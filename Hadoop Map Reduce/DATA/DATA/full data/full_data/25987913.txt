 i  hearts and crosses  baldy woods reached for the bottle and got it whenever baldy went for anything he usuallybut this is not baldys story he poured out a third drink that was larger by a finger than the first and second baldy was in consultation and the consultee is worthy of his hire  id be king if i was you said baldy so positively that his holster creaked and his spurs rattled  webb yeager pushed back his flatbrimmed stetson and made further disorder in his strawcoloured hair the tonsorial recourse being without avail he followed the liquid example of the more resourceful baldy  if a man marries a queen it oughtnt to make him a twospot declared webb epitomising his grievances  sure not said baldy sympathetic still thirsty and genuinely solicitous concerning the relative value of the cards by rights youre a king if i was you id call for a new deal the cards have been stacked on youill tell you what you are webb yeager  what asked webb with a hopeful look in his paleblue eyes  youre a princeconsort  go easy said webb i never blackguarded you none  its a title explained baldy up among the picturecards but it dont take no tricks ill tell you webb its a brand theyre got for certain animals in europe say that you or me or one of them dutch dukes marries in a royal family well by and by our wife gets to be queen are we king not in a million years at the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the ninth grand custodian of the royal hall bedchamber the only use we are is to appear in photographs and accept the responsibility for the heir apparent that aint any square deal yes sir webb youre a prince consort and if i was you id start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin and id be king if i had to turn from the bottom of the deck  baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his warwick pose  baldy said webb solemnly me and you punched cows in the same outfit for years we been runnin on the same range and ridin the same trails since we was boys i wouldnt talk about my family affairs to nobody but you you was linerider on the nopalito ranch when i married santa mcallister i was foreman then but what am i now i dont amount to a knot in a stake rope  when old mcallister was the cattle king of west texas continued baldy with satanic sweetness you was some tallow you had as much to say on the ranch as he did  i did admitted webb up to the time he found out i was tryin to get my rope over santas head then he kept me out on the range as far from the ranchhouse as he could when the old man died they commenced to call santa the cattle queen im boss of the cattlethats all she tends to all the business she handles all the money i cant sell even a beefsteer to a party of campers myself santas the queen and im mr nobody  id be king if i was you repeated baldy woods the royalist when a man marries a queen he ought to grade up with heron the hoof dresseddriedcornedany old way from the chaparral to the packing house lots of folks thinks its funny webb that you dont have the sayso on the nopalito i aint reflectin none on miz yeagershes the finest little lady between the rio grande and next christmasbut a man ought to be boss of his own camp  the smooth brown face of yeager lengthened to a mask of wounded melancholy with that expression and his rumpled yellow hair and guileless blue eyes he might have been likened to a schoolboy whose leadership had been usurped by a youngster of superior strength but his active and sinewy seventytwo inches and his girded revolvers forbade the comparison  what was that you called me baldy he asked what kind of a concert was it  a consort corrected baldya princeconsort its a kind of shortcard pseudonym you come in sort of between jackhigh and a fourcard flush  webb yeager sighed and gathered the strap of his winchester scabbard from the floor  im ridin back to the ranch today he said halfheartedly ive got to start a bunch of beeves for san antone in the morning  im your company as far as dry lake announced baldy ive got a roundup camp on the san marcos cuttin out twoyearolds  the two companeros mounted their ponies and trotted away from the little railroad settlement where they had foregathered in the thirsty morning  at dry lake where their routes diverged they reined up for a parting cigarette for miles they had ridden in silence save for the soft drum of the ponies hoofs on the matted mesquite grass and the rattle of the chaparral against their wooden stirrups but in texas discourse is seldom continuous you may fill in a mile a meal and a murder between your paragraphs without detriment to your thesis so without apology webb offered an addendum to the conversation that had begun ten miles away  you remember yourself baldy that there was a time when santa wasnt quite so independent you remember the days when old mcallister was keepin us apart and how she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me old man mac promised to make me look like a colander if i ever come in gunshot of the ranch you remember the sign she used to send baldythe heart with a cross inside of it  me cried baldy with intoxicated archness you old sugarstealing coyote dont i remember why you dadblamed old longhorned turtle dove the boys in camp was all cognoscious about them hiroglyphs the gizzardandcrossbones we used to call it we used to see em on truck that was sent out from the ranch they was marked in charcoal on the sacks of flour and in leadpencil on the newspapers i see one of em once chalked on the back of a new cook that old man mcallister sent out from the ranchdanged if i didnt  santas father explained webb gently got her to promise that she wouldnt write to me or send me any word that heartandcross sign was her scheme whenever she wanted to see me in particular she managed to put that mark on somethin at the ranch that she knew id see and i never laid eyes on it but what i burnt the wind for the ranch the same night i used to see her in that coma mott back of the little horsecorral  we knowed it chanted baldy but we never let on we was all for you we knowed why you always kept that fast paint in camp and when we see that gizzardandcrossbones figured out on the truck from the ranch we knowed old pinto was goin to eat up miles that night instead of grass you remember scurrythat educated horsewrangler we had the college fellow that tanglefoot drove to the range whenever scurry saw that comemeetyourhoney brand on anything from the ranch hed wave his hand like that and say our friend lee andrews will again swim the hells point tonight  the last time santa sent me the sign said webb was once when she was sick i noticed it as soon as i hit camp and i galloped pinto forty mile that night she wasnt at the coma mott i went to the house and old mcallister met me at the door did you come here to get killed says he ill disoblige you for once i just started a mexican to bring you santa wants you go in that room and see her and then come out here and see me  santa was lyin in bed pretty sick but she gives out a kind of a smile and her hand and mine lock horns and i sets down by the bed mud and spurs and chaps and all ive heard you ridin across the grass for hours webb she says i was sure youd come you saw the sign she whispers the minute i hit camp says i twas marked on the bag of potatoes and onions theyre always together says she soft likealways together in life they go well together i says in a stew i mean hearts and crosses says santa our signto love and to sufferthats what they mean  and there was old doc musgrove amusin himself with whisky and a palmleaf fan and by and by santa goes to sleep and doc feels her forehead and he says to me youre not such a bad febrifuge but youd better slide out now for the diagnosis dont call for you in regular doses the little ladyll be all right when she wakes up  i seen old mcallister outside shes asleep says i and now you can start in with your colanderwork take your time for i left my gun on my saddlehorn  old mac laughs and he says to me pumpin lead into the best ranch boss in west texas dont seem to me good business policy i dont know where i could get as good a one its the soninlaw idea webb that makes me admire for to use you as a target you aint my idea for a member of the family but i can use you on the nopalito if youll keep outside of a radius with the ranchhouse in the middle of it you go upstairs and lay down on a cot and when you get some sleep well talk it over  baldy woods pulled down his hat and uncurled his leg from his saddle horn webb shortened his rein and his pony danced anxious to be off the two men shook hands with western ceremony  adios baldy said webb im glad i seen you and had this talk  with a pounding rush that sounded like the rise of a covey of quail the riders sped away toward different points of the compass a hundred yards on his route baldy reined in on the top of a bare knoll and emitted a yell he swayed on his horse had he been on foot the earth would have risen and conquered him but in the saddle he was a master of equilibrium and laughed at whisky and despised the centre of gravity  webb turned in his saddle at the signal  if i was you came baldys strident and perverting tones id be king  at eight oclock on the following morning bud turner rolled from his saddle in front of the nopalito ranchhouse and stumbled with whizzing rowels toward the gallery bud was in charge of the bunch of beefcattle that was to strike the trail that morning for san antonio mrs yeager was on the gallery watering a cluster of hyacinths growing in a red earthenware jar  king mcallister had bequeathed to his daughter many of his strong characteristicshis resolution his gay courage his contumacious selfreliance his pride as a reigning monarch of hoofs and horns allegro and fortissimo had been mcallisters temp and tone in santa they survived transposed to the feminine key substantially she preserved the image of the mother who had been summoned to wander in other and less finite green pastures long before the waxing herds of kine had conferred royalty upon the house she had her mothers slim strong figure and grave soft prettiness that relieved in her the severity of the imperious mcallister eye and the mcallister air of royal independence  webb stood on one end of the gallery giving orders to two or three subbosses of various camps and outfits who had ridden in for instructions  morning said bud briefly where do you want them beeves to go in townto barbers as usual  now to answer that had been the prerogative of the queen all the reins of businessbuying selling and bankinghad been held by her capable fingers the handling of cattle had been entrusted fully to her husband in the days of king mcallister santa had been his secretary and helper and she had continued her work with wisdom and profit but before she could reply the princeconsort spake up with calm decision  you drive that bunch to zimmerman and nesbits pens i spoke to zimmerman about it some time ago  bud turned on his high bootheels  wait called santa quickly she looked at her husband with surprise in her steady gray eyes  why what do you mean webb she asked with a small wrinkle gathering between her brows i never deal with zimmerman and nesbit barber has handled every head of stock from this ranch in that market for five years im not going to take the business out of his hands she faced bud turner deliver those cattle to barber she concluded positively  bud gazed impartially at the waterjar hanging on the gallery stood on his other leg and chewed a mesquiteleaf  i want this bunch of beeves to go to zimmerman and nesbit said webb with a frosty light in his blue eyes  nonsense said santa impatiently youd better start on bud so as to noon at the little elm waterhole tell barber well have another lot of culls ready in about a month  bud allowed a hesitating eye to steal upward and meet webbs webb saw apology in his look and fancied he saw commiseration  you deliver them cattle he said grimly to  barber finished santa sharply let that settle it is there anything else you are waiting for bud  no mm said bud but before going he lingered while a cows tail could have switched thrice for man is mans ally and even the philistines must have blushed when they took samson in the way they did  you hear your boss cried webb sardonically he took off his hat and bowed until it touched the floor before his wife  webb said santa rebukingly youre acting mighty foolish today  court fool your majesty said webb in his slow tones which had changed their quality what else can you expect let me tell you i was a man before i married a cattlequeen what am i now the laughingstock of the camps ill be a man again  santa looked at him closely  dont be unreasonable webb she said calmly you havent been slighted in any way do i ever interfere in your management of the cattle i know the business side of the ranch much better than you do i learned it from dad be sensible  kingdoms and queendoms said webb dont suit me unless i am in the pictures too i punch the cattle and you wear the crown all right id rather be high lord chancellor of a cowcamp than the eightspot in a queenhigh flush its your ranch and barber gets the beeves  webbs horse was tied to the rack he walked into the house and brought out his roll of blankets that he never took with him except on long rides and his slicker and his longest stakerope of plaited rawhide these he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle santa a little pale followed him  webb swung up into the saddle his serious smooth face was without expression except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes  theres a herd of cows and calves said he near the hondo water hole on the frio that ought to be moved away from timber lobos have killed three of the calves i forgot to leave orders youd better tell simms to attend to it  santa laid a hand on the horses bridle and looked her husband in the eye  are you going to leave me webb she asked quietly  i am going to be a man again he answered  i wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt she said with a sudden coldness she turned and walked directly into the house  webb yeager rode to the southeast as straight as the topography of west texas permitted and when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue space as far as knowledge of him on the nopalito went and the days with sundays at their head formed into hebdomadal squads and the weeks captained by the full moon closed ranks into menstrual companies crying tempus fugit on their banners and the months marched on toward the vast campground of the years but webb yeager came no more to the dominions of his queen  one day a being named bartholomew a sheepmanand therefore of little accountfrom the lower rio grande country rode in sight of the nopalito ranchhouse and felt hunger assail him ex consuetudine he was soon seated at the midday dining table of that hospitable kingdom talk like water gushed from him he might have been smitten with aarons rodthat is your gentle shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears are not overgrown with wool  missis yeager he babbled i see a man the other day on the rancho seco down in hidalgo county by your namewebb yeager was his hed just been engaged as manager he was a tall lighthaired man not saying much perhaps he was some kin of yours do you think  a husband said santa cordially the seco has done well mr yeager is one of the best stockmen in the west  the dropping out of a princeconsort rarely disorganises a monarchy queen santa had appointed as mayordomo of the ranch a trusty subject named ramsay who had been one of her fathers faithful vassals and there was scarcely a ripple on the nopalito ranch save when the gulfbreeze created undulations in the grass of its wide acres  for several years the nopalito had been making experiments with an english breed of cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the texas longhorns the experiments were found satisfactory and a pasture had been set aside for the bluebloods the fame of them had gone forth into the chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles other ranches woke up rubbed their eyes and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the longhorns  as a consequence one day a sunburned capable silkkerchiefed nonchalant youth garnished with revolvers and attended by three mexican vaqueros alighted at the nopalito ranch and presented the following businesslike epistle to the queen thereof    mrs yeagerthe nopalito ranch    dear madam    i am instructed by the owners of the rancho seco to purchase 100   head of two and threeyearold cows of the sussex breed owned by   you if you can fill the order please deliver the cattle to the   bearer and a check will be forwarded to you at once  respectfully webster yeager manager the rancho seco   business is business evenvery scantily did it escape being written especiallyin a kingdom  that night the 100 head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned in a corral near the ranchhouse for delivery in the morning  when night closed down and the house was still did santa yeager throw herself down clasping that formal note to her bosom weeping and calling out a name that pride either in one or the other had kept from her lips many a day or did she file the letter in her business way retaining her royal balance and strength  wonder if you will but royalty is sacred and there is a veil but this much you shall learn  at midnight santa slipped softly out of the ranchhouse clothed in something dark and plain she paused for a moment under the liveoak trees the prairies were somewhat dim and the moonlight was pale orange diluted with particles of an impalpable flying mist but the mockbird whistled on every bough of vantage leagues of flowers scented the air and a kindergarten of little shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by santa turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward for there was none to see  then she sped silently to the blacksmithshop fifty yards away and what she did there can only be surmised but the forge glowed red and there was a faint hammering such as cupid might make when he sharpens his arrowpoints  later she came forth with a queershaped handled thing in one hand and a portable furnace such as are seen in brandingcamps in the other to the corral where the sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight  she opened the gate and slipped inside the corral the sussex cattle were mostly a dark red but among this bunch was one that was milky whitenotable among the others  and now santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen beforea rope lasso she freed the loop of it coiling the length in her left hand and plunged into the thick of the cattle  the white cow was her object she swung the lasso which caught one horn and slipped off the next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily santa made for it like a panther but it scrambled up and dashed against her knocking her over like a blade of grass  again she made her cast while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the corral in a plunging mass this throw was fair the white cow came to earth again and before it could rise santa had made the lasso fast around a post of the corral with a swift and simple knot and had leaped upon the cow again with the rawhide hobbles  in one minute the feet of the animal were tied no recordbreaking deed and santa leaned against the corral for the same space of time panting and lax  and then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the brandingiron queerly shaped and whitehot  the bellow of the outraged white cow as the iron was applied should have stirred the slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the nearby subjects of the nopalito but it did not and it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence that santa ran like a lapwing back to the ranchhouse and there fell upon a cot and sobbedsobbed as though queens had hearts as simple ranchmens wives have and as though she would gladly make kings of princeconsorts should they ride back again from over the hills and far away  in the morning the capable revolvered youth and his vaqueros set forth driving the bunch of sussex cattle across the prairies to the rancho seco ninety miles it was a six days journey grazing and watering the animals on the way  the beasts arrived at rancho seco one evening at dusk and were received and counted by the foreman of the ranch  the next morning at eight oclock a horseman loped out of the brush to the nopalito ranchhouse he dismounted stiffly and strode with whizzing spurs to the house his horse gave a great sigh and swayed foamstreaked with downdrooping head and closed eyes  but waste not your pity upon belshazzar the fleabitten sorrel today in nopalito horsepasture he survives pampered beloved unridden cherished recordholder of longdistance rides  the horseman stumbled into the house two arms fell around his neck and someone cried out in the voice of woman and queen alike webb oh webb  i was a skunk said webb yeager  hush said santa did you see it  i saw it said webb  what they meant god knows and you shall know if you rightly read the primer of events  be the cattlequeen said webb and overlook it if you can i was a mangy sheepstealing coyote  hush said santa again laying her fingers upon his mouth theres no queen here do you know who i am i am santa yeager first lady of the bedchamber come here  she dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right there stood a cradle with an infant in ita red ribald unintelligible babbling beautiful infant sputtering at life in an unseemly manner  theres no queen on this ranch said santa again look at the king hes got your eyes webb down on your knees and look at his highness  but jingling rowels sounded on the gallery and bud turner stumbled there again with the same query that he had brought lacking a few days a year ago  morning them beeves is just turned out on the trail shall i drive em to barbers or  he saw webb and stopped openmouthed  babababababa shrieked the king in his cradle beating the air with his fists  you hear your boss bud said webb yeager with a broad grinjust as he had said a year ago  and that is all except that when old man quinn owner of the rancho seco went out to look over the herd of sussex cattle that he had bought from the nopalito ranch he asked his new manager  whats the nopalito ranch brand wilson  x bar y said wilson  i thought so said quinn but look at that white heifer there shes got another branda heart with a cross inside of it what brand is that    ii  the ransom of mack  me and old mack lonsbury we got out of that little hideandseek gold mine affair with about 40000 apiece i say old mack but he wasnt old fortyone i should say but he always seemed old  andy he says to me im tired of hustling you and me have been working hard together for three years say we knock off for a while and spend some of this idle money weve coaxed our way  the proposition hits me just right says i lets be nabobs for a while and see how it feels whatll we dotake in the niagara falls or buck at faro  for a good many years says mack ive thought that if i ever had extravagant money id rent a tworoom cabin somewhere hire a chinaman to cook and sit in my stocking feet and read buckles history of civilisation  that sounds selfindulgent and gratifying without vulgar ostentation says i and i dont see how money could be better invested give me a cuckoo clock and a sep winners selfinstructor for the banjo and ill join you  a week afterwards me and mack hits this small town of pina about thirty miles out from denver and finds an elegant tworoom house that just suits us we deposited halfapeck of money in the pina bank and shook hands with every one of the 340 citizens in the town we brought along the chinaman and the cuckoo clock and buckle and the instructor with us from denver and they made the cabin seem like home at once  never believe it when they tell you riches dont bring happiness if you could have seen old mack sitting in his rockingchair with his blueyarn sock feet up in the window and absorbing in that buckle stuff through his specs youd have seen a picture of content that would have made rockefeller jealous and i was learning to pick out old zip coon on the banjo and the cuckoo was on time with his remarks and ah sing was messing up the atmosphere with the handsomest smell of ham and eggs that ever laid the honeysuckle in the shade when it got too dark to make out buckles nonsense and the notes in the instructor me and mack would light our pipes and talk about science and pearl diving and sciatica and egypt and spelling and fish and tradewinds and leather and gratitude and eagles and a lot of subjects that wed never had time to explain our sentiments about before  one evening mack spoke up and asked me if i was much apprised in the habits and policies of women folks  why yes says i in a tone of voice i know em from alfred to omaha the feminine nature and similitude says i is as plain to my sight as the rocky mountains is to a blueeyed burro im onto all their little sidesteps and punctual discrepancies  i tell you andy says mack with a kind of sigh i never had the least amount of intersection with their predispositions maybe i might have had a proneness in respect to their vicinity but i never took the time i made my own living since i was fourteen and i never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted toward the sect i sometimes wish i had says old mack  theyre an adverse study says i and adapted to points of view although they vary in rationale i have found em quite often obviously differing from each other in divergences of contrast  it seems to me goes on mack that a man had better take em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when hes young and so preordained i let my chance go by and i guess im too old now to go hopping into the curriculum  oh i dont know i tells him maybe you better credit yourself with a barrel of money and a lot of emancipation from a quantity of uncontent still i dont regret my knowledge of em i says it takes a man who understands the symptoms and byplays of womenfolks to take care of himself in this world  we stayed on in pina because we liked the place some folks might enjoy their money with noise and rapture and locomotion but me and mack we had had plenty of turmoils and hotel towels the people were friendly ah sing got the swing of the grub we liked mack and buckle were as thick as two bodysnatchers and i was hitting out a cordial resemblance to buffalo gals cant you come out tonight on the banjo  one day i got a telegram from speight the man that was working on a mine i had an interest in out in new mexico i had to go out there and i was gone two months i was anxious to get back to pina and enjoy life once more  when i struck the cabin i nearly fainted mack was standing in the door and if angels ever wept i saw no reason why they should be smiling then  that man was a spectacle yes he was worse he was a spyglass he was the great telescope in the lick observatory he had on a coat and shiny shoes and a white vest and a high silk hat and a geranium as big as an order of spinach was spiked onto his front and he was smirking and warping his face like an infernal storekeeper or a kid with colic  hello andy says mack out of his face glad to see you back things have happened since you went away  i know it says i and a sacrilegious sight it is god never made you that way mack lonsbury why do you scarify his works with this presumptuous kind of ribaldry  why andy says he theyve elected me justice of the peace since you left  i looked at mack close he was restless and inspired a justice of the peace ought to be disconsolate and assuaged  just then a young woman passed on the sidewalk and i saw mack kind of half snicker and blush and then he raised up his hat and smiled and bowed and she smiled and bowed and went on by  no hope for you says i if youve got the maryjane infirmity at your age i thought it wasnt going to take on you and patent leather shoes all this in two little short months  im going to marry the young lady who just passed tonight says mack in a kind of flutter  i forgot something at the postoffice says i and walked away quick  i overtook that young woman a hundred yards away i raised my hat and told her my name she was about nineteen and young for her age she blushed and then looked at me cool like i was the snow scene from the two orphans  i understand you are to be married tonight i said  correct says she you got any objections  listen sissy i begins  my name is miss rebosa redd says she in a pained way  i know it says i now rebosa im old enough to have owed money to your father and that old specious dressedup garbled seasick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an irremediable turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend why did you go and get him invested in this marriage business  why he was the only chance there was answers miss rebosa  nay says i giving a sickening look of admiration at her complexion and style of features with your beauty you might pick any kind of a man listen rebosa old mack aint the man you want he was twenty two when you was nee reed as the papers say this bursting into bloom wont last with him hes all ventilated with oldness and rectitude and decay old macks down with a case of indian summer he overlooked his bet when he was young and now hes suing nature for the interest on the promissory note he took from cupid instead of the cash rebosa are you bent on having this marriage occur  why sure i am says she oscillating the pansies on her hat and so is somebody else i reckon  what time is it to take place i asks  at six oclock says she  i made up my mind right away what to do id save old mack if i could to have a good seasoned ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadnt quit eating slate pencils and buttoning in the back was more than i could look on with easiness  rebosa says i earnest drawing upon my display of knowledge concerning the feminine intuitions of reasonaint there a young man in pinaa nice young man that you think a heap of  yep says rebosa nodding her pansiessure there is what do you think gracious  does he like you i asks how does he stand in the matter  crazy says rebosa ma has to wet down the front steps to keep him from sitting there all the time but i guess thatll be all over after tonight she winds up with a sigh  rebosa says i you dont really experience any of this adoration called love for old mack do you  lord no says the girl shaking her head i think hes as dry as a lava bed the idea  who is this young man that you like rebosa i inquires  its eddie bayles says she he clerks in crosbys grocery but he dont make but thirtyfive a month ella noakes was wild about him once  old mack tells me i says that hes going to marry you at six oclock this evening  thats the time says she its to be at our house  rebosa says i listen to me if eddie bayles had a thousand dollars casha thousand dollars mind you would buy him a store of his ownif you and eddie had that much to excuse matrimony on would you consent to marry him this evening at five oclock  the girl looks at me a minute and i can see these inaudible cogitations going on inside of her as women will  a thousand dollars says she of course i would  come on says i well go and see eddie  we went up to crosbys store and called eddie outside he looked to be estimable and freckled and he had chills and fever when i made my proposition  at five oclock says he for a thousand dollars please dont wake me up well you are the rich uncle retired from the spice business in india ill buy out old crosby and run the store myself  we went inside and got old man crosby apart and explained it i wrote my check for a thousand dollars and handed it to him if eddie and rebosa married each other at five he was to turn the money over to them  and then i gave em my blessing and went to wander in the wildwood for a season i sat on a log and made cogitations on life and old age and the zodiac and the ways of women and all the disorder that goes with a lifetime i passed myself congratulations that i had probably saved my old friend mack from his attack of indian summer i knew when he got well of it and shed his infatuation and his patent leather shoes he would feel grateful to keep old mack disinvolved thinks i from relapses like this is worth more than a thousand dollars and most of all i was glad that id made a study of women and wasnt to be deceived any by their means of conceit and evolution  it must have been halfpast five when i got back home i stepped in and there sat old mack on the back of his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the history of civilisation propped up on his knees  this dont look like getting ready for a wedding at six i says to seem innocent  oh says mack reaching for his tobacco that was postponed back to five oclock they sent me over a note saying the hour had been changed its all over now what made you stay away so long andy  you heard about the wedding i asks  i operated it says he i told you i was justice of the peace the preacher is off east to visit his folks and im the only one in town that can perform the dispensations of marriage i promised eddie and rebosa a month ago id marry em hes a busy lad and hell have a grocery of his own some day  he will says i  there was lots of women at the wedding says mack smoking up but i didnt seem to get any ideas from em i wish i was informed in the structure of their attainments like you said you was  that was two months ago says i reaching up for the banjo    iii  telemachus friend  returning from a hunting trip i waited at the little town of los pinos in new mexico for the southbound train which was one hour late i sat on the porch of the summit house and discussed the functions of life with telemachus hicks the hotel proprietor  perceiving that personalities were not out of order i asked him what species of beast had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear being a hunter i was concerned in the evils that may befall one in the pursuit of game  that ear says hicks is the relic of true friendship  an accident i persisted  no friendship is an accident said telemachus and i was silent  the only perfect case of true friendship i ever knew went on my host was a cordial intent between a connecticut man and a monkey the monkey climbed palms in barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man the man sawed them in two and made dippers which he sold for two reales each and bought rum the monkey drank the milk of the nuts through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft they lived like brothers  but in the case of human beings friendship is a transitory art subject to discontinuance without further notice  i had a friend once of the entitlement of paisley fish that i imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time side by side for seven years we had mined ranched sold patent churns herded sheep took photographs and other things built wire fences and picked prunes thinks i neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and paisley fish we was friends an amount you could hardly guess at we was friends in business and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly we certainly had days of damon and nights of pythias  one summer me and paisley gallops down into these san andres mountains for the purpose of a months surcease and levity dressed in the natural store habiliments of man we hit this town of los pinos which certainly was a roofgarden spot of the world and flowing with condensed milk and honey it had a street or two and air and hens and a eatinghouse and that was enough for us  we strikes the town after suppertime and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eatinghouse down by the railroad tracks by the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oilcloth along intrudes widow jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver  now there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows she was not so small as she was large and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity the pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in december  widow jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton and finally wants to know where we came from  spring valley says i  big spring valley chips in paisley out of a lot of potatoes and knucklebone of ham in his mouth  that was the first sign i noticed that the old fidus diogenes business between me and paisley fish was ended forever he knew how i hated a talkative person and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax on the map it was big spring valley but i had heard paisley himself call it spring valley a thousand times  without saying any more we went out after supper and set on the railroad track we had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each others mind  i reckon you understand says paisley that ive made up my mind to accrue that widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever both domestic sociable legal and otherwise until death us do part  why yes says i i read it between the lines though you only spoke one and i suppose you are aware says i that i have a movement on foot that leads up to the widows changing her name to hicks and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding  therell be some hiatuses in your program says paisley chewing up a piece of a railroad tie id give in to you says he in most any respect if it was secular affairs but this is not so the smiles of woman goes on paisley is the whirlpool of squills and chalybeates into which vortex the good ship friendship is often drawn and dismembered id assault a bear that was annoying you says paisley or id endorse your note or rub the place between your shoulderblades with opodeldoc the same as ever but there my sense of etiquette ceases in this fracas with mrs jessup we play it alone ive notified you fair  and then i collaborates with myself and offers the following resolutions and bylaws  friendship between man and man says i is an ancient historical virtue enacted in the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eightyfoot tails and flying turtles and theyve kept up the habit to this day and stand by each other till the bellboy comes up and tells them the animals are not really there ive often heard i says about ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men why should that be ill tell you paisley the first sight and hot biscuit of mrs jessup appears to have inserted a oscillation into each of our bosoms let the best man of us have her ill play you a square game and wont do any underhanded work ill do all of my courting of her in your presence so you will have an equal opportunity with that arrangement i dont see why our steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of whichever of us wins out  good old hoss says paisley shaking my hand and ill do the same says he well court the lady synonymously and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such occasions and well be friends still win or lose  at one side of mrs jessups eatinghouse was a bench under some trees where she used to sit in the breeze after the southbound had been fed and gone and there me and paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the lady of our choice and we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery  the first evening that mrs jessup knew about our arrangement i got to the bench before paisley did supper was just over and mrs jessup was out there with a fresh pink dress on and almost cool enough to handle  i sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective that evening was surely a case in point the moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged and the trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature and there was a kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles and the jackrabbits and other feathered insects of the forest and the wind out of the mountains was singing like a jewsharp in the pile of old tomatocans by the railroad track  i felt a kind of sensation in my left sidesomething like dough rising in a crock by the fire mrs jessup had moved up closer  oh mr hicks says she when one is alone in the world dont they feel it more aggravated on a beautiful night like this  i rose up off the bench at once  excuse me maam says i but ill have to wait till paisley comes before i can give a audible hearing to leading questions like that  and then i explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment and travel and complicity and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any of the more mushy walks of life such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity mrs jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute and then she breaks into a species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound  in a few minutes paisley drops around with oil of bergamot on his hair and sits on the other side of mrs jessup and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and pieface lumley has a skinningmatch of dead cows in 95 for a silvermounted saddle in the santa rita valley during the nine months drought  now from the start of that courtship i had paisley fish hobbled and tied to a post each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart paisleys scheme was to petrify em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print i think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of shakespeares shows i see once called othello there is a coloured man in it who acquires a dukes daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by rider haggard lew dockstader and dr parkhurst but that style of courting dont work well off the stage  now i give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when she can be referred to as nee jones learn how to pick up her hand and hold it and shes yours it aint so easy some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear em tearing off bandages some take it up like a hot horseshoe and hold it off at arms length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle and most of em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the ladys eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm them ways are all wrong  ill tell you the right way did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him he pretends he hasnt got a thing in his hand and that the cat dont see him and that he dont see the cat thats the idea never drag her hand out where shell have to take notice of it dont let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand that was my rule of tactics and as far as paisleys serenade about hostilities and misadventure went he might as well have been reading to her a time table of the sunday trains that stop at ocean grove new jersey  one night when i beat paisley to the bench by one pipeful my friendship gets subsidised for a minute and i asks mrs jessup if she didnt think a h was easier to write than a j in a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my buttonhole and i leaned over andbut i didnt  if you dont mind says i standing up well wait for paisley to come before finishing this ive never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship and this wont be quite fair  mr hicks says mrs jessup looking at me peculiar in the dark if it wasnt for but one thing id ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my house  and what is that maam i asks  you are too good a friend not to make a good husband says she  in five minutes paisley was on his side of mrs jessup  in silver city in the summer of 98 he begins i see jim batholomew chew off a chinamans ear in the blue light saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt thatwhat was that noise  i had resumed matters again with mrs jessup right where we had left off  mrs jessup says i has promised to make it hicks and this is another of the same sort  paisley winds his feet round a leg of the bench and kind of groans  lem says he we been friends for seven years would you mind not kissing mrs jessup quite so loud id do the same for you  all right says i the other kind will do as well  this chinaman goes on paisley was the one that shot a man named mullins in the spring of 97 and that was  paisley interrupted himself again  lem says he if you was a true friend you wouldnt hug mrs jessup quite so hard i felt the bench shake all over just then you know you told me you would give me an even chance as long as there was any  mr man says mrs jessup turning around to paisley if you was to drop in to the celebration of mine and mr hickss silver wedding twentyfive years from now do you think you could get it into that hubbard squash you call your head that you are nix cum rous in this business ive put up with you a long time because you was mr hickss friend but it seems to me its time for you to wear the willow and trot off down the hill  mrs jessup says i without losing my grasp on the situation as fiance mr paisley is my friend and i offered him a square deal and a equal opportunity as long as there was a chance  a chance says she well he may think he has a chance but i hope he wont think hes got a cinch after what hes been next to all the evening  well a month afterwards me and mrs jessup was married in the los pinos methodist church and the whole town closed up to see the performance  when we lined up in front and the preacher was beginning to sing out his rituals and observances i looks around and misses paisley i calls time on the preacher paisley aint here says i weve got to wait for paisley a friend once a friend alwaysthats telemachus hicks says i mrs jessups eyes snapped some but the preacher holds up the incantations according to instructions  in a few minutes paisley gallops up the aisle putting on a cuff as he comes he explains that the only drygoods store in town was closed for the wedding and he couldnt get the kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the store and helped himself then he ranges up on the other side of the bride and the wedding goes on i always imagined that paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might marry him to the widow by mistake  after the proceedings was over we had tea and jerked antelope and canned apricots and then the populace hiked itself away last of all paisley shook me by the hand and told me id acted square and on the level with him and he was proud to call me a friend  the preacher had a small house on the side of the street that hed fixed up to rent and he allowed me and mrs hicks to occupy it till the tenforty train the next morning when we was going on a bridal tour to el paso his wife had decorated it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy and it looked real festal and bowery  about ten oclock that night i sets down in the front door and pulls off my boots a while in the cool breeze while mrs hicks was fixing around in the room right soon the light went out inside and i sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes and then i heard mrs hicks call out aint you coming in soon lem  well well says i kind of rousing up durn me if i wasnt waiting for old paisley to  but when i got that far concluded telemachus hicks i thought somebody had shot this left ear of mine off with a fortyfive but it turned out to be only a lick from a broomhandle in the hands of mrs hicks    iv  the handbook of hymen  tis the opinion of myself sanderson pratt who sets this down that the educational system of the united states should be in the hands of the weather bureau i can give you good reasons for it and you cant tell me why our college professors shouldnt be transferred to the meteorological department they have been learned to read and they could very easily glance at the morning papers and then wire in to the main office what kind of weather to expect but theres the other side of the proposition i am going on to tell you how the weather furnished me and idaho green with an elegant education  we was up in the bitter root mountains over the montana line prospecting for gold a chinwhiskered man in wallawalla carrying a line of hope as excess baggage had grubstaked us and there we was in the foothills pecking away with enough grub on hand to last an army through a peace conference  along one day comes a mailrider over the mountains from carlos and stops to eat three cans of greengages and leave us a newspaper of modern date this paper prints a system of premonitions of the weather and the card it dealt bitter root mountains from the bottom of the deck was warmer and fair with light westerly breezes  that evening it began to snow with the wind strong in the east me and idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain thinking it was only a november flurry but after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest and we knew we was snowed in we got in plenty of firewood before it got deep and we had grub enough for two months so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper  if you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twentyfoot cabin for a month human nature wont stand it  when the first snowflakes fell me and idaho green laughed at each others jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread at the end of three weeks idaho makes this kind of a edict to me says he  i never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan but i have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation the kind of half masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cows cud only shes lady enough to keep hers to herself and you aint  mr green says i you having been a friend of mine once i have some hesitations in confessing to you that if i had my choice for society between you and a common yellow threelegged cur pup one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present  this way we goes on for two or three days and then we quits speaking to one another we divides up the cooking implements and idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace and me on the other the snow is up to the windows and we have to keep a fire all day  you see me and idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing if john had three apples and james five on a slate we never felt any special need for a university degree though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies but snowbound in that cabin in the bitter roots we felt for the first time that if we had studied homer or greek and fractions and the higher branches of information wed have had some resources in the line of meditation and private thought ive seen them eastern college fellows working in camps all through the west and i never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to em than you would think why once over on snake river when andrew mcwilliams saddle horse got the botts he sent a buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist but that horse died  one morning idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too high to reach two books fell down to the floor i started toward em but caught idahos eye he speaks for the first time in a week  dont burn your fingers says he in spite of the fact that youre only fit to be the companion of a sleeping mudturtle ill give you a square deal and thats more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattlesnake and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip ill play you a game of sevenup the winner to pick up his choice of the book the loser to take the other  we played and idaho won he picked up his book and i took mine then each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading  i never was as glad to see a tenounce nugget as i was that book and idaho took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy  mine was a little book about five by six inches called herkimers handbook of indispensable information i may be wrong but i think that was the greatest book that ever was written ive got it today and i can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it talk about solomon or the new york tribune herkimer had cases on both of em that man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff there was the population of all cities in it and the way to tell a girls age and the number of teeth a camel has it told you the longest tunnel in the world the number of the stars how long it takes for chicken pox to break out what a ladys neck ought to measure the veto powers of governors the dates of the roman aqueducts how many pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy the average annual temperature of augusta maine the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills antidotes for poisons the number of hairs on a blond ladys head how to preserve eggs the height of all the mountains in the world and the dates of all wars and battles and how to restore drowned persons and sunstroke and the number of tacks in a pound and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds and what to do before the doctor comesand a hundred times as many things besides if there was anything herkimer didnt know i didnt miss it out of the book  i sat and read that book for four hours all the wonders of education was compressed in it i forgot the snow and i forgot that me and old idaho was on the outs he was sitting still on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft and partly mysterious look shining through his tanbark whiskers  idaho says i what kind of a book is yours  idaho must have forgot too for he answered moderate without any slander or malignity  why says he this here seems to be a volume by homer k m  homer k m what i asks  why just homer k m says he  youre a liar says i a little riled that idaho should try to put me up a tree no man is going round signing books with his initials if its homer k m spoopendyke or homer k m mcsweeney or homer k m jones why dont you say so like a man instead of biting off the end of it like a calf chewing off the tail of a shirt on a clothes line  i put it to you straight sandy says idaho quiet its a poem book says he by homer k m i couldnt get colour out of it at first but theres a vein if you follow it up i wouldnt have missed this book for a pair of red blankets  youre welcome to it says i what i want is a disinterested statement of facts for the mind to work on and thats what i seem to find in the book ive drawn  what youve got says idaho is statistics the lowest grade of information that exists theyll poison your mind give me old k ms system of surmises he seems to be a kind of a wine agent his regular toast is nothing doing and he seems to have a grouch but he keeps it so well lubricated with booze that his worst kicks sound like an invitation to split a quart but its poetry says idaho and i have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries to convey sense in feet and inches when it comes to explaining the instinct of philosophy through the art of nature old k m has got your man beat by drills rows paragraphs chest measurement and average annual rainfall  so thats the way me and idaho had it day and night all the excitement we got was studying our books that snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of attainments apiece by the time the snow melted if you had stepped up to me suddenly and said sanderson pratt what would it cost per square foot to lay a roof with twenty by twenty eight tin at nine dollars and fifty cents per box id have told you as quick as light could travel the length of a spade handle at the rate of one hundred and ninetytwo thousand miles per second how many can do it you wake up most any man you know in the middle of the night and ask him quick to tell you the number of bones in the human skeleton exclusive of the teeth or what percentage of the vote of the nebraska legislature overrules a veto will he tell you try him and see  about what benefit idaho got out of his poetry book i didnt exactly know idaho boosted the wineagent every time he opened his mouth but i wasnt so sure  this homer k m from what leaked out of his libretto through idaho seemed to me to be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail after running himself half to death he sits down hangs his tongue out and looks at the can and says  oh well since we cant shake the growler lets get it filled at the corner and all have a drink on me  besides that it seems he was a persian and i never hear of persia producing anything worth mentioning unless it was turkish rugs and maltese cats  that spring me and idaho struck pay ore it was a habit of ours to sell out quick and keep moving we unloaded our grubstaker for eight thousand dollars apiece and then we drifted down to this little town of rosa on the salmon river to rest up and get some human grub and have our whiskers harvested  rosa was no miningcamp it laid in the valley and was as free of uproar and pestilence as one of them rural towns in the country there was a threemile trolley line champing its bit in the environs and me and idaho spent a week riding on one of the cars dropping off at nights at the sunset view hotel being now well read as well as travelled we was soon pro re nata with the best society in rosa and was invited out to the most dressedup and hightoned entertainments it was at a piano recital and quaileating contest in the city hall for the benefit of the fire company that me and idaho first met mrs de ormond sampson the queen of rosa society  mrs sampson was a widow and owned the only twostory house in town it was painted yellow and whichever way you looked from you could see it as plain as egg on the chin of an ogrady on a friday twentytwo men in rosa besides me and idaho was trying to stake a claim on that yellow house  there was a dance after the song books and quail bones had been raked out of the hall twentythree of the bunch galloped over to mrs sampson and asked for a dance i sidestepped the twostep and asked permission to escort her home thats where i made a hit  on the way home says she  aint the stars lovely and bright tonight mr pratt  for the chance theyve got says i theyre humping themselves in a mighty creditable way that big one you see is sixtysix million miles distant it took thirtysix years for its light to reach us with an eighteenfoot telescope you can see fortythree millions of em including them of the thirteenth magnitude which if one was to go out now you would keep on seeing it for twentyseven hundred years  my says mrs sampson i never knew that before how warm it is im as damp as i can be from dancing so much  thats easy to account for says i when you happen to know that youve got two million sweatglands working all at once if every one of your perspiratory ducts which are a quarter of an inch long was placed end to end they would reach a distance of seven miles  lawsy says mrs sampson it sounds like an irrigation ditch you was describing mr pratt how do you get all this knowledge of information  from observation mrs sampson i tells her i keep my eyes open when i go about the world  mr pratt says she i always did admire a man of education there are so few scholars among the sapheaded pluguglies of this town that it is a real pleasure to converse with a gentleman of culture id be gratified to have you call at my house whenever you feel so inclined  and that was the way i got the goodwill of the lady in the yellow house every tuesday and friday evening i used to go there and tell her about the wonders of the universe as discovered tabulated and compiled from nature by herkimer idaho and the other gay lutherans of the town got every minute of the rest of the week that they could  i never imagined that idaho was trying to work on mrs sampson with old k ms rules of courtship till one afternoon when i was on my way over to take her a basket of wild hogplums i met the lady coming down the lane that led to her house her eyes was snapping and her hat made a dangerous dip over one eye  mr pratt she opens up this mr green is a friend of yours i believe  for nine years says i  cut him out says she hes no gentleman  why maam says i hes a plain incumbent of the mountains with asperities and the usual failings of a spendthrift and a liar but i never on the most momentous occasion had the heart to deny that he was a gentleman it may be that in haberdashery and the sense of arrogance and display idaho offends the eye but inside maam ive found him impervious to the lower grades of crime and obesity after nine years of idahos society mrs sampson i winds up i should hate to impute him and i should hate to see him imputed  its right plausible of you mr pratt says mrs sampson to take up the curmudgeons in your friends behalf but it dont alter the fact that he has made proposals to me sufficiently obnoxious to ruffle the ignominy of any lady  why now now now says i old idaho do that i could believe it of myself sooner i never knew but one thing to deride in him and a blizzard was responsible for that once while we was snowbound in the mountains he became a prey to a kind of spurious and uneven poetry which may have corrupted his demeanour  it has says mrs sampson ever since i knew him he has been reciting to me a lot of irreligious rhymes by some person he calls ruby ott and who is no better than she should be if you judge by her poetry  then idaho has struck a new book says i for the one he had was by a man who writes under the nom de plume of k m  hed better have stuck to it says mrs sampson whatever it was and today he caps the vortex i get a bunch of flowers from him and on em is pinned a note now mr pratt you know a lady when you see her and you know how i stand in rosa society do you think for a moment that id skip out to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf of bread and go singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him i take a little claret with my meals but im not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the brush and raising cain in any such style as that and of course hed bring his book of verses along too he said so let him go on his scandalous picnics alone or let him take his ruby ott with him i reckon she wouldnt kick unless it was on account of there being too much bread along and what do you think of your gentleman friend now mr pratt  well m says i it may be that idahos invitation was a kind of poetry and meant no harm may be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative they offend law and order but they get sent through the mails on the grounds that they mean something that they dont say id be glad on idahos account if youd overlook it says i and let us extricate our minds from the low regions of poetry to the higher planes of fact and fancy on a beautiful afternoon like this mrs sampson i goes on we should let our thoughts dwell accordingly though it is warm here we should remember that at the equator the line of perpetual frost is at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet between the latitudes of forty degrees and fortynine degrees it is from four thousand to nine thousand feet  oh mr pratt says mrs sampson its such a comfort to hear you say them beautiful facts after getting such a jar from that minx of a rubys poetry  let us sit on this log at the roadside says i and forget the inhumanity and ribaldry of the poets it is in the glorious columns of ascertained facts and legalised measures that beauty is to be found in this very log we sit upon mrs sampson says i is statistics more wonderful than any poem the rings show it was sixty years old at the depth of two thousand feet it would become coal in three thousand years the deepest coal mine in the world is at killingworth near newcastle a box four feet long three feet wide and two feet eight inches deep will hold one ton of coal if an artery is cut compress it above the wound a mans leg contains thirty bones the tower of london was burned in 1841  go on mr pratt says mrs sampson them ideas is so original and soothing i think statistics are just as lovely as they can be  but it wasnt till two weeks later that i got all that was coming to me out of herkimer  one night i was waked up by folks hollering fire all around i jumped up and dressed and went out of the hotel to enjoy the scene when i see it was mrs sampsons house i gave forth a kind of yell and i was there in two minutes  the whole lower story of the yellow house was in flames and every masculine feminine and canine in rosa was there screeching and barking and getting in the way of the firemen i saw idaho trying to get away from six firemen who were holding him they was telling him the whole place was on fire downstairs and no man could go in it and come out alive  wheres mrs sampson i asks  she hasnt been seen says one of the firemen she sleeps up stairs weve tried to get in but we cant and our company hasnt got any ladders yet  i runs around to the light of the big blaze and pulls the handbook out of my inside pocket i kind of laughed when i felt it in my hands i reckon i was some daffy with the sensation of excitement  herky old boy i says to it as i flipped over the pages you aint ever lied to me yet and you aint ever throwed me down at a scratch yet tell me what old boy tell me what says i  i turned to what to do in case of accidents on page 117 i run my finger down the page and struck it good old herkimer he never overlooked anything it said    suffocation from inhaling smoke or gasthere is nothing better   than flaxseed place a few seed in the outer corner of the eye  i shoved the handbook back in my pocket and grabbed a boy that was running by  here says i giving him some money run to the drug store and bring a dollars worth of flaxseed hurry and youll get another one for yourself now i sings out to the crowd well have mrs sampson and i throws away my coat and hat  four of the firemen and citizens grabs hold of me its sure death they say to go in the house for the floors was beginning to fall through  how in blazes i sings out kind of laughing yet but not feeling like it do you expect me to put flaxseed in a eye without the eye  i jabbed each elbow in a firemans face kicked the bark off of one citizens shin and tripped the other one with a side hold and then i busted into the house if i die first ill write you a letter and tell you if its any worse down there than the inside of that yellow house was but dont believe it yet i was a heap more cooked than the hurryup orders of broiled chicken that you get in restaurants the fire and smoke had me down on the floor twice and was about to shame herkimer but the firemen helped me with their little stream of water and i got to mrs sampsons room shed lost conscientiousness from the smoke so i wrapped her in the bed clothes and got her on my shoulder well the floors wasnt as bad as they said or i never could have done itnot by no means  i carried her out fifty yards from the house and laid her on the grass then of course every one of them other twentytwo plaintiffs to the ladys hand crowded around with tin dippers of water ready to save her and up runs the boy with the flaxseed  i unwrapped the covers from mrs sampsons head she opened her eyes and says  is that you mr pratt  sssh says i dont talk till youve had the remedy  i runs my arm around her neck and raises her head gentle and breaks the bag of flaxseed with the other hand and as easy as i could i bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer corner of her eye  up gallops the village doc by this time and snorts around and grabs at mrs sampsons pulse and wants to know what i mean by any such sandblasted nonsense  well old jalap and jerusalem oakseed says i im no regular practitioner but ill show you my authority anyway  they fetched my coat and i gets out the handbook  look on page 117 says i at the remedy for suffocation by smoke or gas flaxseed in the outer corner of the eye it says i dont know whether it works as a smoke consumer or whether it hikes the compound gastrohippopotamus nerve into action but herkimer says it and he was called to the case first if you want to make it a consultation theres no objection  old doc takes the book and looks at it by means of his specs and a firemans lantern  well mr pratt says he you evidently got on the wrong line in reading your diagnosis the recipe for suffocation says get the patient into fresh air as quickly as possible and place in a reclining position the flaxseed remedy is for dust and cinders in the eye on the line above but after all  see here interrupts mrs sampson i reckon ive got something to say in this consultation that flaxseed done me more good than anything i ever tried and then she raises up her head and lays it back on my arm again and says put some in the other eye sandy dear  and so if you was to stop off at rosa tomorrow or any other day youd see a fine new yellow house with mrs pratt that was mrs sampson embellishing and adorning it and if you was to step inside youd see on the marbletop centre table in the parlour herkimers handbook of indispensable information all rebound in red morocco and ready to be consulted on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom    v  the pimienta pancakes  while we were rounding up a bunch of the triangleo cattle in the frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week  on the third day of my compulsory idleness i crawled out near the grub wagon and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of judson odom the camp cook jud was a monologist by nature whom destiny with customary blundering had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved for the greater portion of his time of an audience  therefore i was manna in the desert of juds obmutescence  betimes i was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of grub i had visions of the maternal pantry deep as first love and wild with all regret and then i asked  jud can you make pancakes  jud laid down his sixshooter with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak and stood over me in what i felt to be a menacing attitude he further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion  say you he said with candid though not excessive choler did you mean that straight or was you trying to throw the gaff into me some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket  no jud i said sincerely i meant it it seems to me id swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop open kettle new orleans sweetening was there a story about pancakes  jud was mollified at once when he saw that i had not been dealing in allusions he brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where i lay reclined i watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings  no not a story said jud as he worked but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pinkeyed snoozer from mired mule canada and miss willella learight i dont mind telling you  i was punching then for old bill toomey on the san miguel one day i gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasnt ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures so i gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for uncle emsley telfairs store at the pimienta crossing on the nueces  about three in the afternoon i throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into uncle emsleys store i got up on the counter and told uncle emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world in a minute i had a bag of crackers and a longhandled spoon with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with uncle emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings i was feeling like adam before the apple stampede and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twentyfourinch spoon when i happened to look out of the window into the yard of uncle emsleys house which was next to the store  there was a girl standing therean imported girl with fixings on philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry  i slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to uncle emsley  thats my niece says he miss willella learight down from palestine on a visit do you want that i should make you acquainted  the holy land i says to myself my thoughts milling some as i tried to run em into the corral why not there was sure angels in paleswhy yes uncle emsley i says out loud id be awful edified to meet miss learight  so uncle emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each others entitlements  i never was shy about women i never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark get all lefthanded and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it inside of eight minutes me and miss willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins she gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit i had eaten and i got back at her flatfooted about how a certain lady named eve started the fruit trouble in the first freegrass pastureover in palestine wasnt it says i as easy and pat as roping a oneyearold  that was how i acquired cordiality for the proximities of miss willella learight and the disposition grew larger as time passed she was stopping at pimienta crossing for her health which was very good and for the climate which was forty per cent hotter than palestine i rode over to see her once every week for a while and then i figured it out that if i doubled the number of trips i would see her twice as often  one week i slipped in a third trip and thats where the pancakes and the pinkeyed snoozer busted into the game  that evening while i set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth i asked uncle emsley how miss willella was  why says uncle emsley shes gone riding with jackson bird the sheep man from over at mired mule canada  i swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds i guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while i got off and then i walked out straight ahead till i butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied  shes gone riding i whisper in my broncs ear with birdstone jack the hired mule from sheep mans canada did you get that old leatherandgallops  that bronc of mine wept in his way hed been raised a cow pony and he didnt care for snoozers  i went back and said to uncle emsley did you say a sheep man  i said a sheep man says uncle emsley again you must have heard tell of jackson bird hes got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest merinos south of the arctic circle  i went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear i sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while i soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the jackson plumage to his name  i never had believed in harming sheep men i see one one day reading a latin grammar on hossback and i never touched him they never irritated me like they do most cowmen you wouldnt go to work now and impair and disfigure snoozers would you that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects i had always let em pass just as you would a jackrabbit with a polite word and a guess about the weather but no stopping to swap canteens i never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer and because id been lenient and let em live here was one going around riding with miss willella learight  an hour by sun they come loping back and stopped at uncle emsleys gate the sheep person helped her off and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while and then this feathered jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch by this time i had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear and by the time he gets half a mile out of pimienta i singlefoots up beside him on my bronc  i said that snoozer was pinkeyed but he wasnt his seeing arrangement was grey enough but his eyelashes was pink and his hair was sandy and that gave you the idea sheep manhe wasnt more than a lamb man anyhowa little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief and shoes tied up in bowknots  afternoon says i to him you now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called deadmoralcertainty judson on account of the way i shoot when i want a stranger to know me i always introduce myself before the draw for i never did like to shake hands with ghosts  ah says he just like thatah im glad to know you mr judson im jackson bird from over at mired mule ranch  just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill and the other eye noticed a rabbithawk sitting on a dead limb in a waterelm i popped over one after the other with my fortyfive just to show him two out of three says i birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever i go  nice shooting says the sheep man without a flutter but dont you sometimes ever miss the third shot elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass mr judson says he  willie says i riding over close to his palfrey your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of jackson but you sure moulted into a twittering willielet us slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements and get down to talk that is outside the vocabulary of parrots that is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at pimienta ive known birds says i to be served on toast for less than that miss willella says i dont ever want any nest made out of sheeps wool by a tomtit of the jacksonian branch of ornithology now are you going to quit or do you wish for to gallop up against this deadmoralcertainty attachment to my name which is good for two hyphens and at least one set of funeral obsequies  jackson bird flushed up some and then he laughed  why mr judson says he youve got the wrong idea ive called on miss learight a few times but not for the purpose you imagine my object is purely a gastronomical one  i reached for my gun  any coyote says i that would boast of dishonourable  wait a minute says this bird till i explain what would i do with a wife if you ever saw that ranch of mine i do my own cooking and mending eatingthats all the pleasure i get out of sheep raising mr judson did you ever taste the pancakes that miss learight makes  me no i told him i never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres  theyre golden sunshine says he honeybrowned by the ambrosial fires of epicurus id give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes thats what i went to see miss learight for says jackson bird but i havent been able to get it from her its an old recipe thats been in the family for seventyfive years they hand it down from one generation to another but they dont give it away to outsiders if i could get that recipe so i could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch id be a happy man says bird  are you sure i says to him that it aint the hand that mixes the pancakes that youre after  sure says jackson miss learight is a mighty nice girl but i can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitudethan the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe he finishes  you aint such a bad little man says i trying to be fair i was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep but ill let you fly away this time but you stick to pancakes says i as close as the middle one of a stack and dont go and mistake sentiments for syrup or therell be singing at your ranch and you wont hear it  to convince you that i am sincere says the sheep man ill ask you to help me miss learight and you being closer friends maybe she would do for you what she wouldnt for me if you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe i give you my word that ill never call upon her again  thats fair i says and i shook hands with jackson bird ill get it for you if i can and glad to oblige and he turned off down the big pear flat on the piedra in the direction of mired mule and i steered northwest for old bill toomeys ranch  it was five days afterward when i got another chance to ride over to pimienta miss willella and me passed a gratifying evening at uncle emsleys she sang some and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas i gave imitations of a rattlesnake and told her about snaky mcfees new way of skinning cows and described the trip i made to saint louis once we was getting along in one anothers estimations fine thinks i if jackson bird can now be persuaded to migrate i win i recollect his promise about the pancake receipt and i thinks i will persuade it from miss willella and give it to him and then if i catches birdie off of mired mule again ill make him hop the twig  so along about ten oclock i put on a wheedling smile and says to miss willella now if theres anything i do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass its the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugarhouse molasses  miss willella gives a little jump on the piano stool and looked at me curious  yes says she theyre real nice what did you say was the name of that street in saint louis mr odom where you lost your hat  pancake avenue says i with a wink to show her that i was on about the family receipt and couldnt be sidecorralled off of the subject come now miss willella i says lets hear how you make em pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels start her off nowpound of flour eight dozen eggs and so on how does the catalogue of constituents run  excuse me for a moment please says miss willella and she gives me a quick kind of sideways look and slides off the stool she ambled out into the other room and directly uncle emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves with a pitcher of water he turns around to get a glass on the table and i see a fortyfive in his hip pocket great post holes thinks i but heres a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts protecting it with firearms ive known outfits that wouldnt do that much by a family feud  drink this here down says uncle emsley handing me the glass of water youve rid too far today jud and got yourself overexcited try to think about something else now  do you know how to make them pancakes uncle emsley i asked  well im not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some says uncle emsley but i reckon you take a sifter of plaster of paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal and mix em with eggs and buttermilk as usual is old bill going to ship beeves to kansas city again this spring jud  that was all the pancake specifications i could get that night i didnt wonder that jackson bird found it uphill work so i dropped the subject and talked with uncle emsley for a while about hollowhorn and cyclones and then miss willella came and said goodnight and i hit the breeze for the ranch  about a week afterward i met jackson bird riding out of pimienta as i rode in and we stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks  got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet i asked him  well no says jackson i dont seem to have any success in getting hold of it did you try  i did says i and twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull that pancake receipt must be a jookalorum the way they hold on to it  im most ready to give it up says jackson so discouraged in his pronunciations that i felt sorry for him but i did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely ranch says he i lie awake at nights thinking how good they are  you keep on trying for it i tells him and ill do the same one of us is bound to get a rope over its horns before long well so long jacksy  you see by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms when i saw that he wasnt after miss willella i had more endurable contemplations of that sandyhaired snoozer in order to help out the ambitions of his appetite i kept on trying to get that receipt from miss willella but every time i would say pancakes she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the eye and try to change the subject if i held her to it she would slide out and round up uncle emsley with his pitcher of water and hippocket howitzer  one day i galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that i cut out of a herd of wild flowers over on poisoned dog prairie uncle emsley looked at em with one eye shut and says  havent ye heard the news  cattle up i asks  willella and jackson bird was married in palestine yesterday says he just got a letter this morning  i dropped them flowers in a crackerbarrel and let the news trickle in my ears and down toward my upper lefthand shirt pocket until it got to my feet  would you mind saying that over again once more uncle emsley says i maybe my hearing has got wrong and you only said that prime heifers was 480 on the hoof or something like that  married yesterday says uncle emsley and gone to waco and niagara falls on a wedding tour why didnt you see none of the signs all along jackson bird has been courting willella ever since that day he took her out riding  then says i in a kind of yell what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about pancakes tell me that  when i said pancakes uncle emsley sort of dodged and stepped back  somebodys been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck i says and ill find out i believe you know talk up says i or well mix a panful of batter right here  i slid over the counter after uncle emsley he grabbed at his gun but it was in a drawer and he missed it two inches i got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner  talk pancakes says i or be made into one does miss willella make em  she never made one in her life and i never saw one says uncle emsley soothing calm down now judcalm down youve got excited and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence try not to think about pancakes  uncle emsley says i im not wounded in the head except so far as my natural cognitive instincts run to runts jackson bird told me he was calling on miss willella for the purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes and he asked me to help him get the bill of lading of the ingredients i done so with the results as you see have i been sodded down with johnson grass by a pinkeyed snoozer or what  slack up your grip in my dress shirt says uncle emsley and ill tell you yes it looks like jackson bird has gone and humbugged you some the day after he went riding with willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking about pancakes he said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks and one of the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy and you went raving about pancakes he told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down and you wouldnt be dangerous so me and willella done the best by you we knew how well well says uncle emsley that jackson bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer  during the progress of juds story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans toward the close of it he set before me the finished producta pair of redhot richhued pancakes on a tin plate from some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup  how long ago did these things happen i asked him  three years said jud theyre living on the mired mule ranch now but i havent seen either of em since they say jackson bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree oh i got over it after a while but the boys kept the racket up  did you make these cakes by the famous recipe i asked  didnt i tell you there wasnt no receipt said jud the boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry and i cut this recipe out of a newspaper how does the truck taste  theyre delicious i answered why dont you have some too jud  i was sure i heard a sigh  me said jud i dont ever eat em    vi  seats of the haughty  golden by day and silver by night a new trail now leads to us across the indian ocean dusky kings and princes have found our bombay of the west and few be their trails that do not lead down to broadway on their journey for to admire and for to see  if chance should ever lead you near a hotel that transiently shelters some one of these splendid touring grandees i counsel you to seek lucullus polk among the republican tufthunters that besiege its entrances he will be there you will know him by his red alert wellingtonnosed face by his manner of nervous caution mingled with determination by his assumed promoters or brokers air of busy impatience and by his brightred necktie gallantly redressing the wrongs of his maltreated blue serge suit like a battle standard still waving above a lost cause i found him profitable and so may you when you do look for him look among the lighthorse troop of bedouins that besiege the picketline of the travelling potentates guards and secretariesamong the wildeyed genii of arabian afternoons that gather to make astounding and egregrious demands upon the princes coffers  i first saw mr polk coming down the steps of the hotel at which sojourned his highness the gaekwar of baroda most enlightened of the mahratta princes who of late ate bread and salt in our metropolis of the occident  lucullus moved rapidly as though propelled by some potent moral force that imminently threatened to become physical behind him closely followed the impetusa hotel detective if ever white alpine hat hawks nose implacable watch chain and loud refinement of manner spoke the truth a brace of uniformed porters at his heels preserved the smooth decorum of the hotel repudiating by their air of disengagement any suspicion that they formed a reserve squad of ejectment  safe on the sidewalk lucullus polk turned and shook a freckled fist at the caravansary and to my joy he began to breathe deep invective in strange words  rides in howdays does he he cried loudly and sneeringly rides on elephants in howdahs and calls himself a prince kingsyah comes over here and talks horse till you would think he was a president and then goes home and rides in a private diningroom strapped onto an elephant well well well  the ejecting committee quietly retired the scorner of princes turned to me and snapped his fingers  what do you think of that he shouted derisively the gaekwar of baroda rides in an elephant in a howdah and theres old bikram shamsher jang scorching up and down the pigpaths of khatmandu on a motorcycle wouldnt that maharajah you and the shah of persia that ought to have been muleyonthespot for at least three hes got the palanquin habit and that funnyhat prince from koreawouldnt you think he could afford to amble around on a milkwhite palfrey once in a dynasty or two nothing doing his idea of a balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog wallows of seoul in a bullcart thats the kind of visiting potentates that come to this country now its a hard deal friend  i murmured a few words of sympathy but it was uncomprehending for i did not know his grievance against the rulers who flash meteorlike now and then upon our shores  the last one i sold continued the displeased one was to that threehorsetailed turkish pasha that came over a year ago five hundred dollars he paid for it easy i says to his executioner or secretaryhe was a kind of a jew or a chinamanhis turkey gibbets is fond of horses then  him says the secretary well no hes got a big fat wife in the harem named bad dora that he dont like i believe he intends to saddle her up and ride her up and down the boardwalk in the bulbul gardens a few times every day you havent got a pair of extralong spurs you could throw in on the deal have you yes sir theres mighty few real roughriders among the royal sports these days  as soon as lucullus polk got cool enough i picked him up and with no greater effort than you would employ in persuading a drowning man to clutch a straw i inveigled him into accompanying me to a cool corner in a dim cafe  and it came to pass that manservants set before us brewage and lucullus polk spake unto me relating the wherefores of his beleaguering the antechambers of the princes of the earth  did you ever hear of the sa  ap railroad in texas well that dont stand for samaritan actors aid philanthropy i was down that way managing a summer bunch of the gum and syntaxchewers that play the idlewild parks in the western hamlets of course we went to pieces when the soubrette ran away with a prominent barber of beeville i dont know what became of the rest of the company i believe there were some salaries due and the last i saw of the troupe was when i told them that fortythree cents was all the treasury contained i say i never saw any of them after that but i heard them for about twenty minutes i didnt have time to look back but after dark i came out of the woods and struck the sa  ap agent for means of transportation he at once extended to me the courtesies of the entire railroad kindly warning me however not to get aboard any of the rolling stock  about ten the next morning i steps off the ties into a village that calls itself atascosa city i bought a thirtycent breakfast and a tencent cigar and stood on the main street jingling the three pennies in my pocketdead broke a man in texas with only three cents in his pocket is no better off than a man that has no money and owes two cents  one of lucks favourite tricks is to soak a man for his last dollar so quick that he dont have time to look it there i was in a swell st louis tailormade blueandgreen plaid suit and an eighteen carat sulphateofcopper scarfpin with no hope in sight except the two great texas industries the cotton fields and grading new railroads i never picked cotton and i never cottoned to a pick so the outlook had ultramarine edges  all of a sudden while i was standing on the edge of the wooden sidewalk down out of the sky falls two fine gold watches in the middle of the street one hits a chunk of mud and sticks the other falls hard and flies open making a fine drizzle of little springs and screws and wheels i looks up for a balloon or an airship but not seeing any i steps off the sidewalk to investigate  but i hear a couple of yells and see two men running up the street in leather overalls and highheeled boots and cartwheel hats one man is six or eight feet high with openplumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance he picks up the watch that has stuck in the mud the other man who is little with pink hair and white eyes goes for the empty case and says i win then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather legholsters and hands a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces to his albino friend i dont know how much money it was it looked as big as an earthquakerelief fund to me  ill have this here case filled up with works says shorty and throw you again for five hundred  im your company says the high man ill meet you at the smoked dog saloon an hour from now  the little man hustles away with a kind of swiss movement toward a jewelry store the heartbroken person stoops over and takes a telescopic view of my haberdashery  thems a mighty slick outfit of habiliments you have got on mr man says he ill bet a hoss you never acquired the right title and interest in and to them clothes in atascosa city  why no says i being ready enough to exchange personalities with this moneyed monument of melancholy i had this suit tailored from a special line of coatericks vestures and pantings in st louis would you mind putting me sane says i on this watchthrowing contest ive been used to seeing timepieces treated with more politeness and esteemexcept womens watches of course which by nature they abuse by cracking walnuts with em and having em taken showing in tintype pictures  me and george he explains are up from the ranch having a spell of fun up to last month we owned four sections of watered grazing down on the san miguel but along comes one of these oil prospectors and begins to bore he strikes a gusher that flows out twenty thousand or maybe it was twenty millionbarrels of oil a day and me and george gets one hundred and fifty thousand dollarsseventyfive thousand dollars apiecefor the land so now and then we saddles up and hits the breeze for atascosa city for a few days of excitement and damage heres a little bunch of the dinero that i drawed out of the bank this morning says he and shows a roll of twenties and fifties as big around as a sleepingcar pillow the yellowbacks glowed like a sunset on the gable end of john ds barn my knees got weak and i sat down on the edge of the board sidewalk  you must have knocked around a right smart goes on this oil greaseus i shouldnt be surprised if you have saw towns more livelier than what atascosa city is sometimes it seems to me that there ought to be some more ways of having a good time than there is here specially when youve got plenty of money and dont mind spending it  then this mother carys chick of the desert sits down by me and we hold a conversationfest it seems that he was moneypoor hed lived in ranch camps all his life and he confessed to me that his supreme idea of luxury was to ride into camp tired out from a roundup eat a peck of mexican beans hobble his brains with a pint of raw whisky and go to sleep with his boots for a pillow when this bargeload of unexpected money came to him and his pink but perky partner george and they hied themselves to this clump of outhouses called atascosa city you know what happened to them they had money to buy anything they wanted but they didnt know what to want their ideas of spendthriftiness were limited to threewhisky saddles and gold watches if there was anything else in the world to throw away fortunes on they had never heard about it so when they wanted to have a hot time theyd ride into town and get a city directory and stand in front of the principal saloon and call up the population alphabetically for free drinks then they would order three or four new california saddles from the storekeeper and play crackloo on the sidewalk with twentydollar gold pieces betting who could throw his gold watch the farthest was an inspiration of georges but even that was getting to be monotonous  was i on to the opportunity listen  in thirty minutes i had dashed off a word picture of metropolitan joys that made life in atascosa city look as dull as a trip to coney island with your own wife in ten minutes more we shook hands on an agreement that i was to act as his guide interpreter and friend in and to the aforesaid wassail and amenity and solomon mills which was his name was to pay all expenses for a month at the end of that time if i had made good as directorgeneral of the rowdy life he was to pay me one thousand dollars and then to clinch the bargain we called the roll of atascosa city and put all of its citizens except the ladies and minors under the table except one man named horace westervelt st clair just for that we bought a couple of hatfuls of cheap silver watches and egged him out of town with em we wound up by dragging the harnessmaker out of bed and setting him to work on three new saddles and then we went to sleep across the railroad track at the depot just to annoy the sa  ap think of having seventy five thousand dollars and trying to avoid the disgrace of dying rich in a town like that  the next day george who was married or something started back to the ranch me and solly as i now called him prepared to shake off our moth balls and wing our way against the arclights of the joyous and tuneful east  no waystops says i to solly except long enough to get you barbered and haberdashed this is no texas feet shampetter says i where you eat chiliconcarneconhuevos and then holler whoopee across the plaza were now going against the real high life were going to mingle with the set that carries a spitz wears spats and hits the ground in high spots  solly puts six thousand dollars in century bills in one pocket of his brown ducks and bills of lading for ten thousand dollars on eastern banks in another then i resume diplomatic relations with the sa  ap and we hike in a northwesterly direction on our circuitous route to the spice gardens of the yankee orient  we stopped in san antonio long enough for solly to buy some clothes and eight rounds of drinks for the guests and employees of the menger hotel and order four mexican saddles with silver trimmings and white angora suaderos to be shipped down to the ranch from there we made a big jump to st louis we got there in time for dinner and i put our thumbprints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city  now says i to solly with a wink at myself heres the first dinnerstation weve struck where we can get a real good plate of beans and while he was up in his room trying to draw water out of the gaspipe i got one finger in the buttonhole of the head waiters tuxedo drew him apart inserted a twodollar bill and closed him up again  frankoyse says i i have a pal here for dinner thats been subsisting for years on cereals and short stogies you see the chef and order a dinner for us such as you serve to dave francis and the general passenger agent of the iron mountain when they eat here weve got more than bernhardts tent full of money and we want the nose bags crammed with all the chief deveries de cuisine object is no expense now show us  at six oclock me and solly sat down to dinner spread theres nothing been seen like it since the cambon snack it was all served at once the chef called it dinnay a la poker its a famous thing among the gormands of the west the dinner comes in threes of a kind there was guineafowls guineapigs and guinnesss stout roast veal mock turtle soup and chicken pate shadroe caviar and tapioca canvasback duck canvasback ham and cottontail rabbit philadelphia capon fried snails and sloeginand so on in threes the idea was that you eat nearly all you can of them and then the waiter takes away the discard and gives you pears to fill on  i was sure solly would be tickled to death with these hands after the bobtail flushes hed been eating on the ranch and i was a little anxious that he should for i didnt remember his having honoured my efforts with a smile since we left atascosa city  we were in the main diningroom and there was a finedressed crowd there all talking loud and enjoyable about the two st louis topics the water supply and the colour line they mix the two subjects so fast that strangers often think they are discussing watercolours and that has given the old town something of a rep as an art centre and over in the corner was a fine brass band playing and now thinks i solly will become conscious of the spiritual oats of life nourishing and exhilarating his system but nong mong frang  he gazed across the table at me there was four square yards of it looking like the path of a cyclone that has wandered through a stock yard a poultryfarm a vegetablegarden and an irish linen mill solly gets up and comes around to me  luke says he im pretty hungry after our ride i thought you said they had some beans here im going out and get something i can eat you can stay and monkey with this artificial layout of grub if you want to  wait a minute says i  i called the waiter and slapped s mills on the back of the check for thirteen dollars and fifty cents  what do you mean says i by serving gentlemen with a lot of truck only suitable for deckhands on a mississippi steamboat were going out to get something decent to eat  i walked up the street with the unhappy plainsman he saw a saddle shop open and some of the sadness faded from his eyes we went in and he ordered and paid for two more saddlesone with a solid silver horn and nails and ornaments and a sixinch border of rhinestones and imitation rubies around the flaps the other one had to have a gold mounted horn quadrupleplated stirrups and the leather inlaid with silver beadwork wherever it would stand it eleven hundred dollars the two cost him  then he goes out and heads toward the river following his nose in a little side street where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses he finds what he is looking for we go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen and eat beans with tin spoons yes sir beansbeans boiled with salt pork  i kind of thought wed strike some over this way says solly  delightful says i that stylish hotel grub may appeal to some but for me give me the husky table dgoat  when we had succumbed to the beans i leads him out of the tarpaulin steam under a lamp post and pulls out a daily paper with the amusement column folded out  but now what ho for a merry round of pleasure says i heres one of hall caines shows and a stockyard company in hamlet and skating at the hollowhorn rink and sarah bernhardt and the shapely syrens burlesque company i should think now that the shapely  but what does this healthy wealthy and wise man do but reach his arms up to the secondstory windows and gape noisily  reckon ill be going to bed says he its about my time st louis is a kind of quiet place aint it  oh yes says i ever since the railroads ran in here the towns been practically ruined and the buildingandloan associations and the fair have about killed it guess we might as well go to bed wait till you see chicago though shall we get tickets for the big breeze tomorrow  mought as well says solly i reckon all these towns are about alike  well maybe the wise cicerone and personal conductor didnt fall hard in chicago looloovilleonthelake is supposed to have one or two things in it calculated to keep the rural visitor awake after the curfew rings but not for the grassfed man of the pampas i tried him with theatres rides in automobiles sails on the lake champagne suppers and all those little inventions that hold the simple life in check but in vain solly grew sadder day by day and i got fearful about my salary and knew i must play my trump card so i mentioned new york to him and informed him that these western towns were no more than gateways to the great walled city of the whirling dervishes  after i bought the tickets i missed solly i knew his habits by then so in a couple of hours i found him in a saddleshop they had some new ideas there in the way of trees and girths that had strayed down from the canadian mounted police and solly was so interested that he almost looked reconciled to live he invested about nine hundred dollars in there  at the depot i telegraphed a cigarstore man i knew in new york to meet me at the twentythird street ferry with a list of all the saddlestores in the city i wanted to know where to look for solly when he got lost  now ill tell you what happened in new york i says to myself friend heherezade you want to get busy and make bagdad look pretty to the sad sultan of the sour countenance or itll be the bowstring for yours but i never had any doubt i could do it  i began with him like youd feed a starving man i showed him the horsecars on broadway and the staten island ferryboats and then i piled up the sensations on him but always keeping a lot of warmer ones up my sleeve  at the end of the third day he looked like a composite picture of five thousand orphans too late to catch a picnic steamboat and i was wilting down a collar every two hours wondering how i could please him and whether i was going to get my thou he went to sleep looking at the brooklyn bridge he disregarded the skyscrapers above the third story it took three ushers to wake him up at the liveliest vaudeville in town  once i thought i had him i nailed a pair of cuffs on him one morning before he was awake and i dragged him that evening to the palmcage of one of the biggest hotels in the cityto see the johnnies and the alicesitbythehours they were out in numerous quantities with the fat of the land showing in their clothes while we were looking them over solly divested himself of a fearful rusty kind of laughlike moving a folding bed with one roller broken it was his first in two weeks and it gave me hope  right you are says i theyre a funny lot of postcards arent they  oh i wasnt thinking of them dudes and culls on the hoof says he i was thinking of the time me and george put sheepdip in horsehead johnsons whisky i wish i was back in atascosa city says he  i felt a cold chill run down my back me to play and mate in one move says i to myself  i made solly promise to stay in the cafe for half an hour and i hiked out in a cab to lolabelle delatours flat on fortythird street i knew her well she was a chorusgirl in a broadway musical comedy  jane says i when i found her ive got a friend from texas here hes all right butwell he carries weight id like to give him a little whirl after the show this eveningbubbles you know and a buzz out to a casino for the whitebait and pickled walnuts is it a go  can he sing asks lolabelle  you know says i that i wouldnt take him away from home unless his notes were good hes got pots of moneybeanpots full of it  bring him around after the second act says lolabelle and ill examine his credentials and securities  so about ten oclock that evening i led solly to miss delatours dressingroom and her maid let us in in ten minutes in comes lolabelle fresh from the stage looking stunning in the costume she wears when she steps from the ranks of the lady grenadiers and says to the king welcome to our mayday revels and you can bet it wasnt the way she spoke the lines that got her the part  as soon as solly saw her he got up and walked straight out through the stage entrance into the street i followed him lolabelle wasnt paying my salary i wondered whether anybody was  luke says solly outside that was an awful mistake we must have got into the ladys private room i hope im gentleman enough to do anything possible in the way of apologies do you reckon shed ever forgive us  she may forget it says i of course it was a mistake lets go find some beans  thats the way it went but pretty soon afterward solly failed to show up at dinnertime for several days i cornered him he confessed that he had found a restaurant on third avenue where they cooked beans in texas style i made him take me there the minute i set foot inside the door i threw up my hands  there was a young woman at the desk and solly introduced me to her and then we sat down and had beans  yes sir sitting at the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger theres a way of doing it she knew i saw her working it she was healthylooking and plain dressed she had her hair drawn back from her forehead and faceno curls or frizzes thats the way she looked now ill tell you the way they work the game its simple when she wants a man she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him thats all  the next evening solly was to go to coney island with me at seven at eight oclock he hadnt showed up i went out and found a cab i felt sure there was something wrong  drive to the back home restaurant on third avenue says i and if i dont find what i want there take in these saddleshops i handed him the list  boss says the cabby i et a steak in that restaurant once if youre real hungry i advise you to try the saddleshops first  im a detective says i and i dont eat hurry up  as soon as i got to the restaurant i felt in the lines of my palms that i should beware of a tall red damfool man and i was going to lose a sum of money  solly wasnt there neither was the smoothhaired lady  i waited and in an hour they came in a cab and got out hand in hand i asked solly to step around the corner for a few words he was grinning clear across his face but i had not administered the grin  shes the greatest that ever sniffed the breeze says he  congrats says i id like to have my thousand now if you please  well luke says he i dont know that ive had such a skyhoodlin fine time under your tutelage and dispensation but ill do the best i can for youill do the best i can he repeats me and miss skinner was married an hour ago were leaving for texas in the morning  great says i consider yourself covered with rice and congress gaiters but dont lets tie so many satin bows on our business relations that we lose sight of em how about my honorarium  missis mills says he has taken possession of my money and papers except six bits i told her what id agreed to give you but she says its an irreligious and illegal contract and she wont pay a cent of it but i aint going to see you treated unfair says he ive got eightyseven saddles on the ranch what ive bought on this trip and when i get back im going to pick out the best six in the lot and send em to you  and did he i asked when lucullus ceased talking  he did and they are fit for kings to ride on the six he sent me must have cost him three thousand dollars but where is the market for em who would buy one except one of these rajahs and princes of asia and africa ive got em all on the list i know every tan royal dub and smoked princerino from mindanao to the caspian sea  its a long time between customers i ventured  theyre coming faster said polk nowadays when one of the murdering mutts gets civilised enough to abolish suttee and quit using his whiskers for a napkin he calls himself the roosevelt of the east and comes over to investigate our chautauquas and cocktails ill place em all yet now look here  from an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with much worn edges and indicated a paragraph  read that said the saddler to royalty the paragraph ran thus    his highness seyyid feysal bin turkee imam of muskat is one of   the most progressive and enlightened rulers of the old world his   stables contain more than a thousand horses of the purest persian   breeds it is said that this powerful prince contemplates a visit   to the united states at an early date  there said mr polk triumphantly my best saddle is as good as soldthe one with turquoises set in the rim of the cantle have you three dollars that you could loan me for a short time  it happened that i had and i did  if this should meet the eye of the imam of muskat may it quicken his whim to visit the land of the free otherwise i fear that i shall be longer than a short time separated from my dollars three    vii  hygeia at the solito  if you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the early nineties when for a minute and sundry odd seconds a champion and a wouldbe faced each other on the alien side of an international river so brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise of true sport the reporters made what they could of it but divested of padding the action was sadly fugacious the champion merely smote his victim turned his back upon him remarking i know what i done to dat stiff and extended an arm like a ships mast for his glove to be removed  which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy vests and neckwear being spilled from their pullmans in san antonio in the early morning following the fight which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which cricket mcguire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform torn by a spasm of that hollow racking cough so familiar to san antonian ears at that time in the uncertain light of dawn that way passed curtis raidler the nueces county cattlemanmay his shadow never measure under six foot two  the cattleman out this early to catch the southbound for his ranch station stopped at the side of the distressed patron of sport and spoke in the kindly drawl of his ilk and region got it pretty bad bud  cricket mcguire exfeatherweight prizefighter tout jockey follower of the ponies allround sport and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut shells looked up pugnaciously at the imputation cast by bud  gwan he rasped telegraph pole i didnt ring for yer  another paroxysm wrung him and he leaned limply against a convenient baggage truck raidler waited patiently glancing around at the white hats short overcoats and big cigars thronging the platform youre from the noth aint you bud he asked when the other was partially recovered come down to see the fight  fight snapped mcguire pussinthecorner twas a hypodermic injection handed him just one like a squirt of dope and hes asleep and no tanbark needed in front of his residence fight he rattled a bit coughed and went on hardly addressing the cattleman but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles no more dead sure tings for me but rus sage himself would have snatched at it five to one dat de boy from cork wouldnt stay tree rounds is what i invested in put my last cent on and could already smell the sawdust in dat allnight joint of jimmy delaneys on tirtyseventh street i was goin to buy and densay telegraph pole what a gazaboo a guy is to put his whole roll on one turn of the gaboozlum  youre plenty right said the big cattleman more specially when you lose son you get up and light out for a hotel you got a mighty bad cough had it long  lungs said mcguire comprehensively i got it the croaker says ill come to time for six months longermaybe a year if i hold my gait i wanted to settle down and take care of myself dats why i speculated on dat five to one perhaps i had a tousand iron dollars saved up if i winned i was goin to buy delaneys cafe whod a tought dat stiff would take a nap in de foist roundsay  its a hard deal commented raidler looking down at the diminutive form of mcguire crumpled against the truck but you go to a hotel and rest theres the menger and the maverick and  and the fith avnoo and the waldorfastoria mimicked mcguire told you i went broke im on de bum proper ive got one dime left maybe a trip to europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up paper  he flung his dime at a newsboy got his express propped his back against the truck and was at once rapt in the account of his waterloo as expanded by the ingenious press  curtis raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch and laid his hand on mcguires shoulder  come on bud he said we got three minutes to catch the train  sarcasm seemed to be mcguires vein  you aint seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since i told you i was broke a minute ago have you friend chase yourself away  youre going down to my ranch said the cattleman and stay till you get well six monthsll fix you good as new he lifted mcguire with one hand and halfdragged him in the direction of the train  what about the money said mcguire struggling weakly to escape  money for what asked raidler puzzled they eyed each other not understanding for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog wheelsat right angles and moving upon different axes  passengers on the southbound saw them seated together and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes mcguire was five feet one with a countenance belonging to either yokohama or dublin brightbeady of eye bony of cheek and jaw scarred toughened broken and reknit indestructible grisly gladiatorial as a hornet he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar raidler was the product of a different soil six feet two in height miles broad and no deeper than a crystal brook he represented the union of the west and south few accurate pictures of his kind have been made for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in texas after all the only possible medium of portrayal of raidlers kind would be the frescosomething high and simple and cool and unframed  they were rolling southward on the international the timber was huddling into little dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright vert prairies this was the land of the ranches the domain of the kings of the kine  mcguire sat collapsed into his corner of the seat receiving with acid suspicion the conversation of the cattleman what was the game of this big geezer who was carrying him off altruism would have been mcguires last guess he aint no farmer thought the captive and he aint no con man for sure wats his lay you trail in cricket and see how many cards he draws youre up against it anyhow you got a nickel and gallopin consumption and you better lay low lay low and see wats his game  at rincon a hundred miles from san antonio they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for raidler in this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and their destination if anything could this drive should have stirred the acrimonious mcguire to a sense of his ransom they sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna the pair of spanish ponies struck a nimble tireless trot which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild untrammelled gallop the air was wine and seltzer perfumed as they absorbed it with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers the road perished and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself steered by the practised hand of raidler to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance but mcguire reclined upon his spine seeing nothing but a desert and receiving the cattlemans advances with sullen distrust wats he up to was the burden of his thoughts wat kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell mcguire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension  a week before while riding the prairies raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf deserted and bawling without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy across his saddle and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to it was impossible for mcguire to know or comprehend that in the eyes of the cattleman his case and that of the calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance a creature was ill and helpless he had the power to render aidthese were the only postulates required for the cattleman to act they formed his system of logic and the most of his creed mcguire was the seventh invalid whom raidler had picked up thus casually in san antonio where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets five of them had been guests of solito ranch until they had been able to leave cured or better and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude one came too late but rested very comfortably at last under a ratama tree in the garden  so then it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door and raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery  mcguire looked upon things strange to him the ranchhouse was the best in the country it was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon but it was of but one story and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor gallery the miscellaneous setting of horses dogs saddles wagons guns and cowpunchers paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman  well here we are at home said raidler cheeringly  its a hl of a looking place said mcguire promptly as he rolled upon the gallery floor in a fit of coughing  well try to make it comfortable for you buddy said the cattleman gently it aint fine inside but its the outdoors anyway thatll do you the most good thisll be your room in here anything we got you ask for it  he led mcguire into the east room the floor was bare and clean white curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows a big willow rocker two straight chairs a long table covered with newspapers pipes tobacco spurs and cartridges stood in the centre some wellmounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls a wide cool cotbed stood in a corner nueces county people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince mcguire showed his eyeteeth at it he took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling  tought i was lyin about the money did ye well you can frisk me if you wanter dats the last simoleon in the treasury whos goin to pay  the cattlemans clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the huckleberry optics of his guest after a little he said simply and not ungraciously ill be much obliged to you son if you wont mention money any more once was quite a plenty folks i ask to my ranch dont have to pay anything and they very scarcely ever offers it supperll be ready in half an hour theres water in the pitcher and some cooler to drink in that red jar hanging on the gallery  wheres the bell asked mcguire looking about  bell for what  bell to ring for things i cantsee here he exploded in a sudden weak fury i never asked you to bring me here i never held you up for a cent i never gave you a hardluck story till you asked me here i am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail im sick i cant hustle gee but im up against it mcguire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly  raidler went to the door and called a slender brightcomplexioned mexican youth about twenty came quickly raidler spoke to him in spanish  ylario it is in my mind that i promised you the position of vaquero on the san carlos range at the fall rodeo  si senor such was your goodness  listen this senorito is my friend he is very sick place yourself at his side attend to his wants at all times have much patience and care with him and when he is well orand when he is well instead of vaquero i will make you mayordomo of the rancho de las piedras esta bueno  si simil gracias senor ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently growling none of your operyhouse antics now  ten minutes later ylario came from mcguires room and stood before raidler  the little senor he announced presents his compliments raidler credited ylario with the preliminary and desires some pounded ice one hot bath one gin feezz that the windows be all closed toast one shave one newyorkheral cigarettes and to send one telegram  raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet here take him this he said  thus was instituted the reign of terror at the solito ranch for a few weeks mcguire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of raidlers he was an absolutely new experience to them he explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence he opened to their minds view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports his jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them his gestures his strange poses his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them he was like a being from a new world  strange to say this new world he had entered did not exist to him he was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar he had dropped out he felt into open space for a time and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the closedrawn spangled nights touched him all the hues of aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal get something for nothing was his mission in life thirtyseventh street was his goal  nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse it was then that he became the ranchs incubus its harpy its old man of the sea he shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet whining complaining cursing accusing the keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts with all his dire protestations of increasing illness to the eye of others he remained unchanged his currantlike eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever his voice was as rasping his callous face with the skin drawn tense as a drumhead had no flesh to lose a flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom and percussion might have established the fact that mcguire was breathing with only one lung but his appearance remained the same  in constant attendance upon him was ylario whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated for mcguire chained him to a bitter existence the airthe mans only chance for lifehe commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains the room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke whosoever entered it must sit suffocating and listen to the imps interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career  the oddest thing of all was the relation existing between mcguire and his benefactor the attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish perverse child toward an indulgent parent when raidler would leave the ranch mcguire would fall into a fit of malevolent silent sullenness when he returned he would be met by a string of violent and stinging reproaches raidlers attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable in its way the cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character assigned to him by mcguires intemperate accusationsthe character of tyrant and guilty oppressor he seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellows condition and he always met his tirades with a pacific patient and even remorseful kindness that never altered  one day raidler said to him try more air son you can have the buckboard and a driver every day if youll go try a week or two in one of the cow camps ill fix you up plumb comfortable the ground and the air next to itthems the things to cure you i knowed a man from philadelphy sicker than you are got lost on the guadalupe and slept on the bare grass in sheep camps for two weeks well sir it started him getting well which he done close to the groundthats where the medicine in the air stays try a little hossback riding now theres a gentle pony  whatve i done to yer screamed mcguire did i ever doublecross yer did i ask you to bring me here drive me out to your camps if you wanter or stick a knife in me and save trouble ride i cant lift my feet i couldnt sidestep a jab from a fiveyearold kid thats what your dd ranch has done for me theres nothing to eat nothing to see and nobody to talk to but a lot of reubens who dont know a punching bag from a lobster salad  its a lonesome place for certain apologised raidler abashedly we got plenty but its rough enough anything you think of you want the boysll ride up and fetch it down for you  it was chad murchison a cowpuncher from the circle bar outfit who first suggested that mcguires illness was fraudulent chad had brought a basket of grapes for him thirty miles and four out of his way tied to his saddlehorn after remaining in the smoketainted room for a while he emerged and bluntly confided his suspicions to raidler  his arm said chad is hardern a diamond he interduced me to what he called a shoreperplexus punch and twas like being kicked twice by a mustang hes playin it low down on you curt he aint no sickern i am i hate to say it but the runts workin you for range and shelter  the cattlemans ingenuous mind refused to entertain chads view of the case and when later he came to apply the test doubt entered not into his motives  one day about noon two men drove up to the ranch alighted hitched and came in to dinner standing and general invitations being the custom of the country one of them was a great san antonio doctor whose costly services had been engaged by a wealthy cowman who had been laid low by an accidental bullet he was now being driven back to the station to take the train back to town after dinner raidler took him aside pushed a twentydollar bill against his hand and said  doc theres a young chap in that room i guess has got a bad case of consumption id like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is and if we can do anything for him  how much was that dinner i just ate mr raidler said the doctor bluffly looking over his spectacles raidler returned the money to his pocket the doctor immediately entered mcguires room and the cattleman seated himself upon a heap of saddles on the gallery ready to reproach himself in the event the verdict should be unfavourable  in ten minutes the doctor came briskly out your man he said promptly is as sound as a new dollar his lungs are better than mine respiration temperature and pulse normal chest expansion four inches not a sign of weakness anywhere of course i didnt examine for the bacillus but it isnt there you can put my name to the diagnosis even cigarettes and a vilely close room havent hurt him coughs does he well you tell him it isnt necessary you asked if there is anything we could do for him well i advise you to set him digging postholes or breaking mustangs theres our team ready good day sir and like a puff of wholesome blustery wind the doctor was off  raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing and began chewing it thoughtfully  the branding season was at hand and the next morning ross hargis foreman of the outfit was mustering his force of some twentyfive men at the ranch ready to start for the san carlos range where the work was to begin by six oclock the horses were all saddled the grub wagon ready and the cowpunchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts when raidler bade them wait a boy was bringing up an extra pony bridled and saddled to the gate raidler walked to mcguires room and threw open the door mcguire was lying on his cot not yet dressed smoking  get up said the cattleman and his voice was clear and brassy like a bugle  hows that asked mcguire a little startled  get up and dress i can stand a rattlesnake but i hate a liar do i have to tell you again he caught mcguire by the neck and stood him on the floor  say friend cried mcguire wildly are you bughouse im sick see ill croak if i got to hustle whatve i done to yerhe began his chronic whinei never asked yer to  put on your clothes called raidler in a rising tone  swearing stumbling shivering keeping his amazed shining eyes upon the now menacing form of the aroused cattleman mcguire managed to tumble into his clothes then raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and across the yard to the extra pony hitched at the gate the cowpunchers lolled in their saddles openmouthed  take this man said raidler to ross hargis and put him to work make him work hard sleep hard and eat hard you boys know i done what i could for him and he was welcome yesterday the best doctor in san antone examined him and says hes got the lungs of a burro and the constitution of a steer you know what to do with him ross  ross hargis only smiled grimly  aw said mcguire looking intently at raidler with a peculiar expression upon his face the croaker said i was all right did he said i was fakin did he you put him onto me you tought i wasnt sick you said i was a liar say friend i talked rough i know but i didnt mean most of it if you felt like i didaw i forgoti aint sick the croaker says well friend now ill go work for yer heres where you play even  he sprang into the saddle easily as a bird got the quirt from the horn and gave his pony a slash with it cricket who once brought in good boy by a neck at hawthorneand a 10 to 1 shothad his foot in the stirrups again  mcguire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for san carlos and the cowpunchers gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust  but in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear and was last man when they struck the patch of high chaparral below the horse pens behind a clump of this he drew rein and held a handkerchief to his mouth he took it away drenched with bright arterial blood and threw it carefully into a clump of prickly pear then he slashed with his quirt again gasped gwan to his astonished pony and galloped after the gang  that night raidler received a message from his old home in alabama there had been a death in the family an estate was to divide and they called for him to come daylight found him in the buckboard skimming the prairies for the station it was two months before he returned when he arrived at the ranch house he found it wellnigh deserted save for ylario who acted as a kind of steward during his absence little by little the youth made him acquainted with the work done while he was away the branding camp he was informed was still doing business on account of many severe storms the cattle had been badly scattered and the branding had been accomplished but slowly the camp was now in the valley of the guadalupe twenty miles away  by the way said raidler suddenly remembering that fellow i sent along with themmcguireis he working yet  i do not know said ylario mans from the camp come verree few times to the ranch so plentee work with the leetle calves they no say oh i think that fellow mcguire he dead much time ago  dead said raidler what you talking about  verree sick fellow mcguire replied ylario with a shrug of his shoulder i theenk he no live one two month when he go away  shucks said raidler he humbugged you too did he the doctor examined him and said he was sound as a mesquite knot  that doctor said ylario smiling he tell you so that doctor no see mcguire  talk up ordered raidler what the devil do you mean  mcguire continued the boy tranquilly he getting drink water outside when that doctor come in room that doctor take me and pound me all over here with his fingersputting his hand to his chesti not know for what he put his ear here and here and here and listen i not know for what he put little glass stick in my mouth he feel my arm here he make me count like whispersotwenty treinta cuarenta who knows concluded ylario with a deprecating spread of his hands for what that doctor do those verree droll and suchlike things  what horses are up asked raidler shortly  paisano is grazing out behind the little corral senor  saddle him for me at once  within a very few minutes the cattleman was mounted and away paisano well named after that ungainly but swiftrunning bird struck into his long lope that ate up the ground like a strip of macaroni in two hours and a quarter raidler from a gentle swell saw the branding camp by a water hole in the guadalupe sick with expectancy of the news he feared he rode up dismounted and dropped paisanos reins so gentle was his heart that at that moment he would have pleaded guilty to the murder of mcguire  the only being in the camp was the cook who was just arranging the hunks of barbecued beef and distributing the tin coffee cups for supper raidler evaded a direct question concerning the one subject in his mind  everything all right in camp pete he managed to inquire  so so said pete conservatively grub give out twice wind scattered the cattle and weve had to rake the brush for forty mile i need a new coffeepot and the mosquitos is some more hellish than common  the boysall well  pete was no optimist besides inquiries concerning the health of cow punchers were not only superfluous but bordered on flaccidity it was not like the boss to make them  whats left of em dont miss no calls to grub the cook conceded  whats left of em repeated raidler in a husky voice mechanically he began to look around for mcguires grave he had in his mind a white slab such as he had seen in the alabama churchyard but immediately he knew that was foolish  sure said pete whats left cow camps change in two months somes gone  raidler nerved himself  thatchapi sent alongmcguiredidhe  say interrupted pete rising with a chunk of corn bread in each hand that was a dirty shame sending that poor sick kid to a cow camp a doctor that couldnt tell he was graveyard meat ought to be skinned with a cinch buckle game as he was tooits a scandal among snakeslemme tell you what he done first night in camp the boys started to initiate him in the leather breeches degree ross hargis busted him one swipe with his chaparreras and what do you reckon the poor child did got up the little skeeter and licked ross licked ross hargis licked him good hit him plenty and everywhere and hard rossd just get up and pick out a fresh place to lay down on agin  then that mcguire goes off there and lays down with his head in the grass and bleeds a hemridge they calls it he lays there eighteen hours by the watch and they cant budge him then ross hargis who loves any man who can lick him goes to work and damns the doctors from greenland to poland chiny and him and green branch johnson they gets mcguire into a tent and spells each other feedin him chopped raw meat and whisky  but it looks like the kid aint got no appetite to git well for they misses him from the tent in the night and finds him rootin in the grass and likewise a drizzle fallin gwan he says lemme go and die like i wanter he said i was a liar and a fake and i was playin sick lemme alone  two weeks went on the cook he laid around not noticin nobody and then  a sudden thunder filled the air and a score of galloping centaurs crashed through the brush into camp  illustrious

cussed little runt remarked ross tenderly is the jodartinest hustlerand the hardest hitter in anybodys cow camp    viii  an afternoon miracle  at the united states end of an international river bridge four armed rangers sweltered in a little dobe hut keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers from the mexican side  bud dawson proprietor of the top notch saloon had on the evening previous violently ejected from his premises one leandro garcia for alleged violation of the top notch code of behaviour garcia had mentioned twentyfour hours as a limit by which time he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction  this mexican although a tremendous braggart was thoroughly courageous and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes he and a following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation  the day designated by garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the american side by a cattlemens convention a bull fight and an old settlers barbecue and picnic knowing the avenger to be a man of his word and believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations were in progress captain mcnulty of the ranger company stationed there detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge their instructions were to prevent the invasion of garcia either alone or attended by his gang  travel was slight that sultry afternoon and the rangers swore gently and mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters for an hour no one had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling then three shots were fired down the street the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air  the four rangers quickened from sprawling symbolic figures of indolence to alert life but only one rose to his feet three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the fourth who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridgebelt around him the three knew that lieutenant bob buckley in command would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row when he himself might go  the agile broadchested lieutenant without a change of expression in his smooth yellowbrown melancholy face shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette caught up his winchester and dived for the door there he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge and then plunged into the broiling highway  the three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment  ive heard of fellows grumbled broncho leathers what was wedded to danger but if bob buckley aint committed bigamy with trouble im a son of a gun  peculiarness of bob is inserted the nueces kid he aint had proper trainin he never learned how to git skeered now a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss to hanker after readin his name on the list of survivors anyway  buckley commented ranger no 3 who was a misguided eastern man burdened with an education scraps in such a solemn manner that i have been led to doubt its spontaneity im not quite onto his system but he fights like tybalt by the book of arithmetic  i never heard mentioned broncho about any of dibbles ways of mixin scrappin and cipherin  triggernometry suggested the nueces infant  thats rather better than i hoped from you nodded the easterner approvingly the other meaning is that buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight he seems to dread taking the slightest advantage thats quite close to foolhardiness when you are dealing with horsethieves and fencecutters who would ambush you any night and shoot you in the back if they could buckleys too full of sand hell play horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day  im on there drawled the kid i mind that bridge gang in the reader me i go instructed for the other chapspurious somebodythe one that fought and pulled his freight to fight em on some other day  anyway summed up broncho bobs about the gamest man i ever see along the rio bravo great sam houston if she gets any hotter shell sizzle broncho whacked at a scorpion with his fourpound stetson felt and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless silence  how well bob buckley had kept his secret since these men for two years his side comrades in countless border raids and dangers thus spake of him not knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that rio bravo country neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage it was purely a physical cowardice and only by an extreme grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest deeds scourging himself always as a monk whips his besetting sin buckley threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger with the hope of some day ridding himself of the despised affliction but each successive test brought no relief and the rangers face by nature adapted to cheerfulness and goodhumour became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy thus while the frontier admired his deeds and his prowess was celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp fires in the valley of the bravo his heart was sick within him only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest the dry mouth the weakening of the spine the agony of the strung nervesthe never failing symptoms of his shameful malady  one mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle a cigarette hanging from his lips which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention buckley would have given a years pay to attain that devil maycare method once the debonair youth said to him buck you go into a scrap like it was a funeral not he added with a complimentary wave of his tin cup but what it generally is  buckleys conscience was of the new england order with western adjustments and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible wherefore on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the state  two squares down the street stood the top notch saloon here buckley came upon signs of recent upheaval a few curious spectators pressed about its front entrance grinding beneath their heels the fragments of a plateglass window inside buckley found bud dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his shoulder while he feelingly wept at having to explain why he failed to drop the blamed masquerooter who shot him at the entrance of the ranger bud turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have dealt  you know buck id a plum got him first rattle if id thought a minute come in amasquerootin playin female till he got the drop and turned loose i never reached for a gun thinkin it was sure chihuahua betty or mrs atwater or anyhow one of the mayfield girls comin agunnin which they might liable as not i never thought of that blamed garcia until  garcia snapped buckley how did he get over here  buds bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door there stood a patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter with a load of kindling wood tied across its back on the ground lay a black shawl and a voluminous brown dress  masquerootin in them things called bud still resisting attempted ministrations to his wounds thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and winged me  he went down this side street said the bartender he was alone and hell hide out till night when his gang comes over you ought to find him in that mexican layout below the depot hes got a girl down therepancha sales  how was he armed asked buckley  two pearlhandled sixes and a knife  keep this for me billy said the ranger handing over his winchester quixotic perhaps but it was bob buckleys way another manand a braver onemight have raised a posse to accompany him it was buckleys rule to discard all preliminary advantage  the mexican had left behind him a wake of closed doors and an empty street but now people were beginning to emerge from their places of refuge with assumed unconsciousness of anything having happened many citizens who knew the ranger pointed out to him with alacrity the course of garcias retreat  as buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating constriction about his throat the cold sweat under the brim of his hat the old shameful dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down down down in his bosom    the morning train of the mexican central had that day been three hours late thus failing to connect with the i  gn on the other side of the river passengers for los estados unidos grumblingly sought entertainment in the little swaggering mongrel town of two nations for until the morrow no other train would come to rescue them grumblingly because two days later would begin the great fair and races in san antone consider that at that time san antone was the hub of the wheel of fortune and the names of its spokes were cattle wool faro running horses and ozone in those times cattlemen played at crackloo on the sidewalks with doubleeagles and gentlemen backed their conception of the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height only by the interference of gravity wherefore thither journeyed the sowers and the reapersthey who stampeded the dollars and they who rounded them up especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people haste to san antone two greatest shows on earth were already there and dozens of smallest ones were on the way  on a side track near the mean little dobe depot stood a private car left there by the mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to ignobly await amid squalid surroundings connection with the next days regular  the car had been once a common daycoach but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductors hatband slips would never have recognised it in its transformation paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public servitude the whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows from its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of mexico from its rear projected the stars and stripes and a busy stovepipe the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease the beholders eye regarding its gorgeous sides found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire lengtha single name the audacious privilege of royalty and genius doubly then was this arrogant nomenclature here justified for the name was that of alvarita queen of the serpent tribe this her car was back from a triumphant tour of the principal mexican cities and now headed for san antonio where according to promissory advertisement she would exhibit her marvellous dominion and fearless control over deadly and venomous serpents handling them with ease as they coil and hiss to the terror of thousands of tonguetied tremblers  one hundred in the shade kept the vicinity somewhat depeopled this quarter of the town was a ragged edge its denizens the bubbling froth of five nations its architecture tent jacal and dobe its distractions the hurdygurdy and the informal contribution to the sudden strangers store of experience beyond this dishonourable fringe upon the old towns jowl rose a dense mass of trees surmounting and filling a little hollow through this bickered a small stream that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of the rio bravo del norte  in this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent transport of the queen of the serpent tribe  the front door of the car was open its forward end was curtained off into a small receptionroom here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont to sit and transpose the music of senorita alvaritas talk into the more florid key of the press a picture of abraham lincoln hung against a wall one of a cluster of schoolgirls grouped upon stone steps was in another place a third was easter lilies in a bloodred frame a neat carpet was under foot a pitcher sweating cold drops and a glass stood on a fragile stand in a willow rocker reading a newspaper sat alvarita  spanish you would say andalusian or better still basque that compound like the diamond of darkness and fire hair the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight eyes long dusky and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze face haughty and bold touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life to hasten conviction of her charm but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner green and yellow and white upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose irresistible in black lace and yellow ribbons she faces you a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck his horrid head close to hers you perceive kuku the great elevenfoot asian python  a hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car and a middle aged faded woman holding a knife and a halfpeeled potato looked in and said  alviry are you right busy  im reading the home paper ma what do you think that pale tow headed matilda price got the most votes in the news for the prettiest girl in gallipolees  shush she wouldnt of done it if youd been home alviry lord knows i hope well be there before falls over im tired gallopin round the world playin we are dagoes and givin snake shows but that aint what i wanted to say that there biggest snakes gone again ive looked all over the car and cant find him he must have been gone an hour i remember hearin somethin rustlin along the floor but i thought it was you  oh blame that old rascal exclaimed the queen throwing down her paper this is the third time hes got away george never will fasten down the lid to his box properly i do believe hes afraid of kuku now ive got to go hunt him  better hurry somebody might hurt him  the queens teeth showed in a gleaming contemptuous smile no danger when they see kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides theres a crick over between here and the river that old scampd swap his skin any time for a drink of running water i guess ill find him there all right  a few minutes later alvarita stopped upon the forward platform ready for her quest her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion her spotless shirtwaist gladdened the eye in that desert of sunshine a swelling oasis cool and fresh a mans splitstraw hat sat firmly on her coiled abundant hair beneath her serene round impudent chin a mans fourinhand tie was jauntily knotted about a mans high stiff collar a parasol she carried of white silk and its fringe was lace yellowly genuine  i will grant gallipolis as to her costume but firmly to seville or valladolid i am held by her eyes castanets balconies mantillas serenades ambuscades escapadesall these their dark depths guaranteed  aint you afraid to go out alone alviry queried the queenmother anxiously theres so many rough people about mebbe youd better  i never saw anything i was afraid of yet ma specially people and men in particular dont you fret ill trot along back as soon as i find that runaway scamp  the dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks alvaritas eye soon discovered the serrated trail of the escaped python it led across the depot grounds and away down a smaller street in the direction of the little canon as predicted by her a stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that as yet the inhabitants were unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways the heat had driven them indoors whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs or the depressing whine of a maltreated concertina in the shade a few mexican children like vivified stolid idols in clay stared from their play visionstruck and silent as alvarita came and went here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol  a hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed scattered chaparral succeeding and then a noble grove overflowing the bijou canon through this a small bright stream meandered parklike it was with a kind of cockney ruralness further endorsed by the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers up this stream and down it among its pseudosylvan glades and depressions wandered the bright and unruffled alvarita once she saw evidence of the recreant reptiles progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in the arroyo the living water was bound to lure him he could not be far away  so sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant waterelm to reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline around her chaparral grew thick and high a lateblooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent odour adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind melancholy with the taste of sodden fallen leaves  alvarita removed her hat and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair began to slowly arrange it in two long dusky plaits  from the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away two small jewelbright eyes were steadfastly regarding her coiled there lay kuku the great python kuku the magnificent he of the plated muzzle the grooved lips the elevenfoot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin the great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to disclose his presence perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture but screened by the foliage thought to prolong the delight of his escapade what pleasure it was after the hot and dusty car to lie thus smelling the running water and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body soon very soon the queen would find him and he powerless as a worm in her audacious hands would be returned to the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels  alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her turning her head she saw a big swarthy mexican with a daring and evil expression contemplating her with an ominous dull eye  what do you want she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would permit continuing to plait her hair and looking him over with placid contempt the mexican continued to gaze at her and showed his teeth in a white jagged smile  i no hurty you senorita he said  you bet you wont answered the queen shaking back one finished massive plait but dont you think youd better move on  not hurty youno but maybeso take one besoone lil kees you call him  the man smiled again and set his foot to ascend the slope alvarita leaned swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut  vamoose quick she ordered peremptorily you coon  the red of insult burned through the mexicans dark skin  hidalgo yo he shot between his fangs i am not negrro diabla bonita for that you shall pay me  he made two quick upward steps this time but the stone hurled by no weak arm struck him square in the chest he staggered back to the footway swerved half around and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head she turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest a man with redbrown curling hair and a melancholy sunburned smoothshaven face was coming up the path twenty yards away around the mexicans waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters he had laid aside his sixespossibly in the jacal of the fair panchaand had forgotten them when the passing of the fairer alvarita had enticed him to her trail his hands now flew instinctively to the holsters but finding the weapons gone he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent abjuring deprecating latin gesture and stood like a rock seeing his plight the newcomer unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers threw it upon the ground and continued to advance  splendid murmured alvarita with flashing eyes    as bob buckley according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy the old inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him his breath whistled through his constricted air passages his feet seemed like lumps of lead his mouth was dry as dust his heart congested with blood hurt his ribs as it thumped against them the hot june day turned to moist november and still he advanced spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its uttermost against his weakling flesh  the distance between the two men slowly lessened the mexican stood immovable waiting when scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled down from above to the rangers feet he glanced upward with instinctive caution a pair of dark eyes brilliantly soft and fierily tender encountered and held his own the most fearful heart and the boldest one in all the rio bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable communication alvarita still seated within her vine leaned forward above the breasthigh chaparral one hand was laid across her bosom one great dark braid curved forward over her shoulder her lips were parted her face was lit with what seemed but wondergreat and absolute wonder her eyes lingered upon buckleys let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium the miracle was performed as by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge so on that eyeglance the man received his complement of manhood and the maid conceded what enriched her womanly grace by its loss  the mexican suddenly stirring ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife buckley cast aside his hat and laughed once aloud like a happy schoolboy at a frolic then emptyhanded he sprang nimbly and garcia met him without default  so soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the rangers warlike ecstasy instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke the mexican lunged straight with his knife buckley took the precarious chance and caught his wrist fair and firm then he delivered the good saxon knockout blowalways so pathetically disastrous to the fistless latin racesand garcia was down and out with his head under a clump of prickly pears the ranger looked up again to the queen of the serpents  alvarita scrambled down to the path  im mighty glad i happened along when i did said the ranger  hehe frightened me so cooed alvarita  they did not hear the long low hiss of the python under the shrubs wiliest of the beasts no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome  then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities and to them the ranger awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one of their mounts but buckley and alvarita lingered  slowly slowly they walked the ranger regained his belt of weapons with a fine timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great 45s with little ohs and ahs of newborn delicious shyness  the canoncito was growing dusky beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset  a screama piercing scream of fright from alvarita back she cowered and the ready protecting arm of buckley formed her refuge what terror so dire as to thus beset the close of the reign of the never beforedaunted queen  across the path there crawled a caterpillara horrid fuzzy two inch caterpillar truly kuku thou went avenged thus abdicated the queen of the serpent tribeviva la reina    ix  the higher abdication  curly the tramp sidled toward the freelunch counter he caught a fleeting glance from the bartenders eye and stood still trying to look like a business man who had just dined at the menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car curlys histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation but his makeup was wanting  the bartender rounded the bar in a casual way looking up at the ceiling as though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining and then fell upon curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready irresistibly but so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part the dispenser of drinks pushed curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness that was the way of the southwest  curly arose from the gutter leisurely he felt no anger or resentment toward his ejector fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twentytwo years of his life had hardened the fibres of his spirit the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fell blunted from the buckler of his armoured pride with especial resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the hands of bartenders naturally they were his enemies and unnaturally they were often his friends he had to take his chances with them but he had not yet learned to estimate these cool languid southwestern knights of the bungstarter who had the manners of an earl of pawtucket and who when they disapproved of your presence moved you with the silence and despatch of a chess automaton advancing a pawn  curly stood for a few moments in the narrow mesquitepaved street san antonio puzzled and disturbed him three days he had been a non paying guest of the town having dropped off there from a box car of an i  gn freight because greaser johnny had told him in des moines that the alamo city was manna fallen gathered cooked and served free with cream and sugar curly had found the tip partly a good one there was hospitality in plenty of a careless liberal irregular sort but the town itself was a weight upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing businesslike systematised cities of the north and east here he was often flung a dollar but too frequently a goodnatured kick would follow it once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on military plaza and dragged him across the black soil until no respectable ragbag would have stood sponsor for his clothes the winding doubling streets leading nowhere bewildered him and then there was a little river crooked as a pothook that crawled through the middle of the town crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on curlys nerves and the last bartender wore a number nine shoe  the saloon stood on a corner the hour was eight oclock homefarers and outgoers jostled curly on the narrow stone sidewalk between the buildings to his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare the alley was dark except for one patch of light where there was light there were sure to be human beings where there were human beings after nightfall in san antonio there might be food and there was sure to be drink so curly headed for the light  the illumination came from schwegels cafe on the sidewalk in front of it curly picked up an old envelope it might have contained a check for a million it was empty but the wanderer read the address mr otto schwegel and the name of the town and state the postmark was detroit  curly entered the saloon and now in the light it could be perceived that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage he had none of the tidiness of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp his wardrobe represented the castoff specimens of half a dozen fashions and eras two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet as you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies wax figures russian exiles and men lost on desert islands his face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocketknife and that had furnished him with his nom de route lightblue eyes full of sullenness fear cunning impudence and fawning witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul  the saloon was small and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink struggled for the ascendancy the pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen behind the bar schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores showed no signs of being obstructed hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer curly shuffled to the end of the bar coughed hollowly and told schwegel that he was a detroit cabinetmaker out of a job  it followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch  was you acquainted maybe with heinrich strauss in detroit asked schwegel  did i know heinrich strauss repeated curly affectionately why say bo i wish i had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and heine has played on sunday afternoons  more beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat and then curly knowing to a fluiddrachm how far a con game would go shuffled out into the unpromising street  and now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony southern town there was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that provided distraction even to the poorest in the cities of the north here even so early the gloomy rockwalled houses were closed and barred against the murky dampness of the night the streets were mere fissures through which flowed grey wreaths of river mist as he walked he heard laughter and the chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows and music coming from every chink of wood and stone but the diversions were selfish the day of popular pastimes had not yet come to san antonio  but at length curly as he strayed turned the sharp angle of another lost street and came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches celebrating in the open in front of an ancient wooden hotel one great roisterer from the sheep country who had just instigated a movement toward the bar swept curly in like a stray goat with the rest of his flock the princes of kine and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery and uproariously strove to preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards  an hour afterward curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his fickle friends whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen fullstoked with alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food the only question remaining to disturb him was that of shelter and bed  a drizzling cold texas rain had begun to fallan endless lazy unintermittent downfall that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the streets and houses thus comes the norther dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter  curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet conducted him at the lower end of it on the bank of the serpentine stream he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of the enclosing wall he entered the enclosure under the sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn many wagons and buckboards stood about with their teams harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees curly recognised the place as a wagonyard such as is provided by merchants for their outof town friends and customers no one was in sight no doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town seeing the elephant and hearing the owl in their haste to become patrons of the towns dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open  curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel so he was neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer he zigzagged his way to the first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semidarkness under the shed it was a twohorse wagon with a top of white canvas the wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks two or three great bundles of grey blankets and a number of bales bundles and boxes a reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies bound on the morrow for some outlying hacienda but to the drowsy intelligence of curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night after several unlucky efforts at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day then he became instinctively a burrowing animal and dug his way like a prairiedog down among the sacks and blankets hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den for three nights sleep had visited curly only in broken and shivering doses so now when morpheus condescended to pay him a call curly got such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that night    six cowpunchers of the cibolo ranch were waiting around the door of the ranch store their ponies cropped grass near by tied in the texas fashionwhich is not tied at all their bridle reins had been dropped to the earth which is a more effectual way of securing them such is the power of habit and imagination than you could devise out of a halfinch rope and a liveoak tree  these guardians of the cow lounged about each with a brown cigarette paper in his hand and gently but unceasingly cursed sam revell the storekeeper sam stood in the door snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras shirtsleeves and looking down affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes within a fortymile radius his offence had been serious and he was divided between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his raiment he had allowed the ranch stock of smoking to become exhausted  i thought sure there was another case of it under the counter boys he explained but it happened to be catterdges  youve sure got a case of happenedicitis said poky rodgers fency rider of

sam revell hasnt got no tobacco on hand  gregorio falcon mexican vaquero and best thrower of the rope on the cibolo pushed his heavy silverembroidered straw sombrero back upon his thicket of jet black curls and scraped the bottoms of his pockets for a few crumbs of the precious weed  ah don samuel he said reproachfully but with his touch of castilian manners escuse me dthey say dthe jackrabbeet and

can of greengage plums sam while im waitin for somethin better  open me some yellow clings ordered poky rodgers ill wait too  the tobaccoless punchers arranged themselves comfortably on the steps of the store inside sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit  the store a big white wooden building like a barn stood fifty yards from the ranchhouse beyond it were the horse corrals and still farther the wool sheds and the brushtopped shearing pensfor the rancho cibolo raised both cattle and sheep behind the store at a little distance were the grassthatched jacals of the mexicans who bestowed their allegiance upon the cibolo  the ranchhouse was composed of four large rooms with plastered adobe walls and a tworoom wooden ell a twentyfeetwide gallery circumvented the structure it was set in a grove of immense liveoaks and waterelms near a lakea long not very wide and tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall great gars leaped to the surface and plunged with the noise of hippopotamuses frolicking at their bath from the trees hung garlands and massive pendants of the melancholy grey moss of the south indeed the cibolo ranchhouse seemed more of the south than of the west it looked as if old kiowa truesdell might have brought it with him from the lowlands of mississippi when he came to texas with his rifle in the hollow of his arm in 55  but though he did not bring the family mansion truesdell did bring something in the way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone he brought one end of the truesdellcurtis family feud and when a curtis bought the rancho de los olmos sixteen miles from the cibolo there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the southwest in those days truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger cat and mexican lion and one or two curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock also he buried a brother with a curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at cibolo and then the kiowa indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the frio and the rio grande and truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave earning his sobriquet then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands and then old age and bitterness when he sat with his great mane of hair as white as the spanishdagger blossoms and his fierce paleblue eyes on the shaded gallery at cibolo growling like the pumas that he had slain he snapped his fingers at old age the bitter taste to life did not come from that the cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son ransom wanted to marry a curtis the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud    for a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers the stamping of the grazing ponies and the singing of a doleful song by sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror  from the door of the store could be seen the irregular sloping stretch of prairie to the south with its reaches of lightgreen billowy mesquite flats in the lower places and its rises crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral through the mesquite flat wound the ranch road that five miles away flowed into the old government trail to san antonio the sun was so low that the gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the greengold sea of sunshine  that evening ears were quicker than eyes  the mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin  one waggeen said he cross dthe arroyo hondo ah hear dthe wheel verree rockee place dthe hondo  youve got good ears gregorio said mustang taylor i never heard nothin but the songbird in the bush and the zephyr skallyhootin across the peaceful dell  in ten minutes taylor remarked i see the dust of a wagon risin right above the fur end of the flat  you have verree good eyes senor said gregorio smiling  two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the mesquites in twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses hoofs in five minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy  from the jacals came a cry of el amo el amo four mexican youths raced to unharness the greys the cowpunchers gave a yell of greeting and delight  ranse truesdell driving threw the reins to the ground and laughed  its under the wagon sheet boys he said i know what youre waiting for if sam lets it run out again well use those yellow shoes of his for a target theres two cases pull em out and light up i know you all want a smoke  after striking dry country ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows and thrown it over the goods in the wagon six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco  long collins tobacco messenger from the san gabriel outfit who rode with the longest stirrups west of the mississippi delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon he caught something harder than a blanket and pulled out a fearful thinga shapeless muddy bunch of leather tied together with wire and twine from its ragged end like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle protruded human toes  whoee yelled long collins ranse are you apackin around of corpuses heres ahowlin grasshoppers  up from his long slumber popped curly like some vile worm from its burrow he clawed his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable drunken owl his face was as bluishred and puffed and seamed and crosslined as the cheapest round steak of the butcher his eyes were swollen slits his nose a pickled beet his hair would have made the wildest thatch of a jackinthebox look like the satin poll of a cleo de merode the rest of him was scarecrow done to the life  ranse jumped down from his seat and looked at his strange cargo with wideopen eyes  here you maverick what are you doing in my wagon how did you get in there  the punchers gathered around in delight for the time they had forgotten tobacco  curly looked around him slowly in every direction he snarled like a scotch terrier through his ragged beard  where is this he rasped through his parched throat its a damn farm in an old field whatd you bring me here forsay did i say i wanted to come here what are you reubs rubberin athey gwan or ill punch some of yer faces  drag him out collins said ranse  curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder blades he got up and sat on the steps of the store shivering from outraged nerves hugging his knees and sneering taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and wrenched off its top six cigarettes began to glow bringing peace and forgiveness to sam  howd you come in my wagon repeated ranse this time in a voice that drew a reply  curly recognised the tone he had heard it used by freight brakemen and large persons in blue carrying clubs  me he growled oh was you talkin to me why i was on my way to the menger but my valet had forgot to pack my pyjamas so i crawled into that wagon in the wagonyardsee i never told you to bring me out to this bloomin farmsee  what is it mustang asked poky rodgers almost forgetting to smoke in his ecstasy what do it live on  its a galliwampus poky said mustang its the thing that hollers williwalloo up in ellum trees in the low grounds of nights i dont know if it bites  no it aint mustang volunteered long collins them galliwampuses has fins on their backs and eighteen toes this here is a hicklesnifter it lives under the ground and eats cherries dont stand so close to it it wipes out villages with one stroke of its prehensile tail  sam the cosmopolite who called bartenders in san antone by their first name stood in the door he was a better zoologist  well aint that a willie for your whiskers he commented whered you dig up the hobo ranse goin to make an auditorium for inbreviates out of the ranch  say said curly from whose panoplied breast all shafts of wit fell blunted any of you kiddin guys got a drink on you have your fun say ive been hittin the stuff till i dont know straight up  he turned to ranse say you shanghaied me on your dd old prairie schoonerdid i tell you to drive me to a farm i want a drink im goin all to little pieces whats doin  ranse saw that the tramps nerves were racking him he despatched one of the mexican boys to the ranchhouse for a glass of whisky curly gulped it down and into his eyes came a brief grateful glowas human as the expression in the eye of a faithful setter dog  thanky boss he said quietly  youre thirty miles from a railroad and forty miles from a saloon said ranse  curly fell back weakly against the steps  since you are here continued the ranchman come along with me we cant turn you out on the prairie a rabbit might tear you to pieces  he conducted curly to a large shed where the ranch vehicles were kept there he spread out a canvas cot and brought blankets  i dont suppose you can sleep said ranse since youve been pounding your ear for twentyfour hours but you can camp here till morning ill have pedro fetch you up some grub  sleep said curly i can sleep a week say sport have you got a coffin nail on you    fifty miles had ransom truesdell driven that day and yet this is what he did  old kiowa truesdell sat in his great wicker chair reading by the light of an immense oil lamp ranse laid a bundle of newspapers fresh from town at his elbow  back ranse said the old man looking up  son old kiowa continued ive been thinking all day about a certain matter that we have talked about i want you to tell me again ive lived for you ive fought wolves and indians and worse white men to protect you you never had any mother that you can remember ive taught you to shoot straight ride hard and live clean later on ive worked to pile up dollars thatll be yours youll be a rich man ranse when my chunk goes out ive made you ive licked you into shape like a leopard cat licks its cubs you dont belong to yourself youve got to be a truesdell first now is there to be any more nonsense about this curtis girl  ill tell you once more said ranse slowly as i am a truesdell and as you are my father ill never marry a curtis  good boy said old kiowa youd better go get some supper  ranse went to the kitchen at the rear of the house pedro the mexican cook sprang up to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove  just a cup of coffee pedro he said and drank it standing and then  theres a tramp on a cot in the wagonshed take him something to eat better make it enough for two  ranse walked out toward the jacals a boy came running  manuel can you catch vaminos in the little pasture for me  why not senor i saw him near the puerta but two hours past he bears a dragrope  get him and saddle him as quick as you can  prontito senor  soon mounted on vaminos ranse leaned in the saddle pressed with his knees and galloped eastward past the store where sat sam trying his guitar in the moonlight  vaminos shall have a wordvaminos the good dun horse the mexicans who have a hundred names for the colours of a horse called him gruyo he was a mousecoloured slatecoloured fleabitten roan dun if you can conceive it down his back from his mane to his tail went a line of black he would live forever and surveyors have not laid off as many miles in the world as he could travel in a day  eight miles east of the cibolo ranchhouse ranse loosened the pressure of his knees and vaminos stopped under a big ratama tree the yellow ratama blossoms showered fragrance that would have undone the roses of france the moon made the earth a great concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid in a glade five jackrabbits leaped and played together like kittens eight miles farther east shone a faint star that appeared to have dropped below the horizon night riders who often steered their course by it knew it to be the light in the rancho de los olmos  in ten minutes yenna curtis galloped to the tree on her sorrel pony dancer the two leaned and clasped hands heartily  i ought to have ridden nearer your home said ranse but you never will let me  yenna laughed and in the soft light you could see her strong white teeth and fearless eyes no sentimentality there in spite of the moonlight the odour of the ratamas and the admirable figure of ranse truesdell the lover but she was there eight miles from her home to meet him  how often have i told you ranse she said that i am your halfway girl always halfway  well said ranse with a question in his tones  i did said yenna with almost a sigh i told him after dinner when i thought he would be in a good humour did you ever wake up a lion ranse with the mistaken idea that he would be a kitten he almost tore the ranch to pieces its all up i love my daddy ranse and im afraidim afraid of him too he ordered me to promise that id never marry a truesdell i promised thats all what luck did you have  the same said ranse slowly i promised him that his son would never marry a curtis somehow i couldnt go against him hes mighty old im sorry yenna  the girl leaned in her saddle and laid one hand on ranses on the horn of his saddle  i never thought id like you better for giving me up she said ardently but i do i must ride back now ranse i slipped out of the house and saddled dancer myself goodnight neighbour  goodnight said ranse ride carefully over them badger holes  they wheeled and rode away in opposite directions yenna turned in her saddle and called clearly  dont forget im your halfway girl ranse  damn all family feuds and inherited scraps muttered ranse vindictively to the breeze as he rode back to the cibolo  ranse turned his horse into the small pasture and went to his own room he opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to mississippi for a visit the drawer stuck and he yanked at it savagelyas a man will it came out of the bureau and bruised both his shinsas a drawer will an old folded yellow letter without an envelope fell from somewhereprobably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers ranse took it to the lamp and read it curiously  then he took his hat and walked to one of the mexican jacals  tia juana he said i would like to talk with you a while  an old old mexican woman whitehaired and wonderfully wrinkled rose from a stool  sit down said ranse removing his hat and taking the one chair in the jacal who am i tia juana he asked speaking spanish  don ransom our good friend and employer why do you ask answered the old woman wonderingly  tia juana who am i he repeated with his stern eyes looking into hers  a frightened look came in the old womans face she fumbled with her black shawl  who am i tia juana said ranse once more  thirtytwo years i have lived on the rancho cibolo said tia juana i thought to be buried under the coma mott beyond the garden before these things should be known close the door don ransom and i will speak i see in your face that you know  an hour ranse spent behind tia juanas closed door as he was on his way back to the house curly called to him from the wagonshed  the tramp sat on his cot swinging his feet and smoking  say sport he grumbled this is no way to treat a man after kidnappin him i went up to the store and borrowed a razor from that fresh guy and had a shave but that aint all a man needs saycant you loosen up for about three fingers more of that booze i never asked you to bring me to your dd farm  stand up out here in the light said ranse looking at him closely  curly got up sullenly and took a step or two  his face now shaven smooth seemed transformed his hair had been combed and it fell back from the right side of his forehead with a peculiar wave the moonlight charitably softened the ravages of drink and his aquiline wellshaped nose and small square cleft chin almost gave distinction to his looks  ranse sat on the foot of the cot and looked at him curiously  where did you come fromhave you got any home or folks anywhere  me why im a dook said curly im sir reginaldoh cheese it no i dont know anything about my ancestors ive been a tramp ever since i can remember say old pal are you going to set em up again tonight or not  you answer my questions and maybe i will how did you come to be a tramp  me answered curly why i adopted that profession when i was an infant case of had to first thing i can remember i belonged to a big lazy hobo called beefsteak charley he sent me around to houses to beg i wasnt hardly big enough to reach the latch of a gate  did he ever tell you how he got you asked ranse  once when he was sober he said he bought me for an old sixshooter and six bits from a band of drunken mexican sheepshearers but whats the diff thats all i know  all right said ranse i reckon youre a maverick for certain im going to put the rancho cibolo brand on you ill start you to work in one of the camps tomorrow  work sniffed curly disdainfully what do you take me for do you think id chase cows and hopskipandjump around after crazy sheep like that pink and yellow guy at the store says these reubs do forget it  oh youll like it when you get used to it said ranse yes ill send you up one more drink by pedro i think youll make a firstclass cowpuncher before i get through with you  me said curly i pity the cows you set me to chaperon they can go chase themselves dont forget my nightcap please boss  ranse paid a visit to the store before going to the house sam rivell was taking off his tan shoes regretting and preparing for bed  any of the boys from the san gabriel camp riding in early in the morning asked ranse  long collins said sam briefly for the mail  tell him said ranse to take that tramp out to camp with him and keep him till i get there  curly was sitting on his blankets in the san gabriel camp cursing talentedly when ranse truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon the cowpunchers were ignoring the stray he was grimy with dust and black dirt his clothes were making their last stand in favour of the conventions  ranse went up to buck rabb the camp boss and spoke briefly  hes a plumb buzzard said buck he wont work and hes the low downest passel of inhumanity i ever see i didnt know what you wanted done with him ranse so i just let him set that seems to suit him hes been condemned to death by the boys a dozen times but i told em maybe you was savin him for the torture  ranse took off his coat  ive got a hard job before me buck i reckon but it has to be done ive got to make a man out of that thing thats what ive come to camp for  he went up to curly  brother he said dont you think if you had a bath it would allow you to take a seat in the company of your fellowman with less injustice to the atmosphere  run away farmer said curly sardonically willie will send for nursey when he feels like having his tub  the charco or water hole was twelve yards away ranse took one of curlys ankles and dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the brink then with the strength and sleight of a hammerthrow he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake  curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise  ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands  go to the other end of the lake and use this he said buck will give you some dry clothes at the wagon  the tramp obeyed without protest by the time supper was ready he had returned to camp he was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown duck clothes ranse observed him out of the corner of his eye  lordy i hope he aint a coward he was saying to himself i hope he wont turn out to be a coward  his doubts were soon allayed curly walked straight to where he stood his lightblue eyes were blazing  now im clean he said meaningly maybe youll talk to me think youve got a picnic here do you you clodhoppers think you can run over a man because you know he cant get away all right now what do you think of that  curly planted a stinging slap against ranses left cheek the print of his hand stood out a dull red against the tan  ranse smiled happily  the cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed  somewhere in his restless tour of the cities curly had acquired the art of selfdefence the ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and equilibrium of perfect health and the endurance conferred by decent living the two attributes nearly matched there were no formal rounds at last the fibre of the clean liver prevailed the last time curly went down from one of the ranchmans awkward but powerful blows he remained on the grass but looking up with an unquenched eye  ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in the stream from the faucet  on his face was a grin of satisfaction  much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the details of the curriculum of reclamation through which ranse put his waif during the month that he spent in the san gabriel camp the ranchman had no fine theories to work outperhaps his whole stock of pedagogy embraced only a knowledge of horsebreaking and a belief in heredity  the cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the strange animal that he had sent among them and they tacitly organised themselves into a faculty of assistants but their system was their own  curlys first lesson stuck he became on friendly and then on intimate terms with soap and water and the thing that pleased ranse most was that his subject held his ground at each successive higher step but the steps were sometimes far apart  once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for rattlesnake bites and spent sixteen hours on the grass magnificently drunk but when he staggered to his feet his first move was to find his soap and towel and start for the charco and once when a treat came from the ranch in the form of a basket of fresh tomatoes and young onions curly devoured the entire consignment before the punchers reached the camp at supper time  and then the punchers punished him in their own way for three days they did not speak to him except to reply to his own questions or remarks and they spoke with absolute and unfailing politeness they played tricks on one another they pounded one another hurtfully and affectionately they heaped upon one anothers heads friendly curses and obloquy but they were polite to curly he saw it and it stung him as much as ranse hoped it would  then came a night that brought a cold wet norther wilson the youngest of the outfit had lain in camp two days ill with fever when joe got up at daylight to begin breakfast he found curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the grub wagon with only a saddle blanket around him while curlys blankets were stretched over wilson to protect him from the rain and wind  three nights after that curly rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep then the other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations ranse saw long collins tie a rope to the horn of a saddle others were getting out their sixshooters  boys said ranse im much obliged i was hoping you would but i didnt like to ask  half a dozen sixshooters began to popawful yells rent the airlong collins galloped wildly across curlys bed dragging the saddle after him that was merely their way of gently awaking their victim then they hazed him for an hour carefully and ridiculously after the code of cow camps whenever he uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of blankets and thrashed him woefully with a pair of leather leggings  and all this meant that curly had won his spurs that he was receiving the punchers accolade nevermore would they be polite to him but he would be their pardner and stirrupbrother foot to foot  when the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on joes big coffee pot by the fire for a java nightcap ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if he understood and was worthy curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it long collins followed and sat by his side buck rabb went and sat at the other curlygrinned  and then ranse furnished curly with mounts and saddle and equipment and turned him over to buck rabb instructing him to finish the job  three weeks later ranse rode from the ranch into rabbs camp which was then in snake valley the boys were saddling for the days ride he sought out long collins among them  how about that bronco he asked  long collins grinned  reach out your hand ranse truesdell he said and youll touch him and you can shake hisn too if you like for hes plumb white and theres none better in no camp  ranse looked again at the clearfaced bronzed smiling cowpuncher who stood at collinss side could that be curly he held out his hand and curly grasped it with the muscles of a broncobuster  i want you at the ranch said ranse  all right sport said curly heartily but i want to come back again say pal this is a dandy farm and i dont want any better fun than hustlin cows with this bunch of guys theyre all to the merry merry  at the cibolo ranchhouse they dismounted ranse bade curly wait at the door of the living room he walked inside old kiowa truesdell was reading at a table  goodmorning mr truesdell said ranse  the old man turned his white head quickly  how is this he began why do you call me mr  when he looked at ranses face he stopped and the hand that held his newspaper shook slightly  boy he said slowly how did you find it out  its all right said ranse with a smile i made tia juana tell me it was kind of by accident but its all right  youve been like a son to me said old kiowa trembling  tia juana told me all about it said ranse she told me how you adopted me when i was kneehigh to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors that was bound west and she told me how the kidyour own kid you knowgot lost or was run away with and she said it was the same day that the sheepshearers got on a bender and left the ranch  our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old said the old man and then along came those emigrant wagons with a youngster they didnt want and we took you i never intended you to know ranse we never heard of our boy again  hes right outside unless im mighty mistaken said ranse opening the door and beckoning  curly walked in  no one could have doubted the old man and the young had the same sweep of hair the same nose chin line of face and prominent light blue eyes  old kiowa rose eagerly  curly looked about the room curiously a puzzled expression came over his face he pointed to the wall opposite  wheres the ticktock he asked absentmindedly  the clock cried old kiowa loudly the eightday clock used to stand there why  he turned to ranse but ranse was not there  already a hundred yards away vaminos the good fleabitten dun was bearing him eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral towards the rancho de los olmos    x  cupid a la carte  the dispositions of woman said jeff peters after various opinions on the subject had been advanced run regular to diversions what a woman wants is what youre out of she wants more of a thing when its scarce she likes to have souvenirs of things that never happened she likes to be reminded of things she never heard of a onesided view of objects is disjointing to the female composition  tis a misfortune of mine begotten by nature and travel continued jeff looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove to look deeper into some subjects than most people do ive breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the united states ive held em spellbound with music oratory sleight of hand and prevarications while ive sold em jewelry medicine soap hair tonic and junk of other nominations and during my travels as a matter of recreation and expiation ive taken cognisance some of women it takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular woman but if he puts in say ten years industrious and curious he can acquire the general rudiments of the sex one lesson i picked up was when i was working the west with a line of brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from savannah down through the cotton belt with dalbys antiexplosive lamp oil powder twas when the oklahoma country was in first bloom guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of selfraising dough it was a boom town of the regular kindyou stood in line to get a chance to wash your face if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the next morning  by nature and doctrines i am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed so i looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard i found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the boom they had knocked together a box house where they lived and did the cooking and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side that tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the worldworn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pickme up hotels try mothers homemade biscuits whats the matter with our apple dumplings and hard sauce hot cakes and maple syrup like you ate when a boy our fried chicken never was heard to crow there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man i said to myself that mothers wandering boy should munch there that night and so it came to pass and there is where i contracted my case of mame dugan  old man dugan was six feet by one of indiana loafer and he spent his time sitting on his shoulder blades in a rockingchair in the shanty memorialising the great corncrop failure of 96 ma dugan did the cooking and mame waited on the table  as soon as i saw mame i knew there was a mistake in the census reports there wasnt but one girl in the united states when you come to specifications it isnt easy she was about the size of an angel and she had eyes and ways about her when you come to the kind of a girl she was youll find a belt of em reaching from the brooklyn bridge west as far as the courthouse in council bluffs ia they earn their own living in stores restaurants factories and offices theyre chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy and they look life straight in the eye theyve met man face to face and discovered that hes a poor creature theyve dropped to it that the reports in the seaside library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation  mame was that sort she was full of life and fun and breezy she passed the repartee with the boarders quick as a wink youd have smothered laughing i am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection i am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines so youll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward mame  pretty soon i got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times when there wasnt so many around mame would sail in with a smile in a black dress and white apron and say hello jeff why dont you come at mealtime want to see how much trouble you can be of course friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpieand so on she called me jeff but there was no significations attached designations was all she meant the front names of any of us she used as they came to hand id eat about two meals before i left and string em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives and josh one another festively between bites mame stood for it pleasant for it wasnt up to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times  it wasnt long until there was another fellow named ed collier got the betweenmeals affliction and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper that made a threeringed circus of that tent and mames turn as waiter a continuous performance that collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings he was in wellboring or insurance or claimjumping or somethingive forgotten which he was a man well lubricated with gentility and his words were such as recommended you to his point of view so collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity mame was level full of impartiality twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favoursone to collier and one to me and one to the board and not a card up her sleeve  me and collier naturally got acquainted and gravitated together some on the outside divested of his stratagems he seemed to be a pleasant chap full of an amiable sort of hostility  i notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled says i to him one day to draw his conclusions  well yes says collier reflecting the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my sensitive nerves  it exasperates mine some too says i nice little girl dont you think  i see says collier laughing well now that you mention it i have noticed that she doesnt seem to displease the optic nerve  shes a joy to mine says i and im going after her notice is hereby served  ill be as candid as you admits collier and if the drug stores dont run out of pepsin ill give you a run for your money thatll leave you a dyspeptic at the windup  so collier and me begins the race the grub department lays in new supplies mame waits on us jolly and kind and agreeable and it looks like an even break with cupid and the cook working overtime in dugans restaurant  twas one night in september when i got mame to take a walk after supper when the things were all cleared away we strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the edge of town such opportunities was seldom so i spoke my piece explaining how the brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the happiness of two and that both of em together couldnt equal the light from somebodys eyes and that the name of dugan should be changed to peters or reasons why not would be in order  mame didnt say anything right away directly she gave a kind of shudder and i began to learn something  jeff she says im sorry you spoke i like you as well as any of them but there isnt a man in the world id ever marry and there never will be do you know what a man is in my eye hes a tomb hes a sarcophagus for the interment of beafsteakporkchopslivernbaconham andeggs hes that and nothing more for two years ive watched men eat eat eat until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds theyre absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and plate at the table theyre fixed that way in my mind and memory ive tried to overcome it but i cant ive heard girls rave about their sweethearts but i never could understand it a man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments i went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about i got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare medium or well done and his eggs over or straight up that was all no jeff ill marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat and come back to dinner and eat and happen in again at supper to eat eat eat  but mame says i itll wear off youve had too much of it youll marry some time of course men dont eat always  as far as my observation goes they do no ill tell you what im going to do mame turns sudden to animation and bright eyes theres a girl named susie foster in terre haute a chum of mine she waits in the railroad eating house there i worked two years in a restaurant in that town susie has it worse than i do because the men who eat at railroad stations gobble they try to flirt and gobble at the same time whew susie and i have it all planned out were saving our money and when we get enough were going to buy a little cottage and five acres we know of and live together and grow violets for the eastern market a man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch  dont girls ever i commenced but mame heads me off sharp  no they dont they nibble a little bit sometimes thats all  i thought the confect  for goodness sake change the subject says mame  as i said before that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever struggles after deceptions and illusions take englandbeef made her wieners elevated germany uncle sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie but the young ladies of the shetalkyou schools theyll never believe it shakespeare they allow and rubinstein and the rough riders is what did the trick  twas a situation calculated to disturb i couldnt bear to give up mame and yet it pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating i had acquired the habit too early for twentyseven years i had been blindly rushing upon my fate yielding to the insidious lures of that deadly monster food it was too late i was a ruminant biped for keeps it was lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it  i continued to board at the dugan tent hoping that mame would relent i had sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square meal it might in time overcome the presence of one i went on ministering to my fatal vice although i felt that each time i shoved a potato into my mouth in mames presence i might be burying my fondest hopes  i think collier must have spoken to mame and got the same answer for one day he orders a cup of coffee and a cracker and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour thats filled up in the kitchen previous on cold roast and fried cabbage i caught on and did the same and maybe we thought wed made a hit the next day we tried it again and out comes old man dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands  kinder off yer feed aint ye gents he asks fatherly and some sardonic thought id spell mame a bit seein the work was light and my rheumatiz can stand the strain  so back me and collier had to drop to the heavy grub again i noticed about that time that i was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite i ate until mame must have hated to see me darken the door afterward i found out that i had been made the victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by ed collier him and me had been taking drinks together uptown regular trying to drown our thirst for food that man had bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of appletrees anaconda appetite bitters in every one of my drinks but the last trick he played me was hardest to forget  one day collier failed to show up at the tent a man told me he left town that morning my only rival now was the bill of fare a few days before he left collier had presented me with a twogallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from kentucky i now have reason to believe that it contained appletrees anaconda appetite bitters almost exclusively i continued to devour tons of provisions in mames eyes i remained a mere biped more ruminant than ever  about a week after collier pulled his freight there came a kind of sideshow to town and hoisted a tent near the railroad i judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity business i called to see mame one night and ma dugan said that she and thomas her younger brother had gone to the show that same thing happened for three nights that week saturday night i caught her on the way coming back and got to sit on the steps a while and talk to her i noticed she looked different her eyes were softer and shiny like instead of a mame dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets she seemed to be a mame more in line as god intended her approachable and suited to bask in the light of the brazilians and the kindler  you seem to be right smart inveigled says i with the unparalleled exhibition of the worlds living curiosities and wonders  its a change says mame  youll need another says i if you keep on going every night  dont be cross jeff says she it takes my mind off business  dont the curiosities eat i ask  not all of them some of them are wax  look out then that you dont get stuck says i kind of flip and foolish  mame blushed i didnt know what to think about her my hopes raised some that perhaps my attentions had palliated mans awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment into his system she talked some about the stars referring to them with respect and politeness and i drivelled a quantity about united hearts homes made bright by true affection and the kindler mame listened without scorn and i says to myself jeff old man youre removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals youre setting your heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl  monday night i drop around mame is at the unparalleled exhibition with thomas  now may the curse of the fortyone sevensided sea cooks says i and the bad luck of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this selfsame sideshow at once and forever more amen ill go to see it myself tomorrow night and investigate its baleful charm shall man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork and then by a tencent circus  the next night before starting out for the exhibition tent i inquire and find out that mame is not at home she is not at the circus with thomas this time for thomas waylays me in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before i had time to eat supper  whatll you give me jeff says he if i tell you something  the value of it son i says  sis is stuck on a freak says thomas one of the sideshow freaks i dont like him she does i overheard em talking thought maybe youd like to know say jeff does it put you wise two dollars worth theres a target rifle up town that  i frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into thomass hat the information was of the piledriver system of news and it telescoped my intellects for a while while i was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside and suffering disturbances internally i was saying idiotically and pleasantly  thank you thomasthank youera freak you said thomas now could you make out the monstrositys entitlements a little clearer if you please thomas  this is the fellow says thomas pulling out a yellow handbill from his pocket and shoving it under my nose hes the champion faster of the universe i guess thats why sis got soft on him he dont eat nothing hes going to fast fortynine days this is the sixth thats him  i looked at the name thomas pointed outprofessor eduardo collieri ah says i in admiration thats not so bad ed collier i give you credit for the trick but i dont give you the girl until shes mrs freak  i hit the sod in the direction of the show i came up to the rear of the tent and as i did so a man wiggled out like a snake from under the bottom of the canvas scrambled to his feet and ran into me like a locoed bronco i gathered him by the neck and investigated him by the light of the stars it is professor eduardo collieri in human habiliments with a desperate look in one eye and impatience in the other  hello curiosity says i get still a minute and lets have a look at your freakship how do you like being the willopuswallopus or the bimbam from borneo or whatever name you are denounced by in the sideshow business  jeff peters says collier in a weak voice turn me loose or ill slug you one im in the extremest kind of a large hurry hands off  tut tut eddie i answers holding him hard let an old friend gaze on the exhibition of your curiousness its an eminent graft you fell onto my son but dont speak of assaults and battery because youre not fit the best youve got is a lot of nerve and a mighty empty stomach and so it was the man was as weak as a vegetarian cat  id argue this case with you jeff says he regretful in his style for an unlimited number of rounds if i had half an hour to train in and a slab of beefsteak two feet square to train with curse the man i say that invented the art of going foodless may his soul in eternity be chained up within two feet of a bottomless pit of red hot hash im abandoning the conflict jeff im deserting to the enemy youll find miss dugan inside contemplating the only living mummy and the informed hog shes a fine girl jeff id have beat you out if i could have kept up the grubless habit a little while longer youll have to admit that the fasting dodge was acesup for a while i figured it out that way but say jeff its said that love makes the world go around let me tell you the announcement lacks verification its the wind from the dinner horn that does it i love that mame dugan ive gone six days without food in order to coincide with her sentiments only one bite did i have that was when i knocked the tattooed man down with a war club and got a sandwich he was gobbling the manager fined me all my salary but salary wasnt what i was after twas that girl id give my life for her but id endanger my immortal soul for a beef stew hunger is a horrible thing jeff love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a mans starving  in such language ed collier discoursed to me pathetic i gathered the diagnosis that his affections and his digestions had been implicated in a scramble and the commissary had won out i never disliked ed collier i searched my internal admonitions of suitable etiquette to see if i could find a remark of a consoling nature but there was none convenient  id be glad now says ed if youll let me go ive been hard hit but ill hit the ration supply harder im going to clean out every restaurant in town im going to wade waist deep in sirloins and swim in ham and eggs its an awful thing jeff peters for a man to come to this passto give up his girl for something to eatits worse than that man esau that swapped his copyright for a partridge but then hungers a fierce thing youll excuse me now jeff for i smell a pervasion of ham frying in the distance and my legs are crying out to stampede in that direction  a hearty meal to you ed collier i says to him and no hard feelings for myself i am projected to be an unseldom eater and i have condolence for your predicaments  there was a sudden big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze and the champion faster gives a snort and gallops off in the dark toward fodder  i wish some of the cultured outfit that are always advertising the extenuating circumstances of love and romance had been there to see there was ed collier a fine man full of contrivances and flirtations abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into the contiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at the bestpaying element of fiction an empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart  i was naturally anxious to know how far mame was infatuated with collier and his stratagems i went inside the unparalleled exhibition and there she was she looked surprised to see me but unguilty  its an elegant evening outside says i the coolness is quite nice and gratifying and the stars are lined out first class up where they belong wouldnt you shake these byproducts of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life  mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant  oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town  you mean ed collier says mame  i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when ones ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeenyear locust of himself  mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections  jeff says she it isnt quite like you to talk that way i dont care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they dont look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me id be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didnt feel kindly toward him could you do what he did  i know says i seeing the point im condemned i cant help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the fryingpan i guess im the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little  ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did youno marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake  wasnt you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasnt there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity  all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant youre short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a fortynine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe ill answer it  so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didnt seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie  i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame goodbye i wasnt abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame  what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a weeks visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south  that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didnt seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation  i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was falling in large wet bunches down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small knoll of high ground the bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded all around it it seemed to be a melancholy little house and you felt sorry for it twas that house for the night the way i reasoned it i explained to mame and she leaves it to me to decide she doesnt become galvanic and prosecuting as most women would but she says its all right she knows i didnt mean to do it  we found the house was deserted it had two empty rooms there was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept in a loft of it was a lot of old hay i put my horses in there and gave them some of it for which they looked at me sorrowful expecting apologies the rest of the hay i carried into the house by armfuls with a view to accommodations i also brought in the patent kindler and the brazilians neither of which are guaranteed against the action of water  mame and i sat on the wagon seats on the floor and i lit a lot of the kindler on the hearth for the night was chilly if i was any judge that girl enjoyed it it was a change for her it gave her a different point of view she laughed and talked and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes i had a pocketful of cigars and as far as i was concerned there had never been any fall of man we were at the same old stand in the garden of eden out there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of zion and the angel with the flaming sword had not yet put up the keepoffthegrass sign i opened up a gross or two of the brazilians and made mame put them onrings brooches necklaces eardrops bracelets girdles and lockets she flashed and sparkled like a milliondollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a lookingglass  when it got late i made a fine bunk on the floor for mame with the hay and my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon and persuaded her to lie down i sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral  i must have dozed a little while before morning for my eyes were shut and when i opened them it was daylight and there stood mame with her hair all done up neat and correct and her eyes bright with admiration of existence  gee whiz jeff she exclaims but im hungry i could eat a  i looked up and caught her eye her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of suspicion then i laughed and laid down on the floor to laugh easier it seemed funny to me by nature and geniality i am a hearty laugher and i went the limit when i came to mame was sitting with her back to me all contaminated with dignity  dont be angry mame i says for i couldnt help it its the funny way youve done up your hair if you could only see it  you neednt tell stories sir said mame cool and advised my hair is all right i know what you were laughing about why jeff look outside she winds up peeping through a chink between the logs i opened the little wooden window and looked out the entire river bottom was flooded and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide and it was still raining hard all we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch  i am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day i was aware that mame was getting a too prolonged onesided view of things again but i had no way to change it personally i was wrapped up in the desire to eat i had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham and i kept saying to myself all the time whatll you have to eat jeffwhatll you order now old man when the waiter comes i picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare and imagines them coming i guess its that way with all hungry men they cant get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat it shows that the little table with the brokenlegged caster and the imitation worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue after all instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations  i sat there musing along arguing with myself quite heated as to how id have my steakwith mushrooms or a la creole mame was on the other seat pensive her head leaning on her hand let the potatoes come homefried i states in my mind and brown the hash in the pan with nine poached eggs on the side i felt careful in my own pockets to see if i could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn  night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling i looked at mame and i noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an icecream lair i knew that poor girl was hungrymaybe for the first time in her life there was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back  it was about eleven oclock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all  they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a mans starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death theyd have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but theyd compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions  i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six softscrambled on toast  mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden  medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldnt it be glorious and then id like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and  go easy i interrupts wheres the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and  oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and  keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and dont forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the crossbarred dewberry pie  yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before  the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the mud some precarious until we found the road again we were only a few miles wrong and in two hours we were in oklahoma city the first thing we saw was a big restaurant sign and we piled into there in a hurry here i finds myself sitting with mame at table with knives and forks and plates between us and she not scornful but smiling with starvation and sweetness  twas a new restaurant and well stocked i designated a list of quotations from the bill of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be coming  there we were and there was the order being served twas a banquet for a dozen but we felt like a dozen i looked across the table at mame and smiled for i had recollections mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stemwinder then she looked at me straight in the face and two big tears came in her eyes the waiter was gone after more grub  jeff she says soft like ive been a foolish girl ive looked at things from the wrong side i never felt this way before men get hungry every day like this dont they theyre big and strong and they do the hard work of the world and they dont eat just to spite silly waiter girls in restaurants do they jeff you said oncethat is you asked meyou wanted me towell jeff if you still careid be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the table from me now give me something to eat quick please  so as ive said a woman needs to change her point of view now and then they get tired of the same old sightsthe same old dinner table washtub and sewing machine give em a touch of the variousa little travel and a little rest a little tomfoolery along with the tragedies of keeping house a little petting after the blowingup a little upsetting and a little jostling aroundand everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play    xi  the caballeros way  the cisco kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages had murdered twice as many mostly mexicans and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count therefore a woman loved him  the kid was twentyfive looked twenty and a careful insurance company would have estimated the probable time of his demise at say twentysix his habitat was anywhere between the frio and the rio grande he killed for the love of itbecause he was quicktempered to avoid arrestfor his own amusementany reason that came to his mind would suffice he had escaped capture because he could shoot fivesixths of a second sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service and because he rode a speckled roan horse that knew every cowpath in the mesquite and pear thickets from san antonio to matamoras  tonia perez the girl who loved the cisco kid was half carmen half madonna and the restoh yes a woman who is half carmen and half madonna can always be something morethe rest let us say was hummingbird she lived in a grassroofed jacal near a little mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio with her lived a father or grandfather a lineal aztec somewhat less than a thousand years old who herded a hundred goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal back of the jacal a tremendous forest of bristling pear twenty feet high at its worst crowded almost to its door it was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring the kid to see his girl and once clinging like a lizard to the ridgepole high up under the peaked grass roof he had heard tonia with her madonna face and carmen beauty and hummingbird soul parley with the sheriffs posse denying knowledge of her man in her soft melange of spanish and english  one day the adjutantgeneral of the state who is ex offico commander of the ranger forces wrote some sarcastic lines to captain duval of company x stationed at laredo relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the said captains territory  the captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan and forwarded the letter after adding a few comments per ranger private bill adamson to ranger lieutenant sandridge camped at a water hole on the nueces with a squad of five men in preservation of law and order  lieutenant sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary strawberry complexion tucked the letter in his hip pocket and chewed off the ends of his gamboge moustache  the next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio twenty miles away  six feet two blond as a viking quiet as a deacon dangerous as a machine gun sandridge moved among the jacales patiently seeking news of the cisco kid  far more than the law the mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the lone rider that the ranger sought it had been one of the kids pastimes to shoot mexicans to see them kick if he demanded from them moribund terpsichorean feats simply that he might be entertained what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should they anger him one and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders filling the air with quien sabes and denials of the kids acquaintance  but there was a man named fink who kept a store at the crossinga man of many nationalities tongues interests and ways of thinking  no use to ask them mexicans he said to sandridge theyre afraid to tell this hombre they call the kidgoodall is his name aint ithes been in my store once or twice i have an idea you might run across him atbut i guess i dont keer to say myself im two seconds later in pulling a gun than i used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kids got a halfmexican girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear maybe sheno i dont suppose she would but that jacal would be a good place to watch anyway  sandridge rode down to the jacal of perez the sun was low and the broad shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass thatched hut the goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by a few kids walked the top of it nibbling the chaparral leaves the old mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass already in a stupor from his mescal and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and pizarro touched glasses to their new world fortunesso old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be and in the door of the jacal stood tonia and lieutenant sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at a sailorman  the cisco kid was a vain person as all eminent and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been looming large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him  never before had tonia seen such a man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and bloodred tissue and clear weather he seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his achievements was a stripling no larger than herself with black straight hair and a cold marble face that chilled the noonday  as for tonia though she sends description to the poorhouse let her make a millionaire of your fancy her blueblack hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the gitanas of the basque province as for the hummingbird part of her that dwelt in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird  the newly lighted sungod asked for a drink of water tonia brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations  i play no spy nor do i assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but i assert by the chroniclers right that before a quarter of an hour had sped sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a sixstrand rawhide stakerope and tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little crippled chivo that she fed from a bottle she would be very very lonely indeed  which leads to a suspicion that the kids fences needed repairing and that the adjutantgenerals sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil  in his camp by the water hole lieutenant sandridge announced and reiterated his intention of either causing the cisco kid to nibble the black loam of the frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury that sounded businesslike twice a week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the frio and directed tonias slim slightly lemontinted fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata a sixstrand plait is hard to learn and easy to teach  the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his armament ready and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal thus he might bring down the kite and the hummingbird with one stone  while the sunnyhaired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the cisco kid was also attending to his professional duties he moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on quintana creek killed the town marshal plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away morose and unsatisfied no true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an oldstyle 38 bulldog  on his way the kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when wrongdoing loses its keen edge of delight he yearned for the woman he loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion he wanted tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle  the kid turned the speckled roans head up the tenmile pear flat that stretches along the arroyo hondo until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the frio the roan whickered for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a beltline streetcar horse and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a fortyfoot stakerope while ulysses rested his head in circes strawroofed hut  more weird and lonesome than the journey of an amazonian explorer is the ride of one through a texas pear flat with dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks and fat bristly hands to encumber the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey greenness it warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and inviting paths only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spinedefended bottoms of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass whirling in his head  to be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about  but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting circling tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out the good roan lessened the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made  while they fared the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was a singleminded man of conventional ideas he had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was a conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words    dont you monkey with my lulu girl   or ill tell you what ill do  and so on the roan was inured to it and did not mind  but even the poorest singer will after a certain time gain his own consent to refrain from contributing to the worlds noises so the kid by the time he was within a mile or two of tonias jacal had reluctantly allowed his song to die awaynot because his vocal performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary  as though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the pear was thinner he caught sight of the grass roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo a few yards farther the kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings then he dismounted dropped the roans reins and proceeded on foot stooping and silent like an indian the roan knowing his part stood still making no sound  the kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus  ten yards from his hidingplace in the shade of the jacal sat his tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat so far she might surely escape condemnation women have been known from time to time to engage in more mischievous occupations but if all must be told there is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall redandyellow man and that his arm was about her guiding her nimble fingers that required so many lessons at the intricate six strand plait  sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar a gun scabbard will make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six shooter suddenly but the sound was not repeated and tonias fingers needed close attention  and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid  remember then said tonia you must not come again until i send for you soon he will be here a vaquero at the tienda said today he saw him on the guadalupe three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until i send you the word  all right said the stranger and then what  and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you  he aint a man to surrender thats sure said sandridge its kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid  he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape  you used to think right much of him said sandridge  tonia dropped the lariat twisted herself around and curved a lemon tinted arm over the rangers shoulder  but then she murmured in liquid spanish i had not beheld thee thou great red mountain of a man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then i will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me  how can i know when he comes asked sandridge  when he comes said tonia he remains two days sometimes three gregorio the small son of old luisa the lavendera has a swift pony i will write a letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by gregorio will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the rattlesnake is not quicker to strike than is el chivato as they call him to send a ball from his pistola  the kids handy with his gun sure enough admitted sandridge but when i come for him i shall come alone ill get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid arrives and ill do the rest  i will send you the message by the boy gregorio said the girl i knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could i ever have thought i cared for him  it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of tonia with one arm high from the earth for a parting salute the drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the jacal where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot rose straight as a plumbline above the claydaubed chimney no sound or movement disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away  when the form of sandridge had disappeared loping his big dun down the steep banks of the frio crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come  but not far he stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an hour had passed and then tonia heard the high untrue notes of his unmusical singing coming nearer and nearer and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet him  the kid seldom smiled but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her he dismounted and his girl sprang into his arms the kid looked at her fondly his thick black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat the meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask  hows my girl he asked holding her close  sick of waiting so long for you dear one she answered my eyes are dim with always gazing into that devils pincushion through which you come and i can see into it such a little way too but you are here beloved one and i will not scold que mal muchacho not to come to see your alma more often go in and rest and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope there is cool water in the jar for you  the kid kissed her affectionately  not if the court knows itself do i let a lady stake my horse for me said he but if youll run in chica and throw a pot of coffee together while i attend to the caballo ill be a good deal obliged  besides his marksmanship the kid had another attribute for which he admired himself greatly he was muy caballero as the mexicans express it where the ladies were concerned for them he had always gentle words and consideration he could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman he might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers but he could not have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about mr kid one shouldnt believe everything one heard they said when confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the caballeros deeds of infamy they said maybe he had been driven to it and that he knew how to treat a lady anyhow  considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the kid and the pride he took in it one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding place in the pear that afternoon at least as to one of the actors must have been obscured by difficulties and yet one could not think of the kid overlooking little matters of that kind  at the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of frijoles goat steaks canned peaches and coffee by the light of a lantern in the jacal afterward the ancestor his flock corralled smoked a cigarette and became a mummy in a grey blanket tonia washed the few dishes while the kid dried them with the floursacking towel her eyes shone she chatted volubly of the inconsequent happenings of her small world since the kids last visit it was as all his other homecomings had been  then outside tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad canciones de amor  do you love me just the same old girl asked the kid hunting for his cigarette papers  always the same little one said tonia her dark eyes lingering upon him  i must go over to finks said the kid rising for some tobacco i thought i had another sack in my coat ill be back in a quarter of an hour  hasten said tonia and tell mehow long shall i call you my own this time will you be gone again tomorrow leaving me to grieve or will you be longer with your tonia  oh i might stay two or three days this trip said the kid yawning ive been on the dodge for a month and id like to rest up  he was gone half an hour for his tobacco when he returned tonia was still lying in the hammock  its funny said the kid how i feel i feel like there was somebody lying behind every bush and tree waiting to shoot me i never had mullygrubs like them before maybe its one of them presumptions ive got half a notion to light out in the morning before day the guadalupe country is burning up about that old dutchman i plugged down there  you are not afraidno one could make my brave little one fear  well i havent been usually regarded as a jackrabbit when it comes to scrapping but i dont want a posse smoking me out when im in your jacal somebody might get hurt that oughtnt to  remain with your tonia no one will find you here  the kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward the dim lights of the mexican village  ill see how it looks later on was his decision    at midnight a horseman rode into the rangers camp blazing his way by noisy halloes to indicate a pacific mission sandridge and one or two others turned out to investigate the row the rider announced himself to be domingo sales from the lone wolf crossing he bore a letter for senor sandridge old luisa the lavendera had persuaded him to bring it he said her son gregorio being too ill of a fever to ride  sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter these were its words    dear one he has come hardly had you ridden away when he came   out of the pear when he first talked he said he would stay three   days or more then as it grew later he was like a wolf or a fox   and walked about without rest looking and listening soon he said   he must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest and   then he seemed to suspect that i be not true to him he looked at   me so strange that i am frightened i swear to him that i love   him his own tonia last of all he said i must prove to him i am   true he thinks that even now men are waiting to kill him as he   rides from my house to escape he says he will dress in my   clothes my red skirt and the blue waist i wear and the brown   mantilla over the head and thus ride away but before that he   says that i must put on his clothes his pantalones and camisa   and hat and ride away on his horse from the jacal as far as the   big road beyond the crossing and back again this before he goes   so he can tell if i am true and if men are hidden to shoot him it   is a terrible thing an hour before daybreak this is to be come   my dear one and kill this man and take me for your tonia do not   try to take hold of him alive but kill him quickly knowing all   you should do that you must come long before the time and hide   yourself in the little shed near the jacal where the wagon and   saddles are kept it is dark in there he will wear my red skirt   and blue waist and brown mantilla i send you a hundred kisses   come surely and shoot quickly and straight  thine own tonia   sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive the rangers protested against his going alone  ill get him easy enough said the lieutenant the girls got him trapped and dont even think hell get the drop on me  sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the lone wolf crossing he tied his big dun in a clump of brush on the arroyo took his winchester from its scabbard and carefully approached the perez jacal there was only the half of a high moon drifted over by ragged milkwhite gulf clouds  the wagonshed was an excellent place for ambush and the ranger got inside it safely in the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the jacal he could see a horse tied and hear him impatiently pawing the hardtrodden earth  he waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the jacal one in mans clothes quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagonshed toward the crossing and village and then the other figure in skirt waist and mantilla over its head stepped out into the faint moonlight gazing after the rider sandridge thought he would take his chance then before tonia rode back he fancied she might not care to see it  throw up your hands he ordered loudly stepping out of the wagon shed with his winchester at his shoulder  there was a quick turn of the figure but no movement to obey so the ranger pumped in the bulletsonetwothreeand then twice more for you never could be too sure of bringing down the cisco kid there was no danger of missing at ten paces even in that half moonlight  the old ancestor asleep on his blanket was awakened by the shots listening further he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish and rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns  the tall red ghost of a man burst into the jacal reaching one hand shaking like a tule reed for the lantern hanging on its nail the other spread a letter on the table  look at this letter perez cried the man who wrote it  ah dios it is senor sandridge mumbled the old man approaching pues senor that letter was written by el chivato as he is calledby the man of tonia they say he is a bad man i do not know while tonia slept he wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of mine to domingo sales to be brought to you is there anything wrong in the letter i am very old and i did not know valgame dios it is a very foolish world and there is nothing in the house to drink nothing to drink  just then all that sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw himself face downward in the dust by the side of his hummingbird of whom not a feather fluttered he was not a caballero by instinct and he could not understand the niceties of revenge  a mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagonshed struck up a harsh untuneful song the words of which began    dont you monkey with my lulu girl   or ill tell you what ill do    xii  the sphinx apple  twenty miles out from paradise and fifteen miles short of sunrise city bildad rose the stagedriver stopped his team a furious snow had been falling all day eight inches it measured now on a level the remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains now when both snow and night masked its dangers further travel was not to be thought of said bildad rose so he pulled up his four stout horses and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his wisdom  judge menefee to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver salver sprang from the coach at once four of his fellowpassengers followed inspired by his example ready to explore to objurgate to resist to submit to proceed according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway them the fifth passenger a young woman remained in the coach  bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur two railfences raggedblack hemmed the road fifty yards above the upper fence showing a dark blot in the white drifts stood a small house upon this house descendedor rather ascendedjudge menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress they called they pounded at window and door at the inhospitable silence they waxed restive they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers and invaded the premises  the watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house before long a light within flickered glowed flamed high and bright and cheerful then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers more deeply pitched than the clarioneven orchestral in volumethe voice of judge menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail the one room of the house was uninhabited he said and bare of furniture but it contained a great fireplace and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a leanto at the rear housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured for the placation of bildad rose there was news of a stable not ruined beyond service with hay in a loft near the house  gentlemen cried bildad rose from his seat swathed in coats and robes tear me down two panels of that fence so i can drive in that is old man redruths shanty i thought we must be nigh it they took him to the foolish house in august  cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snowcapped rails the exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a midsummer madness had ravished its proprietor the driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch judge menefee opened the door of the coach and removed his hat  i have to announce miss garland said he the enforced suspension of our journey the driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider it will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning i beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience i have personally inspected the house and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather at least you shall be made as comfortable as possible permit me to assist you to alight  to the judges side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the little goliath windmill his name was dunwoody but that matters not much in travelling merely from paradise to sunrise city one needs little or no name still one who would seek to divide honours with judge madison l menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which fame may hang a wreath thus spake loudly and buoyantly the aerial miller  guess youll have to climb out of the ark mrs mcfarland this wigwam isnt exactly the palmer house but it turns snow and they wont search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave weve got a fire going and well fix you up with dry tilbys and keep the mice away anyhow all right all right  one of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses harness snow and the sarcastic injunctions of bildad rose called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties say some of you fellows get miss solomon into the house will you whoa there you confounded brute  again must it be gently urged that in travelling from paradise to sunrise city an accurate name is prodigality when judge menefee sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread reputehad introduced himself to the lady passenger she had herself sweetly breathed a name in response that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted in the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated each clung stubbornly to his own theory for the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be garlanded and mcfarlanded and solomoned with equal and discreet complacency it is thirtyfive miles from paradise to sunrise city compagnon de voyage is name enough by the gripsack of the wandering jew for so brief a journey  soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the roaring fire the robes cushions and removable portions of the coach had been brought in and put to service the lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc there she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared she sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and barrel robe bespread which formed a defence from the invading draughts she extended her feet delectably shod to the cordial heat she ungloved her hands but retained about her neck her long fur boa the unstable flames half revealed while the warding boa half submerged her face a youthful face altogether feminine clearly moulded and calm with beautys unchallenged confidence chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her she seemed to accept their devoirsnot piquantly as one courted and attended nor preeningly as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours not yet stolidly as the ox receives his hay but concordantly with natures own planas the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment  outside the wind roared mightily the fine snow whizzed through the cracks the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six but the elements did not lack a champion that night judge menefee was attorney for the storm the weather was his client and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jurybox that they sojourned in a bower of roses beset only by benignant zephyrs he drew upon a fund of gaiety wit and anecdote sophistical but crowned with success his cheerfulness communicated itself irresistibly each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism even the lady passenger was moved to expression  i think it is quite charming she said in her slow crystal tones  at intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room there was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man redruth  bildad rose was called upon vivaciously for the exhermits history now since the stagedrivers horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers appeared to be so peace and comity returned to him  the old didapper began bildad somewhat irreverently infested this here house about twenty year he never allowed nobody to come nigh him hed duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along there was spinningwheels up in his loft all right he used to buy his groceries and tobacco at sam tillys store on the little muddy last august he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt and told sam he was king solomon and that the queen of sheba was coming to visit him he fetched along all the money he hada little bag full of silverand dropped it in sams well she wont come says old man redruth to sam if she knows ive got any money  as soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they knowed he was crazy so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum  was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence asked one of the passengers a young man who had an agency  no said bildad not that i ever heard spoke of just ordinary trouble they say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young before he contracted red bedquilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified i never heard of no romance  ah exclaimed judge menefee impressively a case of unrequited affection no doubt  no sir returned bildad not at all she never married him marmaduke mulligan down at paradise seen a man once that come from old redruths town he said redruth was a fine young man but when you kicked him on the pocket all you could hear jingle was a cufffastener and a bunch of keys he was engaged to this young ladymiss alice something was her name ive forgot this man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare well there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time although she was a staked claim miss alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip they had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presentsa rift within the loot the poetry man calls it  one day folks seen redruth and miss alice standing talking at the gate then he lifts his hat and walks away and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him as far as this man knew  what about the young lady asked the young man who had an agency  never heard answered bildad right there is where my lode of information turns to an old spavined crowbait and folds its wings for ive pumped it dry  a very sad began judge menefee but his remark was curtailed by a higher authority  what a charming story said the lady passenger in flutelike tones  a little silence followed except for the wind and the crackling of the fire  the men were seated upon the floor having slightly mitigated its inhospitable surface with wraps and stray pieces of boards the man who was placing little goliath windmills arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles  suddenly a triumphant shout came from him he hurried back from a dusky corner of the room bearing aloft something in his hand it was an applea large redmottled firm pippin pleasing to behold in a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it it could have been no relic of the lovewrecked redruth for its glorious soundness repudiated the theory that it had lain on that musty shelf since august no doubt some recent bivouackers lunching in the deserted house had left it there  dunwoodyagain his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclatureflaunted his apple in the faces of his fellowmarooners see what i found mrs mcfarland he cried vaingloriously he held the apple high up in the light of the fire where it glowed a still richer red the lady passenger smiled calmlyalways calmly  what a charming apple she murmured clearly  for a brief space judge menefee felt crushed humiliated relegated second place galled him why had this blatant obtrusive unpolished man of windmills been selected by fate instead of himself to discover the sensational apple he could have made of the act a scene a function a setting for some impromptu fanciful discourse or piece of comedyand have retained the role of cynosure actually the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous dunboddy or woodbundy with an admiring smile as if the fellow had performed a feat and the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of his own goods puffed up with the wind that ever blows from the chorus land toward the domain of the star  while the transported dunwoody with his aladdins apple was receiving the fickle attentions of all the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own laurels  with his courtliest smile upon his heavy but classic features judge menefee advanced and took the apple as if to examine it from the hand of dunwoody in his hand it became exhibit a  a fine apple he said approvingly really my dear mr dudwindy you have eclipsed all of us as a forager but i have an idea this apple shall become an emblem a token a symbol a prize bestowed by the mind and heart of beauty upon the most deserving  the audience except one applauded good on the stump aint he commented the passenger who was nobody in particular to the young man who had an agency  the unresponsive one was the windmill man he saw himself reduced to the ranks never would the thought have occurred to him to declare his apple an emblem he had intended after it had been divided and eaten to create diversion by sticking the seeds against his forehead and naming them for young ladies of his acquaintance one he was going to name mrs mcfarland the seed that fell off first would bebut twas too late now  the apple continued judge menefee charging his jury in modern days occupies though undeservedly a lowly place in our esteem indeed it is so constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits but in ancient times this was not so biblical historical and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits we still say the apple of the eye when we wish to describe something superlatively precious we find in proverbs the comparison to apples of silver no other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech who has not heard of and longed for the apples of the hesperides i need not call your attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apples ancient prestige when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and perfection  apples like them said the windmill man lingering with the objective article are worth 350 a barrel in the chicago market  now what i have to propose said judge menefee conceding an indulgent smile to his interrupter is this we must remain here perforce until morning we have wood in plenty to keep us warm our next need is to entertain ourselves as best we can in order that the time shall not pass too slowly i propose that we place this apple in the hands of miss garland it is no longer a fruit but as i said a prize in award representing a great human idea miss garland herself shall cease to be an individualbut only temporarily i am happy to adda low bow full of the oldtime grace she shall represent her sex she shall be the embodiment the epitome of womankindthe heart and brain i may say of gods masterpiece of creation in this guise she shall judge and decide the question which follows  but a few minutes ago our friend mr rose favoured us with an entertaining but fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of this habitation the few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture for the study of human hearts for the exercise of the imaginationin short for storytelling let us make use of the opportunity let each one of us relate his own version of the story of redruth the hermit and his ladylove beginning where mr roses narrative endsat the parting of the lovers at the gate this much should be assumed and concededthat the young lady was not necessarily to blame for redruths becoming a crazed and worldhating hermit when we have done miss garland shall render the judgement of woman as the spirit of her sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human and love interest and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of redruths betrothed according to the feminine view the apple shall be bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision if you are all agreed we shall be pleased to hear the first story from mr dinwiddie  the last sentence captured the windmill man he was not one to linger in the dumps  thats a firstrate scheme judge he said heartily be a regular shortstory vaudeville wont it i used to be correspondent for a paper in springfield and when there wasnt any news i faked it guess i can do my turn all right  i think the idea is charming said the lady passenger brightly it will be almost like a game  judge menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively  in olden days he said orotundly paris awarded the golden apple to the most beautiful  i was at the exposition remarked the windmill man now cheerful again but i never heard of it and i was on the midway too all the time i wasnt at the machinery exhibit  but now continued the judge the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and wisdom of the feminine heart take the apple miss garland hear our modest tales of romance and then award the prize as you may deem it just  the lady passenger smiled sweetly the apple lay in her lap beneath her robes and wraps she reclined against her protecting bulwark brightly and cosily at ease but for the voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to hear her purr someone cast fresh logs upon the fire judge menefee nodded suavely will you oblige us with the initial story he asked  the windmill man sat as sits a turk with his hat well back on his head on account of the draughts  well he began without any embarrassment this is about the way i size up the difficulty of course redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had money to play ball with who tried to cut him out of his girl so he goes around naturally and asks her if the game is still square well nobody wants a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when hes got an option on a girl well he goes around to see her well maybe hes hot and talks like the proprietor and forgets that an engagement aint always a leadpipe cinch well i guess that makes alice warm under the lacy yoke well she answers back sharp well he  say interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular if you could put up a windmill on every one of them wells youre using youd be able to retire from business wouldnt you  the windmill man grinned goodnaturedly  oh i aint no guy de mopassong he said cheerfully im giving it to you in straight american well she says something like this mr gold bonds is only a friend says she but he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets and thats what you never do aint i to never have any pleasure in life while i can pass this chatfield chatfield thing along says redruthhand out the mitt to the willie with creases in it or you dont put your slippers under my wardrobe  now that kind of train orders dont go with a girl thats got any spirit i bet that girl loved her honey all the time maybe she only wanted as girls do to work the good thing for a little fun and caramels before she settled down to patch georges other pair and be a good wife but he is glued to the high horse and wont come down well she hands him back the ring proper enough and george goes away and hits the booze yep thats what done it i bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left george boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown he sticks to old booze for a number of years and then the aniline and aquafortis gets the decision me for the hermits hut says george and the long whiskers and the buried can of money that isnt there  but that alice in my mind was on the level she never married but took up typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show and kept a cat that came when you said weenyweenyweeny i got too much faith in good women to believe they throw down the fellow theyre stuck on every time for the dough the windmill man ceased  i think said the lady passenger slightly moving upon her lowly throne that that is a char  oh miss garland interposed judge menefee with uplifted hand i beg of you no comments it would not be fair to the other contestants mrerwill you take the next turn the judge addressed the young man who had the agency  my version of the romance began the young man diffidently clasping his hands would be this they did not quarrel when they parted mr redruth bade her goodby and went out into the world to seek his fortune he knew his love would remain true to him he scorned the thought that his rival could make an impression upon a heart so fond and faithful i would say that mr redruth went out to the rocky mountains in wyoming to seek for gold one day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work and  hey whats that sharply called the passenger who was nobody in particulara crew of pirates landed in the rocky mountains will you tell us how they sailed  landed from a train said the narrator quietly and not without some readiness they kept him prisoner in a cave for months and then they took him hundreds of miles away to the forests of alaska there a beautiful indian girl fell in love with him but he remained true to alice after another year of wandering in the woods he set out with the diamonds  what diamonds asked the unimportant passenger almost with acerbity  the ones the saddlemaker showed him in the peruvian temple said the other somewhat obscurely when he reached home alices mother led him weeping to a green mound under a willow tree her heart was broken when you left said her mother and what of my rivalof chester mcintosh asked mr redruth as he knelt sadly by alices grave when he found out she answered that her heart was yours he pined away day by day until at length he started a furniture store in grand rapids we heard lately that he was bitten to death by an infuriated moose near south bend ind where he had gone to try to forget scenes of civilisation with which mr redruth forsook the face of mankind and became a hermit as we have seen  my story concluded the young man with an agency may lack the literary quality but what i wanted it to show is that the young lady remained true she cared nothing for wealth in comparison with true affection i admire and believe in the fair sex too much to think otherwise  the narrator ceased with a sidelong glance at the corner where reclined the lady passenger  bildad rose was next invited by judge menefee to contribute his story in the contest for the apple of judgment the stagedrivers essay was brief  im not one of them lobo wolves he said who are always blaming on women the calamities of life my testimony in regards to the fiction story you ask for judge will be about as follows what ailed redruth was pure laziness if he had up and slugged this percival de lacey that tried to give him the outside of the road and had kept alice in the grapevine swing with the blindbridle on all would have been well the woman you want is sure worth taking pains for  send for me if you want me again says redruth and hoists his stetson and walks off hed have called it pride but the nixycomlogical name for it is laziness no woman dont like to run after a man let him come back hisself says the girl and ill be bound she tells the boy with the pay ore to trot and then spends her time watching out the window for the man with the empty pocketbook and the tickly moustache  i reckon redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a nigger asking him to forgive her but she dont this game wont work says redruth then so wont i and he goes in the hermit business and raises whiskers yes laziness and whiskers was what done the trick they travel together you ever hear of a man with long whiskers and hair striking a bonanza no look at the duke of marlborough and this standard oil snoozer have they got em  now this alice didnt never marry ill bet a hoss if redruth had married somebody else she might have done so too but he never turns up she has these here things they call fond memories and maybe a lock of hair and a corset steel that he broke treasured up them sort of articles is as good as a husband to some women id say she played out a lone hand i dont blame no woman for old man redruths abandonment of barber shops and clean shirts  next in order came the passenger who was nobody in particular nameless to us he travels the road from paradise to sunrise city  but him you shall see if the firelight be not too dim as he responds to the judges call  a lean form in rustybrown clothing sitting like a frog his arms wrapped about his legs his chin resting upon his knees smooth oakumcoloured hair long nose mouth like a satyrs with upturned tobaccostained corners an eye like a fishs a red necktie with a horseshoe pin he began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words  everybody wrong so far what a romance without any orange blossoms ho ho my money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings  take em as they parted at the gate all right you never loved me says redruth wildly or you wouldnt speak to a man who can buy you the icecream i hate him says she i loathe his sidebar buggy i despise the elegant cream bonbons he sends me in gilt boxes covered with real lace i feel that i could stab him to the heart when he presents me with a solid medallion locket with turquoises and pearls running in a vine around the border away with him tis only you i love back to the cosey corner says redruth was i bound and lettered in east aurora get platonic if you please no jackpots for mine go and hate your friend some more for me the nickerson girl on avenue b and gum and a trolley ride  around that night comes john w croesus what tears says he arranging his pearl pin you have driven my lover away says little alice sobbing i hate the sight of you marry me then says john w lighting a henry clay what she cries indignantly marry you never she says until this blows over and i can do some shopping and you see about the licence theres a telephone next door if you want to call up the county clerk  the narrator paused to give vent to his cynical chuckle  did they marry he continued did the duck swallow the junebug and then i take up the case of old boy redruth theres where you are all wrong again according to my theory what turned him into a hermit one says laziness one says remorse one says booze i say women did it how old is the old man now asked the speaker turning to bildad rose  i should say about sixtyfive  all right he conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years say he was twentyfive when he took off his hat at the gate that leaves twenty years for him to account for or else be docked where did he spend that ten and two fives ill give you my idea up for bigamy say there was the fat blonde in saint jo and the panatela brunette at skillet ridge and the gold tooth down in the kaw valley redruth gets his cases mixed and they send him up the road he gets out after they are through with him and says any line for me except the crinoline the hermit trade is not overdone and the stenographers never apply to em for work the jolly hermits life for me no more long hairs in the comb or dill pickles lying around in the cigar tray you tell me they pinched old redruth for the noodle villa just because he said he was king solomon figs he was solomon thats all of mine i guess it dont call for any apples enclosed find stamps it dont sound much like a prize winner  respecting the stricture laid by judge menefee against comments upon the stories all were silent when the passenger who was nobody in particular had concluded and then the ingenious originator of the contest cleared his throat to begin the ultimate entry for the prize though seated with small comfort upon the floor you might search in vain for any abatement of dignity in judge menefee the now diminishing firelight played softly upon his face as clearly chiselled as a roman emperors on some old coin and upon the thick waves of his honourable grey hair  a womans heart he began in even but thrilling toneswho can hope to fathom it the ways and desires of men are various i think that the hearts of all women beat with the same rhythm and to the same old tune of love love to a woman means sacrifice if she be worthy of the name no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion  gentlemen of theeri should say my friends the case of redruth versus love and affection has been called yet who is on trial not redruth for he has been punished not those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels then who each man of us here tonight stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his bosom to judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers in her hand she holds the prize intrinsically insignificant but worthy of our noblest efforts to win as a guerdon of approval from so worthy a representative of feminine judgment and taste  in taking up the imaginary history of redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his heart i must in the beginning raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world i have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal we must seek elsewhere among mans baser nature and lower motives for the cause  there was in all probability a lovers quarrel as they stood at the gate on that memorable day tormented by jealousy young redruth vanished from his native haunts but had he just cause to do so there is no evidence for or against but there is something higher than evidence there is the grand eternal belief in womans goodness in her steadfastness against temptation in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches  i picture to myself the rash lover wandering selftortured about the world i picture his gradual descent and finally his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the most precious gift life had to offer him then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible  but what do i see on the other hand a lonely woman fading away as the years roll by still faithful still waiting still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no more she is old now her hair is white and smoothly banded each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road in spirit she is waiting there at the gate just as he left herhis forever but not here below yes my belief in woman paints that picture in my mind parted forever on earth but waiting she in anticipation of a meeting in elysium he in the slough of despond  i thought he was in the bughouse said the passenger who was nobody in particular  judge menefee stirred a little impatiently the men sat drooping in grotesque attitudes the wind had abated its violence coming now in fitful virulent puffs the fire had burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room the lady passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk crowned by a mass of coiled sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa  judge menefee got stiffly to his feet  and now miss garland he announced we have concluded it is for you to award the prize to the one of us whose argumentespecially i may say in regard to his estimate of true womanhoodapproaches nearest to your own conception  no answer came from the lady passenger judge menefee bent over solicitously the passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly the lady was sleeping sweetly the judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her in doing so he touched a small cold round irregular something in her lap  she has eaten the apple announced judge menefee in awed tones as he held up the core for them to see    xiii  the missing chord  i stopped overnight at the sheepranch of rush kinney on the sandy fork of the nueces mr kinney and i had been strangers up to the time when i called hallo at his hitchingrack but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were according to the texas code undeniable friends  after supper the ranchman and i lugged our chairs outside the tworoom house to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass with the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked el toro tobacco while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world  as for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening despair waits upon it it is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a texas night in the early spring an inventory must suffice  the ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope the ambient prairie diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there the miraculous air heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets gave tang and savour to the breath in the sky was a great round mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon but the dark lantern of summer who came to hunt northward the cowering spring in the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush for other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearingpen and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass but even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mockingbirds notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees it would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars they hung so bright and imminent  mr kinneys wife a young and capable woman we had left in the house she remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties in which i had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride in one room we had supped presently from the other as kinney and i sat without there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music if i could justly estimate the art of pianoplaying the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard a piano and one so well played seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch house i must have looked my surprise at rush kinney for he laughed in his soft southern way and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes  you dont often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheepranch he remarked but i never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush its a lonesome life for a woman and if a little music can make it any better why not have it thats the way i look at it  a wise and generous theory i assented and mrs kinney plays well i am not learned in the science of music but i should call her an uncommonly good performer she has technic and more than ordinary power  the moon was very bright you will understand and i saw upon kinneys face a sort of amused and pregnant expression as though there were things behind it that might be expounded  you came up the trail from the doubleelm fork he said promisingly as you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott  i did said i there was a drove of javalis rooting around it i could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there  thats where this music proposition started said kinney i dont mind telling you about it while we smoke thats where old cal adams lived he had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stakerope on a thirtydollar pony and i dont mind telling you that i was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old cals ranch all the time i could spare away from lambing and shearing miss marilla was her name and i had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of rancho lomito belonging to r kinney esq where you are now a welcome and honoured guest  i will say that old cal wasnt distinguished as a sheepman he was a little old stoopshouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard with scraggy white whiskers and condemned to the continuous use of language old cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasnt even hated by the cowmen and when a sheepman dont get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung  but that marilla girl was a benefit to the eye and she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper i was the nearest neighbour and i used to ride over to the doubleelm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheepdip just as a frivolous excuse to see marilla marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other and i was pretty sure i was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the lomito only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old cal that i never could get her to talk about serious matters  you never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old cal he was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment you couldnt advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought you would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations any subject you brought up old cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market  one day just after the fall shearing i rides over to the doubleelm with a ladys magazine about fashions for marilla and a scientific paper for old cal  while i was tying my pony to a mesquite out runs marilla tickled to death with some news that couldnt wait  oh rush she says all flushed up with esteem and gratification what do you think dads going to buy me a piano aint it grand i never dreamed id ever have one  its sure joyful says i i always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano itll be lots of company for you thats mighty good of uncle cal to do that  im all undecided says marilla between a piano and an organ a parlour organ is nice  either of em says i is firstclass for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheepranch for my part i says i shouldnt like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs with somebody about your size sitting on the piano stool and rounding up the notes  oh hush about that says marilla and go on in the house dad hasnt rode out today hes not feeling well  old cal was inside lying on a cot he had a pretty bad cold and cough i stayed to supper  going to get marilla a piano i hear says i to him  why yes something of the kind rush says he shes been hankering for music for a long spell and i allow to fix her up with something in that line right away the sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall and im going to get marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it  star wayno says i the little girl deserves it  im going to san antone on the last load of wool says uncle cal and select an instrument for her myself  wouldnt it be better i suggests to take marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes  i might have known that would set uncle cal going of course a man like him that knew everything about everything would look at that as a reflection on his attainments  no sir it wouldnt says he pulling at his white whiskers there aint a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what i am i had an uncle says he that was a partner in a pianofactory and ive seen thousands of em put together i know all about musical instruments from a pipeorgan to a cornstalk fiddle there aint a man lives sir that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded blowed scraped grinded picked or wound with a key  you get me what you like dad says marilla who couldnt keep her feet on the floor from joy of course you know what to select id just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what  i see in st louis once what they call a orchestrion says uncle cal that i judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented but there aint room in this house for one anyway i imagine theyd cost a thousand dollars i reckon something in the piano line would suit marilla the best she took lessons in that respect for two years over at birdstail i wouldnt trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself i reckon if i hadnt took up sheepraising id have been one of the finest composers or piano andorgan manufacturers in the world  that was uncle cals style but i never lost any patience with him on account of his thinking so much of marilla and she thought just as much of him he sent her to the academy over at birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses  along about tuesday uncle cal put out for san antone on the last wagonload of wool marillas uncle ben who lived in birdstail come over and stayed at the ranch while uncle cal was gone  it was ninety miles to san antone and forty to the nearest railroad station so uncle cal was gone about four days i was over at the doubleelm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown and up there in the wagon sure enough was a piano or a organwe couldnt tell whichall wrapped up in woolsacks with a wagonsheet tied over it in case of rain and out skips marilla hollering oh oh with her eyes shining and her hair aflying daddad she sings out have you brought ithave you brought itand it right there before her eyes as women will do  finest piano in san antone says uncle cal waving his hand proud genuine rosewood and the finest loudest tone you ever listened to i heard the storekeeper play it and i took it on the spot and paid cash down  me and ben and uncle cal and a mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner it was one of them upright instruments and not very heavy or very big  and then all of a sudden uncle cal flops over and says hes mighty sick hes got a high fever and he complains of his lungs he gets into bed while me and ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture and marilla flies around to get uncle cal something hot to drink but first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile like you see kids doing with their christmas toys  when i came in from the pasture marilla was in the room where the piano was i could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped but now she was tying the wagonsheet over it again and there was a kind of solemn whitish look on her face  aint wrapping up the music again are you marilla i asks whats the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle  not tonight rush says she i dont want to play any tonight dads too sick just think rush he paid three hundred dollars for it nearly a third of what the woolclip brought  well it aint anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth i told her and i dont think uncle cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the pianokeys just to christen the machine  not tonight rush says marilla in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things  but it seems that uncle cal was plenty sick after all he got so bad that ben saddled up and rode over to birdstail for doc simpson i stayed around to see if id be needed for anything  when uncle cals pain let up on him a little he called marilla and says to her did you look at your instrument honey and do you like it  its lovely dad says she leaning down by his pillow i never saw one so pretty how dear and good it was of you to buy it for me  i havent heard you play on it any yet says uncle cal and ive been listening my side dont hurt quite so bad nowwont you play a piece marilla  but no she puts uncle cal off and soothes him down like youve seen women do with a kid it seems shes made up her mind not to touch that piano at present  when doc simpson comes over he tells us that uncle cal has pneumonia the worst kind and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow the odds was against his walking on grass any more  on the fourth day of his sickness he calls for marilla again and wants to talk piano doc simpson was there and so was ben and mrs ben trying to do all they could  id have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music says uncle cal i got the finest instrument for the money in san antone aint that piano all right in every respect marilla  its just perfect dad says she its got the finest tone i ever heard but dont you think you could sleep a little while now dad  no i dont says uncle cal i want to hear that piano i dont believe youve even tried it yet i went all the way to san antone and picked it out for you myself it took a third of the fall clip to buy it but i dont mind that if it makes my good girl happier wont you play a little bit for dad marilla  doc simpson beckoned marilla to one side and recommended her to do what uncle cal wanted so it would get him quieted and her uncle ben and his wife asked her too  why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on i asks marilla uncle cal has begged you so often it would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano hes bought for you dont you think you might  but marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing and then she runs over and slips her arm under uncle cals neck and hugs him tight  why last night dad we heard her say i played it ever so much honesti have been playing it and its such a splendid instrument you dont know how i love it last night i played bonnie dundee and the anvil polka and the blue danubeand lots of pieces you must surely have heard me playing a little didnt you dad i didnt like to play loud when you was so sick  well well says uncle cal maybe i did maybe i did and forgot about it my head is a little cranky at times i heard the man in the store play it fine im mighty glad you like it marilla yes i believe i could go to sleep a while if youll stay right beside me till i do  there was where marilla had me guessing much as she thought of that old man she wouldnt strike a note on that piano that hed bought her i couldnt imagine why she told him shed been playing it for the wagonsheet hadnt ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come i knew she could play a little anyhow for id once heard her snatch some pretty fair dancemusic out of an old piano at the charco largo ranch  well in about a week the pneumonia got the best of uncle cal they had the funeral over at birdstail and all of us went over i brought marilla back home in my buckboard her uncle ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her  that night marilla takes me in the room where the piano was while the others were out on the gallery  come here rush says she i want you to see this now  she unties the rope and drags off the wagonsheet  if you ever rode a saddle without a horse or fired off a gun that wasnt loaded or took a drink out of an empty bottle why then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument uncle cal had bought  instead of a piano it was one of the machines theyve invented to play the piano with by itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute  and that was the piano that uncle cal had selected and standing by it was the good fine allwool girl that never let him know it  and what you heard playing a while ago concluded mr kinney was that same deputypiano machine only just at present its shoved up against a sixhundreddollar piano that i bought for marilla as soon as we was married    xiv  a call loan  in those days the cattlemen were the anointed they were the grandees of the grass kings of the kine lords of the lea barons of beef and bone they might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined the cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars it seemed to him that he had more money than was decent but when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs and a california saddle with silver nails and angora skin suaderos and ordered everybody up to the bar for whiskywhat else was there for him to spend money for  not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name in the breast of the ribsprung sex the genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity but never my brothers does it become extinct  so out of the chaparral came long bill longley from the bar circle branch on the frioa wifedriven manto taste the urban joys of success something like half a million dollars he had with an income steadily increasing  long bill was a graduate of the camp and trail luck and thrift a cool head and a telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman then came the boom in cattle and fortune stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns came and emptied her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch  in the little frontier city of chaparosa longley built a costly residence here he became a captive bound to the chariot of social existence he was doomed to become a leading citizen he struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral and then he hung up his quirt and spurs time hung heavily on his hands he organised the first national bank of chaparosa and was elected its president  one day a dyspeptic man wearing doublemagnifying glasses inserted an officiallooking card between the bars of the cashiers window of the first national bank five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank examiner  this examiner mr j edgar todd proved to be a thorough one  at the end of it all the examiner put on his hat and called the president mr william r longley into the private office  well how do you find things asked longley in his slow deep tones any brands in the roundup you didnt like the looks of  the bank checks up all right mr longley said todd and i find your loans in very good shapewith one exception you are carrying one very bad bit of paperone that is so bad that i have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in i refer to a call loan of 10000 made to thomas merwin not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally but it is absolutely without endorsement or security thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the government a report of the matter to the comptroller of the currencywhich i am bound to makewould i am sure result in the matter being turned over to the department of justice for action you see what a serious thing it is  bill longley was leaning his lengthy slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair his hands were clasped behind his head and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face the examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker and a kindly twinkle in his lightblue eyes if he saw the seriousness of the affair it did not show in his countenance  of course you dont know tom merwin said longley almost genially yes i know about that loan it hasnt any security except tom merwins word somehow ive always found that when a mans word is good its the best security there is oh yes i know the government doesnt think so i guess ill see tom about that note  mr todds dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse he looked at the chaparral banker through his doublemagnifying glasses in amazement  you see said longley easily explaining the thing away tom heard of 2000 head of twoyearolds down near rocky ford on the rio grande that could be had for 8 a head i reckon twas one of old leandro garcias outfits that he had smuggled over and he wanted to make a quick turn on em those cattle are worth 15 on the hoof in kansas city tom knew it and i knew it he had 6000 and i let him have the 10000 to make the deal with his brother ed took em on to market three weeks ago he ought to be back most any day now with the money when he comes tomll pay that note  the bank examiner was shocked it was perhaps his duty to step out to the telegraph office and wire the situation to the comptroller but he did not he talked pointedly and effectively to longley for three minutes he succeeded in making the banker understand that he stood upon the border of a catastrophe and then he offered a tiny loophole of escape  i am going to hilldales tonight he told longley to examine a bank there i will pass through chaparosa on my way back at twelve oclock tomorrow i shall call at this bank if this loan has been cleared out of the way by that time it will not be mentioned in my report if noti will have to do my duty  with that the examiner bowed and departed  the president of the first national lounged in his chair half an hour longer and then he lit a mild cigar and went over to tom merwins house merwin a ranchman in brown duck with a contemplative eye sat with his feet upon a table plaiting a rawhide quirt  tom said longley leaning against the table you heard anything from ed yet  not yet said merwin continuing his plaiting i guess edll be along back now in a few days  there was a bank examiner said longley nosing around our place today and he bucked a sight about that note of yours you know i know its all right but the thing is against the banking laws i was pretty sure youd have paid it off before the bank was examined again but the sonofagun slipped in on us tom now im short of cash myself just now or id let you have the money to take it up with ive got till twelve oclock tomorrow and then ive got to show the cash in place of that note or  or what bill asked merwin as longley hesitated  well i suppose it means be jumped on with both of uncle sams feet  ill try to raise the money for you on time said merwin interested in his plaiting  all right tom concluded longley as he turned toward the door i knew you would if you could  merwin threw down his whip and went to the only other bank in town a private one run by cooper  craig  cooper he said to the partner by that name ive got to have 10000 today or tomorrow ive got a house and lot there thats worth about 6000 and thats all the actual collateral but ive got a cattle deal on thats sure to bring me in more than that much profit within a few days  cooper began to cough  now for gods sake dont say no said merwin i owe that much money on a call loan its been called and the man that called it is a man ive laid on the same blanket with in cowcamps and rangercamps for ten years he can call anything ive got he can call the blood out of my veins and itll come hes got to have the money hes in a devil of awell he needs the money and ive got to get it for him you know my words good cooper  no doubt of it assented cooper urbanely but ive a partner you know im not free in making loans and even if you had the best security in your hands merwin we couldnt accommodate you in less than a week were just making a shipment of 15000 to myer brothers in rockdell to buy cotton with it goes down on the narrowgauge tonight that leaves our cash quite short at present sorry we cant arrange it for you  merwin went back to his little bare office and plaited at his quirt again about four oclock in the afternoon he went to the first national bank and leaned over the railing of longleys desk  ill try to get that money for you tonighti mean tomorrow bill  all right tom said longley quietly  at nine oclock that night tom merwin stepped cautiously out of the small frame house in which he lived it was near the edge of the little town and few citizens were in the neighbourhood at that hour merwin wore two sixshooters in a belt and a slouch hat he moved swiftly down a lonely street and then followed the sandy road that ran parallel to the narrowgauge track until he reached the water tank two miles below the town there tom merwin stopped tied a black silk handkerchief about the lower part of his face and pulled his hat down low  in ten minutes the night train for rockdell pulled up at the tank having come from chaparosa  with a gun in each hand merwin raised himself from behind a clump of chaparral and started for the engine but before he had taken three steps two long strong arms clasped him from behind and he was lifted from his feet and thrown face downward upon the grass there was a heavy knee pressing against his back and an iron hand grasping each of his wrists he was held thus like a child until the engine had taken water and until the train had moved with accelerating speed out of sight then he was released and rose to his feet to face bill longley  the case never needed to be fixed up this way tom said longley i saw cooper this evening and he told me what you and him talked about then i went down to your house tonight and saw you come out with your guns on and i followed you lets go back tom  they walked away together side by side  twas the only chance i saw said merwin presently you called your loan and i tried to answer you now whatll you do bill if they sock it to you  what would you have done if theyd socked it to you was the answer longley made  i never thought id lay in a bush to stick up a train remarked merwin but a call loans different a calls a call with me weve got twelve hours yet bill before this spy jumps onto you weve got to raise them spondulicks somehow maybe we cangreat sam houston do you hear that  merwin broke into a run and longley kept with him hearing only a rather pleasing whistle somewhere in the night rendering the lugubrious air of the cowboys lament  its the only tune he knows shouted merwin as he ran ill bet  they were at the door of merwins house he kicked it open and fell over an old valise lying in the middle of the floor a sunburned firmjawed youth stained by travel lay upon the bed puffing at a brown cigarette  whats the word ed gasped merwin  so so drawled that capable youngster just got in on the 930 sold the bunch for fifteen straight now buddy you want to quit kickin a valise around thats got 29000 in greenbacks in its inards    xv  the princess and the puma  there had to be a king and queen of course the king was a terrible old man who wore sixshooters and spurs and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear before there was a royal family they called the man whispering ben when he came to own 50000 acres of land and more cattle than he could count they called him odonnell the cattle king  the queen had been a mexican girl from laredo she made a good mild coloradoclaro wife and even succeeded in teaching ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken when ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of espinosa ranch and weave rush mats when wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from san antone in the wagons she bowed her smooth dark head and shared the fate of the danae  to avoid lesemajeste you have been presented first to the king and queen they do not enter the story which might be called the chronicle of the princess the happy thought and the lion that bungled his job  josefa odonnell was the surviving daughter the princess from her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky semitropic beauty from ben odonnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity common sense and the faculty of ruling the combination was one worth going miles to see josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomatocan swinging at the end of a string she could play for hours with a white kitten she owned dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes scorning a pencil she could tell you out of her head what 1545 twoyearolds would bring on the hoof at 850 per head roughly speaking the espinosa ranch is forty miles long and thirty broadbut mostly leased land josefa on her pony had prospected over every mile of it every cowpuncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal ripley givens foreman of one of the espinosa outfits saw her one day and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance presumptuous no in those days in the nueces country a man was a man and after all the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing  one day ripley givens rode over to the double elm ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings he was late in setting out on his return trip and it was sundown when he struck the white horse crossing of the nueces from there to his own camp it was sixteen miles to the espinosa ranch it was twelve givens was tired he decided to pass the night at the crossing  there was a fine water hole in the riverbed the banks were thickly covered with great trees undergrown with brush back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grasssupper for his horse and bed for himself givens staked his horse and spread out his saddle blankets to dry he sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette from somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden rageful shivering wail the pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear givens puffed at his cigarette but he reached leisurely for his pistolbelt which lay on the grass and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively a great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole a little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at givens the pony went on eating grass  it is well to be reasonably watchful when a mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown the burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance  in the grass lay an empty fruit can cast there by some former sojourner givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction in his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee black coffee and cigarettes what ranchero could desire more  in two minutes he had a little fire going clearly he started with his can for the water hole when within fifteen yards of its edge he saw between the bushes a sidesaddled pony with downdropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was josefa odonnell she had been drinking water and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands ten yards away to her right half concealed by a clump of sacuista givens saw the crouching form of the mexican lion his amber eyeballs glared hungrily six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight like a pointers his hindquarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping  givens did what he could his sixshooter was thirtyfive yards away lying on the grass he gave a loud yell and dashed between the lion and the princess  the rucus as givens called it afterward was brief and somewhat confused when he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air and heard a couple of faint cracks then a hundred pounds of mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him with a heavy jar to the ground he remembered calling out let up nowno fair gouging and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm with his mouth full of grass and dirt and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a waterelm the lion lay motionless givens feeling aggrieved and suspicious of fouls shook his fist at the lion and shouted ill rastle you again for twenty and then he got back to himself  josefa was standing in her tracks quietly reloading her silver mounted 38 it had not been a difficult shot the lions head made an easier mark than a tomatocan swinging at the end of a string there was a provoking teasing maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes the wouldberescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul here had been his chance the chance that he had dreamed of and momus and not cupid had presided over it the satyrs in the wood were no doubt holding their sides in hilarious silent laughter there had been something like vaudevillesay signor givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion  is that you mr givens said josefa in her deliberate saccharine contralto you nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled did you hurt your head when you fell  oh no said givens quietly that didnt hurt he stooped ignominiously and dragged his best stetson hat from under the beast it was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce openjawed head of the dead lion  poor old bill he exclaimed mournfully  whats that asked josefa sharply  of course you didnt know miss josefa said givens with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief nobody can blame you i tried to save him but i couldnt let you know in time  save who  why bill ive been looking for him all day you see hes been our camp pet for two years poor old fellow he wouldnt have hurt a cottontail rabbit itll break the boys all up when they hear about it but you couldnt tell of course that bill was just trying to play with you  josefas black eyes burned steadily upon him ripley givens met the test successfully he stood rumpling the yellowbrown curls on his head pensively in his eye was regret not unmingled with a gentle reproach his smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow josefa wavered  what was your pet doing here she asked making a last stand theres no camp near the white horse crossing  the old rascal ran away from camp yesterday answered givens readily its a wonder the coyotes didnt scare him to death you see jim webster our horse wrangler brought a little terrier pup into camp last week the pup made life miserable for billhe used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time every night when bedtime came bill would sneak under one of the boys blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him i reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldnt have run away he was always afraid to get out of sight of camp  josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry her eyes grew softer and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery  im very sorry she said humbly but he looked so big and jumped so high that  poor old bill was hungry interrupted givens in quick defence of the deceased we always made him jump for his supper in camp he would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat when he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you  suddenly josefas eyes opened wide  i might have shot you she exclaimed you ran right in between you risked your life to save your pet that was fine mr givens i like a man who is kind to animals  yes there was even admiration in her gaze now after all there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anticlimax the look on givenss face would have secured him a high position in the spca  i always loved em said he horses dogs mexican lions cows alligators  i hate alligators instantly demurred josefa crawly muddy things  did i say alligators said givens i meant antelopes of course  josefas conscience drove her to make further amends she held out her hand penitently there was a bright unshed drop in each of her eyes  please forgive me mr givens wont you im only a girl you know and i was frightened at first im very very sorry i shot bill you dont know how ashamed i feel i wouldnt have done it for anything  givens took the proffered hand he held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of bill at last it was clear that he had forgiven her  please dont speak of it any more miss josefa twas enough to frighten any young lady the way bill looked ill explain it all right to the boys  are you really sure you dont hate me josefa came closer to him impulsively her eyes were sweetoh sweet and pleading with gracious penitence i would hate anyone who would kill my kitten and how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him how very few men would have done that victory wrested from defeat vaudeville turned into drama bravo ripley givens  it was now twilight of course miss josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranchhouse alone givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animals reproachful glances and rode with her side by side they galloped across the smooth grass the princess and the man who was kind to animals the prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them coyotes yelping over there on the hill no fear and yet  josefa rode closer a little hand seemed to grope givens found it with his own the ponies kept an even gait the hands lingered together and the owner of one explained  i never was frightened before but just think how terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion poor bill im so glad you came with me  odonnell was sitting on the ranch gallery  hello rip he shoutedthat you  he rode in with me said josefa i lost my way and was late  much obliged called the cattle king stop over rip and ride to camp in the morning  but givens would not he would push on to camp there was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak he said goodnight and trotted away  an hour later when the lights were out josefa in her nightrobe came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brickpaved hallway  say pop you know that old mexican lion they call the gotcheared devilthe one that killed gonzales mr martins sheep herder and about fifty calves on the salado range well i settled his hash this afternoon over at the white horse crossing put two balls in his head with my 38 while he was on the jump i knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old gonzales cut off with his machete you couldnt have made a better shot yourself daddy  bully for you thundered whispering ben from the darkness of the royal chamber    xvi  the indian summer of dry valley johnson  dry valley johnson shook the bottle you have to shake the bottle before using for sulphur will not dissolve then dry valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum dry valley found the recipe in a sunday newspaper you must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a beauty hint  dry valley had been a sheepman his real name was hector but he had been rechristened after his range to distinguish him from elm creek johnson who ran sheep further down the frio  many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied dry valley johnson so he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to santa rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease being a silent and melancholy person of thirtyfiveor perhaps thirtyeighthe soon became that cursed and earthcumbering thingan elderlyish bachelor with a hobby some one gave him his first strawberry to eat and he was done for  dry valley bought a fourroom cottage in the village and a library on strawberry culture behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch in his old grey woolen shirt his brown duck trousers and highheeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a liveoak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive scarlet berry  the school teacher miss de witt spoke of him as a fine presentable man for all his middle age but the focus of dry valleys eyes embraced no women they were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy roundcrowned broadbrimmed felt stetson whenever he met them and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries  and all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why dry valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle so longdrawn and inconsequential a thing is historythe anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun  when his strawberries were beginning to ripen dry valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the santa rosa store he sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash when it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker for the bright predatory eyes of santa rosa youth were watching the ripening berries and dry valley was arming himself against their expected raids no greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property  in the house next to dry valleys lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings in the woman there was a strain of the spanish she had wedded one of the name of obrien dry valley was a connoisseur in cross strains and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union  between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets keeping tabs on the reddening berries  late one afternoon dry valley went to the post office when he came back like mother hubbard he found the deuce to pay the descendants of iberian bandits and hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch to the outraged vision of dry valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them perhaps they numbered five or six between the rows of green plants they were stooped hopping about like toads gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit  dry valley slipped into the house got his whip and charged the marauders the lash curled about the legs of the nearesta greedy tenyearoldbefore they knew they were discovered his screech gave warning and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral dry valleys whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vineclad fence and disappeared  dry valley less fleet followed them nearly to the pickets checking his useless pursuit he rounded a bush dropped his whip and stood voiceless motionless the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular  behind the bush stood panchita obrien scorning to fly she was nineteen the oldest of the raiders her nightblack hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon she stood with reluctant feet yet nearer the brook than to the river for childhood had environed and detained her  she looked at dry valley johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying conscious motion such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade there she turned again and grilled dry valley johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes laughed a trifle schoolgirlishly and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the obrien side of the wild gourd vine  dry valley picked up his whip and went into his house he stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps the old mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms dry valley went on stumbled down the front steps out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town he sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear one by one this was his attitude of thought acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water  a thing had happened to the mana thing that if you are eligible you must pray may pass you by he had become enveloped in the indian summer of the soul  dry valley had had no youth even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness at six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his fathers ranch with silent disapproval his life as a young man had been wasted the divine fires and impulses the glorious exaltations and despairs the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head never a thrill of romeo had he known he was but a melancholy jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy lacking the bittersweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of arden and now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of panchita obrien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat  but a sheepman is a hardy animal dry valley johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer spiritual or real old he would show them  by the next mail went an order to san antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes colours and styles and prices no object the next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper for dry valleys sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears  dry valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers then a few days later he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness  a jaybirdblue tennis suit covered him outwardly almost as far as his wrists and ankles his shirt was oxblood his collar winged and tall his necktie a floating oriflamme his shoes a venomous bright tan pointed and shaped on penitential lasts a little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weatherbeaten head lemoncoloured kid gloves protected his oaktough hands from the benignant may sunshine this sad and opticsmiting creature teetered out of its den smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see to such a pass had dry valley johnson been brought by cupid who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of momus reconstructing mythology he had risen a prismatic macaw from the ashes of the greybrown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of santa rosa  dry valley paused in the street to allow santa rosans within sight of him to be stunned and then deliberately and slowly as his shoes required entered mrs obriens gate  not until the eleven months drought did santa rosa cease talking about dry valley johnsons courtship of panchita obrien it was an unclassifiable procedure something like a combination of cake walking deafanddumb oratory postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades it lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end  of course mrs obrien favoured the match as soon as dry valleys intentions were disclosed being the mother of a woman child and therefore a charter member of the ancient order of the rattrap she joyfully decked out panchita for the sacrifice the girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese it was nice too to have as good a match as mr johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him  dry valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in san antonio every day he drove out with panchita he was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving the consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb the feeling that panchita was there kept him happy  he took her to parties and dances and to church he triedoh no man ever tried so hard to be young as dry valley did he could not dance but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions a smile that in him was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning handsprings would be in another he began to seek the company of the young men in the towneven of the boys they accepted him as a decided damper for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with panchita  the end came suddenly in one day as often disappears the false afterglow before a november sky and wind  dry valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk an afternoon walk in santa rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of ones wardrobe so dry valley began gorgeously to array himself and so early that he finished early and went over to the obrien cottage as he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within he stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door  panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters she wore a mans clothesno doubt those of the late mr obrien on her head was the smallest brothers straw hat decorated with an inkstriped paper band on her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade the same material covered her shoes giving them the semblance of tan leather high collar and flowing necktie were not omitted  panchita was an actress dry valley saw his affectedly youthful gait his limp where the right shoe hurt him his forced smile his awkward simulation of a gallant air all reproduced with startling fidelity for the first time a mirror had been held up to him the corroboration of one of the youngsters calling mamma come and see pancha do like mr johnson was not needed  as softly as the caricatured tans would permit dry valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again  twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin trim white lawn and sailor hat she strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at dry valleys gate her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency  then out of his door and down the walk strodenot the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime but the sheepman rehabilitated he wore his old grey woolen shirt open at the throat his brown duck trousers stuffed into his runover boots and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head twenty years or fifty he might look dry valley cared not his light blue eyes met panchitas dark ones with a cold flash in them he came as far as the gate he pointed with his long arm to her house  go home said dry valley go home to your mother i wonder lightnin dont strike a fool like me go home and play in the sand what business have you got cavortin around with grown men i reckon i was locoed to be makin a he pollparrot out of myself for a kid like you go home and dont let me see you no more why i done it will somebody tell me go home and let me try and forget it  panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home saying nothing for some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon dry valleys at her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house  old antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove dry valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly  im a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin stuck on a kid aint i tonia said he  not verree good thing agreed antonia sagely for too much old man to likee muchacha  you bet it aint said dry valley grimly its dum foolishness and besides it hurts  he brought at one armful the regalia of his aberrationthe blue tennis suit shoes hat gloves and all and threw them in a pile at antonias feet  give them to your old man said he to hunt antelope in  just as the first star presided palely over the twilight dry valley got his biggest strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light he thought he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch he laid aside the book got his whip and hurried forth to see  it was panchita she had slipped through the picket fence and was halfway across the patch she stopped when she saw him and looked at him without wavering  a sudden ragea humiliating flush of unreasoning wrathcame over dry valley for this child he had made himself a motley to the view he had tried to bribe time to turn backward for himself he hadbeen made a fool of at last he had seen his folly there was a gulf between him and youth over which he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves to protect his hands and the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin prankscoming to plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboyroused all his anger  i told you to keep away from here said dry valley go back to your home  panchita moved slowly toward him  dry valley cracked his whip  go back home said dry valley savagely and play theatricals some more youd make a fine man youve made a fine one of me  she came a step nearer silent and with that strange defiant steady shine in her eyes that had always puzzled him now it stirred his wrath  his whiplash whistled through the air he saw a red streak suddenly come out through her white dress above her knee where it had struck  without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes panchita came steadily toward him through the strawberry vines dry valleys trembling hand released his whip handle when within a yard of him panchita stretched out her arms  god kid stammered dry valley do you mean  but the seasons are versatile and it may have been springtime after all instead of indian summer that struck dry valley johnson    xvii  christmas by injunction  cherokee was the civic father of yellowhammer yellowhammer was a new mining town constructed mainly of canvas and undressed pine cherokee was a prospector one day while his burro was eating quartz and pine burrs cherokee turned up with his pick a nugget weighing thirty ounces he staked his claim and then being a man of breadth and hospitality sent out invitations to his friends in three states to drop in and share his luck  not one of the invited guests sent regrets they rolled in from the gila country from salt river from the pecos from albuquerque and phoenix and santa fe and from the camps intervening  when a thousand citizens had arrived and taken up claims they named the town yellowhammer appointed a vigilance committee and presented cherokee with a watchchain made of nuggets  three hours after the presentation ceremonies cherokees claim played out he had located a pocket instead of a vein he abandoned it and staked others one by one luck had kissed her hand to him never afterward did he turn up enough dust in yellowhammer to pay his bar bill but his thousand invited guests were mostly prospering and cherokee smiled and congratulated them  yellowhammer was made up of men who took off their hats to a smiling loser so they invited cherokee to say what he wanted  me said cherokee oh grubstakes will be about the thing i reckon ill prospect along up in the mariposas if i strike it up there i will most certainly let you all know about the facts i never was any hand to hold out cards on my friends  in may cherokee packed his burro and turned its thoughtful mouse coloured forehead to the north many citizens escorted him to the undefined limits of yellowhammer and bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and farewells five pocket flasks without an air bubble between contents and cork were forced upon him and he was bidden to consider yellowhammer in perpetual commission for his bed bacon and eggs and hot water for shaving in the event that luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the mariposas  the name of the father of yellowhammer was given him by the gold hunters in accordance with their popular system of nomenclature it was not necessary for a citizen to exhibit his baptismal certificate in order to acquire a cognomen a mans name was his personal property for convenience in calling him up to the bar and in designating him among other blueshirted bipeds a temporary appellation title or epithet was conferred upon him by the public personal peculiarities formed the source of the majority of such informal baptisms many were easily dubbed geographically from the regions from which they confessed to have hailed some announced themselves to be thompsons and adamses and the like with a brazenness and loudness that cast a cloud upon their titles a few vaingloriously and shamelessly uncovered their proper and indisputable names this was held to be unduly arrogant and did not win popularity one man who said he was chesterton l c belmont and proved it by letters was given till sundown to leave the town such names as shorty bowlegs texas lazy bill thirsty rogers limping riley the judge and california ed were in favour cherokee derived his title from the fact that he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the indian nation  on the twentieth day of december baldy the mail rider brought yellowhammer a piece of news  what do i see in albuquerque said baldy to the patrons of the bar but cherokee all embellished and festooned up like the czar of turkey and lavishin money in bulk him and me seen the elephant and the owl and we had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine and cherokee he audits all the bills cod his pockets looked like a pool tables after a fifteenball run  cherokee must have struck pay ore remarked california ed well hes white im much obliged to him for his success  seems like cherokee would ramble down to yellowhammer and see his friends said another slightly aggrieved but thats the way prosperity is the finest cure there is for lost forgetfulness  you wait said baldy im comin to that cherokee strikes a three foot vein up in the mariposas that assays a trip to europe to the ton and he closes it out to a syndicate outfit for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash then he buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat and a red sleigh and what do you think he takes it in his head to do next  chuckaluck said texas whose ideas of recreation were the gamesters  come and kiss me ma honey sang shorty who carried tintypes in his pocket and wore a red necktie while working on his claim  bought a saloon suggested thirsty rogers  cherokee took me to a room continued baldy and showed me hes got that room full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumpingjacks and toy lambs and whistles and such infantile truck and what do you think hes goin to do with them inefficacious knick knacks dont surmise nonecherokee told me hes goin to lead em up in his red sleigh andwait a minute dont order no drinks yet hes goin to drive down here to yellowhammer and give the kidsthe kids of this here townthe biggest christmas tree and the biggest cryin doll and little giant boys tool chest blowout that was ever seen west of the cape hatteras  two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of baldys words it was broken by the house who happily conceiving the moment to be ripe for extending hospitality sent a dozen whisky glasses spinning down the bar with the slower travelling bottle bringing up the rear  didnt you tell him asked the miner called trinidad  well no answered baldy pensively i never exactly seen my way to  you see cherokee had this christmas mess already bought and paid for and he was all flattered up with selfesteem over his idea and we had in a way flew the flume with that fizzy wine i speak of so i never let on  i cannot refrain from a certain amount of surprise said the judge as he hung his ivoryhandled cane on the bar that our friend cherokee should possess such an erroneous conception ofahhis as it were own town  oh it aint the eighth wonder of the terrestrial world said baldy cherokees been gone from yellowhammer over seven months lots of things could happen in that time hows he to know that there aint a single kid in this town and so far as emigration is concerned none expected  come to think of it remarked california ed its funny some aint drifted in town aint settled enough yet for to bring in the rubber ring brigade i reckon  to top off this christmastree splurge of cherokees went on baldy hes goin to give an imitation of santa claus hes got a white wig and whiskers that disfigure him up exactly like the pictures of this william cullen longfellow in the books and a red suit of furtrimmed outside underwear and eightounce gloves and a standup laydown croshayed red cap aint it a shame that a outfit like that cant get a chance to connect with a annie and willies prayer layout  when does cherokee allow to come over with his truck inquired trinidad  mornin before christmas said baldy and he wants you folks to have a room fixed up and a tree hauled and ready and such ladies to assist as can stop breathin long enough to let it be a surprise for the kids  the unblessed condition of yellowhammer had been truly described the voice of childhood had never gladdened its flimsy structures the patter of restless little feet had never consecrated the one rugged highway between the two rows of tents and rough buildings later they would come but now yellowhammer was but a mountain camp and nowhere in it were the roguish expectant eyes opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day the eager small hands to reach for santas bewildering hoard the elated childish voicings of the seasons joy such as the coming good things of the warmhearted cherokee deserved  of women there were five in yellowhammer the assayers wife the proprietress of the lucky strike hotel and a laundress whose washtub panned out an ounce of dust a day these were the permanent feminines the remaining two were the spangler sisters misses fanchon and erma of the transcontinental comedy company then playing in repertoire at the improvised empire theatre but of children there were none sometimes miss fanchon enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood but between her delineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy offered as eligible recipients of cherokees holiday stores there seemed to be fixed a gulf  christmas would come on thursday on tuesday morning trinidad instead of going to work sought the judge at the lucky strike hotel  itll be a disgrace to yellowhammer said trinidad if it throws cherokee down on his christmas tree blowout you might say that that man made this town for one im goin to see what can be done to give santa claus a square deal  my cooperation said the judge would be gladly forthcoming i am indebted to cherokee for past favours but i do not seei have heretofore regarded the absence of children rather as a luxurybut in this instancestill i do not see  look at me said trinidad and youll see old ways and means with the fur on im goin to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for cherokees santa claus act if i have to rob an orphan asylum  eureka cried the judge enthusiastically  no you didnt said trinidad decidedly i found it myself i learned about that latin word at school  i will accompany you declared the judge waving his cane perhaps such eloquence and gift of language as i possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend themselves to our project  within an hour yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of trinidad and the judge and approved it citizens who knew of families with offspring within a fortymile radius of yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information trinidad made careful notes of all such and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team  the first stop scheduled was at a double loghouse fifteen miles out from yellowhammer a man opened the door at trinidads hail and then came down and leaned upon the rickety gate the doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters some ragged all full of curiosity and health  its this way explained trinidad were from yellowhammer and we come kidnappin in a gentle kind of a way one of our leading citizens is stung with the santa claus affliction and hes due in town tomorrow with half the folderols thats painted red and made in germany the youngest kid we got in yellowhammer packs a fortyfive and a safety razor consequently were mighty shy on anybody to say oh and ah when we light the candles on the christmas tree now partner if youll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return em safe and sound on christmas day and theyll come back loaded down with a good time and swiss family robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials what do you say  in other words said the judge we have discovered for the first time in our embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence the season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender  i understand said the parent packing his pipe with a forefinger i guess i neednt detain you gentlemen me and the old woman have got seven kids so to speak and runnin my mind over the bunch i dont appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take over to your doins the old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest and we allow to give christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style no i couldnt with any degree of avidity seem to fall in with the idea of lettin none of em go thank you kindly gentlemen  down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranchhouse of wiley wilson trinidad recited his appeal and the judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony mrs wiley gathered her two rosycheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had seen wiley laugh and shake his head again a refusal  trinidad and the judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in among the hills they spent the night at a stage road hostelry and set out again early the next morning the wagon had not acquired a single passenger  its creepin upon my faculties remarked trinidad that borrowin kids at christmas is somethin like tryin to steal butter from a man thats got hot pancakes acomin  it is undoubtedly an indisputable fact said the judge that the ahfamily ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year  on the day before christmas they drove thirty miles making four fruitless halts and appeals everywhere they found kids at a premium  the sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her unavailable progeny behind her and said  theres a woman thats just took charge of the railroad eatin house down at granite junction i hear shes got a little boy maybe she might let him go  trinidad pulled up his mules at granite junction at five oclock in the afternoon the train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers  on the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette the diningroom had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites a youngish woman reclined exhausted in a chair her face wore sharp lines of worry she had once possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return trinidad set forth his mission  id count it a mercy if youd take bobby for a while she said wearily im on the go from morning till night and i dont have time to tend to him hes learning bad habits from the men itll be the only chance hell have to get any christmas  the men went outside and conferred with bobby trinidad pictured the glories of the christmas tree and presents in lively colours  and moreover my young friend added the judge santa claus himself will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of bethlehem to  aw come off said the boy squinting his small eyes i aint no kid there aint any santa claus its your folks that buys toys and sneaks em in when youre asleep and they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like santas sleigh tracks  that might be so argued trinidad but christmas trees aint no fairy tale this ones goin to look like the tencent store in albuquerque all strung up in a redwood theres tops and drums and noahs arks and  oh rats said bobby wearily i cut them out long ago id like to have a riflenot a target onea real one to shoot wildcats with but i guess you wont have any of them on your old tree  well i cant say for sure said trinidad diplomatically it might be you go along with us and see  the hope thus held out though faint won the boys hesitating consent to go with this solitary beneficiary for cherokees holiday bounty the canvassers spun along the homeward road  in yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have passed as the bower of an arizona fairy the ladies had done their work well a tall christmas tree covered to the topmost branch with candles spangles and toys sufficient for more than a score of children stood in the centre of the floor near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for the returning team of the childproviders at noon that day cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and bales of all sizes and shapes so intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice no one gave away the humiliating state of yellowhammer for the efforts of trinidad and the judge were expected to supply the deficiency  when the sun went down cherokee with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned face went into retirement with the bundle containing the santa claus raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts  when the kids are rounded up he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee light up the candles on the tree and set em to playin pussy wants a corner and king william when they get good and at it whyold santall slide in the door i reckon therell be plenty of gifts to go round  the ladies were flitting about the tree giving it final touches that were never final the spangled sisters were there in costume as lady violet de vere and marie the maid in their new drama the miners bride the theatre did not open until nine and they were welcome assistants of the christmas tree committee every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for the approach of trinidads team and now this became an anxious function for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree and cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his kriss kringle garb  at length the wagon of the child rustlers rattled down the street to the door the ladies with little screams of excitement flew to the lighting of the candles the men of yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups  trinidad and the judge bearing the marks of protracted travel entered conducting between them a single impish boy who stared with sullen pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree  where are the other children asked the assayers wife the acknowledged leader of all social functions  maam said trinidad with a sigh prospectin for kids at christmas time is like huntin in a limestone for silver this parental business is one that i havent no chance to comprehend it seems that fathers and mothers are willin for their offsprings to be drownded stole fed on poison oak and et by catamounts 364 days in the year but on christmas day they insists on enjoyin the exclusive mortification of their company this here young biped maam is all that washes out of our two days manoeuvres  oh the sweet little boy cooed miss erma trailing her de vere robes to centre of stage  aw shut up said bobby with a scowl whos a kid you aint you bet  fresh brat breathed miss erma beneath her enamelled smile  we done the best we could said trinidad its tough on cherokee but it cant be helped  then the door opened and cherokee entered in the conventional dress of saint nick a white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes over his shoulder he carried a pack  no one stirred as he came in even the spangler sisters ceased their coquettish poses and stared curiously at the tall figure bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree cherokee put down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere to be loosed upon his entrance he went up to bobby and extended his redmittened hand  merry christmas little boy said cherokee anything on the tree you want theyll get it down for you wont you shake hands with santa claus  there aint any santa claus whined the boy youve got old false billy goats whiskers on your face i aint no kid what do i want with dolls and tin horses the driver said youd have a rifle and you havent i want to go home  trinidad stepped into the breach he shook cherokees hand in warm greeting  im sorry cherokee he explained there never was a kid in yellowhammer we tried to rustle a bunch of em for your swaree but this sardine was all we could catch hes a atheist and he dont believe in santa claus its a shame for you to be out all this truck but me and the judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks  thats all right said cherokee gravely the expense dont amount to nothin worth mentionin we can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away i dont know what i was thinkin about but it never occurred to my cogitations that there wasnt any kids in yellowhammer  meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation of a pleasure gathering  bobby had retreated to a distant chair and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui plastered thick upon him cherokee lingering with his original idea went over and sat beside him  where do you live little boy he asked respectfully  granite junction said bobby without emphasis  the room was warm cherokee took off his cap and then removed his beard and wig  say exclaimed bobby with a show of interest i know your mug all right  did you ever see me before asked cherokee  i dont know but ive seen your picture lots of times  where  the boy hesitated on the bureau at home he answered  lets have your name if you please buddy  robert lumsden the picture belongs to my mother she puts it under her pillow of nights and once i saw her kiss it i wouldnt but women are that way  cherokee rose and beckoned to trinidad  keep this boy by you till i come back he said im goin to shed these christmas duds and hitch up my sleigh im goin to take this kid home  well infidel said trinidad taking cherokees vacant chair and so you are too superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys it seems  i dont like you said bobby with acrimony you said there would be a rifle a fellow cant even smoke i wish i was at home  cherokee drove his sleigh to the door and they lifted bobby in beside him the team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow cherokee had on his 500 overcoat of baby sealskin the laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet  bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match  throw that cigarette away said cherokee in a quiet but new voice  bobby hesitated and then dropped the cylinder overboard  throw the box too commanded the new voice  more reluctantly the boy obeyed  say said bobby presently i like you i dont know why nobody never made me do anything i didnt want to do before  tell me kid said cherokee not using his new voice are you sure your mother kissed that picture that looks like me  dead sure i seen her do it  didnt you remark somethin a while ago about wanting a rifle  you bet i did will you get me one  tomorrowsilvermounted  cherokee took out his watch  halfpast nine well hit the junction plumb on time with christmas day are you cold sit closer son    xviii  a chaparral prince  nine oclock at last and the drudging toil of the day was ended lena climbed to her room in the third halfstory of the quarrymens hotel since daylight she had slaved doing the work of a fullgrown woman scrubbing the floors washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups making the beds and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing hostelry  the din of the days quarrying was overthe blasting and drilling the creaking of the great cranes the shouts of the foremen the backing and shifting of the flatcars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers heavy odours of stewed meat hot grease and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house  lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair she was eleven years old thin and illnourished her back and limbs were sore and aching but the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble the last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders they had taken away grimm always at night however tired she might be she had turned to grimm for comfort and hope each time had grimm whispered to her that the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment every night she had taken fresh courage and strength from grimm  to whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition the woodcutters lost child the unhappy goose girl the persecuted stepdaughter the little maiden imprisoned in the witchs hutall these were but transparent disguises for lena the overworked kitchenmaid in the quarrymens hotel and always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue  so here in the ogres castle enslaved by a wicked spell lena had leaned upon grimm and waited longing for the powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from ones mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is  lenas home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people  thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lenas father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his wellguarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogres castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and thento have grimm taken away from you  lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballingers tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballingers every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lenas window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters  the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote    dearest mammai want so much to see you and gretel and claus   and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you   today i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could   not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book   yesterday i mean grimms fairy tales which uncle leo gave me   it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as   well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little   bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to   do unless you send for me tomorrow to bring me home i shall go   to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to   drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one   else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you   will excuse me mamma if i do it  your respectful and loving daughter lena   tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor  at 1030 oclock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road  old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritzs team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritzs big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballingers the mailcarrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballingers  while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon  fritz bergmann was a man of three sentimentsor to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller  tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again  yes said old man ballinger thars a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say  in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the closefist of a peter hildesmullersome day i shall with a big club pound that mans dummkopfall in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballingeryour feets will take cold out in the night air  so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive  up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer  these fancies occupied the mind of the mailcarrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballingers here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen  donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voicewass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail  hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice dont you know when youre in a stickup reverse your mules and climb out of the cart  it is due to the breadth of hondo bills demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz  the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers  trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tendermouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists  villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans  yiyi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sourkrout offn me  one of the band yanked fritz back by the coattail and the woods rang with rattlesnakes vociferous comments  the doggoned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably hes not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didnt he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dadblamed little limburger he went for me didnt he whoa now muleyi aint agoin to hurt your mouth agin any more  perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils  say cap he said addressing hondo bill theres likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks ive done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints theres big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before theyd pay the banks to handle the money  hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail  you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what dyou mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at  the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondos knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lenas letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared  much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess thats the letter we want got spondulicks in it aint it here she is make a light boys  hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script  whatever is this youve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter thats a mighty lowdown trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail  thats chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondos shoulder  youre off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating thats shorthand i see em do it once in court  ach no no nodot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter  what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you aint presumin to insinuate that we gents aint possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the misss health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society  hondo twirled his sixshooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently  how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done  eleven said fritz  and where is she at  at dose rock quarriesworking ach mein gottlittle lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun  you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand youre a hell of a sect of people i reckon well fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys  hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by  we aint going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twont hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespieltnixcumrous dutchy dont get any more impatience  fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pellmell back along the fredericksburg road  for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands  hit it out for home dutch said hondo bills voice commandingly youve given us lots of trouble and were pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose  hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt  the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure  according to schedule time he should have reached fredericksburg at daylight as it was he drove down the long street of the town at eleven oclock am he had to pass peter hildesmullers house on his way to the postoffice he stopped his team at the gate and called but frau hildesmuller was watching for him out rushed the whole family of hildesmullers  frau hildesmuller fat and flushed inquired if he had a letter from lena and then fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure he told the contents of that letter that the robber had made him read and then frau hildesmuller broke into wild weeping her little lena drown herself why had they sent her from home what could be done perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now peter hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces  woman he roared at his wife why did you let that child go away it is your fault if she comes home to us no more  every one knew that it was peter hildesmullers fault so they paid no attention to his words  a moment afterward a strange faint voice was heard to call mamma frau hildesmuller at first thought it was lenas spirit calling and then she rushed to the rear of fritzs covered wagon and with a loud shriek of joy caught up lena herself covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs lenas eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see there among the mail sacks covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters she had lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her  fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles  gott in himmel he shouted how did you get in that wagon am i going crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day  you brought her to us fritz cried frau hildesmuller how can we ever thank you enough  tell mamma how you came in fritzs wagon said frau hildesmuller  i dont know said lena but i know how i got away from the hotel the prince brought me  by the emperors crown shouted fritz we are all going crazy  i always knew he would come said lena sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogres castle they broke the dishes and kicked down the doors they pitched mr maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over mrs maloney the workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns they wakened me up and i peeped down the stair and then the prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out he was so tall and strong and fine his face was as rough as a scrubbing brush and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps he took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights he held me close and i went to sleep that way and didnt wake up till i got home  rubbish cried fritz bergmann fairy tales how did you come from the quarries to my wagon  the prince brought me said lena confidently  and to this day the good people of fredericksburg havent been able to make her give any other explanation    xix  the reformation of calliope  calliope catesby was in his humours again ennui was upon him this goodly promontory the earthparticularly that portion of it known as quicksandwas to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours overtaken by the megrims the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy my lady find solace in tears the flaccid easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of quicksand calliope especially was wont to express his ennui according to his lights  over night calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits he had kicked his own dog on the porch of the occidental hotel and refused to apologise he had become capricious and faultfinding in conversation while strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely that was always an ominous act another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases a husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones a dangerous courtesy marked his manners later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under  at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliopes melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvesters tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure  a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other timesquiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace  and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pinebox whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a lifelong study of the art of truculence  at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and crisscrossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksands main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his sloganthat fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his fortyfive by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weathercock on judge rileys lemon and ultramarine twostory residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes  the artillery was in trim calliopes hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand  down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terrors guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliopes low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliopes and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased  but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesbys love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliopes impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturbers misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit  buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little tenby twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliopes leaden jocularities  gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign dont have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down hes a nogood un its up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and dont git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits  buck patterson tall muscular and solemnfaced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible  the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some drygoods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a wellexecuted detour  the first volley broke the lock of one of calliopes guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind  and now calliope met the enemys tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a doublequick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that directionone of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it  not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers  calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshals crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door  patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliopes bullets  the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes  standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliopes fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshals trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side  the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away  abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence    at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk  there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of

lighting with a proud and wonderful smile she reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one of her sons then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waitingroom tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age  i aint seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price

wall he was a rugged man bigboned and straight his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshals badge upon the others breast  yes yes youll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you dont get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while

kind and bedient and wellbehaved wont you let me advise you sir not to do so no more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet  the blackmitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother  what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talks all right  the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of threescore years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake  i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place id follow it if i was a drunken desprate character without shame or hope id follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine id say marshal im willin to swear if youll give me the chance ill quit the racket ill drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and wont play hoss no more ill be a good citizen

mine i see a man settin it on the platform jest as i seen sons face in the window and it went plum out of my head theres eight jars of homemade quince jam in that trunk that i made myself i wouldnt

window acomin in she never had heard a word bout my tough ways i didnt have the nerve to let her know i was a worthless cuss bein hunted down by the community there you was lyin where my shot laid you
