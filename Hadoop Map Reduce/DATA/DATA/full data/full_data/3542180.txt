ludgate hill   within sight of cape race       note   this volume of papers unconnected as they are it will be better to read through from the beginning rather than dip into at random a certain thread of meaning binds them memories of childhood and youth portraits of those who have gone before us in the battletaken together they build up a face that i have loved long since and lost awhile the face of what was once myself this has come by accident i had no design at first to be autobiographical i was but led away by the charm of beloved memories and by regret for the irrevocable dead and when my own young face which is a face of the dead also began to appear in the well as by a kind of magic i was the first to be surprised at the occurrence  my grandfather the pious child my father the idle eager sentimental youth i have thus unconsciously exposed of their descendant the person of today i wish to keep the secret not because i love him better but because with him i am still in a business partnership and cannot divide interests  of the papers which make up the volume some have appeared already in the cornhill longmans scribner the english illustrated the magazine of art the contemporary review three are here in print for the first time and two others have enjoyed only what may be regarded as a private circulation                                                             r l s       memories and portraits     i    the foreigner at home    this is no my ain house     i ken by the biggin ot   two recent books1 one by mr grant white on england one on france by the diabolically clever mr hillebrand may well have set people thinking on the divisions of races and nations such thoughts should arise with particular congruity and force to inhabitants of that united kingdom peopled from so many different stocks babbling so many different dialects and offering in its extent such singular contrasts from the busiest overpopulation to the unkindliest desert from the black country to the moor of rannoch it is not only when we cross the seas that we go abroad there are foreign parts of england and the race that has conquered so wide an empire has not yet managed to assimilate the islands whence she sprang ireland wales and the scottish mountains still cling in part to their old gaelic speech it was but the other day that english triumphed in cornwall and they still show in mousehole on st michaels bay the house of the last cornishspeaking woman english itself which will now frank the traveller through the most of north america through the greater south sea islands in india along much of the coast of africa and in the ports of china and japan is still to be heard in its home country in half a hundred varying stages of transition you may go all over the states andsetting aside the actual intrusion and influence of foreigners negro french or chineseyou shall scarce meet with so marked a difference of accent as in the forty miles between edinburgh and glasgow or of dialect as in the hundred miles between edinburgh and aberdeen book english has gone round the world but at home we still preserve the racy idioms of our fathers and every county in some parts every dale has its own quality of speech vocal or verbal in like manner local custom and prejudice even local religion and local law linger on into the latter end of the nineteenth centuryimperia in imperio foreign things at home  in spite of these promptings to reflection ignorance of his neighbours is the character of the typical john bull his is a domineering nature steady in fight imperious to command but neither curious nor quick about the life of others in french colonies and still more in the dutch i have read that there is an immediate and lively contact between the dominant and the dominated race that a certain sympathy is begotten or at the least a transfusion of prejudices making life easier for both but the englishman sits apart bursting with pride and ignorance he figures among his vassals in the hour of peace with the same disdainful air that led him on to victory a passing enthusiasm for some foreign art or fashion may deceive the world it cannot impose upon his intimates he may be amused by a foreigner as by a monkey but he will never condescend to study him with any patience miss bird an authoress with whom i profess myself in love declares all the viands of japan to be uneatablea staggering pretension so when the prince of waless marriage was celebrated at mentone by a dinner to the mentonese it was proposed to give them solid english fareroast beef and plum pudding and no tomfoolery here we have either pole of the britannic folly we will not eat the food of any foreigner nor when we have the chance will we suffer him to eat of it himself the same spirit inspired miss birds american missionaries who had come thousands of miles to change the faith of japan and openly professed their ignorance of the religions they were trying to supplant  i quote an american in this connection without scruple uncle sam is better than john bull but he is tarred with the english stick for mr grant white the states are the new england states and nothing more he wonders at the amount of drinking in london let him try san francisco he wittily reproves english ignorance as to the status of women in america but has he not himself forgotten wyoming the name yankee of which he is so tenacious is used over the most of the great union as a term of reproach the yankee states of which he is so staunch a subject are but a drop in the bucket and we find in his book a vast virgin ignorance of the life and prospects of america every view partial parochial not raised to the horizon the moral feeling proper at the largest to a clique of states and the whole scope and atmosphere not american but merely yankee i will go far beyond him in reprobating the assumption and the incivility of my countryfolk to their cousins from beyond the sea i grill in my blood over the silly rudeness of our newspaper articles and i do not know where to look when i find myself in company with an american and see my countrymen unbending to him as to a performing dog but in the case of mr grant white example were better than precept wyoming is after all more readily accessible to mr white than boston to the english and the new england selfsufficiency no better justified than the britannic  it is so perhaps in all countries perhaps in all men are most ignorant of the foreigners at home john bull is ignorant of the states he is probably ignorant of india but considering his opportunities he is far more ignorant of countries nearer his own door there is one country for instanceits frontier not so far from london its people closely akin its language the same in all essentials with the englishof which i will go bail he knows nothing his ignorance of the sister kingdom cannot be described it can only be illustrated by anecdote i once travelled with a man of plausible manners and good intelligencea university man as the phrase goesa man besides who had taken his degree in life and knew a thing or two about the age we live in we were deep in talk whirling between peterborough and london among other things he began to describe some piece of legal injustice he had recently encountered and i observed in my innocence that things were not so in scotland i beg your pardon said he this is a matter of law he had never heard of the scots law nor did he choose to be informed the law was the same for the whole country he told me roundly every child knew that at last to settle matters i explained to him that i was a member of a scottish legal body and had stood the brunt of an examination in the very law in question thereupon he looked me for a moment full in the face and dropped the conversation this is a monstrous instance if you like but it does not stand alone in the experience of scots  england and scotland differ indeed in law in history in religion in education and in the very look of nature and mens faces not always widely but always trenchantly many particulars that struck mr grant white a yankee struck me a scot no less forcibly he and i felt ourselves foreigners on many common provocations2  a scotsman may tramp the better part of europe and the united states and never again receive so vivid an impression of foreign travel and strange lands and manners as on his first excursion into england the change from a hilly to a level country strikes him with delighted wonder along the flat horizon there arise the frequent venerable towers of churches he sees at the end of airy vistas the revolution of the windmill sails he may go where he pleases in the future he may see alps and pyramids and lions but it will be hard to beat the pleasure of that moment there are indeed few merrier spectacles than that of many windmills bickering together in a fresh breeze over a woody country their halting alacrity of movement their pleasant busyness making bread all day with uncouth gesticulations their air gigantically human as of a creature half alive put a spirit of romance into the tamest landscape when the scottish child sees them first he falls immediately in love and from that time forward windmills keep turning in his dreams and so in their degree with every feature of the life and landscape the warm habitable age of towns and hamlets the green settled ancient look of the country the lush hedgerows stiles and privy pathways in the fields the sluggish brimming rivers chalk and smockfrocks chimes of bells and the rapid pertlysounding english speechthey are all new to the curiosity they are all set to english airs in the childs story that he tells himself at night the sharp edge of novelty wears off the feeling is blunted but i doubt whether it is ever killed rather it keeps returning ever the more rarely and strangely and even in scenes to which you have been long accustomed suddenly awakes and gives a relish to enjoyment or heightens the sense of isolation  one thing especially continues unfamiliar to the scotsmans eyethe domestic architecture the look of streets and buildings the quaint venerable age of many and the thin walls and warm colouring of all we have in scotland far fewer ancient buildings above all in country places and those that we have are all of hewn or harled masonry wood has been sparingly used in their construction the windowframes are sunken in the wall not flat to the front as in england the roofs are steeperpitched even a hill farm will have a massy square cold and permanent appearance english houses in comparison have the look of cardboard toys such as a puff might shatter and to this the scotsman never becomes used his eye can never rest consciously on one of these brick housesrickles of brick as he might call themor on one of these flatchested streets but he is instantly reminded where he is and instantly travels back in fancy to his home this is no my ain house i ken by the biggin ot and yet perhaps it is his own bought with his own money the key of it long polished in his pocket but it has not yet been and never will be thoroughly adopted by his imagination nor does he cease to remember that in the whole length and breadth of his native country there was no building even distantly resembling it  but it is not alone in scenery and architecture that we count england foreign the constitution of society the very pillars of the empire surprise and even pain us the dull neglected peasant sunk in matter insolent gross and servile makes a startling contrast with our own longlegged longheaded thoughtful biblequoting ploughman a week or two in such a place as suffolk leaves the scotsman gasping it seems incredible that within the boundaries of his own island a class should have been thus forgotten even the educated and intelligent who hold our own opinions and speak in our own words yet seem to hold them with a difference or from another reason and to speak on all things with less interest and conviction the first shock of english society is like a cold plunge it is possible that the scot comes looking for too much and to be sure his first experiment will be in the wrong direction yet surely his complaint is grounded surely the speech of englishmen is too often lacking in generous ardour the better part of the man too often withheld from the social commerce and the contact of mind with mind evaded as with terror a scottish peasant will talk more liberally out of his own experience he will not put you by with conversational counters and small jests he will give you the best of himself like one interested in life and mans chief end a scotsman is vain interested in himself and others eager for sympathy setting forth his thoughts and experience in the best light the egoism of the englishman is selfcontained he does not seek to proselytise he takes no interest in scotland or the scots and what is the unkindest cut of all he does not care to justify his indifference give him the wages of going on and being an englishman that is all he asks and in the meantime while you continue to associate he would rather be reminded of your baser origin compared with the grand treelike selfsufficiency of his demeanour the vanity and curiosity of the scot seem uneasy vulgar and immodest that you should continually try to establish human and serious relations that you should actually feel an interest in john bull and desire and invite a return of interest from him may argue something more awake and lively in your mind but it still puts you in the attitude of a suitor and a poor relation thus even the lowest class of the educated english towers over a scotsman by the head and shoulders  different indeed is the atmosphere in which scottish and english youth begin to look about them come to themselves in life and gather up those first apprehensions which are the material of future thought and to a great extent the rule of future conduct i have been to school in both countries and i found in the boys of the north something at once rougher and more tender at once more reserve and more expansion a greater habitual distance chequered by glimpses of a nearer intimacy and on the whole wider extremes of temperament and sensibility the boy of the south seems more wholesome but less thoughtful he gives himself to games as to a business striving to excel but is not readily transported by imagination the type remains with me as cleaner in mind and body more active fonder of eating endowed with a lesser and a less romantic sense of life and of the future and more immersed in present circumstances and certainly for one thing english boys are younger for their age sabbath observance makes a series of grim and perhaps serviceable pauses in the tenor of scottish boyhooddays of great stillness and solitude for the rebellious mind when in the dearth of books and play and in the intervals of studying the shorter catechism the intellect and senses prey upon and test each other the typical english sunday with a huge midday dinner and the plethoric afternoon leads perhaps to different results about the very cradle of the scot there goes a hum of metaphysical divinity and the whole of two divergent systems is summed up not merely speciously in the two first questions of the rival catechisms the english tritely inquiring what is your name the scottish striking at the very roots of life with what is the chief end of man and answering nobly if obscurely to glorify god and to enjoy him for ever i do not wish to make an idol of the shorter catechism but the fact of such a question being asked opens to us scots a great field of speculation and the fact that it is asked of all of us from the peer to the ploughboy binds us more nearly together no englishman of byrons age character and history would have had patience for long theological discussions on the way to fight for greece but the daft gordon blood and the aberdonian schooldays kept their influence to the end we have spoken of the material conditions nor need much more be said of these of the land lying everywhere more exposed of the wind always louder and bleaker of the black roaring winters of the gloom of highlying old stone cities imminent on the windy seaboard compared with the level streets the warm colouring of the brick the domestic quaintness of the architecture among which english children begin to grow up and come to themselves in life as the stage of the university approaches the contrast becomes more express the english lad goes to oxford or cambridge there in an ideal world of gardens to lead a semiscenic life costumed disciplined and drilled by proctors nor is this to be regarded merely as a stage of education it is a piece of privilege besides and a step that separates him further from the bulk of his compatriots at an earlier age the scottish lad begins his greatly different experience of crowded classrooms of a gaunt quadrangle of a bell hourly booming over the traffic of the city to recall him from the publichouse where he has been lunching or the streets where he has been wandering fancyfree his college life has little of restraint and nothing of necessary gentility he will find no quiet clique of the exclusive studious and cultured no rotten borough of the arts all classes rub shoulders on the greasy benches the raffish young gentleman in gloves must measure his scholarship with the plain clownish laddie from the parish school they separate at the sessions end one to smoke cigars about a wateringplace the other to resume the labours of the field beside his peasant family the first muster of a college class in scotland is a scene of curious and painful interest so many lads fresh from the heather hang round the stove in cloddish embarrassment ruffled by the presence of their smarter comrades and afraid of the sound of their own rustic voices it was in these early days i think that professor blackie won the affection of his pupils putting these uncouth umbrageous students at their ease with ready human geniality thus at least we have a healthy democratic atmosphere to breathe in while at work even when there is no cordiality there is always a juxtaposition of the different classes and in the competition of study the intellectual power of each is plainly demonstrated to the other our tasks ended we of the north go forth as freemen into the humming lamplit city at five oclock you may see the last of us hiving from the college gates in the glare of the shopwindows under the green glimmer of the winter sunset the frost tingles in our blood no proctor lies in wait to intercept us till the bell sounds again we are the masters of the world and some portion of our lives is always saturday la trêve de dieu  nor must we omit the sense of the nature of his country and his countrys history gradually growing in the childs mind from story and from observation a scottish child hears much of shipwreck outlying iron skerries pitiless breakers and great sealights much of heathery mountains wild clans and hunted covenanters breaths come to him in song of the distant cheviots and the ring of foraying hoofs he glories in his hardfisted forefathers of the iron girdle and the handful of oatmeal who rode so swiftly and lived so sparely on their raids poverty illluck enterprise and constant resolution are the fibres of the legend of his countrys history the heroes and kings of scotland have been tragically fated the most marking incidents in scottish historyflodden darien or the fortyfivewere still either failures or defeats and the fall of wallace and the repeated reverses of the bruce combine with the very smallness of the country to teach rather a moral than a material criterion for life britain is altogether small the mere taproot of her extended empire scotland again which alone the scottish boy adopts in his imagination is but a little part of that and avowedly cold sterile and unpopulous it is not so for nothing i once seemed to have perceived in an american boy a greater readiness of sympathy for lands that are great and rich and growing like his own it proved to be quite otherwise a mere dumb piece of boyish romance that i had lacked penetration to divine but the error serves the purpose of my argument for i am sure at least that the heart of young scotland will be always touched more nearly by paucity of number and spartan poverty of life  so we may argue and yet the difference is not explained that shorter catechism which i took as being so typical of scotland was yet composed in the city of westminster the division of races is more sharply marked within the borders of scotland itself than between the countries galloway and buchan lothian and lochaber are like foreign parts yet you may choose a man from any of them and ten to one he shall prove to have the headmark of a scot a century and a half ago the highlander wore a different costume spoke a different language worshipped in another church held different morals and obeyed a different social constitution from his fellowcountrymen either of the south or north even the english it is recorded did not loathe the highlander and the highland costume as they were loathed by the remainder of the scots yet the highlander felt himself a scot he would willingly raid into the scottish lowlands but his courage failed him at the border and he regarded england as a perilous unhomely land when the black watch after years of foreign service returned to scotland veterans leaped out and kissed the earth at portpatrick they had been in ireland stationed among men of their own race and language where they were well liked and treated with affection but it was the soil of galloway that they kissed at the extreme end of the hostile lowlands among a people who did not understand their speech and who had hated harried and hanged them since the dawn of history last and perhaps most curious the sons of chieftains were often educated on the continent of europe they went abroad speaking gaelic they returned speaking not english but the broad dialect of scotland now what idea had they in their minds when they thus in thought identified themselves with their ancestral enemies what was the sense in which they were scottish and not english or scottish and not irish can a bare name be thus influential on the minds and affections of men and a political aggregation blind them to the nature of facts the story of the austrian empire would seem to answer no the far more galling business of ireland clinches the negative from nearer home is it common education common morals a common language or a common faith that join men into nations there were practically none of these in the case we are considering  the fact remains in spite of the difference of blood and language the lowlander feels himself the sentimental countryman of the highlander when they meet abroad they fall upon each others necks in spirit even at home there is a kind of clannish intimacy in their talk but from his compatriot in the south the lowlander stands consciously apart he has had a different training he obeys different laws he makes his will in other terms is otherwise divorced and married his eyes are not at home in an english landscape or with english houses his ear continues to remark the english speech and even though his tongue acquire the southern knack he will still have a strong scots accent of the mind   footnotes    1 1881    2 the previous pages from the opening of this essay down to     provocations are reprinted from the original edition of 1881 in     the reprints of which they still stand in the edinburgh edition     they were omitted and the essay began with a scotsmaned       ii    some college memories   i am asked to write something it is not specifically stated what to the profit and glory of my alma mater3 and the fact is i seem to be in very nearly the same case with those who addressed me for while i am willing enough to write something i know not what to write only one point i see that if i am to write at all it should be of the university itself and my own days under its shadow of the things that are still the same and of those that are already changed such talk in short as would pass naturally between a student of today and one of yesterday supposing them to meet and grow confidential  the generations pass away swiftly enough on the high seas of life more swiftly still in the little bubbling backwater of the quadrangle so that we see there on a scale startlingly diminished the flight of time and the succession of men i looked for my name the other day in last years casebook of the speculative naturally enough i looked for it near the end it was not there nor yet in the next column so that i began to think it had been dropped at press and when at last i found it mounted on the shoulders of so many successors and looking in that posture like the name of a man of ninety i was conscious of some of the dignity of years this kind of dignity of temporal precession is likely with prolonged life to become more familiar possibly less welcome but i felt it strongly then it is strongly on me now and i am the more emboldened to speak with my successors in the tone of a parent and a praiser of things past  for indeed that which they attend is but a fallen university it has doubtless some remains of good for human institutions decline by gradual stages but decline in spite of all seeming embellishments it does and what is perhaps more singular began to do so when i ceased to be a student thus by an odd chance i had the very last of the very best of alma mater the same thing i hear which makes it the more strange had previously happened to my father and if they are good and do not die something not at all unsimilar will be found in time to have befallen my successors of today of the specific points of change of advantage in the past of shortcoming in the present i must own that on a near examination they look wondrous cloudy the chief and far the most lamentable change is the absence of a certain lean ugly idle unpopular student whose presence was for me the gist and heart of the whole matter whose changing humours fine occasional purposes of good flinching acceptance of evil shiverings on wet eastwindy morning journeys up to class infinite yawnings during lecture and unquenchable gusto in the delights of truantry made up the sunshine and shadow of my college life you cannot fancy what you missed in missing him his virtues i make sure are inconceivable to his successors just as they were apparently concealed from his contemporaries for i was practically alone in the pleasure i had in his society poor soul i remember how much he was cast down at times and how life which had not yet begun seemed to be already at an end and hope quite dead and misfortune and dishonour like physical presences dogging him as he went and it may be worth while to add that these clouds rolled away in their season and that all clouds roll away at last and the troubles of youth in particular are things but of a moment so this student whom i have in my eye took his full share of these concerns and that very largely by his own fault but he still clung to his fortune and in the midst of much misconduct kept on in his own way learning how to work and at last to his wonder escaped out of the stage of studentship not openly shamed leaving behind him the university of edinburgh shorn of a good deal of its interest for myself  but while he is in more senses than one the first person he is by no means the only one whom i regret or whom the students of today if they knew what they had lost would regret also they have still tait to be surelong may they have himand they have still taits classroom cupola and all but think of what a different place it was when this youth of mine at least on roll days would be present on the benches and at the near end of the platform lindsay senior4 was airing his robust old age it is possible my successors may have never even heard of old lindsay but when he went a link snapped with the last century he had something of a rustic air sturdy and fresh and plain he spoke with a ripe eastcountry accent which i used to admire his reminiscences were all of journeys on foot or highways busy with postchaisesa scotland before steam he had seen the coal fire on the isle of may and he regaled me with tales of my own grandfather thus he was for me a mirror of things perished it was only in his memory that i could see the huge shock of flames of the may beacon stream to leeward and the watchers as they fed the fire lay hold unscorched of the windward bars of the furnace it was only thus that i could see my grandfather driving swiftly in a gig along the seaboard road from pittenweem to crail and for all his business hurry drawing up to speak goodhumouredly with those he met and now in his turn lindsay is gone also inhabits only the memories of other men till these shall follow him and figures in my reminiscences as my grandfather figured in his  today again they have professor butcher and i hear he has a prodigious deal of greek and they have professor chrystal who is a man filled with the mathematics and doubtless these are setoffs but they cannot change the fact that professor blackie has retired and that professor kelland is dead no mans education is complete or truly liberal who knew not kelland there were unutterable lessons in the mere sight of that frail old clerical gentleman lively as a boy kind like a fairy godfather and keeping perfect order in his class by the spell of that very kindness i have heard him drift into reminiscences in class time though not for long and give us glimpses of oldworld life in outoftheway english parishes when he was young thus playing the same part as lindsaythe part of the surviving memory signalling out of the dark backward and abysm of time the images of perished things but it was a part that scarce became him he somehow lacked the means for all his silver hair and worn face he was not truly old and he had too much of the unrest and petulant fire of youth and too much invincible innocence of mind to play the veteran well the time to measure him best to taste in the old phrase his gracious nature was when he received his class at home what a pretty simplicity would he then show trying to amuse us like children with toys and what an engaging nervousness of manner as fearing that his efforts might not succeed truly he made us all feel like children and like children embarrassed but at the same time filled with sympathy for the conscientious troubled elderboy who was working so hard to entertain us a theorist has held the view that there is no feature in man so telltale as his spectacles that the mouth may be compressed and the brow smoothed artificially but the sheen of the barnacles is diagnostic and truly it must have been thus with kelland for as i still fancy i behold him frisking actively about the platform pointer in hand that which i seem to see most clearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection i never knew but one other man who had if you will permit the phrase so kind a spectacle and that was dr appleton5 but the light in his case was tempered and passive in kellands it danced and changed and flashed vivaciously among the students like a perpetual challenge to goodwill  i cannot say so much about professor blackie for a good reason kellands class i attended once even gained there a certificate of merit the only distinction of my university career but although i am the holder of a certificate of attendance in the professors own hand i cannot remember to have been present in the greek class above a dozen times professor blackie was even kind enough to remark more than once while in the very act of writing the document above referred to that he did not know my face indeed i denied myself many opportunities acting upon an extensive and highly rational system of truantry which cost me a great deal of trouble to put in exerciseperhaps as much as would have taught me greekand sent me forth into the world and the profession of letters with the merest shadow of an education but they say it is always a good thing to have taken pains and that success is its own reward whatever be its nature so that perhaps even upon this i should plume myself that no one ever played the truant with more deliberate care and none ever had more certificates for less education one consequence however of my system is that i have much less to say of professor blackie than i had of professor kelland and as he is still alive and will long i hope continue to be so it will not surprise you very much that i have no intention of saying it  meanwhile how many others have gonejenkin hodgson and i know not who besides and of that tide of students that used to throng the arch and blacken the quadrangle how many are scattered into the remotest parts of the earth and how many more have lain down beside their fathers in their restinggraves and again how many of these last have not found their way there all too early through the stress of education that was one thing at least from which my truantry protected me i am sorry indeed that i have no greek but i should be sorrier still if i were dead nor do i know the name of that branch of knowledge which is worth acquiring at the price of a brain fever there are many sordid tragedies in the life of the student above all if he be poor or drunken or both but nothing more moves a wise mans pity than the case of the lad who is in too much hurry to be learned and so for the sake of a moral at the end i will call up one more figure and have done a student ambitious of success by that hot intemperate manner of study that now grows so common read night and day for an examination as he went on the task became more easy to him sleep was more easily banished his brain grew hot and clear and more capacious the necessary knowledge daily fuller and more orderly it came to the eve of the trial and he watched all night in his high chamber reviewing what he knew and already secure of success his window looked eastward and being as i said high up and the house itself standing on a hill commanded a view over dwindling suburbs to a country horizon at last my student drew up his blind and still in quite a jocund humour looked abroad day was breaking the east was tinging with strange fires the clouds breaking up for the coming of the sun and at the sight nameless terror seized upon his mind he was sane his senses were undisturbed he saw clearly and knew what he was seeing and knew that it was normal but he could neither bear to see it nor find the strength to look away and fled in panic from his chamber into the enclosure of the street in the cool air and silence and among the sleeping houses his strength was renewed nothing troubled him but the memory of what had passed and an abject fear of its return    gallo canente spes redit    aegris salus refunditur    lapsis fides revertitur  as they sang of old in portugal in the morning office but to him that good hour of cockcrow and the changes of the dawn had brought panic and lasting doubt and such terror as he still shook to think of he dared not return to his lodging he could not eat he sat down he rose up he wandered the city woke about him with its cheerful bustle the sun climbed overhead and still he grew but the more absorbed in the distress of his recollection and the fear of his past fear at the appointed hour he came to the door of the place of examination but when he was asked he had forgotten his name seeing him so disordered they had not the heart to send him away but gave him a paper and admitted him still nameless to the hall vain kindness vain efforts he could only sit in a still growing horror writing nothing ignorant of all his mind filled with a single memory of the breaking day and his own intolerable fear and that same night he was tossing in a brain fever  people are afraid of war and wounds and dentists all with excellent reason but these are not to be compared with such chaotic terrors of the mind as fell on this young man we all have by our bedsides the box of the merchant abudah thank god securely enough shut but when a young man sacrifices sleep to labour let him have a care for he is playing with the lock   footnotes    3 for the book of the edinburgh university union fancy fair

mortality     i  there is a certain graveyard looked upon on the one side by a prison on the other by the windows of a quiet hotel below under a steep cliff it beholds the traffic of many lines of rail and the scream of the engine and the shock of meeting buffers mount to it all day long the aisles are lined with the enclosed sepulchres of families door beyond door like houses in a street and in the morning the shadows of the prison turrets and of many tall memorials fall upon the graves there in the hot fits of youth i came to be unhappy pleasant incidents are woven with my memory of the place i here made friends with a certain plain old gentleman a visitor on sunny mornings gravely cheerful who with one eye upon the place that awaited him chirped about his youth like winter sparrows a beautiful housemaid of the hotel once for some days together dumbly flirted with me from a window and kept my wild heart flying and onceshe possibly remembersthe wise eugenia followed me to that austere enclosure her hair came down and in the shelter of a tomb my trembling fingers helped her to repair the braid but for the most part i went there solitary and with irrevocable emotion pored on the names of the forgotten name after name and to each the conventional attributions and the idle dates a regiment of the unknown that had been the joy of mothers and had thrilled with the illusions of youth and at last in the dim sickroom wrestled with the pangs of old mortality in that whole crew of the silenced there was but one of whom my fancy had received a picture and he with his comely florid countenance bewigged and habited in scarlet and in his day combining fame and popularity stood forth like a taunt among that company of phantom appellations it was possible then to leave behind us something more explicit than these severe monotonous and lying epitaphs and the thing left the memory of a painted picture and what we call the immortality of a name was hardly more desirable than mere oblivion even david hume as he lay composed beneath that circular idea was fainter than a dream and when the housemaid broom in hand smiled and beckoned from the open window the fame of that bewigged philosopher melted like a raindrop in the sea  and yet in soberness i cared as little for the housemaid as for david hume the interests of youth are rarely frank his passions like noahs dove come home to roost the fire sensibility and volume of his own nature that is all that he has learned to recognise the tumultuary and grey tide of life the empire of routine the unrejoicing faces of his elders fill him with contemptuous surprise there also he seems to walk among the tombs of spirits and it is only in the course of years and after much rubbing with his fellowmen that he begins by glimpses to see himself from without and his fellows from within to know his own for one among the thousand undenoted countenances of the city street and to divine in others the throb of human agony and hope in the meantime he will avoid the hospital doors the pale faces the cripple the sweet whiff of chloroformfor there on the most thoughtless the pains of others are burned home but he will continue to walk in a divine selfpity the aisles of the forgotten graveyard the length of mans life which is endless to the brave and busy is scorned by his ambitious thought he cannot bear to have come for so little and to go again so wholly he cannot bear above all in that brief scene to be still idle and by way of cure neglects the little that he has to do the parable of the talent is the brief epitome of youth to believe in immortality is one thing but it is first needful to believe in life denunciatory preachers seem not to suspect that they may be taken gravely and in evil part that young men may come to think of time as of a moment and with the pride of satan wave back the inadequate gift yet here is a true peril this it is that sets them to pace the graveyard alleys and to read with strange extremes of pity and derision the memorials of the dead  books were the proper remedy books of vivid human import forcing upon their minds the issues pleasures busyness importance and immediacy of that life in which they stand books of smiling or heroic temper to excite or to console books of a large design shadowing the complexity of that game of consequences to which we all sit down the hangerback not least but the average sermon flees the point disporting itself in that eternity of which we know and need to know so little avoiding the bright crowded and momentous fields of life where destiny awaits us upon the average book a writer may be silent he may set it down to his illhap that when his own youth was in the acrid fermentation he should have fallen and fed upon the cheerless fields of obermann yet to mr matthew arnold who led him to these pastures he still bears a grudge the day is perhaps not far off when people will begin to count moll flanders ay or the country wife more wholesome and more pious diet than these guidebooks to consistent egoism  but the most inhuman of boys soon wearies of the inhumanity of obermann and even while i still continued to be a haunter of the graveyard i began insensibly to turn my attention to the gravediggers and was weaned out of myself to observe the conduct of visitors this was dayspring indeed to a lad in such great darkness not that i began to see men or to try to see them from within nor to learn charity and modesty and justice from the sight but still stared at them externally from the prison windows of my affectation once i remember to have observed two working women with a baby halting by a grave there was something monumental in the grouping one upright carrying the child the other with bowed face crouching by her side a wreath of immortelles under a glass dome had thus attracted them and drawing near i overheard their judgment on that wonder eh what extravagance to a youth afflicted with the callosity of sentiment this quaint and pregnant saying appeared merely base  my acquaintance with gravediggers considering its length was unremarkable one indeed whom i found plying his spade in the red evening high above allan water and in the shadow of dunblane cathedral told me of his acquaintance with the birds that still attended on his labours how some would even perch about him waiting for their prey and in a true sextons calendar how the species varied with the season of the year but this was the very poetry of the profession the others whom i knew were somewhat dry a faint flavour of the gardener hung about them but sophisticated and disbloomed they had engagements to keep not alone with the deliberate series of the seasons but with mankinds clocks and hourlong measurement of time and thus there was no leisure for the relishing pinch or the hourlong gossip foot on spade they were men wrapped up in their grim business they liked well to open longclosed family vaults blowing in the key and throwing wide the grating and they carried in their minds a calendar of names and dates it would be in fiftytwa that such a tomb was last opened for miss jemimy it was thus they spoke of their past patientsfamiliarly but not without respect like old family servants here is indeed a servant whom we forget that we possess who does not wait at the bright table or run at the bells summons but patiently smokes his pipe beside the mortuary fire and in his faithful memory notches the burials of our race to suspect shakespeare in his maturity of a superficial touch savours of paradox yet he was surely in error when he attributed insensibility to the digger of the grave but perhaps it is on hamlet that the charge should lie or perhaps the english sexton differs from the scottish the goodman delver reckoning up his years of office might have at least suggested other thoughts it is a pride common among sextons a cabinetmaker does not count his cabinets nor even an author his volumes save when they stare upon him from the shelves but the gravedigger numbers his graves he would indeed be something different from human if his solitary openair and tragic labours left not a broad mark upon his mind there in his tranquil isle apart from city clamour among the cats and robins and the ancient effigies and legends of the tomb he waits the continual passage of his contemporaries falling like minute drops into eternity as they fall he counts them and this enumeration which was at first perhaps appalling to his soul in the process of years and by the kindly influence of habit grows to be his pride and pleasure there are many common stories telling how he piques himself on crowded cemeteries but i will rather tell of the old gravedigger of monkton to whose unsuffering bedside the minister was summoned he dwelt in a cottage built into the wall of the churchyard and through a bullseye pane above his bed he could see as he lay dying the rank grasses and the upright and recumbent stones dr laurie was i think a moderate tis certain at least that he took a very roman view of deathbed dispositions for he told the old man that he had lived beyond mans natural years that his life had been easy and reputable that his family had all grown up and been a credit to his care and that it now behoved him unregretfully to gird his loins and follow the majority the gravedigger heard him out then he raised himself up on one elbow and with the other hand pointed through the window to the scene of his lifelong labours doctor he said i hae laid three hunner and fowerscore in that kirkyaird an it had been his wull indicating heaven i would hae likit weel to hae made out the fower hunner but it was not to be this tragedian of the fifth act had now another part to play and the time had come when others were to gird and carry him     ii  i would fain strike a note that should be more heroical but the ground of all youths suffering solitude hysteria and haunting of the grave is nothing else than naked ignorant selfishness it is himself that he sees dead those are his virtues that are forgotten his is the vague epitaph pity him but the more if pity be your cue for where a man is all pride vanity and personal aspiration he goes through fire unshielded in every part and corner of our life to lose oneself is to be gainer to forget oneself is to be happy and this poor laughable and tragic fool has not yet learned the rudiments himself giant prometheus is still ironed on the peaks of caucasus but by and by his truant interests will leave that tortured body slip abroad and gather flowers then shall death appear before him in an altered guise no longer as a doom peculiar to himself whether fates crowning injustice or his own last vengeance upon those who fail to value him but now as a power that wounds him far more tenderly not without solemn compensations taking and giving bereaving and yet storing up  the first step for all is to learn to the dregs our own ignoble fallibility when we have fallen through story after story of our vanity and aspiration and sit rueful among the ruins then it is that we begin to measure the stature of our friends how they stand between us and our own contempt believing in our best how linking us with others and still spreading wide the influential circle they weave us in and in with the fabric of contemporary life and to what petty size they dwarf the virtues and the vices that appeared gigantic in our youth so that at the last when such a pin falls outwhen there vanishes in the least breath of time one of those rich magazines of life on which we drew for our supplywhen he who had first dawned upon us as a face among the faces of the city and still growing came to bulk on our regard with those clear features of the loved and living man falls in a breath to memory and shadow there falls along with him a whole wing of the palace of our life     iii  one such face i now remember one such blank some half a dozen of us labour to dissemble in his youth he was most beautiful in person most serene and genial by disposition full of racy words and quaint thoughts laughter attended on his coming he had the air of a great gentleman jovial and royal with his equals and to the poorest student gentle and attentive power seemed to reside in him exhaustless we saw him stoop to play with us but held him marked for higher destinies we loved his notice and i have rarely had my pride more gratified than when he sat at my fathers table my acknowledged friend so he walked among us both hands full of gifts carrying with nonchalance the seeds of a most influential life  the powers and the ground of friendship is a mystery but looking back i can discern that in part we loved the thing he was for some shadow of what he was to be for with all his beauty power breeding urbanity and mirth there was in those days something soulless in our friend he would astonish us by sallies witty innocent and inhumane and by a misapplied johnsonian pleasantry demolish honest sentiment i can still see and hear him as he went his way along the lamplit streets là ci darem la mano on his lips a noble figure of a youth but following vanity and incredulous of good and sure enough somewhere on the high seas of life with his health his hopes his patrimony and his selfrespect miserably went down  from this disaster like a spent swimmer he came desperately ashore bankrupt of money and consideration creeping to the family he had deserted with broken wing never more to rise but in his face there was a light of knowledge that was new to it of the wounds of his body he was never healed died of them gradually with cleareyed resignation of his wounded pride we knew only from his silence he returned to that city where he had lorded it in his ambitious youth lived there alone seeing few striving to retrieve the irretrievable at times still grappling with that mortal frailty that had brought him down still joying in his friends successes his laugh still ready but with a kindlier music and over all his thoughts the shadow of that unalterable law which he had disavowed and which had brought him low lastly when his bodily evils had quite disabled him he lay a great while dying still without complaint still finding interests to his last step gentle urbane and with the will to smile  the tale of this great failure is to those who remained true to him the tale of a success in his youth he took thought for no one but himself when he came ashore again his whole armada lost he seemed to think of none but others such was his tenderness for others such his instinct of fine courtesy and pride that of that impure passion of remorse he never breathed a syllable even regret was rare with him and pointed with a jest you would not have dreamed if you had known him then that this was that great failure that beacon to young men over whose fall a whole society had hissed and pointed fingers often have we gone to him redhot with our own hopeful sorrows railing on the roseleaves in our princely bed of life and he would patiently give ear and wisely counsel and it was only upon some return of our own thoughts that we were reminded what manner of man this was to whom we disembosomed a man by his own fault ruined shut out of the garden of his gifts his whole city of hope both ploughed and salted silently awaiting the deliverer then something took us by the throat and to see him there so gentle patient brave and pious oppressed but not cast down sorrow was so swallowed up in admiration that we could not dare to pity him even if the old fault flashed out again it but awoke our wonder that in that lost battle he should have still the energy to fight he had gone to ruin with a kind of kingly abandon like one who condescended but once ruined with the lights all out he fought as for a kingdom most men finding themselves the authors of their own disgrace rail the louder against god or destiny most men when they repent oblige their friends to share the bitterness of that repentance but he had held an inquest and passed sentence mene mene and condemned himself to smiling silence he had given trouble enough had earned misfortune amply and foregone the right to murmur  thus was our old comrade like samson careless in his days of strength but on the coming of adversity and when that strength was gone that had betrayed himfor our strength is weaknesshe began to blossom and bring forth well now he is out of the fight the burden that he bore thrown down before the great deliverer we      in the vast cathedral leave him   god accept him   christ receive him     iv  if we go now and look on these innumerable epitaphs the pathos and the irony are strangely fled they do not stand merely to the dead these foolish monuments they are pillars and legends set up to glorify the difficult but not desperate life of man this ground is hallowed by the heroes of defeat  i see the indifferent pass before my friends last restingplace pause with a shrug of pity marvelling that so rich an argosy had sunk a pity now that he is done with suffering a pity most uncalled for and an ignorant wonder before those who loved him his memory shines like a reproach they honour him for silent lessons they cherish his example and in what remains before them of their toil fear to be unworthy of the dead for this proud man was one of those who prospered in the valley of humiliationof whom bunyan wrote that though christian had the hard hap to meet in the valley with apollyon yet i must tell you that in former times men have met with angels here have found pearls here and have in this place found the words of life       iv    a college magazine     i  all through my boyhood and youth i was known and pointed out for the pattern of an idler and yet i was always busy on my own private end which was to learn to write i kept always two books in my pocket one to read one to write in as i walked my mind was busy fitting what i saw with appropriate words when i sat by the roadside i would either read or a pencil and a penny versionbook would be in my hand to note down the features of the scene or commemorate some halting stanzas thus i lived with words and what i thus wrote was for no ulterior use it was written consciously for practice it was not so much that i wished to be an author though i wished that too as that i had vowed that i would learn to write that was a proficiency that tempted me and i practised to acquire it as men learn to whittle in a wager with myself description was the principal field of my exercise for to any one with senses there is always something worth describing and town and country are but one continuous subject but i worked in other ways also often accompanied my walks with dramatic dialogues in which i played many parts and often exercised myself in writing down conversations from memory  this was all excellent no doubt so were the diaries i sometimes tried to keep but always and very speedily discarded finding them a school of posturing and melancholy selfdeception and yet this was not the most efficient part of my training good though it was it only taught me so far as i have learned them at all the lower and less intellectual elements of the art the choice of the essential note and the right word things that to a happier constitution had perhaps come by nature and regarded as training it had one grave defect for it set me no standard of achievement so that there was perhaps more profit as there was certainly more effort in my secret labours at home whenever i read a book or a passage that particularly pleased me in which a thing was said or an effect rendered with propriety in which there was either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style i must sit down at once and set myself to ape that quality i was unsuccessful and i knew it and tried again and was again unsuccessful and always unsuccessful but at least in these vain bouts i got some practice in rhythm in harmony in construction and the coordination of parts i have thus played the sedulous ape to hazlitt to lamb to wordsworth to sir thomas browne to defoe to hawthorne to montaigne to baudelaire and to obermann i remember one of these monkey tricks which was called the vanity of morals it was to have had a second part the vanity of knowledge and as i had neither morality nor scholarship the names were apt but the second part was never attempted and the first part was written which is my reason for recalling it ghostlike from its ashes no less than three times first in the manner of hazlitt second in the manner of ruskin who had cast on me a passing spell and third in a laborious pasticcio of sir thomas browne so with my other works cain an epic was save the mark an imitation of sordello robin hood a tale in verse took an eclectic middle course among the fields of keats chaucer and morris in monmouth a tragedy i reclined on the bosom of mr swinburne in my innumerable goutyfooted lyrics i followed many masters in the first draft of the kings pardon a tragedy i was on the trail of no less a man than john webster in the second draft of the same piece with staggering versatility i had shifted my allegiance to congreve and of course conceived my fable in a less serious veinfor it was not congreves verse it was his exquisite prose that i admired and sought to copy even at the age of thirteen i had tried to do justice to the inhabitants of the famous city of peebles in the style of the book of snobs so i might go on for ever through all my abortive novels and down to my later plays of which i think more tenderly for they were not only conceived at first under the bracing influence of old dumas but have met with resurrections one strangely bettered by another hand came on the stage itself and was played by bodily actors the other originally known as semiramis a tragedy i have observed on bookstalls under the alias of prince otto but enough has been said to show by what arts of impersonation and in what purely ventriloquial efforts i first saw my words on paper  that like it or not is the way to learn to write whether i have profited or not that is the way it was so keats learned and there was never a finer temperament for literature than keatss it was so if we could trace it out that all men have learned and that is why a revival of letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier and fresher models perhaps i hear some one cry out but this is not the way to be original it is not nor is there any way but to be born so nor yet if you are born original is there anything in this training that shall clip the wings of your originality there can be none more original than montaigne neither could any be more unlike cicero yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to imitate the other burns is the very type of a prime force in letters he was of all men the most imitative shakespeare himself the imperial proceeds directly from a school it is only from a school that we can expect to have good writers it is almost invariably from a school that great writers these lawless exceptions issue nor is there anything here that should astonish the considerate before he can tell what cadences he truly prefers the student should have tried all that are possible before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of language he should long have practised the literary scales and it is only after years of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last legions of words swarming to his call dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice and he himself knowing what he wants to do and within the narrow limit of a mans ability able to do it  and it is the great point of these imitations that there still shines beyond the students reach his inimitable model let him try as he please he is still sure of failure and it is a very old and a very true saying that failure is the only highroad to success i must have had some disposition to learn for i clearsightedly condemned my own performances i liked doing them indeed but when they were done i could see they were rubbish in consequence i very rarely showed them even to my friends and such friends as i chose to be my confidants i must have chosen well for they had the friendliness to be quite plain with me padding said one another wrote i cannot understand why you do lyrics so badly no more could i thrice i put myself in the way of a more authoritative rebuff by sending a paper to a magazine these were returned and i was not surprised or even pained if they had not been looked at as like all amateurs i suspected was the case there was no good in repeating the experiment if they had been looked atwell then i had not yet learned to write and i must keep on learning and living lastly i had a piece of good fortune which is the occasion of this paper and by which i was able to see my literature in print and to measure experimentally how far i stood from the favour of the public     ii  the speculative society is a body of some antiquity and has counted among its members scott brougham jeffrey horner benjamin constant robert emmet and many a legal and local celebrity besides by an accident variously explained it has its rooms in the very buildings of the university of edinburgh a hall turkeycarpeted hung with pictures looking when lighted up at night with fire and candle like some goodly diningroom a passagelike library walled with books in their wire cages and a corridor with a fireplace benches a table many prints of famous members and a mural tablet to the virtues of a former secretary here a member can warm himself and loaf and read here in defiance of senatusconsults he can smoke the senatus looks askance at these privileges looks even with a somewhat vinegar aspect on the whole society which argues a lack of proportion in the learned mind for the world we may be sure will prize far higher this haunt of dead lions than all the living dogs of the professoriate  i sat one december morning in the library of the speculative a very humbleminded youth though it was a virtue i never had much credit for yet proud of my privileges as a member of the spec proud of the pipe i was smoking in the teeth of the senatus and in particular proud of being in the next room to three very distinguished students who were then conversing beside the corridor fire one of these has now his name on the back of several volumes and his voice i learn is influential in the law courts of the death of the second you have just been reading what i had to say and the third also has escaped out of that battle of life in which he fought so hard it may be so unwisely they were all three as i have said notable students but this was the most conspicuous wealthy handsome ambitious adventurous diplomatic a reader of balzac and of all men that i have known the most like to one of balzacs characters he led a life and was attended by an ill fortune that could be properly set forth only in the comédie humaine he had then his eye on parliament and soon after the time of which i write he made a showy speech at a political dinner was cried up to heaven next day in the courant and the day after was dashed lower than earth with a charge of plagiarism in the scotsman report would have it i daresay very wrongly that he was betrayed by one in whom he particularly trusted and that the author of the charge had learned its truth from his own lips thus at least he was up one day on a pinnacle admired and envied by all and the next though still but a boy he was publicly disgraced the blow would have broken a less finely tempered spirit and even him i suppose it rendered reckless for he took flight to london and there in a fast club disposed of the bulk of his considerable patrimony in the space of one winter for years thereafter he lived i know not how always well dressed always in good hotels and good society always with empty pockets the charm of his manner may have stood him in good stead but though my own manners are very agreeable i have never found in them a source of livelihood and to explain the miracle of his continued existence i must fall back upon the theory of the philosopher that in his case as in all of the same kind there was a suffering relative in the background from this genteel eclipse he reappeared upon the scene and presently sought me out in the character of a generous editor it is in this part that i best remember him tall slender with a not ungraceful stoop looking quite like a refined gentleman and quite like an urbane adventurer smiling with an engaging ambiguity cocking at you one peaked eyebrow with a great appearance of finesse speaking low and sweet and thick with a touch of burr telling strange tales with singular deliberation and to a patient listener excellent effect after all these ups and downs he seemed still like the rich student that he was of yore to breathe of money seemed still perfectly sure of himself and certain of his end yet he was then upon the brink of his last overthrow he had set himself to found the strangest thing in our society one of those periodical sheets from which men suppose themselves to learn opinions in which young gentlemen from the universities are encouraged at so much a line to garble facts insult foreign nations and calumniate private individuals and which are now the source of glory so that if a mans name be often enough printed there he becomes a kind of demigod and people will pardon him when he talks back and forth as they do for mr gladstone and crowd him to suffocation on railway platforms as they did the other day to general boulanger and buy his literary works as i hope you have just done for me our fathers when they were upon some great enterprise would sacrifice a life building it may be a favourite slave into the foundations of their palace it was with his own life that my companion disarmed the envy of the gods he fought his paper singlehanded trusting no one for he was something of a cynic up early and down late for he was nothing of a sluggard daily earwigging influential men for he was a master of ingratiation in that slender and silken fellow there must have been a rare vein of courage that he should thus have died at his employment and doubtless ambition spoke loudly in his ear and doubtless love also for it seems there was a marriage in his view had he succeeded but he died and his paper died after him and of all this grace and tact and courage it must seem to our blind eyes as if there had come literally nothing  these three students sat as i was saying in the corridor under the mural tablet that records the virtues of macbean the former secretary we would often smile at that ineloquent memorial and thought it a poor thing to come into the world at all and leave no more behind one than macbean and yet of these three two are gone and have left less and this book perhaps when it is old and foxy and some one picks it up in a corner of a bookshop and glances through it smiling at the old graceless turns of speech and perhaps for the love of alma mater which may be still extant and flourishing buys it not without haggling for some pencethis book may alone preserve a memory of james walter ferrier and robert glasgow brown  their thoughts ran very differently on that december morning they were all on fire with ambition and when they had called me in to them and made me a sharer in their design i too became drunken with pride and hope we were to found a university magazine a pair of little active brotherslivingstone by name great skippers on the foot great rubbers of the hands who kept a bookshop over against the university buildinghad been debauched to play the part of publishers we four were to be conjunct editors and what was the main point of the concern to print our own works while by every rule of arithmeticthat flatterer of credulitythe adventure must succeed and bring great profit well well it was a bright vision i went home that morning walking upon air to have been chosen by these three distinguished students was to me the most unspeakable advance it was my first draught of consideration it reconciled me to myself and to my fellowmen and as i steered round the railings at the tron i could not withhold my lips from smiling publicly yet in the bottom of my heart i knew that magazine would be a grim fiasco i knew it would not be worth reading i knew even if it were that nobody would read it and i kept wondering how i should be able upon my compact income of twelve pounds per annum payable monthly to meet my share in the expense it was a comfortable thought to me that i had a father  the magazine appeared in a yellow cover which was the best part of it for at least it was unassuming it ran four months in undisturbed obscurity and died without a gasp the first number was edited by all four of us with prodigious bustle the second fell principally into the hands of ferrier and me the third i edited alone and it has long been a solemn question who it was that edited the fourth it would perhaps be still more difficult to say who read it poor yellow sheet that looked so hopefully in the livingstones window poor harmless paper that might have gone to print a shakespeare on and was instead so clumsily defaced with nonsense and shall i say poor editors i cannot pity myself to whom it was all pure gain it was no news to me but only the wholesome confirmation of my judgment when the magazine struggled into halfbirth and instantly sickened and subsided into night i had sent a copy to the lady with whom my heart was at that time somewhat engaged and who did all that in her lay to break it and she with some tact passed over the gift and my cherished contributions in silence i will not say that i was pleased at this but i will tell her now if by any chance she takes up the work of her former servant that i thought the better of her taste i cleared the decks after this lost engagement had the necessary interview with my father which passed off not amiss paid over my share of the expense to the two little active brothers who rubbed their hands as much but methought skipped rather less than formerly having perhaps these two also embarked upon the enterprise with some graceful illusions and then reviewing the whole episode i told myself that the time was not yet ripe nor the man ready and to work i went again with my penny versionbooks having fallen back in one day from the printed author to the manuscript student     iii  from this defunct periodical i am going to reprint one of my own papers the poor little piece is all tailforemost i have done my best to straighten its array i have pruned it fearlessly and it remains invertebrate and wordy no selfrespecting magazine would print the thing and here you behold it in a bound volume not for any worth of its own but for the sake of the man whom it purports dimly to represent and some of whose sayings it preserves so that in this volume of memories and portraits robert young the swanston gardener may stand alongside of john todd the swanston shepherd not that john and robert drew very close together in their lives for john was roughhe smelt of the windy brae and robert was gentle and smacked of the garden in the hollow perhaps it is to my shame that i liked john the better of the two he had grit and dash and that salt of the old adam that pleases men with any savage inheritance of blood and he was a wayfarer besides and took my gipsy fancy but however that may be and however roberts profile may be blurred in the boyish sketch that follows he was a man of a most quaint and beautiful nature whom if it were possible to recast a piece of work so old i should like well to draw again with a maturer touch and as i think of him and of john i wonder in what other country two such men would be found dwelling together in a hamlet of some twenty cottages in the woody fold of a green hill       v    an old scots gardener   i think i might almost have said the last somewhere indeed in the uttermost glens of the lammermuir or among the southwestern hills there may yet linger a decrepit representative of this bygone good fellowship but as far as actual experience goes i have only met one man in my life who might fitly be quoted in the same breath with andrew fairservicethough without his vices he was a man whose very presence could impart a savour of quaint antiquity to the baldest and most modern flowerplots there was a dignity about his tall stooping form and an earnestness in his wrinkled face that recalled don quixote but a don quixote who had come through the training of the covenant and been nourished in his youth on walkers lives and the hind let loose  now as i could not bear to let such a man pass away with no sketch preserved of his oldfashioned virtues i hope the reader will take this as an excuse for the present paper and judge as kindly as he can the infirmities of my description to me who find it so difficult to tell the little that i know he stands essentially as a genius loci it is impossible to separate his spare form and old straw hat from the garden in the lap of the hill with its rocks overgrown with clematis its shadowy walks and the splendid breadth of champaign that one saw from the northwest corner the garden and gardener seem part and parcel of each other when i take him from his right surroundings and try to make him appear for me on paper he looks unreal and phantasmal the best that i can say may convey some notion to those that never saw him but to me it will be ever impotent  the first time that i saw him i fancy robert was pretty old already he had certainly begun to use his years as a stalkinghorse latterly he was beyond all the impudencies of logic considering a reference to the parish register worth all the reasons in the world i am old and well stricken in years he was wont to say and i never found any one bold enough to answer the argument apart from this vantage that he kept over all who were not yet octogenarian he had some other drawbacks as a gardener he shrank the very place he cultivated the dignity and reduced gentility of his appearance made the small garden cut a sorry figure he was full of tales of greater situations in his younger days he spoke of castles and parks with a humbling familiarity he told of places where undergardeners had trembled at his looks where there were meres and swanneries labyrinths of walk and wildernesses of sad shrubbery in his control till you could not help feeling that it was condescension on his part to dress your humbler garden plots you were thrown at once into an invidious position you felt that you were profiting by the needs of dignity and that his poverty and not his will consented to your vulgar rule involuntarily you compared yourself with the swineherd that made alfred watch his cakes or some bloated citizen who may have given his sons and his condescension to the fallen dionysius nor were the disagreeables purely fanciful and metaphysical for the sway that he exercised over your feelings he extended to your garden and through the garden to your diet he would trim a hedge throw away a favourite plant or fill the most favoured and fertile section of the garden with a vegetable that none of us could eat in supreme contempt for our opinion if you asked him to send you in one of your own artichokes that i wull mem he would say with pleesure for it is mair blessed to give than to receive ay and even when by extra twisting of the screw we prevailed on him to prefer our commands to his own inclination and he went away stately and sad professing that our wull was his pleesure but yet reminding us that he would do it with feelinseven then i say the triumphant master felt humbled in his triumph felt that he ruled on sufferance only that he was taking a mean advantage of the others low estate and that the whole scene had been one of those slights that patient merit of the unworthy takes  in flowers his taste was oldfashioned and catholic affecting sunflowers and dahlias wallflowers and roses and holding in supreme aversion whatsoever was fantastic newfashioned or wild there was one exception to this sweeping ban foxgloves though undoubtedly guilty on the last count he not only spared but loved and when the shrubbery was being thinned he stayed his hand and dexterously manipulated his bill in order to save every stately stem in boyhood as he told me once speaking in that tone that only actors and the oldfashioned common folk can use nowadays his heart grew proud within him when he came on a burncourse among the braes of manor that shone purple with their graceful trophies and not all his apprenticeship and practice for so many years of precise gardening had banished these boyish recollections from his heart indeed he was a man keenly alive to the beauty of all that was bygone he abounded in old stories of his boyhood and kept pious account of all his former pleasures and when he went on a holiday to visit one of the fabled great places of the earth where he had served before he came back full of little preraphaelite reminiscences that showed real passion for the past such as might have shaken hands with hazlitt or jeanjacques  but however his sympathy with his old feelings might affect his liking for the foxgloves the very truth was that he scorned all flowers together they were but garnishings childish toys trifling ornaments for ladies chimneyshelves it was towards his cauliflowers and peas and cabbage that his heart grew warm his preference for the more useful growths was such that cabbages were found invading the flowerplots and an outpost of savoys was once discovered in the centre of the lawn he would prelect over some thriving plant with wonderful enthusiasm piling reminiscence on reminiscence of former and perhaps yet finer specimens yet even then he did not let the credit leave himself he had indeed raised finer o them but it seemed that no one else had been favoured with a like success all other gardeners in fact were mere foils to his own superior attainments and he would recount with perfect soberness of voice and visage how soandso had wondered and such another could scarcely give credit to his eyes nor was it with his rivals only that he parted praise and blame if you remarked how well a plant was looking he would gravely touch his hat and thank you with solemn unction all credit in the matter falling to him if on the other hand you called his attention to some backgoing vegetable he would quote scripture paul may plant and apollos may water all blame being left to providence on the score of deficient rain or untimely frosts  there was one thing in the garden that shared his preference with his favourite cabbages and rhubarb and that other was the beehive their sound their industry perhaps their sweet product also had taken hold of his imagination and heart whether by way of memory or no i cannot say although perhaps the bees too were linked to him by some recollection of manor braes and his country childhood nevertheless he was too chary of his personal safety or let me rather say his personal dignity to mingle in any active office towards them but he could stand by while one of the contemned rivals did the work for him and protest that it was quite safe in spite of his own considerate distance and the cries of the distressed assistant in regard to bees he was rather a man of word than deed and some of his most striking sentences had the bees for text they are indeed wonderfu creatures mem he said once they just mind me o what the queen of sheba said to solomonand i think she said it wi a sighthe half of it hath not been told unto me  as far as the bible goes he was deeply read like the old covenanters of whom he was the worthy representative his mouth was full of sacred quotations it was the book that he had studied most and thought upon most deeply to many people in his station the bible and perhaps burns are the only books of any vital literary merit that they read feeding themselves for the rest on the draff of country newspapers and the very instructive but not very palatable pabulum of some cheap educational series this was roberts position all day long he had dreamed of the hebrew stories and his head had been full of hebrew poetry and gospel ethics until they had struck deep root into his heart and the very expressions had become a part of him so that he rarely spoke without some antique idiom or scripture mannerism that gave a raciness to the merest trivialities of talk but the influence of the bible did not stop here there was more in robert than quaint phrase and ready store of reference he was imbued with a spirit of peace and love he interposed between man and wife he threw himself between the angry touching his hat the while with all the ceremony of an usher he protected the birds from everybody but himself seeing i suppose a great difference between official execution and wanton sport his mistress telling him one day to put some ferns into his masters particular corner and adding though indeed robert he doesnt deserve them for he wouldnt help me to gather them eh mem replied robert but i wouldna say that for i think hes just a most deservin gentleman again two of our friends who were on intimate terms and accustomed to use language to each other somewhat without the bounds of the parliamentary happened to differ about the position of a seat in the garden the discussion as was usual when these two were at it soon waxed tolerably insulting on both sides every one accustomed to such controversies several times a day was quietly enjoying this prizefight of somewhat abusive witevery one but robert to whom the perfect good faith of the whole quarrel seemed unquestionable and who after having waited till his conscience would suffer him to wait no more and till he expected every moment that the disputants would fall to blows cut suddenly in with tones of almost tearful entreaty eh but gentlemen i wad hae nae mair words about it one thing was noticeable about roberts religion it was neither dogmatic nor sectarian he never expatiated at least in my hearing on the doctrines of his creed and he never condemned anybody else i have no doubt that he held all roman catholics atheists and mahometans as considerably out of it i dont believe he had any sympathy for prelacy and the natural feelings of man must have made him a little sore about freechurchism but at least he never talked about these views never grew controversially noisy and never openly aspersed the belief or practice of anybody now all this is not generally characteristic of scots piety scots sects being churches militant with a vengeance and scots believers perpetual crusaders the one against the other and missionaries the one to the other perhaps roberts originally tender heart was what made the difference or perhaps his solitary and pleasant labour among fruits and flowers had taught him a more sunshiny creed than those whose work is among the tares of fallen humanity and the soft influences of the garden had entered deep into his spirit    annihilating all thats made    to a green thought in a green shade  but i could go on for ever chronicling his golden sayings or telling of his innocent and living piety i had meant to tell of his cottage with the german pipe hung reverently above the fire and the shell box that he had made for his son and of which he would say pathetically he was real pleased wi it at first but i think hes got a kind o tired o it nowthe son being then a man of about forty but i will let all these pass tis more significant hes dead the earth that he had digged so much in his life was dug out by another for himself and the flowers that he had tended drew their life still from him but in a new and nearer way a bird flew about the open grave as if it too wished to honour the obsequies of one who had so often quoted scripture in favour of its kind are not two sparrows sold for one farthing and yet not one of them falleth to the ground  yes he is dead but the kings did not rise in the place of death to greet him with taunting proverbs as they rose to greet the haughty babylonian for in his life he was lowly and a peacemaker and a servant of god       vi    pastoral   to leave home in early life is to be stunned and quickened with novelties but to leave it when years have come only casts a more endearing light upon the past as in those composite photographs of mr galtons the image of each new sitter brings out but the more clearly the central features of the race when once youth has flown each new impression only deepens the sense of nationality and the desire of native places so may some cadet of royal Écossais or the albany regiment as he mounted guard about french citadels so may some officer marching his company of the scotsdutch among the polders have felt the soft rains of the hebrides upon his brow or started in the ranks at the remembered aroma of peatsmoke and the rivers of home are dear in particular to all men this is as old as naaman who was jealous for abana and pharpar it is confined to no race nor country for i know one of scottish blood but a child of suffolk whose fancy still lingers about the lilied lowland waters of that shire but the streams of scotland are incomparable in themselvesor i am only the more scottish to suppose soand their sound and colour dwell for ever in the memory how often and willingly do i not look again in fancy on tummel or manor or the talking airdle or dee swirling in its lynn on the bright burn of kinnaird or the golden burn that pours and sulks in the den behind kingussie i think shame to leave out one of these enchantresses but the list would grow too long if i remembered all only i may not forget allan water nor birchwetting rogie nor yet almond nor for all its pollutions that water of leith of the many and wellnamed millsbells mills and canon mills and silver mills nor redford burn of pleasant memories nor yet for all its smallness that nameless trickle that springs in the green bosom of allermuir and is fed from halkerside with a perennial teacupful and threads the moss under the shearers knowe and makes one pool there overhung by a rock where i loved to sit and make bad verses and is then kidnapped in its infancy by subterranean pipes for the service of the seabeholding city in the plain from many points in the moss you may see at one glance its whole course and that of all its tributaries the geographer of this lilliput may visit all its corners without sitting down and not yet begin to be breathed shearers knowe and halkerside are but names of adjacent cantons on a single shoulder of a hill as names are squandered it would seem to the inexpert in superfluity upon these upland sheepwalks a bucket would receive the whole discharge of the toy river it would take it an appreciable time to fill your morning bath for the most part besides it soaks unseen through the moss and yet for the sake of auld lang syne and the figure of a certain genius loci i am condemned to linger awhile in fancy by its shores and if the nymph who cannot be above a span in stature will but inspire my pen i would gladly carry the reader along with me  john todd when i knew him was already the oldest herd on the pentlands and had been all his days faithful to that curlewscattering sheepcollecting life he remembered the droving days when the droveroads that now lie green and solitary through the heather were thronged thoroughfares he had himself often marched flocks into england sleeping on the hillsides with his caravan and by his account it was a rough business not without danger the droveroads lay apart from habitation the drovers met in the wilderness as today the deepsea fishers meet off the banks in the solitude of the atlantic and in the one as in the other case rough habits and fistlaw were the rule crimes were committed sheep filched and drovers robbed and beaten most of which offences had a moorland burial and were never heard of in the courts of justice john in those days was at least once attackedby two men after his watchand at least once betrayed by his habitual anger fell under the danger of the law and was clapped into some rustic prisonhouse the doors of which he burst in the night and was no more heard of in that quarter when i knew him his life had fallen in quieter places and he had no cares beyond the dulness of his dogs and the inroads of pedestrians from town but for a man of his propensity to wrath these were enough he knew neither rest nor peace except by snatches in the grey of the summer morning and already from far up the hill he would wake the toun with the sound of his shoutings and in the lambingtime his cries were not yet silenced late at night this wrathful voice of a man unseen might be said to haunt that quarter of the pentlands an audible bogie and no doubt it added to the fear in which men stood of john a touch of something legendary for my own part he was at first my enemy and i in my character of a rambling boy his natural abhorrence it was long before i saw him near at hand knowing him only by some sudden blast of bellowing from far above bidding me cway oot amang the sheep the quietest recesses of the hill harboured this ogre i skulked in my favourite wilderness like a cameronian of the killing time and john todd was my claverhouse and his dogs my questing dragoons little by little we dropped into civilities his hail at sight of me began to have less of the ring of a warslogan soon we never met but he produced his snuffbox which was with him like the calumet with the red indian a part of the heraldry of peace and at length in the ripeness of time we grew to be a pair of friends and when i lived alone in these parts in the winter it was a settled thing for john to give me a cry over the garden wall as he set forth upon his evening round and for me to overtake and bear him company  that dread voice of his that shook the hills when he was angry fell in ordinary talk very pleasantly upon the ear with a kind of honeyed friendly whine not far off singing that was eminently scottish he laughed not very often and when he did with a sudden loud hawhaw hearty but somehow joyless like an echo from a rock his face was permanently set and coloured ruddy and stiff with weathering more like a picture than a face yet with a certain strain and a threat of latent anger in the expression like that of a man trained too fine and harassed with perpetual vigilance he spoke in the richest dialect of scots i ever heard the words in themselves were a pleasure and often a surprise to me so that i often came back from one of our patrols with new acquisitions and this vocabulary he would handle like a master stalking a little before me beard on shoulder the plaid hanging loosely about him the yellow staff clapped under his arm and guiding me uphill by that devious tactical ascent which seems peculiar to men of his trade i might count him with the best talkers only that talking scots and talking english seem incomparable acts he touched on nothing at least but he adorned it when he narrated the scene was before you when he spoke as he did mostly of his own antique business the thing took on a colour of romance and curiosity that was surprising the clans of sheep with their particular territories on the hill and how in the yearly killings and purchases each must be proportionately thinned and strengthened the midnight busyness of animals the signs of the weather the cares of the snowy season the exquisite stupidity of sheep the exquisite cunning of dogs all these he could present so humanly and with so much old experience and living gusto that weariness was excluded and in the midst he would suddenly straighten his bowed back the stick would fly abroad in demonstration and the sharp thunder of his voice roll out a long itinerary for the dogs so that you saw at last the use of that great wealth of names for every knowe and howe upon the hillside and the dogs having hearkened with lowered tails and raised faces would run up their flags again to the masthead and spread themselves upon the indicated circuit it used to fill me with wonder how they could follow and retain so long a story but john denied these creatures all intelligence they were the constant butt of his passion and contempt it was just possible to work with the like of them he saidnot more than possible and then he would expand upon the subject of the really good dogs that he had known and the one really good dog that he had himself possessed he had been offered forty pounds for it but a good collie was worth more than that more than anything to a herd he did the herds work for him as for the like of them he would cry and scornfully indicate the scouring tails of his assistants  oncei translate johns lallan for i cannot do it justice being born britannis in montibus indeed but alas inerudito saeculoonce in the days of his good dog he had bought some sheep in edinburgh and on the way out the road being crowded two were lost this was a reproach to john and a slur upon the dog and both were alive to their misfortune word came after some days that a farmer about braid had found a pair of sheep and thither went john and the dog to ask for restitution but the farmer was a hard man and stood upon his rights how were they marked he asked and since john had bought right and left from many sellers and had no notion of the marksvery well said the farmer then its only right that i should keep themwell said john its a fact that i canna tell the sheep but if my dog can will ye let me have them the farmer was honest as well as hard and besides i daresay he had little fear of the ordeal so he had all the sheep upon his farm into one large park and turned johns dog into the midst that hairy man of business knew his errand well he knew that john and he had bought two sheep and to their shame lost them about boroughmuirhead he knew besides the lord knows how unless by listening that they were come to braid for their recovery and without pause or blunder singled out first one and then the other the two waifs it was that afternoon the forty pounds were offered and refused and the shepherd and his dogwhat do i say the true shepherd and his manset off together by fairmilehead in jocund humour and smiled to ither all the way home with the two recovered ones before them so far so good but intelligence may be abused the dog as he is by little mans inferior in mind is only by little his superior in virtue and john had another collie tale of quite a different complexion at the foot of the moss behind kirk yetton caer ketton wise men say there is a scrog of low wood and a pool with a dam for washing sheep john was one day lying under a bush in the scrog when he was aware of a collie on the far hillside skulking down through the deepest of the heather with obtrusive stealth he knew the dog knew him for a clever rising practitioner from quite a distant farm one whom perhaps he had coveted as he saw him masterfully steering flocks to market but what did the practitioner so far from home and why this guilty and secret manoeuvring towards the poolfor it was towards the pool that he was heading john lay the closer under his bush and presently saw the dog come forth upon the margin look all about to see if he were anywhere observed plunge in and repeatedly wash himself over head and ears and then but now openly and with tail in air strike homeward over the hills that same night word was sent his master and the rising practitioner shaken up from where he lay all innocence before the fire was had out to a dykeside and promptly shot for alas he was that foulest of criminals under trust a sheepeater and it was from the maculation of sheeps blood that he had come so far to cleanse himself in the pool behind kirk yetton  a trade that touches nature one that lies at the foundations of life in which we have all had ancestors employed so that on a hint of it ancestral memories revive lends itself to literary use vocal or written the fortune of a tale lies not alone in the skill of him that writes but as much perhaps in the inherited experience of him who reads and when i hear with a particular thrill of things that i have never done or seen it is one of that innumerable army of my ancestors rejoicing in past deeds thus novels begin to touch not the fine dilettante but the gross mass of mankind when they leave off to speak of parlours and shades of manner and stillborn niceties of motive and begin to deal with fighting sailoring adventure death or childbirth and thus ancient outdoor crafts and occupations whether mr hardy wields the shepherds crook or count tolstoi swings the scythe lift romance into a near neighbourhood with epic these aged things have on them the dew of mans morning they lie near not so much to us the semiartificial flowerets as to the trunk and aboriginal taproot of the race a thousand interests spring up in the process of the ages and a thousand perish that is now an eccentricity or a lost art which was once the fashion of an empire and those only are perennial matters that rouse us today and that roused men in all epochs of the past there is a certain critic not indeed of execution but of matter whom i dare be known to set before the best a certain lowbrowed hairy gentleman at first a percher in the fork of trees next as they relate a dweller in caves and whom i think i see squatting in cavemouths of a pleasant afternoon to munch his berrieshis wife that accomplished lady squatting by his side his name i never heard but he is often described as probably arboreal which may serve for recognition each has his own tree of ancestors but at the top of all sits probably arboreal in all our veins there run some minims of his old wild treetop blood our civilised nerves still tingle with his rude terrors and pleasures and to that which would have moved our common ancestor all must obediently thrill  we have not so far to climb to come to shepherds and it may be i had one for an ascendant who has largely moulded me but yet i think i owe my taste for that hillside business rather to the art and interest of john todd he it was that made it live for me as the artist can make all things live it was through him the simple strategy of massing sheep upon a snowy evening with its attendant scampering of earnest shaggy aidesdecamp was an affair that i never wearied of seeing and that i never weary of recalling to mind the shadow of the night darkening on the hills inscrutable black blots of snowshower moving here and there like night already come huddles of yellow sheep and dartings of black dogs upon the snow a bitter air that took you by the throat unearthly harpings of the wind along the moors and for centrepiece to all these features and influences john winding up the brae keeping his captains eye upon all sides and breaking ever and again into a spasm of bellowing that seemed to make the evening bleaker it is thus that i still see him in my minds eye perched on a hump of the declivity not far from halkerside his staff in airy flourish his great voice taking hold upon the hills and echoing terror to the lowlands i meanwhile standing somewhat back until the fit should be over and with a pinch of snuff my friend relapse into his easy even conversation       vii    the manse   i have named among many rivers that make music in my memory that dirty water of leith often and often i desire to look upon it again and the choice of a point of view is easy to me it should be at a certain waterdoor embowered in shrubbery the river is there dammed back for the service of the flourmill just below so that it lies deep and darkling and the sand slopes into brown obscurity with a glint of gold and it has but newly been recruited by the borrowings of the snuffmill just above and these tumbling merrily in shake the pool to its black heart fill it with drowsy eddies and set the curded froth of many other mills solemnly steering to and fro upon the surface or so it was when i was young for change and the masons and the pruningknife have been busy and if i could hope to repeat a cherished experience it must be on many and impossible conditions i must choose as well as the point of view a certain moment in my growth so that the scale may be exaggerated and the trees on the steep opposite side may seem to climb to heaven and the sand by the waterdoor where i am standing seem as low as styx and i must choose the season also so that the valley may be brimmed like a cup with sunshine and the songs of birdsand the year of grace so that when i turn to leave the riverside i may find the old manse and its inhabitants unchanged  it was a place in that time like no other the garden cut into provinces by a great hedge of beech and overlooked by the church and the terrace of the churchyard where the tombstones were thick and after nightfall spunkies might be seen to dance at least by children flowerplots lying warm in sunshine laurels and the great yew making elsewhere a pleasing horror of shade the smell of water rising from all round with an added tang of papermills the sound of water everywhere and the sound of millsthe wheel and the dam singing their alternate strain the birds on every bush and from every corner of the overhanging woods pealing out their notes until the air throbbed with them and in the midst of this the manse i see it by the standard of my childish stature as a great and roomy house in truth it was not so large as i supposed nor yet so convenient and standing where it did it is difficult to suppose that it was healthful yet a large family of stalwart sons and tall daughters was housed and reared and came to man and womanhood in that nest of little chambers so that the face of the earth was peppered with the children of the manse and letters with outlandish stamps became familiar to the local postman and the walls of the little chambers brightened with the wonders of the east the dullest could see this was a house that had a pair of hands in divers foreign places a wellbeloved houseits image fondly dwelt on by many travellers  here lived an ancestor of mine who was a herd of men i read him judging with older criticism the report of childish observation as a man of singular simplicity of nature unemotional and hating the display of what he felt standing contented on the old ways a lover of his life and innocent habits to the end we children admired him partly for his beautiful face and silver hair for none more than children are concerned for beauty and above all for beauty in the old partly for the solemn light in which we beheld him once a week the observed of all observers in the pulpit but his strictness and distance the effect i now fancy of old age slow blood and settled habit oppressed us with a kind of terror when not abroad he sat much alone writing sermons or letters to his scattered family in a dark and cold room with a library of bloodless booksor so they seemed in those days although i have some of them now on my own shelves and like well enough to read them and these lonely hours wrapped him in the greater gloom for our imaginations but the study had a redeeming grace in many indian pictures gaudily coloured and dear to young eyes i cannot depict for i have no such passions now the greed with which i beheld them and when i was once sent in to say a psalm to my grandfather i went quaking indeed with fear but at the same time glowing with hope that if i said it well he might reward me with an indian picture    thy foot hell not let slide nor will      he slumber that thee keeps  it ran a strange conglomerate of the unpronounceable a sad model to set in childhood before one who was himself to be a versifier and a task in recitation that really merited reward and i must suppose the old man thought so too and was either touched or amused by the performance for he took me in his arms with most unwonted tenderness and kissed me and gave me a little kindly sermon for my psalm so that for that day we were clerk and parson i was struck by this reception into so tender a surprise that i forgot my disappointment and indeed the hope was one of those that childhood forges for a pastime and with no design upon reality nothing was more unlikely than that my grandfather should strip himself of one of those pictures lovegifts and reminders of his absent sons nothing more unlikely than that he should bestow it upon me he had no idea of spoiling children leaving all that to my aunt he had fared hard himself and blubbered under the rod in the last century and his ways were still spartan for the young the last word i heard upon his lips was in this spartan key he had overwalked in the teeth of an east wind and was now near the end of his many days he sat by the diningroom fire with his white hair pale face and bloodshot eyes a somewhat awful figure and my aunt had given him a dose of our good old scots medicine dr gregorys powder now that remedy as the work of a near kinsman of rob roy himself may have a savour of romance for the imagination but it comes uncouthly to the palate the old gentleman had taken it with a wry face and that being accomplished sat with perfect simplicity like a childs munching a barleysugar kiss but when my aunt having the canister open in her hands proposed to let me share in the sweets he interfered at once i had had no gregory then i should have no barleysugar kiss so he decided with a touch of irritation and just then the phaeton coming opportunely to the kitchen doorfor such was our unlordly fashioni was taken for the last time from the presence of my grandfather  now i often wonder what i have inherited from this old minister i must suppose indeed that he was fond of preaching sermons and so am i though i never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them he sought health in his youth in the isle of wight and i have sought it in both hemispheres but whereas he found and kept it i am still on the quest he was a great lover of shakespeare whom he read aloud i have been told with taste well i love my shakespeare also and am persuaded i can read him well though i own i never have been told so he made embroidery designing his own patterns and in that kind of work i never made anything but a kettleholder in berlin wool and an odd garter of knitting which was as black as the chimney before i had done with it he loved port and nuts and porter and so do i but they agreed better with my grandfather which seems to me a breach of contract he had chalkstones in his fingers and these in good time i may possibly inherit but i would much rather have inherited his noble presence try as i please i cannot join myself on with the reverend doctor and all the while no doubt and even as i write the phrase he moves in my blood and whispers words to me and sits efficient in the very knot and centre of my being in his garden as i played there i learned the love of millsor had i an ancestor a millerand a kindness for the neighbourhood of graves as homely things not without their poetryor had i an ancestor a sexton but what of the garden where he played himselffor that too was a scene of my education some part of me played there in the eighteenth century and ran races under the green avenue at pilrig some part of me trudged up leith walk which was still a country place and sat on the high school benches and was thrashed perhaps by dr adam the house where i spent my youth was not yet thought upon but we made holiday parties among the cornfields on its site and ate strawberries and cream near by at a gardeners all this i had forgotten only my grandfather remembered and once reminded me i have forgotten too how we grew up and took orders and went to our first ayrshire parish and fell in love with and married a daughter of burnss dr smithsmith opens out his cauld harangues i have forgotten but i was there all the same and heard stories of burns at first hand  and there is a thing stranger than all that for this homunculus or partman of mine that walked about the eighteenth century with dr balfour in his youth was in the way of meeting other homunculi or partmen in the persons of my other ancestors these were of a lower order and doubtless we looked down upon them duly but as i went to college with dr balfour i may have seen the lamp and oil man taking down the shutters from his shop beside the tronwe may have had a rabbithutch or a bookshelf made for us by a certain carpenter in i know not what wynd of the old smoky city or upon some holiday excursion we may have looked into the windows of a cottage in a flowergarden and seen a certain weaver plying his shuttle and these were all kinsmen of mine upon the other side and from the eyes of the lamp and oil man onehalf of my unborn father and onequarter of myself looked out upon us as we went by to college nothing of all this would cross the mind of the young student as he posted up the bridges with trim stockinged legs in that city of cocked hats and good scots still unadulterated it would not cross his mind that he should have a daughter and the lamp and oil man just then beginning by a not unnatural metastasis to bloom into a lighthouseengineer should have a grandson and that these two in the fulness of time should wed and some portion of that student himself should survive yet a year or two longer in the person of their child  but our ancestral adventures are beyond even the arithmetic of fancy and it is the chief recommendation of long pedigrees that we can follow backward the careers of our homunculi and be reminded of our antenatal lives our conscious years are but a moment in the history of the elements that build us are you a bankclerk and do you live at peckham it was not always so and though today i am only a man of letters either tradition errs or i was present when there landed at st andrews a french barbersurgeon to tend the health and the beard of the great cardinal beaton i have shaken a spear in the debateable land and shouted the slogan of the elliots i was present when a skipper plying from dundee smuggled jacobites to france after the 15 i was in a west india merchants office perhaps next door to bailie nicol jarvies and managed the business of a plantation in st kitts i was with my engineergrandfather the soninlaw of the lamp and oil man when he sailed north about scotland on the famous cruise that gave us the pirate and the lord of the isles i was with him too on the bell rock in the fog when the smeaton had drifted from her moorings and the aberdeen men pick in hand had seized upon the only boats and he must stoop and lap seawater before his tongue could utter audible words and once more with him when the bell rock beacon took a thrawe and his workmen fled into the tower then nearly finished and he sat unmoved reading in his bibleor affecting to readtill one after another slunk back with confusion of countenance to their engineer yes parts of me have seen life and met adventures and sometimes met them well and away in the still cloudier past the threads that make me up can be traced by fancy into the bosoms of thousands and millions of ascendants picts who rallied round macbeth and the old and highly preferable system of descent by females fleërs from before the legions of agricola marchers in pannonian morasses stargazers on chaldæan plateaus and furthest of all what face is this that fancy can see peering through the disparted branches what sleeper in green treetops what muncher of nuts concludes my pedigree probably arboreal in his habits  and i know not which is the more strange that i should carry about with me some fibres of my ministergrandfather or that in him as he sat in his cool study grave reverend contented gentleman there was an aboriginal frisking of the blood that was not his treetop memories like undeveloped negatives lay dormant in his mind treetop instincts awoke and were trod down and probably arboreal scarce to be distinguished from a monkey gambolled and chattered in the brain of the old divine       viii    memoirs of an islet   those who try to be artists use time after time the matter of their recollections setting and resetting little coloured memories of men and scenes rigging up it may be some especial friend in the attire of a buccaneer and decreeing armies to manoeuvre or murder to be done on the playground of their youth but the memories are a fairy gift which cannot be worn out in using after a dozen services in various tales the little sunbright pictures of the past still shine in the minds eye with not a lineament defaced not a tint impaired glück und unglück wird gesang if goethe pleases yet only by endless avatars the original reembodying after each so that a writer in time begins to wonder at the perdurable life of these impressions begins perhaps to fancy that he wrongs them when he weaves them in with fiction and looking back on them with evergrowing kindness puts them at last substantive jewels in a setting of their own  one or two of these pleasant spectres i think i have laid i used one but the other day a little eyot of dense freshwater sand where i once waded deep in butterburrs delighting to hear the song of the river on both sides and to tell myself that i was indeed and at last upon an island two of my puppets lay there a summers day hearkening to the shearers at work in riverside fields and to the drums of the grey old garrison upon the neighbouring hill and this was i think done rightly the place was rightly peopledand now belongs not to me but to my puppetsfor a time at least in time perhaps the puppets will grow faint the original memory swim up instant as ever and i shall once more lie in bed and see the little sandy isle in allan water as it is in nature and the child that once was me wading there in butterburrs and wonder at the instancy and virgin freshness of that memory and be pricked again in season and out of season by the desire to weave it into art  there is another isle in my collection the memory of which besieges me i put a whole family there in one of my tales and later on threw upon its shores and condemned to several days of rain and shellfish on its tumbled boulders the hero of another the ink is not yet faded the sound of the sentences is still in my minds ear and i am under a spell to write of that island again     i  the little isle of earraid lies close in to the southwest corner of the ross of mull the sound of iona on one side across which you may see the isle and church of columba the open sea to the other where you shall be able to mark on a clear surfy day the breakers running white on many sunken rocks i first saw it or first remember seeing it framed in the round bullseye of a cabin port the sea lying smooth along its shores like the waters of a lake the colourless clear light of the early morning making plain its heathery and rocky hummocks there stood upon it in those days a single rude house of uncemented stones approached by a pier of wreckwood it must have been very early for it was then summer and in summer in that latitude day scarcely withdraws but even at that hour the house was making a sweet smoke of peats which came to me over the bay and the barelegged daughters of the cotter were wading by the pier the same day we visited the shores of the isle in the ships boats rowed deep into fiddlers hole sounding as we went and having taken stock of all possible accommodation pitched on the northern inlet as the scene of operations for it was no accident that had brought the lighthouse steamer to anchor in the bay of earraid fifteen miles away to seaward a certain black rock stood environed by the atlantic rollers the outpost of the torran reefs here was a tower to be built and a star lighted for the conduct of seamen but as the rock was small and hard of access and far from land the work would be one of years and my father was now looking for a shore station where the stones might be quarried and dressed the men live and the tender with some degree of safety lie at anchor  i saw earraid next from the sternthwart of an iona lugger sam bough and i sitting there cheek by jowl with our feet upon our baggage in a beautiful clear northern summer eve and behold there was now a pier of stone there were rows of sheds railways travellingcranes a street of cottages an iron house for the resident engineer wooden bothies for the men a stage where the courses of the tower were put together experimentally and behind the settlement a great gash in the hillside where granite was quarried in the bay the steamer lay at her moorings all day long there hung about the place the music of chinking tools and even in the dead of night the watchman carried his lantern to and fro in the dark settlement and could light the pipe of any midnight muser it was above all strange to see earraid on the sunday when the sound of the tools ceased and there fell a crystal quiet all about the green compound men would be sauntering in their sundays best walking with those lax joints of the reposing toiler thoughtfully smoking talking small as if in honour of the stillness or hearkening to the wailing of the gulls and it was strange to see our sabbath services held as they were in one of the bothies with mr brebner reading at a table and the congregation perched about in the double tier of sleepingbunks and to hear the singing of the psalms the chapters the inevitable spurgeons sermon and the old eloquent lighthouse prayer  in fine weather when by the spyglass on the hill the sea was observed to run low upon the reef there would be a sound of preparation in the very early morning and before the sun had risen from behind ben more the tender would steam out of the bay over fifteen seamiles of the great blue atlantic rollers she ploughed her way trailing at her tail a brace of wallowing stonelighters the open ocean widened upon either board and the hills of the mainland began to go down on the horizon before she came to her unhomely destination and layto at last where the rock clapped its black head above the swell with the tall iron barrack on its spider legs and the truncated tower and the cranes waving their arms and the smoke of the enginefire rising in the midsea an ugly reef is this of the dhu heartach no pleasant assemblage of shelves and pools and creeks about which a child might play for a whole summer without weariness like the bell rock or the skerryvore but one oval nodule of blacktrap sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug no other life was there but that of seabirds and of the sea itself that here ran like a millrace and growled about the outer reef for ever and ever and again in the calmest weather roared and spouted on the rock itself times were different upon dhu heartach when it blew and the night fell dark and the neighbour lights of skerryvore and rhuval were quenched in fog and the men sat prisoned high up in their iron drum that then resounded with the lashing of the sprays fear sat with them in their seabeleaguered dwelling and the colour changed in anxious faces when some greater billow struck the barrack and its pillars quivered and sprang under the blow it was then that the foreman builder mr goodwillie whom i see before me still in his rockhabit of undecipherable rags would get his fiddle down and strike up human minstrelsy amid the music of the storm but it was in sunshine only that i saw dhu heartach and it was in sunshine or the yet lovelier summer afterglow that the steamer would return to earraid ploughing an enchanted sea the obedient lighters relieved of their deck cargo riding in her wake more quietly and the steersman upon each as she rose on the long swell standing tall and dark against the shining west     ii  but it was in earraid itself that i delighted chiefly the lighthouse settlement scarce encroached beyond its fences over the top of the first brae the ground was all virgin the world all shut out the face of things unchanged by any of mans doings here was no living presence save for the limpets on the rocks for some old grey rainbeaten ram that i might rouse out of a ferny den betwixt two boulders or for the haunting and the piping of the gulls it was older than man it was found so by incoming celts and seafaring norsemen and columbas priests the earthy savour of the bog plants the rude disorder of the boulders the inimitable seaside brightness of the air the brine and the iodine the lap of the billows among the weedy reefs the sudden springing up of a great run of dashing surf along the seafront of the isleall that i saw and felt my predecessors must have seen and felt with scarce a difference i steeped myself in open air and in past ages    delightful would it be to me to be in uchd ailiun      on the pinnacle of a rock    that i might often see      the face of the ocean    that i might hear the song of the wonderful birds      source of happiness    that i might hear the thunder of the crowding waves      upon the rocks    at times at work without compulsion      this would be delightful    at times plucking dulse from the rocks      at times at fishing  so about the next island of iona sang columba himself twelve hundred years before and so might i have sung of earraid  and all the while i was aware that this life of seabathing and sunburning was for me but a holiday in that year cannon were roaring for days together on french battlefields and i would sit in my isle i call it mine after the use of lovers and think upon the war and the loudness of these faraway battles and the pain of the mens wounds and the weariness of their marching and i would think too of that other war which is as old as mankind and is indeed the life of man the unsparing war the grinding slavery of competition the toil of seventy years dearbought bread precarious honour the perils and pitfalls and the poor rewards it was a long look forward the future summoned me as with trumpet calls it warned me back as with a voice of weeping and beseeching and i thrilled and trembled on the brink of life like a childish bather on the beach  there was another young man on earraid in these days and we were much together bathing clambering on the boulders trying to sail a boat and spinning round instead in the oily whirlpools of the roost but the most part of the time we spoke of the great uncharted desert of our futures wondering together what should there befall us hearing with surprise the sound of our own voices in the empty vestibule of youth as far and as hard as it seemed then to look forward to the grave so far it seems now to look backward upon these emotions so hard to recall justly that loath submission as of the sacrificial bull with which we stooped our necks under the yoke of destiny i met my old companion but the other day i cannot tell of course what he was thinking but upon my part i was wondering to see us both so much at home and so composed and sedentary in the world and how much we had gained and how much we had lost to attain to that composure and which had been upon the whole our best estate when we sat there prating sensibly like men of some experience or when we shared our timorous and hopeful counsels in a western islet       ix    thomas stevenson    civil engineer   the death of thomas stevenson will mean not very much to the general reader his service to mankind took on forms of which the public knows little and understands less he came seldom to london and then only as a task remaining always a stranger and a convinced provincial putting up for years at the same hotel where his father had gone before him faithful for long to the same restaurant the same church and the same theatre chosen simply for propinquity steadfastly refusing to dine out he had a circle of his own indeed at home few men were more beloved in edinburgh where he breathed an air that pleased him and wherever he went in railway carriages or hotel smokingrooms his strange humorous vein of talk and his transparent honesty raised him up friends and admirers but to the general public and the world of london except about the parliamentary committeerooms he remained unknown all the time his lights were in every part of the world guiding the mariner his firm were consulting engineers to the indian the new zealand and the japanese lighthouse boards so that edinburgh was a worldcentre for that branch of applied science in germany he had been called the nestor of lighthouse illumination even in france where his claims were long denied he was at last on the occasion of the late exposition recognised and medalled and to show by one instance the inverted nature of his reputation comparatively small at home yet filling the world a friend of mine was this winter on a visit to the spanish main and was asked by a peruvian if he knew mr stevenson the author because his works were much esteemed in peru my friend supposed the reference was to the writer of tales but the peruvian had never heard of dr jekyll what he had in his eye what was esteemed in peru were the volumes of the engineer  thomas stevenson was born at edinburgh in the year 1818 the grandson of thomas smith first engineer to the board of northern lights son of robert stevenson brother of alan and david so that his nephew david alan stevenson joined with him at the time of his death in the engineership is the sixth of the family who has held successively or conjointly that office the bell rock his fathers great triumph was finished before he was born but he served under his brother alan in the building of skerryvore the noblest of all extant deepsea lights and in conjunction with his brother david he added twothe chickens and dhu heartachto that small number of mans extreme outposts in the ocean of shore lights the two brothers last named erected no fewer than twentyseven of beacons6 about twentyfive many harbours were successfully carried out one the harbour of wick the chief disaster of my fathers life was a failure the sea proved too strong for mans arts and after expedients hitherto unthought of and on a scale hypercyclopean the work must be deserted and now stands a ruin in that bleak godforsaken bay ten miles from johnogroats in the improvement of rivers the brothers were likewise in a large way of practice over both england and scotland nor had any british engineer anything approaching their experience  it was about this nucleus of his professional labours that all my fathers scientific inquiries and inventions centred these proceeded from and acted back upon his daily business thus it was as a harbour engineer that he became interested in the propagation and reduction of waves a difficult subject in regard to which he has left behind him much suggestive matter and some valuable approximate results storms were his sworn adversaries and it was through the study of storms that he approached that of meteorology at large many who knew him not otherwise knewperhaps have in their gardenshis louvreboarded screen for instruments but the great achievement of his life was of course in optics as applied to lighthouse illumination fresnel had done much fresnel had settled the fixed light apparatus on a principle that still seems unimprovable and when thomas stevenson stepped in and brought to a comparable perfection the revolving light a not unnatural jealousy and much painful controversy rose in france it had its hour and as i have told already even in france it has blown by had it not it would have mattered the less since all through his life my father continued to justify his claim by fresh advances new apparatus for lights in new situations was continually being designed with the same unwearied search after perfection the same nice ingenuity of means and though the holophotal revolving light perhaps still remains his most elegant contrivance it is difficult to give it the palm over the much later condensing system with its thousand possible modifications the number and the value of these improvements entitle their author to the name of one of mankinds benefactors in all parts of the world a safer landfall awaits the mariner two things must be said and first that thomas stevenson was no mathematician natural shrewdness a sentiment of optical laws and a great intensity of consideration led him to just conclusions but to calculate the necessary formulæ for the instruments he had conceived was often beyond him and he must fall back on the help of others notably on that of his cousin and lifelong intimate friend emeritus professor swan7 of st andrews and his later friend professor p g tait it is a curious enough circumstance and a great encouragement to others that a man so ill equipped should have succeeded in one of the most abstract and arduous walks of applied science the second remark is one that applies to the whole family and only particularly to thomas stevenson from the great number and importance of his inventions holding as the stevensons did a government appointment they regarded their original work as something due already to the nation and none of them has ever taken out a patent it is another cause of the comparative obscurity of the name for a patent not only brings in money it infallibly spreads reputation and my fathers instruments enter anonymously into a hundred lightrooms and are passed anonymously over in a hundred reports where the least considerable patent would stand out and tell its authors story  but the lifework of thomas stevenson remains what we have lost what we now rather try to recall is the friend and companion he was a man of a somewhat antique strain with a blended sternness and softness that was wholly scottish and at first somewhat bewildering with a profound essential melancholy of disposition and what often accompanies it the most humorous geniality in company shrewd and childish passionately attached passionately prejudiced a man of many extremes many faults of temper and no very stable foothold for himself among lifes troubles yet he was a wise adviser many men and these not inconsiderable took counsel with him habitually i sat at his feet writes one of these when i asked his advice and when the broad brow was set in thought and the firm mouth said his say i always knew that no man could add to the worth of the conclusion he had excellent taste though whimsical and partial collected old furniture and delighted specially in sunflowers long before the days of mr oscar wilde took a lasting pleasure in prints and pictures was a devout admirer of thomson of duddingston at a time when few shared the taste and though he read little was constant to his favourite books he had never any greek latin he happily retaught himself after he had left school where he was a mere consistent idler happily i say for lactantius vossius and cardinal bona were his chief authors the first he must have read for twenty years uninterruptedly keeping it near him in his study and carrying it in his bag on journeys another old theologian brown of wamphray was often in his hands when he was indisposed he had two books guy mannering and the parents assistant of which he never wearied he was a strong conservative or as he preferred to call himself a tory except in so far as his views were modified by a hotheaded chivalrous sentiment for women he was actually in favour of a marriage law under which any woman might have a divorce for the asking and no man on any ground whatever and the same sentiment found another expression in a magdalen mission in edinburgh founded and largely supported by himself this was but one of the many channels of his public generosity his private was equally unstrained the church of scotland of which he held the doctrines though in a sense of his own and to which he bore a clansmans loyalty profited often by his time and money and though from a morbid sense of his own unworthiness he would never consent to be an officebearer his advice was often sought and he served the church on many committees what he perhaps valued highest in his work were his contributions to the defence of christianity one of which in particular was praised by hutchison stirling and reprinted at the request of professor crawford  his sense of his own unworthiness i have called morbid morbid too were his sense of the fleetingness of life and his concern for death he had never accepted the conditions of mans life or his own character and his inmost thoughts were ever tinged with the celtic melancholy cases of conscience were sometimes grievous to him and that delicate employment of a scientific witness cost him many qualms but he found respite from these troublesome humours in his work in his lifelong study of natural science in the society of those he loved and in his daily walks which now would carry him far into the country with some congenial friend and now keep him dangling about the town from one old bookshop to another and scraping romantic acquaintance with every dog that passed his talk compounded of so much sterling sense and so much freakish humour and clothed in language so apt droll and emphatic was a perpetual delight to all who knew him before the clouds began to settle on his mind his use of language was both just and picturesque and when at the beginning of his illness he began to feel the ebbing of this power it was strange and painful to hear him reject one word after another as inadequate and at length desist from the search and leave his phrase unfinished rather than finish it without propriety it was perhaps another celtic trait that his affections and emotions passionate as these were and liable to passionate ups and downs found the most eloquent expression both in words and gestures love anger and indignation shone through him and broke forth in imagery like what we read of southern races for all these emotional extremes and in spite of the melancholy ground of his character he had upon the whole a happy life nor was he less fortunate in his death which at the last came to him unaware   footnotes    6 in dr murrays admirable new dictionary i have

silencefranklin     i  there can be no fairer ambition than to excel in talk to be affable gay ready clear and welcome to have a fact a thought or an illustration pat to every subject and not only to cheer the flight of time among our intimates but bear our part in that great international congress always sitting where public wrongs are first declared public errors first corrected and the course of public opinion shaped day by day a little nearer to the right no measure comes before parliament but it has been long ago prepared by the grand jury of the talkers no book is written that has not been largely composed by their assistance literature in many of its branches is no other than the shadow of good talk but the imitation falls far short of the original in life freedom and effect there are always two to a talk giving and taking comparing experience and according conclusions talk is fluid tentative continually in further search and progress while written words remain fixed become idols even to the writer found wooden dogmatisms and preserve flies of obvious error in the amber of the truth last and chief while literature gagged with linseywoolsey can only deal with a fraction of the life of man talk goes fancy free and may call a spade a spade talk has none of the freezing immunities of the pulpit it cannot even if it would become merely æsthetic or merely classical like literature a jest intervenes the solemn humbug is dissolved in laughter and speech runs forth out of the contemporary groove into the open fields of nature cheery and cheering like schoolboys out of school and it is in talk alone that we can learn our period and ourselves in short the first duty of a man is to speak that is his chief business in this world and talk which is the harmonious speech of two or more is by far the most accessible of pleasures it costs nothing in money it is all profit it completes our education founds and fosters our friendships and can be enjoyed at any age and in almost any state of health  the spice of life is battle the friendliest relations are still a kind of contest and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot we must continually face some other person eye to eye and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity it is still by force of body or power of character or intellect that we attain to worthy pleasures men and women contend for each other in the lists of love like rival mesmerists the active and adroit decide their challenges in the sports of the body and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation all sluggish and pacific pleasures are to the same degree solitary and selfish and every durable bond between human beings is founded in or heightened by some element of competition now the relation that has the least root in matter is undoubtedly that airy one of friendship and hence i suppose it is that good talk most commonly arises among friends talk is indeed both the scene and instrument of friendship it is in talk alone that the friends can measure strength and enjoy that amicable counterassertion of personality which is the gauge of relations and the sport of life  a good talk is not to be had for the asking humours must first be accorded in a kind of overture or prologue hour company and circumstance be suited and then at a fit juncture the subject the quarry of two heated minds spring up like a deer out of the wood not that the talker has any of the hunters pride though he has all and more than all his ardour the genuine artist follows the stream of conversation as an angler follows the windings of a brook not dallying where he fails to kill he trusts implicitly to hazard and he is rewarded by continual variety continual pleasure and those changing prospects of the truth that are the best of education there is nothing in a subject so called that we should regard it as an idol or follow it beyond the promptings of desire indeed there are few subjects and so far as they are truly talkable more than the half of them may be reduced to three that i am i that you are you and that there are other people dimly understood to be not quite the same as either wherever talk may range it still runs half the time on these eternal lines the theme being set each plays on himself as on an instrument asserts and justifies himself ransacks his brain for instances and opinions and brings them forth newminted to his own surprise and the admiration of his adversary all natural talk is a festival of ostentation and by the laws of the game each accepts and fans the vanity of the other it is from that reason that we venture to lay ourselves so open that we dare to be so warmly eloquent and that we swell in each others eyes to such a vast proportion for talkers once launched begin to overflow the limits of their ordinary selves tower up to the height of their secret pretensions and give themselves out for the heroes brave pious musical and wise that in their most shining moments they aspire to be so they weave for themselves with words and for a while inhabit a palace of delights temple at once and theatre where they fill the round of the worlds dignities and feast with the gods exulting in kudos and when the talk is over each goes his way still flushed with vanity and admiration still trailing clouds of glory each declines from the height of his ideal orgie not in a moment but by slow declension i remember in the entracte of an afternoon performance coming forth into the sunshine in a beautiful green gardened corner of a romantic city and as i sat and smoked the music moving in my blood i seemed to sit there and evaporate the flying dutchman for it was that i had been hearing with a wonderful sense of life warmth wellbeing and pride and the noises of the city voices bells and marching feet fell together in my ears like a symphonious orchestra in the same way the excitement of a good talk lives for a long while after in the blood the heart still hot within you the brain still simmering and the physical earth swimming around you with the colours of the sunset  natural talk like ploughing should turn up a large surface of life rather than dig mines into geological strata masses of experience anecdote incident crosslights quotation historical instances the whole flotsam and jetsam of two minds forced in and in upon the matter in hand from every point of the compass and from every degree of mental elevation and abasementthese are the material with which talk is fortified the food on which the talkers thrive such argument as is proper to the exercise should still be brief and seizing talk should proceed by instances by the apposite not the expository it should keep close along the lines of humanity near the bosoms and businesses of men at the level where history fiction and experience intersect and illuminate each other i am i and you are you with all my heart but conceive how these lean propositions change and brighten when instead of words the actual you and i sit cheek by jowl the spirit housed in the live body and the very clothes uttering voices to corroborate the story in the face not less surprising is the change when we leave off to speak of generalitiesthe bad the good the miser and all the characters of theophrastusand call up other men by anecdote or instance in their very trick and feature or trading on a common knowledge toss each other famous names still glowing with the hues of life communication is no longer by words but by the instancing of whole biographies epics systems of philosophy and epochs of history in bulk that which is understood excels that which is spoken in quantity and quality alike ideas thus figured and personified change hands as we may say like coin and the speakers imply without effort the most obscure and intricate thoughts strangers who have a large common ground of reading will for this reason come the sooner to the grapple of genuine converse if they know othello and napoleon consuelo and clarissa harlowe vautrin and steenie steenson they can leave generalities and begin at once to speak by figures  conduct and art are the two subjects that arise most frequently and that embrace the widest range of facts a few pleasures bear discussion for their own sake but only those which are most social or most radically human and even these can only be discussed among their devotees a technicality is always welcome to the expert whether in athletics art or law i have heard the best kind of talk on technicalities from such rare and happy persons as both know and love their business no human being ever spoke of scenery for above two minutes at a time which makes me suspect we hear too much of it in literature the weather is regarded as the very nadir and scoff of conversational topics and yet the weather the dramatic element in scenery is far more tractable in language and far more human both in import and suggestion than the stable features of the landscape sailors and shepherds and the people generally of coast and mountain talk well of it and it is often excitingly presented in literature but the tendency of all living talk draws it back and back into the common focus of humanity talk is a creature of the street and marketplace feeding on gossip and its last resort is still in a discussion on morals that is the heroic form of gossip heroic in virtue of its high pretensions but still gossip because it turns on personalities you can keep no men long nor scotsmen at all off moral or theological discussion these are to all the world what law is to lawyers they are everybodys technicalities the medium through which all consider life and the dialect in which they express their judgments i knew three young men who walked together daily for some two months in a solemn and beautiful forest and in cloudless summer weather daily they talked with unabated zest and yet scarce wandered that whole time beyond two subjectstheology and love and perhaps neither a court of love nor an assembly of divines would have granted their premisses or welcomed their conclusions  conclusions indeed are not often reached by talk any more than by private thinking that is not the profit the profit is in the exercise and above all in the experience for when we reason at large on any subject we review our state and history in life from time to time however and specially i think in talking art talk becomes effective conquering like war widening the boundaries of knowledge like an exploration a point arises the question takes a problematical a baffling yet a likely air the talkers begin to feel lively presentiments of some conclusion near at hand towards this they strive with emulous ardour each by his own path and struggling for first utterance and then one leaps upon the summit of that matter with a shout and almost at the same moment the other is beside him and behold they are agreed like enough the progress is illusory a mere cats cradle having been wound and unwound out of words but the sense of joint discovery is none the less giddy and inspiriting and in the life of the talker such triumphs though imaginary are neither few nor far apart they are attained with speed and pleasure in the hour of mirth and by the nature of the process they are always worthily shared  there is a certain attitude combative at once and deferential eager to fight yet most averse to quarrel which marks out at once the talkable man it is not eloquence not fairness not obstinacy but a certain proportion of all of these that i love to encounter in my amicable adversaries they must not be pontiffs holding doctrine but huntsmen questing after elements of truth neither must they be boys to be instructed but fellowteachers with whom i may wrangle and agree on equal terms we must reach some solution some shadow of consent for without that eager talk becomes a torture but we do not wish to reach it cheaply or quickly or without the tussle and effort wherein pleasure lies  the very best talker with me is one whom i shall call springheeld jack8 i say so because i never knew any one who mingled so largely the possible ingredients of converse in the spanish proverb the fourth man necessary to compound a salad is a madman to mix it jack is that madman i know not which is more remarkable the insane lucidity of his conclusions the humorous eloquence of his language or his power of method bringing the whole of life into the focus of the subject treated mixing the conversational salad like a drunken god he doubles like the serpent changes and flashes like the shaken kaleidoscope transmigrates bodily into the views of others and so in the twinkling of an eye and with a heady rapture turns questions inside out and flings them empty before you on the ground like a triumphant conjuror it is my common practice when a piece of conduct puzzles me to attack it in the presence of jack with such grossness such partiality and such wearing iteration as at length shall spur him up in its defence in a moment he transmigrates dons the required character and with moonstruck philosophy justifies the act in question i can fancy nothing to compare with the vigour of these impersonations the strange scale of language flying from shakespeare to kant and from kant to major dyngwell    as fast as a musician scatters sounds    out of an instrument  the sudden sweeping generalisations the absurd irrelevant particularities the wit wisdom folly humour eloquence and bathos each startling in its kind and yet all luminous in the admired disorder of their combination a talker of a different calibre though belonging to the same school is burly9 burly is a man of a great presence he commands a larger atmosphere gives the impression of a grosser mass of character than most men it has been said of him that his presence could be felt in a room you entered blindfold and the same i think has been said of other powerful constitutions condemned to much physical inaction there is something boisterous and piratic in burlys manner of talk which suits well enough with this impression he will roar you down he will bury his face in his hands he will undergo passions of revolt and agony and meanwhile his attitude of mind is really both conciliatory and receptive and after pistol has been outpistold and the welkin rung for hours you begin to perceive a certain subsidence in these spring torrents points of agreement issue and you end arminarm and in a glow of mutual admiration the outcry only serves to make your final union the more unexpected and precious throughout there has been perfect sincerity perfect intelligence a desire to hear although not always to listen and an unaffected eagerness to meet concessions you have with burly none of the dangers that attend debate with springheeld jack who may at any moment turn his powers of transmigration on yourself create for you a view you never held and then furiously fall on you for holding it these at least are my two favourites and both are loud copious intolerant talkers this argues that i myself am in the same category for if we love talking at all we love a bright fierce adversary who will hold his ground foot by foot in much our own manner sell his attention dearly and give us our full measure of the dust and exertion of battle both these men can be beat from a position but it takes six hours to do it a high and hard adventure worth attempting with both you can pass days in an enchanted country of the mind with people scenery and manners of its own live a life apart more arduous active and glowing than any real existence and come forth again when the talk is over as out of a theatre or a dream to find the east wind still blowing and the chimneypots of the old battered city still around you jack has the far finer mind burly the far more honest jack gives us the animated poetry burly the romantic prose of similar themes the one glances high like a meteor and makes a light in darkness the other with many changing hues of fire burns at the sealevel like a conflagration but both have the same humour and artistic interests the same unquenched ardour in pursuit the same gusts of talk and thunderclaps of contradiction  cockshot10 is a different article but vastly entertaining and has been meat and drink to me for many a long evening his manner is dry brisk and pertinacious and the choice of words not much the point about him is his extraordinary readiness and spirit you can propound nothing but he has either a theory about it readymade or will have one instantly on the stocks and proceed to lay its timbers and launch it in your presence let me see he will say give me a moment i should have some theory for that a blither spectacle than the vigour with which he sets about the task it were hard to fancy he is possessed by a demoniac energy welding the elements for his life and bending ideas as an athlete bends a horseshoe with a visible and lively effort he has in theorising a compass an art what i would call the synthetic gusto something of a herbert spencer who should see the fun of the thing you are not bound and no more is he to place your faith in these brandnew opinions but some of them are right enough durable even for life and the poorest serve for a cockshyas when idle people after picnics float a bottle on a pond and have an hours diversion ere it sinks whichever they are serious opinions or humours of the moment he still defends his ventures with indefatigable wit and spirit hitting savagely himself but taking punishment like a man he knows and never forgets that people talk first of all for the sake of talking conducts himself in the ring to use the old slang like a thorough glutton and honestly enjoys a telling facer from his adversary cockshot is bottled effervescency the sworn foe of sleep threeinthemorning cockshot says a victim his talk is like the driest of all imaginable dry champagnes sleight of hand and inimitable quickness are the qualities by which he lives athelred11 on the other hand presents you with the spectacle of a sincere and somewhat slow nature thinking aloud he is the most unready man i ever knew to shine in conversation you may see him sometimes wrestle with a refractory jest for a minute or two together and perhaps fail to throw it in the end and there is something singularly engaging often instructive in the simplicity with which he thus exposes the process as well as the result the works as well as the dial of the clock withal he has his hours of inspiration apt words come to him as if by accident and coming from deeper down they smack the more personally they have the more of fine old crusted humanity rich in sediment and humour there are sayings of his in which he has stamped himself into the very grain of the language you would think he must have worn the words next his skin and slept with them yet it is not as a sayer of particular good things that athelred is most to be regarded rather as the stalwart woodman of thought i have pulled on a light cord often enough while he has been wielding the broadaxe and between us on this unequal division many a specious fallacy has fallen i have known him to battle the same question night after night for years keeping it in the reign of talk constantly applying it and reapplying it to life with humorous or grave intention and all the while never hurrying nor flagging nor taking an unfair advantage of the facts jack at a given moment when arising as it were from the tripod can be more radiantly just to those from whom he differs but then the tenor of his thoughts is even calumnious while athelred slower to forge excuses is yet slower to condemn and sits over the welter of the world vacillating but still judicial and still faithfully contending with his doubts  both the last talkers deal much in points of conduct and religion studied in the dry light of prose indirectly and as if against his will the same elements from time to time appear in the troubled and poetic talk of opalstein12 his various and exotic knowledge complete although unready sympathies and fine full discriminative flow of language fit him out to be the best of talkers so perhaps he is with some not quite with meproxime accessit i should say he sings the praises of the earth and the arts flowers and jewels wine and music in a moonlight serenading manner as to the light guitar even wisdom comes from his tongue like singing no one is indeed more tuneful in the upper notes but even while he sings the song of the sirens he still hearkens to the barking of the sphinx jarring byronic notes interrupt the flow of his horatian humours his mirth has something of the tragedy of the world for its perpetual background and he feasts like don giovanni to a double orchestra one lightly sounding for the dance one pealing beethoven in the distance he is not truly reconciled either with life or with himself and this instant war in his members sometimes divides the mans attention he does not always perhaps not often frankly surrender himself in conversation he brings into the talk other thoughts than those which he expresses you are conscious that he keeps an eye on something else that he does not shake off the world nor quite forget himself hence arise occasional disappointments even an occasional unfairness for his companions who find themselves one day giving too much and the next when they are wary out of season giving perhaps too little purcel13 is in another class from any i have mentioned he is no debater but appears in conversation as occasion rises in two distinct characters one of which i admire and fear and the other love in the first he is radiantly civil and rather silent sits on a high courtly hilltop and from that vantageground drops you his remarks like favours he seems not to share in our sublunary contentions he wears no sign of interest when on a sudden there falls in a crystal of wit so polished that the dull do not perceive it but so right that the sensitive are silenced true talk should have more body and blood should be louder vainer and more declaratory of the man the true talker should not hold so steady an advantage over whom he speaks with and that is one reason out of a score why i prefer my purcel in his second character when he unbends into a strain of graceful gossip singing like the fireside kettle in these moods he has an elegant homeliness that rings of the true queen anne i know another person who attains in his moments to the insolence of a restoration comedy speaking i declare as congreve wrote but that is a sport of nature and scarce falls under the rubric for there is none alas to give him answer  one last remark occurs it is the mark of genuine conversation that the sayings can scarce be quoted with their full effect beyond the circle of common friends to have their proper weight they should appear in a biography and with the portrait of the speaker good talk is dramatic it is like an impromptu piece of acting where each should represent himself to the greatest advantage and that is the best kind of talk where each speaker is most fully and candidly himself and where if you were to shift the speeches round from one to another there would be the greatest loss in significance and perspicuity it is for this reason that talk depends so wholly on our company we should like to introduce falstaff and mercutio or falstaff and sir toby but falstaff in talk with cordelia seems even painful most of us by the protean quality of man can talk to some degree with all but the true talk that strikes out all the slumbering best of us comes only with the peculiar brethren of our spirits is founded as deep as love in the constitution of our being and is a thing to relish with all our energy while yet we have it and to be grateful for for ever   footnotes    8 robert alan mowbray stevenson 18471900    9 w e henley 18491903    10 fleeming jenkin 183385    11 sir walter grindlay simpson bart 184398    12 john addington symonds 184093    13 mr edmund gosse       xi    talk and talkers14    ii   in the last paper there was perhaps too much about mere debate and there was nothing said at all about that kind of talk which is merely luminous and restful a higher power of silence the quiet of the evening shared by ruminating friends there is something aside from personal preference to be alleged in support of this omission those who are no chimneycornerers who rejoice in the social thunderstorm have a ground in reason for their choice they get little rest indeed but restfulness is a quality for cattle the virtues are all active life is alert and it is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil on the other hand they are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others they have in a high degree the fencers pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved what they get they get upon lifes terms paying for it as they go and once the talk is launched they are assured of honest dealing from an adversary eager like themselves the aboriginal man within us the cavedweller still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and berries scents this kind of equal battle from afar it is like his old primeval days upon the crags a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fictions of the civilised and if it be delightful to the old man it is none the less profitable to his younger brother the conscientious gentleman i feel never quite sure of your urbane and smiling coteries i fear they indulge a mans vanities in silence suffer him to encroach encourage him on to be an ass and send him forth again not merely contemned for the moment but radically more contemptible than when he entered but if i have a flushed blustering fellow for my opposite bent on carrying a point my vanity is sure to have its ears rubbed once at least in the course of the debate he will not spare me when we differ he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face  for many natures there is not much charm in the still chambered society the circle of bland countenances the digestive silence the admired remark the flutter of affectionate approval they demand more atmosphere and exercise a gale upon their spirits as our pious ancestors would phrase it to have their wits well breathed in an uproarious valhalla and i suspect that the choice given their character and faults is one to be defended the purely wise are silenced by facts they talk in a clear atmosphere problems lying around them like a view in nature if they can be shown to be somewhat in the wrong they digest the reproof like a thrashing and make better intellectual blood they stand corrected by a whisper a word or a glance reminds them of the great eternal law but it is not so with all others in conversation seek rather contact with their fellowmen than increase of knowledge or clarity of thought the drama not the philosophy of life is the sphere of their intellectual activity even when they pursue truth they desire as much as possible of what we may call human scenery along the road they follow they dwell in the heart of life the blood sounding in their ears their eyes laying hold of what delights them with a brutal avidity that makes them blind to all besides their interest riveted on people living loving talking tangible people to a man of this description the sphere of argument seems very pale and ghostly by a strong expression a perturbed countenance floods of tears an insult which his conscience obliges him to swallow he is brought round to knowledge which no syllogism would have conveyed to him his own experience is so vivid he is so superlatively conscious of himself that if day after day he is allowed to hector and hear nothing but approving echoes he will lose his hold on the soberness of things and take himself in earnest for a god talk might be to such an one the very way of moral ruin the school where he might learn to be at once intolerable and ridiculous  this character is perhaps commoner than philosophers suppose and for persons of that stamp to learn much by conversation they must speak with their superiors not in intellect for that is a superiority that must be proved but in station if they cannot find a friend to bully them for their good they must find either an old man a woman or some one so far below them in the artificial order of society that courtesy may be particularly exercised  the best teachers are the aged to the old our mouths are always partly closed we must swallow our obvious retorts and listen they sit above our heads on lifes raised dais and appeal at once to our respect and pity a flavour of the old school a touch of something different in their mannerwhich is freer and rounder if they come of what is called a good family and often more timid and precise if they are of the middle classserves in these days to accentuate the difference of age and add a distinction to grey hairs but their superiority is founded more deeply than by outward marks or gestures they are before us in the march of man they have more or less solved the irking problem they have battled through the equinox of life in good and evil they have held their course and now without open shame they near the crown and harbour it may be we have been struck with one of fortunes darts we can scarce be civil so cruelly is our spirit tossed yet long before we were so much as thought upon the like calamity befell the old man or woman that now with pleasant humour rallies us upon our inattention sitting composed in the holy evening of mans life in the clear shining after rain we grow ashamed of our distresses new and hot and coarse like villainous roadside brandy we see life in aerial perspective under the heavens of faith and out of the worst in the mere presence of contented elders look forward and take patience fear shrinks before them like a thing reproved not the flitting and ineffectual fear of death but the instant dwelling terror of the responsibilities and revenges of life their speech indeed is timid they report lions in the path they counsel a meticulous footing but their serene marred faces are more eloquent and tell another story where they have gone we will go also not very greatly fearing what they have endured unbroken we also god helping us will make a shift to bear  not only is the presence of the aged in itself remedial but their minds are stored with antidotes wisdoms simples plain considerations overlooked by youth they have matter to communicate be they never so stupid their talk is not merely literature it is great literature classic in virtue of the speakers detachment studded like a book of travel with things we should not otherwise have learnt in virtue i have said of the speakers detachmentand this is why of two old men the one who is not your father speaks to you with the more sensible authority for in the paternal relation the oldest have lively interests and remain still young thus i have known two young men great friends each swore by the others father the father of each swore by the other lad and yet each pair of parent and child were perpetually by the ears this is typical it reads like the germ of some kindly comedy  the old appear in conversation in two characters the critically silent and the garrulous anecdotic the last is perhaps what we look for it is perhaps the more instructive an old gentleman well on in years sits handsomely and naturally in the bowwindow of his age scanning experience with reverted eye and chirping and smiling communicates the accidents and reads the lesson of his long career opinions are strengthened indeed but they are also weeded out in the course of years what remains steadily present to the eye of the retired veteran in his hermitage what still ministers to his content what still quickens his old honest heartthese are the real longlived things that whitman tells us to prefer where youth agrees with age not where they differ wisdom lies and it is when the young disciple finds his heart to beat in tune with his greybearded teachers that a lesson may be learned i have known one old gentleman whom i may name for he is now gathered to his stockrobert hunter sheriff of dumbarton and author of an excellent lawbook still reedited and republished whether he was originally big or little is more than i can guess when i knew him he was all fallen away and fallen in crooked and shrunken buckled into a stiff waistcoat for support troubled by ailments which kept him hobbling in and out of the room one foot gouty a wig for decency not for deception on his head close shaved except under his chinand for that he never failed to apologise for it went sore against the traditions of his life you can imagine how he would fare in a novel by miss mather yet this rag of a chelsea veteran lived to his last year in the plenitude of all that is best in man brimming with human kindness and staunch as a roman soldier under his manifold infirmities you could not say that he had lost his memory for he would repeat shakespeare and webster and jeremy taylor and burke by the page together but the parchment was filled up there was no room for fresh inscriptions and he was capable of repeating the same anecdote on many successive visits his voice survived in its full power and he took a pride in using it on his last voyage as commissioner of lighthouses he hailed a ship at sea and made himself clearly audible without a speakingtrumpet ruffling the while with a proper vanity in his achievement he had a habit of eking out his words with interrogative hems which was puzzling and a little wearisome suited ill with his appearance and seemed a survival from some former stage of bodily portliness of yore when he was a great pedestrian and no enemy to good claret he may have pointed with these minuteguns his allocutions to the bench his humour was perfectly equable set beyond the reach of fate gout rheumatism stone and gravel might have combined their forces against that frail tabernacle but when i came round on sunday evening he would lay aside jeremy taylors life of christ and greet me with the same open brow the same kind formality of manner his opinions and sympathies dated the man almost to a decade he had begun life under his mothers influence as an admirer of junius but on maturer knowledge had transferred his admiration to burke he cautioned me with entire gravity to be punctilious in writing english never to forget that i was a scotsman that english was a foreign tongue and that if i attempted the colloquial i should certainly be shamed the remark was apposite i suppose in the days of david hume scott was too new for him he had known the authorknown him too for a tory and to the genuine classic a contemporary is always something of a trouble he had the old serious love of the play had even as he was proud to tell played a certain part in the history of shakespearian revivals for he had successfully pressed on murray of the old edinburgh theatre the idea of producing shakespeares fairy pieces with great scenic display a moderate in religion he was much struck in the last years of his life by a conversation with two young lads revivalists hm he would saynew to me i have hadhmno such experience it struck him not with pain rather with a solemn philosophic interest that he a christian as he hoped and a christian of so old a standing should hear these young fellows talking of his own subject his own weapons that he had fought the battle of life withandhmnot understand in this wise and graceful attitude he did justice to himself and others reposed unshaken in his old beliefs and recognised their limits without anger or alarm his last recorded remark on the last night of his life was after he had been arguing against calvinism with his minister and was interrupted by an intolerable pang after all he said of all the isms i know none so bad as rheumatism my own last sight of him was some time before when we dined together at an inn he had been on circuit for he stuck to his duties like a chief part of his existence and i remember it as the only occasion on which he ever soiled his lips with slanga thing he loathed we were both roberts and as we took our places at table he addressed me with a twinkle we are just what you would call two bob he offered me port i remember as the proper milk of youth spoke of twentyshilling notes and throughout the meal was full of oldworld pleasantry and quaintness like an ancient boy on a holiday but what i recall chiefly was his confession that he had never read othello to an end shakespeare was his continual study he loved nothing better than to display his knowledge and memory by adducing parallel passages from shakespeare passages where the same word was employed or the same idea differently treated but othello had beaten him that noble gentleman and that noble ladyhmtoo painful for me the same night the hoardings were covered with posters burlesque of othello and the contrast blazed up in my mind like a bonfire an unforgettable look it gave me into that kind mans soul his acquaintance was indeed a liberal and pious education all the humanities were taught in that bare diningroom beside his gouty footstool he was a piece of good advice he was himself the instance that pointed and adorned his various talk nor could a young man have found elsewhere a place so set apart from envy fear discontent or any of the passions that debase a life so honest and composed a soul like an ancient violin so subdued to harmony responding to a touch in musicas in that diningroom with mr hunter chatting at the eleventh hour under the shadow of eternity fearless and gentle  the second class of old people are not anecdotic they are rather hearers than talkers listening to the young with an amused and critical attention to have this sort of intercourse to perfection i think we must go to old ladies women are better hearers than men to begin with they learn i fear in anguish to bear with the tedious and infantile vanity of the other sex and we will take more from a woman than even from the oldest man in the way of biting comment biting comment is the chief part whether for profit or amusement in this business the old lady that i have in my eye is a very caustic speaker her tongue after years of practice in absolute command whether for silence or attack if she chance to dislike you you will be tempted to curse the malignity of age but if you chance to please even slightly you will be listened to with a particular laughing grace of sympathy and from time to time chastised as if in play with a parasol as heavy as a poleaxe it requires a singular art as well as the vantageground of age to deal these stunning corrections among the coxcombs of the young the pill is disguised in sugar of wit it is administered as a complimentif you had not pleased you would not have been censured it is a personal affaira hyphen a trait dunion between you and your censor ages philandering for her pleasure and your good incontestably the young man feels very much of a fool but he must be a perfect malvolio sick with selflove if he cannot take an open buffet and still smile the correction of silence is what kills when you know you have transgressed and your friend says nothing and avoids your eye if a man were made of guttapercha his heart would quail at such a moment but when the word is out the worst is over and a fellow with any good humour at all may pass through a perfect hail of witty criticism every bare place on his soul hit to the quick with a shrewd missile and reappear as if after a dive tingling with a fine moral reaction and ready with a shrinking readiness onethird loath for a repetition of the discipline  there are few women not well sunned and ripened and perhaps toughened who can thus stand apart from a man and say the true thing with a kind of genial cruelty still there are someand i doubt if there be any man who can return the compliment the class of man represented by vernon whitford in the egoist says indeed the true thing but he says it stockishly vernon is a noble fellow and makes by the way a noble and instructive contrast to daniel deronda his conduct is the conduct of a man of honour but we agree with him against our consciences when he remorsefully considers its astonishing dryness he is the best of men but the best of women manage to combine all that and something more their very faults assist them they are helped even by the falseness of their position in life they can retire into the fortified camp of the proprieties they can touch a subject and suppress it the most adroit employ a somewhat elaborate reserve as a means to be frank much as they wear gloves when they shake hands but a man has the full responsibility of his freedom cannot evade a question can scarce be silent without rudeness must answer for his words upon the moment and is not seldom left face to face with a damning choice between the more or less dishonourable wriggling of deronda and the downright woodenness of vernon whitford  but the superiority of women is perpetually menaced they do not sit throned on infirmities like the old they are suitors as well as sovereigns their vanity is engaged their affections are too apt to follow and hence much of the talk between the sexes degenerates into something unworthy of the name the desire to please to shine with a certain softness of lustre and to draw a fascinating picture of oneself banishes from conversation all that is sterling and most of what is humorous as soon as a strong current of mutual admiration begins to flow the human interest triumphs entirely over the intellectual and the commerce of words consciously or not becomes secondary to the commercing of eyes but even where this ridiculous danger is avoided and a man and woman converse equally and honestly something in their nature or their education falsifies the strain an instinct prompts them to agree and where that is impossible to agree to differ should they neglect the warning at the first suspicion of an argument they find themselves in different hemispheres about any point of business or conduct any actual affair demanding settlement a woman will speak and listen hear and answer arguments not only with natural wisdom but with candour and logical honesty but if the subject of debate be something in the air an abstraction an excuse for talk a logical aunt sally then may the male debater instantly abandon hope he may employ reason adduce facts be supple be smiling be angry all shall avail him nothing what the woman said first that unless she has forgotten it she will repeat at the end hence at the very junctures when a talk between men grows brighter and quicker and begins to promise to bear fruit talk between the sexes is menaced with dissolution the point of difference the point of interest is evaded by the brilliant woman under a shower of irrelevant conversational rockets it is bridged by the discreet woman with a rustle of silk as she passes smoothly forward to the nearest point of safety and this sort of prestidigitation juggling the dangerous topic out of sight until it can be reintroduced with safety in an altered shape is a piece of tactics among the true drawingroom queens  the drawingroom is indeed an artificial place it is so by our choice and for our sins the subjection of women the ideal imposed upon them from the cradle and worn like a hairshirt with so much constancy their motherly superior tenderness to mans vanity and selfimportance their managing artsthe arts of a civilised slave among goodnatured barbariansare all painful ingredients and all help to falsify relations it is not till we get clear of that amusing artificial scene that genuine relations are founded or ideas honestly compared in the garden on the road or the hillside or têteàtête and apart from interruptions occasions arise when we may learn much from any single woman and nowhere more often than in married life marriage is one long conversation chequered by disputes the disputes are valueless they but ingrain the difference the heroic heart of woman prompting her at once to nail her colours to the mast but in the intervals almost unconsciously and with no desire to shine the whole material of life is turned over and over ideas are struck out and shared the two persons more and more adapt their notions one to suit the other and in process of time without sound of trumpet they conduct each other into new worlds of thought   footnote    14 this sequel was called forth by an excellent article in the     spectator

one corner of which a living spirit is confined an automaton like man instinct again he certainly possesses inherited aptitudes are his inherited frailties some things he at once views and understands as though he were awakened from a sleep as though he came trailing clouds of glory but with him as with man the field of instinct is limited its utterances are obscure and occasional and about the far larger part of life both the dog and his master must conduct their steps by deduction and observation  the leading distinction between dog and man after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives is that the one can speak and that the other cannot the absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect it hinders him from many speculations for words are the beginning of metaphysic at the same blow it saves him from many superstitions and his silence has won for him a higher name for virtue than his conduct justifies the faults of the dog are many he is vainer than man singularly greedy of notice singularly intolerant of ridicule suspicious like the deaf jealous to the degree of frenzy and radically devoid of truth the day of an intelligent small dog is passed in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood he lies with his tail he lies with his eye he lies with his protesting paw and when he rattles his dish or scratches at the door his purpose is other than appears but he has some apology to offer for the vice many of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning clearly understood both by his master and himself yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest an old one to a different purpose and this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols meanwhile the dog is clear in his own conscience and draws with a human nicety the distinction between formal and essential truth of his punning perversions his legitimate dexterity with symbols he is even vain but when he has told and been detected in a lie there is not a hair upon his body but confesses guilt to a dog of gentlemanly feeling theft and falsehood are disgraceful vices the canine like the human gentleman demands in his misdemeanours montaignes je ne sais quoi de généreux he is never more than half ashamed of having barked or bitten and for those faults into which he has been led by the desire to shine before a lady of his race he retains even under physical correction a share of pride but to be caught lying if he understands it instantly uncurls his fleece  just as among dull observers he preserves a name for truth the dog has been credited with modesty it is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of manthat because vainglory finds no vent in words creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious if a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech he would

this rage for consideration that has betrayed the dog into his satellite position as the friend of man the cat an animal of franker appetites preserves his independence but the dog with one eye ever on the audience has been wheedled into slavery and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature once he ceased hunting and became mans platelicker the rubicon was crossed thenceforth he was a gentleman of leisure and except the few whom we keep working the whole race grew more and more selfconscious mannered and affected the number of things that a small dog does naturally is strangely small enjoying better spirits and not crushed under material cares he is far more theatrical than average man his whole life if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry is spent in a vain show and in the hot pursuit of admiration take out your puppy for a walk and you will find the little ball of fur clumsy stupid bewildered but natural let but a few months pass and when you repeat the process you will find nature buried in convention he will do nothing plainly but the simplest processes of our material life will all be bent into the forms of an elaborate and mysterious etiquette instinct says the fool has awakened but it is not so some dogssome at the very leastif they be kept separate from others remain quite natural and these when at length they meet with a companion of experience and have the game explained to them distinguish themselves by the severity of their devotion to its rules i wish i were allowed to tell a story which would radiantly illuminate the point but men like dogs have an elaborate and mysterious etiquette it is their bond of sympathy that both are the children of convention  the person man or dog who has a conscience is eternally condemned to some degree of humbug the sense of the law in their members fatally precipitates either towards a frozen and affected bearing and the converse is true and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog moral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed to follow for ten minutes in the street some swaggering canine cavalier is to receive a lesson in dramatic art and the cultured conduct of the body in every act and gesture you see him true to a refined conception and the dullest cur beholding him pricks up his ear and proceeds to imitate and parody that charming ease for to be a highmannered and highminded gentleman careless affable and gay is the inborn pretension of the dog the large dog so much lazier so much more weighed upon with matter so majestic in repose so beautiful in effort is born with the dramatic means to wholly represent the part and it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo sir philip sidney for the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious the everpresent polytheism the whipbearing olympus of mankind rules them on the one hand on the other their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion or we might more exactly compare their society to the curious spectacle presented by a schoolushers monitors and big and little boysqualified by one circumstance the introduction of the other sex in each we should observe a somewhat similar tension of manner and somewhat similar points of honour in each the larger animal keeps a contemptuous good humour in each the smaller annoys him with wasplike impudence certain of practical immunity in each we shall find a double life producing double characters and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity i have known dogs and i have known school heroes that set aside the fur could hardly have been told apart and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping  woman with the dog has been long enfranchised incessant massacre of female innocents has changed the proportions of the sexes and perverted their relations thus when we regard the manners of the dog we see a romantic and monogamous animal once perhaps as delicate as the cat at war with impossible conditions man has much to answer for and the part he plays is yet more damnable and parlous than corins in the eyes of touchstone but his intervention has at least created an imperial situation for the rare surviving ladies in that society they reign without a rival conscious queens and in the only instance of a canine wifebeater that has ever fallen under my notice the criminal was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story he is a little very alert wellbred intelligent skye as black as a hat with a wet bramble for a nose and two cairngorms for eyes to the human observer he is decidedly welllooking but to the ladies of his race he seems abhorrent a thorough elaborate gentleman of the plume and swordknot order he was born with a nice sense of gallantry to women he took at their hands the most outrageous treatment i have heard him bleating like a sheep i have seen him streaming blood and his ear tattered like a regimental banner and yet he would scorn to make reprisals nay more when a human lady upraised the contumelious whip against the very dame who had been so cruelly misusing him my little greatheart gave but one hoarse cry and fell upon the tyrant tooth and nail this is the tale of a souls tragedy after three years of unavailing chivalry he suddenly in one hour threw off the yoke of obligation had he been shakespeare he would then have written troilus and cressida to brand the offending sex but being only a little dog he began to bite them the surprise of the ladies whom he attacked indicated the monstrosity of his offence but he had fairly beaten off his better angel fairly committed moral suicide for almost in the same hour throwing aside the last rags of decency he proceeded to attack the aged also the fact is worth remark showing as it does that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all but while the lamp holds on to burn says the paraphrase the greatest sinner may return i have been cheered to see symptoms of effectual penitence in my sweet ruffian and by the handling that he accepted uncomplainingly the other day from an indignant fair one i begin to hope the period of sturm und drang is closed  all these little gentlemen are subtle casuists the duty to the female dog is plain but where competing duties rise down they will sit and study them out like jesuit confessors i knew another little skye somewhat plain in manner and appearance but a creature compact of amiability and solid wisdom his family going abroad for a winter he was received for that period by an uncle in the same city the winter over his own family home again and his own house of which he was very proud reopened he found himself in a dilemma between two conflicting duties of loyalty and gratitude his old friends were not to be neglected but it seemed hardly decent to desert the new this was how he solved the problem every morning as soon as the door was opened off posted coolin to his uncles visited the children in the nursery saluted the whole family and was back at home in time for breakfast and his bit of fish nor was this done without a sacrifice on his part sharply felt for he had to forego the particular honour and jewel of his dayhis mornings walk with my father and perhaps from this cause he gradually wearied of and relaxed the practice and at length returned entirely to his ancient habits but the same decision served him in another and more distressing case of divided duty which happened not long after he was not at all a kitchen dog but the cook had nursed him with unusual kindness during the distemper and though he did not adore her as he adored my fatheralthough born snob he was critically conscious of her position as only a servanthe still cherished for her a special gratitude well the cook left and retired some streets away to lodgings of her own and there was coolin in precisely the same situation with any young gentleman who has had the inestimable benefit of a faithful nurse the canine conscience did not solve the problem with a pound of tea at christmas no longer content to pay a flying visit it was the whole forenoon that he dedicated to his solitary friend and so day by day he continued to comfort her solitude until for some reason which i could never understand and cannot approve he was kept locked up to break him of the graceful habit here it is not the similarity it is the difference that is worthy of remark the clearly marked degrees of gratitude and the proportional duration of his visits anything further removed from instinct it were hard to fancy and one is even stirred to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of spontaneity so passionless in justice and so priggishly obedient to the voice of reason  there are not many dogs like this good coolin and not many people but the type is one well marked both in the human and the canine family gallantry was not his aim but a solid and somewhat oppressive respectability he was a sworn foe to the unusual and the conspicuous a praiser of the golden mean a kind of city uncle modified by cheeryble and as he was precise and conscientious in all the steps of his own blameless course he looked for the same precision and an even greater gravity in the bearing of his deity my father it was no sinecure to be coolins idol he was exacting like a rigid parent and at every sign of levity in the man whom he respected he announced loudly the death of virtue and the proximate fall of the pillars of the earth  i have called him a snob but all dogs are so though in varying degrees it is hard to follow their snobbery among themselves for though i think we can perceive distinctions of rank we cannot grasp what is the criterion thus in edinburgh in a good part of the town there were several distinct societies or clubs that met in the morning tothe phrase is technicalto rake the backets in a troop a friend of mine the master of three dogs was one day surprised to observe that they had left one club and joined another but whether it was a rise or a fall and the result of an invitation or an expulsion was more than he could guess and this illustrates pointedly our ignorance of the real life of dogs their social ambitions and their social hierarchies at least in their dealings with men they are not only conscious of sex but of the difference of station and that in the most snobbish manner for the poor mans dog is not offended by the notice of the rich and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master and again for every station they have an ideal of behaviour to which the master under pain of derogation will do wisely to conform how often has not a cold glance of an eye informed me that my dog was disappointed and how much more gladly would he not have taken a beating than to be thus wounded in the seat of piety  i knew one disrespectable dog he was far liker a cat cared little or nothing for men with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle and was entirely devoted to the art of poaching a house would not hold him and to live in a town was what he refused he led i believe a life of troubled but genuine pleasure and perished beyond all question in a trap but this was an exception a marked reversion to the ancestral type like the hairy human infant the true dog of the nineteenth century to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance is in love with respectability a streetdog was once adopted by a lady while still an arab he had done as arabs do gambolling in the mud charging into butchers stalls a cathunter a sturdy beggar a common rogue and vagabond but with his rise into society he laid aside these inconsistent pleasures he stole no more he hunted no more cats and conscious of his collar he ignored his old companions yet the canine upper class was never brought to recognise the upstart and from that hour except for human countenance he was alone friendless shorn of his sports and the habits of a lifetime he still lived in a glory of happiness content with his acquired respectability and with no care but to support it solemnly are we to condemn or praise this selfmade dog we praise his human brother and thus to conquer vicious habits is as rare with dogs as with men with the more part for all their scruplemongering and moral thought the vices that are born with them remain invincible throughout and they live all their years glorying in their virtues but still the slaves of their defects thus the sage coolin was a thief to the last among a thousand peccadilloes a whole goose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon his conscience but woggs15 whose souls shipwreck in the matter of gallantry i have recounted above has only twice been known to steal and has often nobly conquered the temptation the eighth is his favourite commandment there is something painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties of the best still more painful is the bearing of those stammering professors in the house of sickness and under the terror of death it is beyond a doubt to me that somehow or other the dog connects together or confounds the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt to the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the conscience and at these times his haggard protestations form in regard to the human deathbed a dreadful parody or parallel  i once supposed that i had found an inverse relation between the double etiquette which dogs obey and that those who were most addicted to the showy street life among other dogs were less careful in the practice of home virtues for the tyrant man but the female dog that mass of carneying affectations shines equally in either sphere rules her rough posse of attendant swains with unwearying tact and gusto and with her master and mistress pushes the arts of insinuation to their crowning point the attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter it would thus appear the same sensibility but perhaps if we could read the canine heart they would be found to flatter it in very different degrees dogs live with man as courtiers round a monarch steeped in the flattery of his notice and enriched with sinecures to push their favour in this world of pickings and caresses is perhaps the business of their lives and their joys may lie outside i am in despair at our persistent ignorance i read in the lives of our companions the same processes of reason the same antique and fatal conflicts of the right against the wrong and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom i see them with our weaknesses vain false inconstant against appetite and with our one stalk of virtue devoted to the dream of an ideal and yet as they hurry by me on the street with tail in air or come singly to solicit my regard i must own the secret purport of their lives is still inscrutable to man is man the friend or is he the patron only have they indeed forgotten natures voice or are those moments snatched from courtiership when they touch noses with the tinkers mongrel the brief reward and pleasure of their artificial lives doubtless when man shares with his dog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art as with the shepherd or the poacher the affection warms and strengthens till it fills the soul but doubtless also the masters are in many cases the object of a merely interested cultus sitting aloft like louis quatorze giving and receiving flattery and favour and the dogs like the majority of men have but foregone their true existence and become the dupes of their ambition   footnote    15 walter watty woggy woggs wogg and lastly bogue under which     last

names you read the evidences of a happy childhood and though not half of them are still to be procured of any living stationer in the mind of their once happy owner all survive kaleidoscopes of changing pictures echoes of the past  there stands i fancy to this day but now how fallen a certain stationers shop at a corner of the wide thoroughfare that joins the city of my childhood with the sea when upon any saturday we made a party to behold the ships we passed that corner and since in those days i loved a ship as a man loves burgundy or daybreak this of itself had been enough to hallow it but there was more than that in the leith walk window all the year round there stood displayed a theatre in working order with a forest set a combat and a few robbers carousing in the slides and below and about dearer tenfold to me the plays themselves those budgets of romance lay tumbled one upon another long and often have i lingered there with empty pockets one figure we shall say was visible in the first plate of characters bearded pistol in hand or drawing to his ear the clothyard arrow i would spell the name was it macaire or long tom coffin or grindoff 2d dress o how i would long to see the rest howif the name by chance were hiddeni would wonder in what play he figured and what immortal legend justified his attitude and strange apparel and then to go within to announce yourself as an intending purchaser and closely watched be suffered to undo those bundles and breathlessly devour those pages of gesticulating villains epileptic combats bosky forests palaces and warships frowning fortresses and prison vaultsit was a giddy joy that shop which was dark and smelt of bibles was a loadstone rock for all that bore the name of boy they could not pass it by nor having entered leave it it was a place besieged the shopmen like the jews rebuilding salem had a double task they kept us at the sticks end frowned us down snatched each play out of our hand ere we were trusted with another and incredible as it may sound used to demand of us upon our entrance like banditti if we came with money or with empty hand old mr smith himself worn out with my eternal vacillation once swept the treasures from before me with the cry i do not believe child that you are an intending purchaser at all these were the dragons of the garden but for such joys of paradise we could have faced the terror of jamaica himself every sheet we fingered was another lightning glance into obscure delicious story it was like wallowing in the raw stuff of storybooks i know nothing to compare with it save now and then in dreams when i am privileged to read in certain unwrit stories of adventure from which i awake to find the world all vanity the crux of buridans donkey was as nothing to the uncertainty of the boy as he handled and lingered and doated on these bundles of delight there was a physical pleasure in the sight and touch of them which he would jealously prolong and when at length the deed was done the play selected and the impatient shopman had brushed the rest into the grey portfolio and the boy was forth again a little late for dinner the lamps springing into light in the blue winters even and the miller or the rover or some kindred drama clutched against his sideon what gay feet he ran and how he laughed aloud in exultation i can hear that laughter still out of all the years of my life i can recall but one homecoming to compare with these and that was on the night when i brought back with me the arabian entertainments in the fat old doublecolumned volume with the prints i was just well into the story of the hunchback i remember when my clergymangrandfather a man we counted pretty stiff came in behind me i grew blind with terror but instead of ordering the book away he said he envied me ah well he might  the purchase and the first halfhour at home that was the summit thenceforth the interest declined by little and little the fable as set forth in the playbook proved to be unworthy of the scenes and characters what fable would not such passages as scene 6 the hermitage night set scene place back of scene 1 no 2 at back of stage and hermitage fig 2 out of set piece r h in a slanting directionsuch passages i say though very practical are hardly to be called good reading indeed as literature these dramas did not much appeal to me i forget the very outline of the plots of the blind boy beyond the fact that he was a most injured prince and once i think abducted i know nothing and the old oak chest what was it all about that proscript 1st dress that prodigious number of banditti that old woman with the broom and the magnificent kitchen in the third act was it in the thirdthey are all fallen in a deliquium swim faintly in my brain and mix and vanish  i cannot deny that joy attended the illumination nor can i quite forgive that child who wilfully foregoing pleasure stoops to twopence coloured with crimson lake hark to the sound of itcrimson lakethe horns of elfland are not richer on the earwith crimson lake and prussian blue a certain purple is to be compounded which for cloaks especially titian could not equal the latter colour with gamboge a hated name although an exquisite pigment supplied a green of such a savoury greenness that today my heart regrets it nor can i recall without a tender weakness the very aspect of the water where i dipped my brush yes there was pleasure in the painting but when all was painted it is needless to deny it all was spoiled you might indeed set up a scene or two to look at but to cut the figures out was simply sacrilege nor could any child twice court the tedium the worry and the longdrawn disenchantment of an actual performance two days after the purchase the honey had been sucked parents used to complain they thought i wearied of my play it was not so no more than a person can be said to have wearied of his dinner when he leaves the bones and dishes i had got the marrow of it and said grace  then was the time to turn to the back of the playbook and to study that enticing double file of names where poetry for the true child of skelt reigned happy and glorious like her majesty the queen much as i have travelled in these realms of gold i have yet seen upon that map or abstract names of el dorados that still haunt the ear of memory and are still but names the floating beaconwhy was that denied me or the wreck ashore sixteenstring jack whom i did not even guess to be a highwayman troubled me awake and haunted my slumbers and there is one sequence of three from that enchanted calendar that i still at times recall liked a loved verse of poetry lodoiska silver palace echo of westminster bridge names bare names are surely more to children than we poor grownup obliterated fools remember  the name of skelt itself has always seemed a part and parcel of the charm of his productions it may be different with the rose but the attraction of this paper drama sensibly declined when webb had crept into the rubric a poor cuckoo flaunting in skelts nest and now we have reached pollock sounding deeper gulfs indeed this name of skelt appears so stagey and piratic that i will adopt it boldly to design these qualities skeltery then is a quality of much art it is even to be found with reverence be it said among the works of nature the stagey is its generic name but it is an old insular homebred staginess not french domestically british not of today but smacking of o smith fitzball and the great age of melodrama a peculiar fragrance haunting it uttering its unimportant message in a tone of voice that has the charm of fresh antiquity i will not insist upon the art of skelts purveyors these wonderful characters that once so thrilled our soul with their bold attitude array of deadly engines and incomparable costume today look somewhat pallidly the extreme hard favour of the heroine strikes me i had almost said with pain the villains scowl no longer thrills me like a trumpet and the scenes themselves those once unparalleled landscapes seem the efforts of a prentice hand so much of fault we find but on the other side the impartial critic rejoices to remark the presence of a great unity of gusto of those direct claptrap appeals which a man is dead and buriable when he fails to answer of the footlight glamour the readymade barefaced transpontine picturesque a thing not one with cold reality but how much dearer to the mind  the scenery of skeltdomor shall we say the kingdom of transpontushad a prevailing character whether it set forth poland as in the blind boy or bohemia with the miller and his men or italy with the old oak chest still it was transpontus a botanist could tell it by the plants the hollyhock was allpervasive running wild in deserts the dock was common and the bending reed and overshadowing these were poplar palm potato tree and quercus skelticabrave growths the graves were all embowelled in the surreyside formation the soil was all betrodden by the light pump of t p cooke skelt to be sure had yet another an oriental string he held the gorgeous east in fee and in the new quarter of hyères say in the garden of the hôtel des Îles dor you may behold these blessed visions realised but on these i will not dwell they were an outwork it was in the occidental scenery that skelt was all himself it had a strong flavour of england it was a sort of indigestion of england and dropscenes and i am bound to say was charming how the roads wander how the castle sits upon the hill how the sun eradiates from behind the cloud and how the congregated clouds themselves uproll as stiff as bolsters here is the cottage interior the usual first flat with the cloak upon the nail the rosaries of onions the gun and powderhorn and cornercupboard here is the inn this drama must be nautical i foresee captain luff and bold bob bowsprit with the red curtain pipes spittoons and eightday clock and there again is that impressive dungeon with the chains which was so dull to colour england the hedgerow elms the thin brick houses windmills glimpses of the navigable thamesengland when at last i came to visit it was only skelt made evident to cross the border was for the scotsman to come home to skelt there was the innsign and there the horsetrough all foreshadowed in the faithful skelt if at the ripe age of fourteen years i bought a certain cudgel got a friend to load it and thenceforward walked the tame ways of the earth my own ideal radiating pure romancestill i was but a puppet in the hand of skelt the original of that regretted bludgeon and surely the antitype of all the bludgeon kind greatly improved from cruikshank had adorned the hand of jonathan wild pl 1 this is mastering me as whitman cries upon some lesser provocation what am i what are life art letters the world but what my skelt has made them he stamped himself upon my immaturity the world was plain before i knew him a poor penny world but soon it was all coloured with romance if i go to the theatre to see a good old melodrama tis but skelt a little faded if i visit a bold scene in nature skelt would have been bolder there had been certainly a castle on that mountain and the hollow treethat setpiecei seem to miss it in the foreground indeed out of this cutanddry dull swaggering obtrusive and infantile art i

of dumass   the books that we reread the oftenest are not always those that we admire the most we choose and we revisit them for many and various reasons as we choose and revisit human friends one or two of scotts novels shakespeare molière montaigne the egoist and the vicomte de bragelonne form the inner circle of my intimates behind these comes a good troop of dear acquaintances the pilgrims progress in the front rank the bible in spain not far behind there are besides a certain number that look at me with reproach as i pass them by on my shelves books that i once thumbed and studied houses which were once like home to me but where i now rarely visit i am on these sad terms and blush to confess it with wordsworth horace burns and hazlitt last of all there is the class of book that has its hour of brilliancyglows sings charms and then fades again into insignificance until the fit return chief of those who thus smile and frown on me by turns i must name virgil and herrick who were they but    their sometime selves the same throughout the year  must have stood in the first company with the six names of my continual literary intimates to these six incongruous as they seem i have long been faithful and hope to be faithful to the day of death i have never read the whole of montaigne but i do not like to be long without reading some of him and my delight in what i do read never lessens of shakespeare i have read all but richard iii henry vi titus andronicus and alls well that ends well and these having already made all suitable endeavour i now know that i shall never readto make up for which unfaithfulness i could read much of the rest for ever of moliéresurely the next greatest name of christendomi could tell a very similar story but in a little corner of a little essay these princes are too much out of place and i prefer to pay my fealty and pass on how often i have read guy mannering rob roy or redgauntlet i have no means of guessing having begun young but it is either four or five times that i have read the egoist and either five or six that i have read the vicomte de bragelonne  some who would accept the others may wonder that i should have spent so much of this brief life of ours over a work so little famous as the last and indeed i am surprised myself not at my own devotion but the coldness of the world my acquaintance with the vicomte began somewhat indirectly in the year of grace 1863 when i had the advantage of studying certain illustrated dessert plates in a hotel at nice the name of dartagnan in the legends i already saluted like an old friend for i had met it the year before in a work of miss yonges my first perusal was in one of those pirated editions that swarmed at that time out of brussels and ran to such a troop of neat and dwarfish volumes i understood but little of the merits of the book my strongest memory is of the execution of deyméric and lyodota strange testimony to the dulness of a boy who could enjoy the roughandtumble in the place de grève and forget dartagnans visits to the two financiers my next reading was in wintertime when i lived alone upon the pentlands i would return in the early night from one of my patrols with the shepherd a friendly face would meet me in the door a friendly retriever scurry upstairs to fetch my slippers and i would sit down with the vicomte for a long silent solitary lamplit evening by the fire and yet i know not why i call it silent when it was enlivened with such a clatter of horseshoes and such a rattle of musketry and such a stir of talk or why i call those evenings solitary in which i gained so many friends i would rise from my book and pull the blind aside and see the snow and the glittering hollies chequer a scottish garden and the winter moonlight brighten the white hills thence i would turn again to that crowded and sunny field of life in which it was so easy to forget myself my cares and my surroundings a place busy as a city bright as a theatre thronged with memorable faces and sounding with delightful speech i carried the thread of that epic into my slumbers i woke with it unbroken i rejoiced to plunge into the book again at breakfast it was with a pang that i must lay it down and turn to my own labours for no part of the world has ever seemed to me so charming as these pages and not even my friends are quite so real perhaps quite so dear as dartagnan  since then i have been going to and fro at very brief intervals in my favourite book and i have now just risen from my last let me call it my fifth perusal having liked it better and admired it more seriously than ever perhaps i have a sense of ownership being so well known in these six volumes perhaps i think that dartagnan delights to have me read of him and louis quatorze is gratified and fouquet throws me a look and aramis although he knows i do not love him yet plays to me with his best graces as to an old patron of the show perhaps if i am not careful something may befall me like what befell george iv about the battle of waterloo and i may come to fancy the vicomte one of the first and heaven knows the best of my own works at least i avow myself a partisan and when i compare the popularity of the vicomte with that of monte cristo or its own elder brother the trois mousquetaires i confess i am both pained and puzzled  to those who have already made acquaintance with the titular hero in the pages of vingt ans après perhaps the name may act as a deterrent a man might well stand back if he supposed he were to follow for six volumes so wellconducted so finespoken and withal so dreary a cavalier as bragelonne but the fear is idle i may be said to have passed the best years of my life in these six volumes and my acquaintance with raoul has never gone beyond a bow and when he who has so long pretended to be alive is at last suffered to pretend to be dead i am sometimes reminded of a saying in an earlier volume enfin dit miss stewartand it was of bragelonne she spokeenfin il a fait quelquechose cest ma foi bien heureux i am reminded of it as i say and the next moment when athos dies of his death and my dear dartagnan bursts into his storm of sobbing i can but deplore my flippancy  or perhaps it is la vallière that the reader of vingt ans après is inclined to flee well he is right there too though not so right louise is no success her creator has spared no pains she is wellmeant not illdesigned sometimes has a word that rings out true sometimes if only for a breath she may even engage our sympathies but i have never envied the king his triumph and so far from pitying bragelonne for his defeat i could wish him no worse not for lack of malice but imagination than to be wedded to that lady madame enchants me i can forgive that royal minx her most serious offences i can thrill and soften with the king on that memorable occasion when he goes to upbraid and remains to flirt and when it comes to the allons aimezmoi donc it is my heart that melts in the bosom of de guiche not so with louise readers cannot fail to have remarked that what an author tells us of the beauty or the charm of his creatures goes for nought that we know instantly better that the heroine cannot open her mouth but what all in a moment the fine phrases of preparation fall from round her like the robes from cinderella and she stands before us selfbetrayed as a poor ugly sickly wench or perhaps a strapping marketwoman authors at least know it well a heroine will too often start the trick of getting ugly and no disease is more difficult to cure i said authors but indeed i had a side eye to one author in particular with whose works i am very well acquainted though i cannot read them and who has spent many vigils in this cause sitting beside his ailing puppets and like a magician wearying his art to restore them to youth and beauty there are others who ride too high for these misfortunes who doubts the loveliness of rosalind arden itself was not more lovely who ever questioned the perennial charm of rose jocelyn lucy desborough or clara middleton fair women with fair names the daughters of george meredith elizabeth bennet has but to speak and i am at her knees ah these are the creators of desirable women they would never have fallen in the mud with dumas and poor la vallière it is my only consolation that not one of all of them except the first could have plucked at the moustache of dartagnan  or perhaps again a portion of readers stumble at the threshold in so vast a mansion there were sure to be back stairs and kitchen offices where no one would delight to linger but it was at least unhappy that the vestibule should be so badly lighted and until in the seventeenth chapter dartagnan sets off to seek his friends i must confess the book goes heavily enough but from thenceforward what a feast is spread monk kidnapped dartagnan enriched mazarins death the ever delectable adventure of belle isle wherein aramis outwits dartagnan with its epilogue vol v chap xxviii where dartagnan regains the moral superiority the love adventures at fontainebleau with st aignans story of the dryad and the business of de guiche de wardes and manicamp aramis made general of the jesuits aramis at the bastille the night talk in the forest of sénart belle isle again with the death of porthos and last but not least the taming of dartagnan the untamable under the lash of the young king what other novel has such epic variety and nobility of incident often if you will impossible often of the order of an arabian story and yet all based in human nature for if you come to that what novel has more human nature not studied with the microscope but seen largely in plain daylight with the natural eye what novel has more good sense and gaiety and wit and unflagging admirable literary skill good souls i suppose must sometimes read it in the blackguard travesty of a translation but there is no style so untranslatable light as a whipped trifle strong as silk wordy like a village tale pat like a generals despatch with every fault yet never tedious with no merit yet inimitably right and once more to make an end of commendations what novel is inspired with a more unstrained or a more wholesome morality  yes in spite of miss yonge who introduced me to the name of dartagnan only to dissuade me from a nearer knowledge of the man i have to add morality there is no quite good book without a good morality but the world is wide and so are morals out of two people who have dipped into sir richard burtons thousand and one nights one shall have been offended by the animal details another to whom these were harmless perhaps even pleasing shall yet have been shocked in his turn by the rascality and cruelty of all the characters of two readers again one shall have been pained by the morality of a religious memoir one by that of the vicomte de bragelonne and the point is that neither need be wrong we shall always shock each other both in life and art we cannot get the sun into our pictures nor the abstract right if there be such a thing into our books enough if in the one there glimmer some hint of the great light that blinds us from heaven enough if in the other there shine even upon foul details a spirit of magnanimity i would scarce send to the vicomte a reader who was in quest of what we may call puritan morality the ventripotent mulatto the great eater worker earner and waster the man of much and witty laughter the man of the great heart and alas of the doubtful honesty is a figure not yet clearly set before the world he still awaits a sober and yet genial portrait but with whatever art that may be touched and whatever indulgence it will not be the portrait of a precisian dumas was certainly not thinking of himself but of planchet when he put into the mouth of dartagnans old servant this excellent profession monsieur jétais une de ces bonnes pâtes dhommes que dieu a faits pour sanimer pendant un certain temps et pour trouver bonnes toutes choses qui accompagnent leur séjour sur la terre he was thinking as i say of planchet to whom the words are aptly fitted but they were fitted also to planchets creator and perhaps this struck him as he wrote for observe what follows dartagnan sassit alors près de la fenêtre et cette philosophie de planchet lui ayant paru solide il y rêva in a man who finds all things good you will scarce expect much zeal for negative virtues the active alone will have a charm for him abstinence however wise however kind will always seem to such a judge entirely mean and partly impious so with dumas chastity is not near his heart nor yet to his own sore cost that virtue of frugality which is the armour of the artist now in the vicomte he had much to do with the contest of fouquet and colbert historic justice should be all upon the side of colbert of official honesty and fiscal competence and dumas knew it well three times at least he shows his knowledge once it is but flashed upon us and received with the laughter of fouquet himself in the jesting controversy in the gardens of saint mandé once it is touched on by aramis in the forest of sénart in the end it is set before us clearly in one dignified speech of the triumphant colbert but in fouquet the waster the lover of good cheer and wit and art the swift transactor of much business lhomme de bruit lhomme de plaisir lhomme qui nest que parceque les autres sont dumas saw something of himself and drew the figure the more tenderly it is to me even touching to see how he insists on fouquets honour not seeing you might think that unflawed honour is impossible to spendthrifts but rather perhaps in the light of his own life seeing it too well and clinging the more to what was left honour can survive a wound it can live and thrive without a member the man rebounds from his disgrace he begins fresh foundations on the ruins of the old and when his sword is broken he will do valiantly with his dagger so it is with fouquet in the book so it was with dumas on the battlefield of life  to cling to what is left of any damaged quality is virtue in the man but perhaps to sing its praises is scarcely to be called morality in the writer and it is elsewhere it is in the character of dartagnan that we must look for that spirit of morality which is one of the chief merits of the book makes one of the main joys of its perusal and sets it high above more popular rivals athos with the coming of years has declined too much into the preacher and the preacher of a sapless creed but dartagnan has mellowed into a man so witty rough kind and upright that he takes the heart by storm there is nothing of the copybook about his virtues nothing of the drawingroom in his fine natural civility he will sail near the wind he is no district visitorno wesley or robespierre his conscience is void of all refinement whether for good or evil but the whole man rings true like a good sovereign readers who have approached the vicomte not across country but by the legitimate fivevolumed avenue of the mousquetaires and vingt ans après will not have forgotten dartagnans ungentlemanly and perfectly improbable trick upon milady what a pleasure it is then what a reward and how agreeable a lesson to see the old captain humble himself to the son of the man whom he had personated here and throughout if i am to choose virtues for myself or my friends let me choose the virtues of dartagnan i do not say there is no character as well drawn in shakespeare i do say there is none that i love so wholly there are many spiritual eyes that seem to spy upon our actionseyes of the dead and the absent whom we imagine to behold us in our most private hours and whom we fear and scruple to offend our witnesses and judges and among these even if you should think me childish i must count my dartagnannot dartagnan of the memoirs whom thackeray pretended to prefera preference i take the freedom of saying in which he stands alone not the dartagnan of flesh and blood but him of the ink and paper not natures but dumass and this is the particular crown and triumph of the artistnot to be true merely but to be lovable not simply to convince but to enchant  there is yet another point in the vicomte which i find incomparable i can recall no other work of the imagination in which the end of life is represented with so nice a tact i was asked the other day if dumas ever made me either laugh or cry well in this my late fifth reading of the vicomte i did laugh once at the small coquelin de volière business and was perhaps a thought surprised at having done so to make up for it i smiled continually but for tears i do not know if you put a pistol to my throat i must own the tale trips upon a very airy footwithin a measurable distance of unreality and for those who like the big guns to be discharged and the great passions to appear authentically it may even seem inadequate from first to last not so to me i cannot count that a poor dinner or a poor book where i meet with those i love and above all in this last volume i find a singular charm of spirit it breathes a pleasant and a tonic sadness always brave never hysterical upon the crowded noisy life of this long tale evening gradually falls and the lights are extinguished and the heroes pass away one by one one by one they go and not a regret embitters their departure the young succeed them in their places louis quatorze is swelling larger and shining broader another generation and another france dawn on the horizon but for us and these old men whom we have loved so long the inevitable end draws near and is welcome to read this well is to anticipate experience ah if only when these hours of the long shadows fall for us in reality and not in figure we may hope to face them with a mind as quiet  but my paper is running out the siegeguns are firing on the dutch frontier and i must say adieu for the fifth time to my old comrade fallen on the field of glory adieurather au revoir yet a sixth time dearest dartagnan we shall kidnap monk and take horse together for belle isle       xv    a gossip on romance   in anything fit to be called by the name of reading the process itself should be absorbing and voluptuous we should gloat over a book be rapt clean out of ourselves and rise from the perusal our mind filled with the busiest kaleidoscopic dance of images incapable of sleep or of continuous thought the words if the book be eloquent should run thenceforward in our ears like the noise of breakers and the story if it be a story repeat itself in a thousand coloured pictures to the eye it was for this last pleasure that we read so closely and loved our books so dearly in the bright troubled period of boyhood eloquence and thought character and conversation were but obstacles to brush aside as we dug blithely after a certain sort of incident like a pig for truffles for my part i liked a story to begin with an old wayside inn where towards the close of the year 17 several gentlemen in threecocked hats were playing bowls a friend of mine preferred the malabar coast in a storm with a ship beating to windward and a scowling fellow of herculean proportions striding along the beach he to be sure was a pirate this was further afield than my homekeeping fancy loved to travel and designed altogether for a larger canvas than the tales that i affected give me a highwayman and i was full to the brim a jacobite would do but the highwayman was my favourite dish i can still hear that merry clatter of the hoofs along the moonlit lane night and the coming of day are still related in my mind with the doings of john rann or jerry abershaw and the words postchaise the great north road ostler and nag still sound in my ears like poetry one and all at least and each with his particular fancy we read storybooks in childhood not for eloquence or character or thought but for some quality of the brute incident that quality was not mere bloodshed or wonder although each of these was welcome in its place the charm for the sake of which we read depended on something different from either my elders used to read novels aloud and i can still remember four different passages which i heard before i was ten with the same keen and lasting pleasure one i discovered long afterwards to be the admirable opening of what will he do with it it was no wonder that i was pleased with that the other three still remain unidentified one is a little vague it was about a dark tall house at night and people groping on the stairs by the light that escaped from the open door of a sickroom in another a lover left a ball and went walking in a cool dewy park whence he could watch the lighted windows and the figures of the dancers as they moved this was the most sentimental impression i think i had yet received for a child is somewhat deaf to the sentimental in the last a poet who had been tragically wrangling with his wife walked forth on the seabeach on a tempestuous night and witnessed the horrors of a wreck16 different as they are all these early favourites have a common notethey have all a touch of the romantic  drama is the poetry of conduct romance the poetry of circumstance the pleasure that we take in life is of two sortsthe active and the passive now we are conscious of a great command over our destiny anon we are lifted up by circumstance as by a breaking wave and dashed we know not how into the future now we are pleased by our conduct anon merely pleased by our surroundings it would be hard to say which of these modes of satisfaction is the more effective but the latter is surely the more constant conduct is three parts of life they say but i think they put it high there is a vast deal in life and letters both which is not immoral but simply nonmoral which either does not regard the human will at all or deals with it in obvious and healthy relations where the interest turns not upon what a man shall choose to do but on how he manages to do it not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the conscience but on the problems of the body and of the practical intelligence in clean openair adventure the shock of arms or the diplomacy of life with such material as this it is impossible to build a play for the serious theatre exists solely on moral grounds and is a standing proof of the dissemination of the human conscience but it is possible to build upon this ground the most joyous of verses and the most lively beautiful and buoyant tales  one thing in life calls for another there is a fitness in events and places the sight of a pleasant arbour puts it in our mind to sit there one place suggests work another idleness a third early rising and long rambles in the dew the effect of night of any flowing water of lighted cities of the peep of day of ships of the open ocean calls up in the mind an army of anonymous desires and pleasures something we feel should happen we know not what yet we proceed in quest of it and many of the happiest hours of life fleet by us in this vain attendance on the genius of the place and moment it is thus that tracts of young fir and low rocks that reach into deep surroundings particularly torture and delight me something must have happened in such places and perhaps ages back to members of my race and when i was a child i tried in vain to invent appropriate games for them as i still try just as vainly to fit them with the proper story some places speak distinctly certain dank gardens cry aloud for a murder certain old houses demand to be haunted certain coasts are set apart for shipwreck other spots again seem to abide their destiny suggestive and impenetrable miching mallecho the inn at burford bridge with its arbours and green garden and silent eddying riverthough it is known already as the place where keats wrote some of his endymion and nelson parted from his emmastill seems to wait the coming of the appropriate legend within these ivied walls behind these old green shutters some further business smoulders waiting for its hour the old hawes inn at the queens ferry makes a similar call upon my fancy there it stands apart from the town beside the pier in a climate of its own half inland half marinein front the ferry bubbling with the tide and the guardship swinging to her anchor behind the old garden with the trees americans seek it already for the sake of lovel and oldbuck who dined there at the beginning of the antiquary but you need not tell methat is not all there is some story unrecorded or not yet complete which must express the meaning of that inn more fully so it is with names and faces so it is with incidents that are idle and inconclusive in themselves and yet seem like the beginning of some quaint romance which the allcareless author leaves untold how many of these romances have we not seen determined at their birth how many people have met us with a look of meaning in their eye and sunk at once into trivial acquaintances to how many places have we not drawn near with express intimationshere my destiny awaits meand we have but dined there and passed on i have lived both at the hawes and burford in a perpetual flutter on the heels as it seemed of some adventure that should justify the place but though the feeling had me to bed at night and called me again at morning in one unbroken round of pleasure and suspense nothing befell me in either worth remark the man or the hour had not yet come but some day i think a boat shall put off from the queens ferry fraught with a dear cargo and some frosty night a horseman on a tragic errand rattle with his whip upon the green shutters of the inn at burford17  now this is one of the natural appetites with which any lively literature has to count the desire for knowledge i had almost added the desire for meat is not more deeply seated than this demand for fit and striking incident the dullest of clowns tells or tries to tell himself a story as the feeblest of children uses invention in his play and even as the imaginative grown person joining in the game at once enriches it with many delightful circumstances the great creative writer shows us the realisation and the apotheosis of the daydreams of common men his stories may be nourished with the realities of life but their true mark is to satisfy the nameless longings of the reader and to obey the ideal laws of the daydream the right kind of thing should fall out in the right kind of place the right kind of thing should follow and not only the characters talk aptly and think naturally but all the circumstances in a tale answer one to another like notes in music the threads of a story come from time to time together and make a picture in the web the characters fall from time to time into some attitude to each other or to nature which stamps the story home like an illustration crusoe recoiling from the footprint achilles shouting over against the trojans ulysses bending the great bow christian running with his fingers in his earsthese are each culminating moments in the legend and each has been printed on the minds eye for ever other things we may forget we may forget the words although they are beautiful we may forget the authors comment although perhaps it was ingenious and true but these epochmaking scenes which put the last mark of truth upon a story and fill up at one blow our capacity for sympathetic pleasure we so adopt into the very bosom of our mind that neither time nor tide can efface or weaken the impression this then is the plastic part of literature to embody character thought or emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the minds eye this is the highest and hardest thing to do in words the thing which once accomplished equally delights the schoolboy and the sage and makes in its own right the quality of epics compared with this all other purposes in literature except the purely lyrical or the purely philosophic are bastard in nature facile of execution and feeble in result it is one thing to write about the inn at burford or to describe scenery with the wordpainters it is quite another to seize on the heart of the suggestion and make a country famous with a legend it is one thing to remark and to dissect with the most cutting logic the complications of life and of the human spirit it is quite another to give them body and blood in the story of ajax or of hamlet the first is literature but the second is something besides for it is likewise art  english people of the present day18 are apt i know not why to look somewhat down on incident and reserve their admiration for the clink of teaspoons and the accents of the curate it is thought clever to write a novel with no story at all or at least with a very dull one reduced even to the lowest terms a certain interest can be communicated by the art of narrative a sense of human kinship stirred and a kind of monotonous fitness comparable to the words and air of sandys mull preserved among the infinitesimal occurrences recorded some people work in this manner with even a strong touch mr trollopes inimitable clergymen naturally arise to the mind in this connection but even mr trollope does not confine himself to chronicling small beer mr crawleys collision with the bishops wife mr melnotte dallying in the deserted banquetroom are typical incidents epically conceived fitly embodying a crisis or again look at thackeray if rawdon crawleys blow were not delivered vanity fair would cease to be a work of art that scene is the chief ganglion of the tale and the discharge of energy from rawdons fist is the reward and consolation of the reader the end of esmond is a yet wider excursion from the authors customary fields the scene at castlewood is pure dumas the great and wily english borrower has here borrowed from the great unblushing french thief as usual he has borrowed admirably well and the breaking of the sword rounds off the best of all his books with a manly martial note but perhaps nothing can more strongly illustrate the necessity for marking incident than to compare the living fame of robinson crusoe with the discredit of clarissa harlowe clarissa is a book of a far more startling import worked out on a great canvas with inimitable courage and unflagging art it contains wit character passion plot conversations full of spirit and insight letters sparkling with unstrained humanity and if the death of the heroine be somewhat frigid and artificial the last days of the hero strike the only note of what we now call byronism between the elizabethans and byron himself and yet a little story of a shipwrecked sailor with not a tenth part of the style nor a thousandth part of the wisdom exploring none of the arcana of humanity and deprived of the perennial interest of love goes on from edition to edition ever young while clarissa lies upon the shelves unread a friend of mine a welsh blacksmith was twentyfive years old and could neither read nor write when he heard a chapter of robinson read aloud in a farm kitchen up to that moment he had sat content huddled in his ignorance but he left that farm another man there were daydreams it appeared divine daydreams written and printed and bound and to be bought for money and enjoyed at pleasure down he sat that day painfully learned to read welsh and returned to borrow the book it had been lost nor could he find another copy but one that was in english down he sat once more learned english and at length and with entire delight read robinson it is like the story of a lovechase if he had heard a letter from clarissa would he have been fired with the same chivalrous ardour i wonder yet clarissa has every quality that can be shown in prose one alone exceptedpictorial or picturemaking romance while robinson depends for the most part and with the overwhelming majority of its readers on the charm of circumstance  in the highest achievements of the art of words the dramatic and the pictorial the moral and romantic interest rise and fall together by a common and organic law situation is animated with passion passion clothed upon with situation neither exists for itself but each inheres indissolubly with the other this is high art and not only the highest art possible in words but the highest art of all since it combines the greatest mass and diversity of the elements of truth and pleasure such are epics and the few prose tales that have the epic weight but as from a school of works aping the creative incident and romance are ruthlessly discarded so may character and drama be omitted or subordinated to romance there is one book for example more generally loved than shakespeare that captivates in childhood and still delights in agei mean the arabian nightswhere you shall look in vain for moral or for intellectual interest no human face or voice greets us among that wooden crowd of kings and genies sorcerers and beggarmen adventure on the most naked terms furnishes forth the entertainment and is found enough dumas approaches perhaps nearest of any modern to these arabian authors in the purely material charm of some of his romances the early part of monte cristo down to the finding of the treasure is a piece of perfect storytelling the man never breathed who shared these moving incidents without a tremor and yet faria is a thing of packthread and dantès little more than a name the sequel is one longdrawn error gloomy bloody unnatural and dull but as for these early chapters i do not believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance it is very thin and light to be sure as on a high mountain but it is brisk and clear and sunny in proportion i saw the other day with envy an old and very clever lady setting forth on a second or third voyage into monte cristo here are stories which powerfully affect the reader which can be reperused at any age and where the characters are no more than puppets the bony fist of the showman visibly propels them their springs are an open secret their faces are of wood their bellies filled with bran and yet we thrillingly partake of their adventures and the point may be illustrated still further the last interview between lucy and richard feverel is pure drama more than that it is the strongest scene since shakespeare in the english tongue their first meeting by the river on the other hand is pure romance it has nothing to do with character it might happen to any other boy and maiden and be none the less delightful for the change and yet i think he would be a bold man who should choose between these passages thus in the same book we may have two scenes each capital in its order in the one human passion deep calling unto deep shall utter its genuine voice in the second according circumstances like instruments in tune shall build up a trivial but desirable incident such as we love to prefigure for ourselves and in the end in spite of the critics we may hesitate to give the preference to either the one may ask more geniusi do not say it does but at least the other dwells as clearly in the memory  true romantic art again makes a romance of all things it reaches into the highest abstraction of the ideal it does not refuse the most pedestrian realism robinson crusoe is as realistic as it is romantic both qualities are pushed to an extreme and neither suffers nor does romance depend upon the material importance of the incidents to deal with strong and deadly elements banditti pirates war and murder is to conjure with great names and in the event of failure to double the disgrace the arrival of haydn and consuelo at the canons villa is a very trifling incident yet we may read a dozen boisterous stories from beginning to end and not receive so fresh and stirring an impression of adventure it was the scene of crusoe at the wreck if i remember rightly that so bewitched my blacksmith nor is the fact surprising every single article the castaway recovers from the hulk is a joy for ever to the man who reads of them they are the things that should be found and the bare enumeration stirs the blood i found a glimmer of the same interest the other day in a new book the sailors sweetheart by mr clark russell the whole business of the brig morning star is very rightly felt and spiritedly written but the clothes the books and the money satisfy the readers mind like things to eat we are dealing here with the old cutanddry legitimate interest of treasuretrove but even treasuretrove can be made dull there are few people who have not groaned under the plethora of goods that fell to the lot of the swiss family robinson that dreary family they found article after article creature after creature from milkkine to pieces of ordnance a whole consignment but no informing taste had presided over the selection there was no smack or relish in the invoice and these riches left the fancy cold the box of goods in vernes mysterious island is another case in point there was no gusto and no glamour about that it might have come from a shop but the two hundred and seventyeight australian sovereigns on board the morning star fell upon me like a surprise that i had expected whole vistas of secondary stories besides the one in hand radiated forth from that discovery as they radiate from a striking particular in life and i was made for the moment as happy as a reader has the right to be  to come at all at the nature of this quality of romance we must bear in mind the peculiarity of our attitude to any art no art produces illusion in the theatre we never forget that we are in the theatre and while we read a story we sit wavering between two minds now merely clapping our hands at the merit of the performance now condescending to take an active part in fancy with the characters this last is the triumph of romantic storytelling when the reader consciously plays at being the hero the scene is a good scene now in characterstudies the pleasure that we take is critical we watch we approve we smile at incongruities we are moved to sudden heats of sympathy with courage suffering or virtue but the characters are still themselves they are not us the more clearly they are depicted the more widely do they stand away from us the more imperiously do they thrust us back into our place as a spectator i cannot identify myself with rawdon crawley or with eugène de rastignac for i have scarce a hope or fear in common with them it is not character but incident that wooes us out of our reserve something happens as we desire to have it happen to ourselves some situation that we have long dallied with in fancy is realised in the story with enticing and appropriate details then we forget the characters then we push the hero aside then we plunge into the tale in our own person and bathe in fresh experience and then and then only do we say we have been reading a romance it is not only pleasurable things that we imagine in our daydreams there are lights in which we are willing to contemplate even the idea of our own death ways in which it seems as if it would amuse us to be cheated wounded or calumniated it is thus possible to construct a story even of tragic import in which every incident detail and trick of circumstance shall be welcome to the readers thoughts fiction is to the grown man what play is to the child it is there that he changes the atmosphere and tenor of his life and when the game so chimes with his fancy that he can join in it with all his heart when it pleases him with every turn when he loves to recall it and dwells upon its recollection with entire delight fiction is called romance  walter scott is out and away the king of the romantics the lady of the lake has no indisputable claim to be a poem beyond the inherent fitness and desirability of the tale it is just such a story as a man would make up for himself walking in the best health and temper through just such scenes as it is laid in hence it is that a charm dwells undefinable among these slovenly verses as the unseen cuckoo fills the mountains with his note hence even after we have flung the book aside the scenery and adventures remain present to the mind a new and green possession not unworthy of that beautiful name the lady of the lake or that direct romantic openingone of the most spirited and poetical in literaturethe stag at eve had drunk his fill the same strength and the same weaknesses adorn and disfigure the novels in that illwritten ragged book the pirate the figure of clevelandcast up by the sea on the resounding foreland of dunrossnessmoving with the blood on his hands and the spanish words on his tongue among the simple islanderssinging a serenade under the window of his shetland mistressis conceived in the very highest manner of romantic invention the words of his song through groves of palm sung in such a scene and by such a lover clinch as in a nutshell the emphatic contrast upon which the tale is built in guy mannering again every incident is delightful to the imagination and the scene when harry bertram lands at ellangowan is a model instance of romantic method  i remember the tune well he saysthough i cannot guess what should at present so strongly recall it to my memory he took his flageolet from his pocket and played a simple melody apparently the tune awoke the corresponding associations of a damsel she immediately took up the song    are these the links of forth she said       or are they the crooks of dee     or the bonny woods of warroch head       that i so fain would see  by heaven said bertram it is the very ballad  on this quotation two remarks fall to be made first as an instance of modern feeling for romance this famous touch of the flageolet and the old song is selected by miss braddon for omission miss braddons idea of a story like mrs todgerss idea of a wooden leg were something strange to have expounded as a matter of personal experience megs appearance to old mr bertram on the road the ruins of derncleugh the scene of the flageolet and the dominies recognition of harry are the four strong notes that continue to ring in the mind after the book is laid aside the second point is still more curious the reader will observe a mark of excision in the passage as quoted by me well here is how it runs in the original a damsel who close behind a fine spring about halfway down the descent and which had once supplied the castle with water was engaged in bleaching linen a man who gave in such copy would be discharged from the staff of a daily paper scott has forgotten to prepare the reader for the presence of the damsel he has forgotten to mention the spring and its relation to the ruin and now face to face with his omission instead of trying back and starting fair crams all this matter tail foremost into a single shambling sentence it is not merely bad english or bad style it is abominably bad narrative besides  certainly the contrast is remarkable and it is one that throws a strong light upon the subject of this paper for here we have a man of the finest creative instinct touching with perfect certainty and charm the romantic junctures of his story and we find him utterly careless almost it would seem incapable in the technical matter of style and not only frequently weak but frequently wrong in points of drama in character parts indeed and particularly in the scots he was delicate strong and truthful but the trite obliterated features of too many of his heroes have already wearied three generations of readers at times his characters will speak with something far beyond proprietywith a true heroic note but on the next page they will be wading wearily forward with an ungrammatical and undramatic rigmarole of words the man who could conceive and write the character of elspeth of the craigburnfoot as scott has conceived and written it had not only splendid romantic but splendid tragic gifts how comes it then that he could so often fob us off with languid inarticulate twaddle it seems to me that the explanation is to be found in the very quality of his surprising merits as his books are play to the reader so were they play to him he was a great daydreamer a seer of fit and beautiful and humorous visions but hardly a great artist he conjured up the romantic with delight but had hardly patience to describe it of the pleasures of his art he tasted fully but of its cares and scruples and distresses never man knew less   footnotes    16 since traced

of mr walter besant and mr henry james two men certainly of very different calibre mr james so precise of outline so cunning of fence so scrupulous of finish and mr besant so genial so friendly with so persuasive and humorous a vein of whim mr james the very type of the deliberate artist mr besant the impersonation of goodnature that such doctors should differ will excite no great surprise but one point in which they seem to agree fills me i confess with wonder for they are both content to talk about the art of fiction and mr besant waxing exceedingly bold goes on to oppose this socalled art of fiction to the art of poetry by the art of poetry he can mean nothing but the art of verse an art of handicraft and only comparable with the art of prose for that heat and height of sane emotion which we agree to call by the name of poetry is but a libertine and vagrant quality present at times in any art more often absent from them all too seldom present in the prose novel too frequently absent from the ode and epic fiction is in the same case it is no substantive art but an element which enters largely into all the arts but architecture homer wordsworth phidias hogarth and salvini all deal in fiction and yet i do not suppose that either hogarth or salvini to mention but these two entered in any degree into the scope of mr besants interesting lecture or mr jamess charming essay the art of fiction then regarded as a definition is both too ample and too scanty let me suggest another let me suggest that what both mr james and mr besant had in view was neither more nor less than the art of narrative  but mr besant is anxious to speak solely of the modern english novel the stay and breadwinner of mr mudie and in the author of the most pleasing novel on that roll all sorts and conditions of men the desire is natural enough i can conceive then that he would hasten to propose two additions and read thus the art of fictitious narrative in prose  now the fact of the existence of the modern english novel is not to be denied materially with its three volumes leaded type and gilded lettering it is easily distinguishable from other forms of literature but to talk at all fruitfully of any branch of art it is needful to build our definitions on some more fundamental ground than binding why then are we to add in prose the odyssey appears to me the best of romances the lady of the lake to stand high in the second order and chaucers tales and prologues to contain more of the matter and art of the modern english novel than the whole treasury of mr mudie whether a narrative be written in blank verse or the spenserian stanza in the long period of gibbon or the chipped phrase of charles reade the principles of the art of narrative must be equally observed the choice of a noble and swelling style in prose affects the problem of narration in the same way if not to the same degree as the choice of measured verse for both imply a closer synthesis of events a higher key of dialogue and a more picked and stately strain of words if you are to refuse don juan it is hard to see why you should include zanoni or to bracket works of very different value the scarlet letter and by what discrimination are you to open your doors to the pilgrims progress and close them on the faery queen to bring things closer home i will here propound to mr besant a conundrum a narrative called paradise lost was written in english verse by one john milton what was it then it was next translated by chateaubriand into french prose and what was it then lastly the french translation was by some inspired compatriot of george gilfillan and of mine turned bodily into an english novel and in the name of clearness what was it then  but once more why should we add fictitious the reason why is obvious the reason why not if something more recondite does not want for weight the art of narrative in fact is the same whether it is applied to the selection and illustration of a real series of events or of an imaginary series boswells life of johnson a work of cunning and inimitable art owes its success to the same technical manoeuvres as let us say tom jones the clear conception of certain characters of man the choice and presentation of certain incidents out of a great number that offered and the invention yes invention and preservation of a certain key in dialogue in which these things are done with the more artin which the greater air of naturereaders will differently judge boswells is indeed a very special case and almost a generic but it is not only in boswell it is in every biography with any salt of life it is in every history where events and men rather than ideas are presentedin tacitus in carlyle in michelet in macaulaythat the novelist will find many of his own methods most conspicuously and adroitly handled he will find besides that he who is freewho has the right to invent or steal a missing incident who has the right more precious still of wholesale omissionis frequently defeated and with all his advantages leaves a less strong impression of reality and passion mr james utters his mind with a becoming fervour on the sanctity of truth to the novelist on a more careful examination truth will seem a word of very debateable propriety not only for the labours of the novelist but for those of the historian no artto use the daring phrase of mr jamescan successfully compete with life and the art that seeks to do so is condemned to perish montibus aviis life goes before us infinite in complication attended by the most various and surprising meteors appealing at once to the eye to the ear to the mindthe seat of wonder to the touchso thrillingly delicate and to the bellyso imperious when starved it combines and employs in its manifestation the method and material not of one art only but of all the arts music is but an arbitrary trifling with a few of lifes majestic chords painting is but a shadow of its pageantry of light and colour literature does but drily indicate that wealth of incident of moral obligation of virtue vice action rapture and agony with which it teems to compete with life whose sun we cannot look upon whose passions and diseases waste and slay usto compete with the flavour of wine the beauty of the dawn the scorching of fire the bitterness of death and separationhere is indeed a projected escalade of heaven here are indeed labours for a hercules in a dress coat armed with a pen and a dictionary to depict the passions armed with a tube of superior flakewhite to paint the portrait of the insufferable sun no art is true in this sense none can compete with life not even history built indeed of indisputable facts but these facts robbed of their vivacity and sting so that even when we read of the sack of a city or the fall of an empire we are surprised and justly commend the authors talent if our pulse be quickened and mark for a last differentia that this quickening of the pulse is in almost every case purely agreeable that these phantom reproductions of experience even at their most acute convey decided pleasure while experience itself in the cockpit of life can torture and slay  what then is the object what the method of an art and what the source of its power the whole secret is that no art does compete with life mans one method whether he reasons or creates is to halfshut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality the arts like arithmetic and geometry turn away their eyes from the gross coloured and mobile nature at our feet and regard instead a certain figmentary abstraction geometry will tell us of a circle a thing never seen in nature asked about a green circle or an iron circle it lays its hand upon its mouth so with the arts painting ruefully comparing sunshine and flakewhite gives up truth of colour as it had already given up relief and movement and instead of vying with nature arranges a scheme of harmonious tints literature above all in its most typical mood the mood of narrative similarly flees the direct challenge and pursues instead an independent and creative aim so far as it imitates at all it imitates not life but speech not the facts of human destiny but the emphasis and the suppressions with which the human actor tells of them the real art that dealt with life directly was that of the first men who told their stories round the savage campfire our art is occupied and bound to be occupied not so much in making stories true as in making them typical not so much in capturing the lineaments of each fact as in marshalling all of them towards a common end for the welter of impressions all forcible but all discrete which life presents it substitutes a certain artificial series of impressions all indeed most feebly represented but all aiming at the same effect all eloquent of the same idea all chiming together like consonant notes in music or like the graduated tints in a good picture from all its chapters from all its pages from all its sentences the wellwritten novel echoes and reechoes its one creative and controlling thought to this must every incident and character contribute the style must have been pitched in unison with this and if there is anywhere a word that looks another way the book would be stronger clearer and i had almost said fuller without it life is monstrous infinite illogical abrupt and poignant a work of art in comparison is neat finite selfcontained rational flowing and emasculate life imposes by brute energy like inarticulate thunder art catches the ear among the far louder noises of experience like an air artificially made by a discreet musician a proposition of geometry does not compete with life and a proposition of geometry is a fair and luminous parallel for a work of art both are reasonable both untrue to the crude fact both inhere in nature neither represents it the novel which is a work of art exists not by its resemblances to life which are forced and material as a shoe must still consist of leather but by its immeasurable difference from life a difference which is designed and significant and is both the method and the meaning of the work  the life of man is not the subject of novels but the inexhaustible magazine from which subjects are to be selected the name of these is legion and with each new subjectfor here again i must differ by the whole width of heaven from mr jamesthe true artist will vary his method and change the point of attack that which was in one case an excellence will become a defect in another what was the making of one book will in the next be impertinent or dull first each novel and then each class of novels exists by and for itself i will take for instance three main classes which are fairly distinct first the novel of adventure which appeals to certain almost sensual and quite illogical tendencies in man second the novel of character which appeals to our intellectual appreciation of mans foibles and mingled and inconstant motives and third the dramatic novel which deals with the same stuff as the serious theatre and appeals to our emotional nature and moral judgment  and first for the novel of adventure mr james refers with singular generosity of praise to a little book about a quest for hidden treasure but he lets fall by the way some rather startling words in this book he misses what he calls the immense luxury of being able to quarrel with his author the luxury to most of us is to lay by our judgment to be submerged by the tale as by a billow and only to awake and begin to distinguish and find fault when the piece is over and the volume laid aside still more remarkable is mr jamess reason he cannot criticise the author as he goes because says he comparing it with another work i have been a child but i have never been on a quest for buried treasure here is indeed a wilful paradox for if he has never been on a quest for buried treasure it can be demonstrated that he has never been a child there never was a child unless master james but has hunted gold and been a pirate and a military commander and a bandit of the mountains but has fought and suffered shipwreck and prison and imbrued its little hands in gore and gallantly retrieved the lost battle and triumphantly protected innocence and beauty elsewhere in his essay mr james has protested with excellent reason against too narrow a conception of experience for the born artist he contends the faintest hints of life are converted into revelations and it will be found true i believe in a majority of cases that the artist writes with more gusto and effect of those things which he has only wished to do than of those which he has done desire is a wonderful telescope and pisgah the best observatory now while it is true that neither mr james nor the author of the work in question has ever in the fleshly sense gone questing after gold it is probable that both have ardently desired and fondly imagined the details of such a life in youthful daydreams and the author counting upon that and well aware cunning and lowminded man that this class of interest having been frequently treated finds a readily accessible and beaten road to the sympathies of the reader addressed himself throughout to the building up and circumstantiation of this boyish dream character to the boy is a sealed book for him a pirate is a beard a pair of wide trousers and a liberal complement of pistols the author for the sake of circumstantiation and because he was himself more or less grown up admitted character within certain limits into his design but only within certain limits had the same puppets figured in a scheme of another sort they had been drawn to very different purpose for in this elementary novel of adventure the characters need to be presented with but one class of qualitiesthe warlike and formidable so as they appear insidious in deceit and fatal in the combat they have served their end danger is the matter with which this class of novel deals fear the passion with which it idly trifles and the characters are portrayed only so far as they realise the sense of danger and provoke the sympathy of fear to add more traits to be too clever to start the hare of moral or intellectual interest while we are running the fox of material interest is not to enrich but to stultify your tale the stupid reader will only be offended and the clever reader lose the scent  the novel of character has this difference from all others that it requires no coherency of plot and for this reason as in the case of gil blas it is sometimes called the novel of adventure it turns on the humours of the persons represented these are to be sure embodied in incidents but the incidents themselves being tributary need not march in a progression and the characters may be statically shown as they enter so they may go out they must be consistent but they need not grow here mr james will recognise the note of much of his own work he treats for the most part the statics of character studying it at rest or only gently moved and with his usual delicate and just artistic instinct he avoids those stronger passions which would deform the attitudes he loves to study and change his sitters from the humorists of ordinary life to the brute forces and bare types of more emotional moments in his recent author of beltraffio so just in conception so nimble and neat in workmanship strong passion is indeed employed but observe that it is not displayed even in the heroine the working of the passion is suppressed and the great struggle the true tragedy the scène à faire passes unseen behind the panels of a locked door the delectable invention of the young visitor is introduced consciously or not to this end that mr james true to his method might avoid the scene of passion i trust no reader will suppose me guilty of undervaluing this little masterpiece i mean merely that it belongs to one marked class of novel and that it would have been very differently conceived and treated had it belonged to that other marked class of which i now proceed to speak  i take pleasure in calling the dramatic novel by that name because it enables me to point out by the way a strange and peculiarly english misconception it is sometimes supposed that the drama consists of incident it consists of passion which gives the actor his opportunity and that passion must progressively increase or the actor as the piece proceeded would be unable to carry the audience from a lower to a higher pitch of interest and emotion a good serious play must therefore be founded on one of the passionate cruces of life where duty and inclination come nobly to the grapple and the same is true of what i call for that reason the dramatic novel i will instance a few worthy specimens all of our own day and language merediths rhoda fleming that wonderful and painful book long out of print21 and hunted for at bookstalls like an aldine hardys pair of blue eyes and two of charles reades griffith gaunt and the double marriage originally called white lies and founded by an accident quaintly favourable to my nomenclature on a play by maquet the partner of the great dumas in this kind of novel the closed door of the author of beltraffio must be broken open passion must appear upon the scene and utter its last word passion is the beall and the endall the plot and the solution the protagonist and the deus ex machinâ in one the characters may come anyhow upon the stage we do not care the point is that before they leave it they shall become transfigured and raised out of themselves by passion it may be part of the design to draw them with detail to depict a fulllength character and then behold it melt and change in the furnace of emotion but there is no obligation of the sort nice portraiture is not required and we are content to accept mere abstract types so they be strongly and sincerely moved a novel of this class may be even great and yet contain no individual figure it may be great because it displays the workings of the perturbed heart and the impersonal utterance of passion and with an artist of the second class it is indeed even more likely to be great when the issue has thus been narrowed and the whole force of the writers mind directed to passion alone cleverness again which has its fair field in the novel of character is debarred all entry upon this more solemn theatre a farfetched motive an ingenious evasion of the issue a witty instead of a passionate turn offend us like an insincerity all should be plain all straightforward to the end hence it is that in rhoda fleming mrs lovel raises such resentment in the reader her motives are too flimsy her ways are too equivocal for the weight and strength of her surroundings hence the hot indignation of the reader when balzac after having begun the duchesse de langeais in terms of strong if somewhat swollen passion cuts the knot by the derangement of the heros clock such personages and incidents belong to the novel of character they are out of place in the high society of the passions when the passions are introduced in art at their full height we look to see them not baffled and impotently striving as in life but towering above circumstance and acting substitutes for fate  and here i can imagine mr james with his lucid sense to intervene to much of what i have said he would apparently demur in much he would somewhat impatiently acquiesce it may be true but it is not what he desired to say or to hear said he spoke of the finished picture and its worth when done i of the brushes the palette and the north light he uttered his views in the tone and for the ear of good society i with the emphasis and technicalities of the obtrusive student but the point i may reply is not merely to amuse the public but to offer helpful advice to the young writer and the young writer will not so much be helped by genial pictures of what an art may aspire to at its highest as by a true idea of what it must be on the lowest terms the best that we can say to him is this let him choose a motive whether of character or passion carefully construct his plot so that every incident is an illustration of the motive and every property employed shall bear to it a near relation of congruity or contrast avoid a subplot unless as sometimes in shakespeare the subplot be a reversion or complement of the main intrigue suffer not his style to flag below the level of the argument pitch the key of conversation not with any thought of how men talk in parlours but with a single eye to the degree of passion he may be called on to express and allow neither himself in the narrative nor any character in the course of the dialogue to utter one sentence that is not part and parcel of the business of the story or the discussion of the problem involved let him not regret if this shortens his book it will be better so for to add irrelevant matter is not to lengthen but to bury let him not mind if he miss a thousand qualities so that he keeps unflaggingly in pursuit of the one he has chosen let him not care particularly if he miss the tone of conversation the pungent material detail of the days manners the reproduction of the atmosphere and the environment these elements are not essential a novel may be excellent and yet have none of them a passion or a character is so much the better depicted as it rises clearer from material circumstance in this age of the particular let him remember the ages of the abstract the great books of the past the brave men that lived before shakespeare and before balzac and as the root of the whole matter let him bear in mind that his novel is not a transcript of life to be judged by its exactitude but a simplification of some side or point of life to stand or fall by its significant simplicity for although in great men working upon great motives what we observe and admire is often their complexity yet underneath appearances the truth remains unchanged that simplification was their method and that simplicity is their excellence     ii  since the above was written another novelist has entered repeatedly the lists of theory one well worthy of mention mr w d howells and none ever couched a lance with narrower convictions his own work and those of his pupils and masters singly occupy his mind he is the bondslave the zealot of his school he dreams of an advance in art like what there is in science he thinks of past things as radically dead he thinks a form can be outlived a strange immersion in his own history a strange forgetfulness of the history of the race meanwhile by a glance at his own works could he see them with the eager eyes of his readers much of this illusion would be dispelled for while he holds all the poor little orthodoxies of the dayno poorer and no smaller than those of yesterday or tomorrow poor and small indeed only so far as they are exclusivethe living quality of much that he has done is of a contrary i had almost said of a heretical complexion a man as i read him of an originally strong romantic benta certain glow of romance still resides in many of his books and lends them their distinction as by accident he runs out and revels in the exceptional and it is then as often as not that his reader rejoicesjustly as i contend for in all this excessive eagerness to be centrally human is there not one central human thing that mr howells is too often tempted to neglect i mean himself a poet a finished artist a man in love with the appearances of life a cunning reader of the mind he has other passions and aspirations than those he loves to draw and why should he suppress himself and do such reverence to the lemuel barkers the obvious is not of necessity the normal fashion rules and deforms the majority fall tamely into the contemporary shape and thus attain in the eyes of the true observer only a higher power of insignificance and the danger is lest in seeking to draw the normal a man should draw the null and write the novel of society instead of the romance of man   footnotes    19 this paper which does not otherwise fit the present volume is     reprinted here as the proper continuation of the lastr l s    20 1884    21 now no longer so thank

appearing alone shorn of that other matter which was at once its occasion and its justification so large an account of a man so little known may seem to a stranger out of all proportion but jenkin was a man much more remarkable than the mere bulk or merit of his work approves him it was in the world in the commerce of friendship by his brave attitude towards life by his high moral value and unwearied intellectual effort that he struck the minds of his contemporaries his was an individual figure such as authors delight to draw and all men to read of in the pages of a novel his was a face worth painting for its own sake if the sitter shall not seem to have justified the portrait if jenkin after his death shall not continue to make new friends the fault will be altogether mine

the county of kent persons of strong genealogical pinion pass from william jenkin mayor of folkestone in 1555 to his contemporary john jenkin of the citie of york receiver general of the county and thence by way of jenkin ap philip to the proper summit of any cambrian pedigreea prince guaith voeth lord of cardigan the name and style of him it may suffice however for the present that these kentish jenkins must have undoubtedly derived from wales and being a stock of some efficiency they struck root and grew to wealth and consequence in their new home  of their consequence we have proof enough in the fact that not only was william jenkin as already mentioned mayor of folkestone in 1555 but no less than twentythree times in the succeeding century and a half a jenkin william thomas henry or robert sat in the same place of humble honour of their wealth we know that in the reign of charles i thomas jenkin of eythorne was more than once in the market buying land and notably in 1633 acquired the manor of stowting court this was an estate of some 320 acres six miles from hythe in the bailiwick and hundred of stowting and the lathe of shipway held of the crown in capite by the service of six men and a constable to defend the passage of the sea at sandgate it had a chequered history before it fell into the hands of thomas of eythorne having been sold and given from one to anotherto the archbishop to heringods to the burghershes to pavelys trivets cliffords wenlocks beauchamps nevilles kempes and clarkes a piece of kentish ground condemned to see new faces and to be no mans home but from 1633 onward it became the anchor of the jenkin family in kent and though passed on from brother to brother held in shares between uncle and nephew burthened by debts and jointures and at least once sold and bought in again it remains to this day in the hands of the direct line it is not my design nor have i the necessary knowledge to give a history of this obscure family but this is an age when genealogy has taken a new lease of life and become for the first time a human science so that we no longer study it in quest of the guaith voeths but to trace out some of the secrets of descent and destiny and as we study we think less of sir bernard burke and more of mr galton not only do our character and talents lie upon the anvil and receive their temper during generations but the very plot of our lifes story unfolds itself on a scale of centuries and the biography of the man is only an episode in the epic of the family from this point of view i ask the readers leave to begin this notice of a remarkable man who was my friend with the accession of his greatgrandfather john jenkin  this john jenkin a grandson of damaris kingsley of the family of westward ho was born in 1727 and married elizabeth daughter of thomas frewen of church house northiam the jenkins had now been long enough intermarrying with their kentish neighbours to be kentish folk themselves in all but name and with the frewens in particular their connection is singularly involved john and his wife were each descended in the third degree from another thomas frewen vicar of northiam and brother to accepted frewen archbishop of york johns mother had married a frewen for a second husband and the last complication was to be added by the bishop of chichesters brother charles buckner viceadmiral of the white who was twice married first to a paternal cousin of squire john and second to anne only sister of the squires wife and already the widow of another frewen the reader must bear mrs buckner in mind it was by means of that lady that fleeming jenkin began life as a poor man meanwhile the relationship of any frewen to any jenkin at the end of these evolutions presents a problem almost insoluble and we need not wonder if mrs john thus exercised in her immediate circle was in her old age a great genealogist of all sussex families and much consulted the names frewen and jenkin may almost seem to have been interchangeable at will and yet fate proceeds with such particularity that it was perhaps on the point of name the family was ruined  the john jenkins had a family of one daughter and five extravagant and unpractical sons the eldest stephen entered the church and held the living of salehurst where he offered we may hope an extreme example of the clergy of the age he was a handsome figure of a man jovial and jocular fond of his garden which produced under his care the finest fruits of the neighbourhood and like all the family very choice in horses he drove tandem like jehu furiously his saddlehorse captain for the names of horses are piously preserved in the family chronicle which i follow was trained to break into a gallop as soon as the vicars foot was thrown across its back nor would the rein be drawn in the nine miles between northiam and the vicarage door debt was the mans proper element he used to skulk from arrest in the chancel of his church and the speed of captain may have come sometimes handy at an early age this unconventional parson married his cook and by her he had two daughters and one son one of the daughters died unmarried the other imitated her father and married imprudently the son still more gallantly continuing the tradition entered the army loaded himself with debt was forced to sell out took refuge in the marines and was lost on the dogger bank in the warship minotaur if he did not marry below him like his father his sister and a certain greatuncle william it was perhaps because he never married at all  the second brother thomas who was employed in the general post office followed in all material points the example of stephen married not very creditably and spent all the money he could lay his hands on he died without issue as did the fourth brother john who was of weak intellect and feeble health and the fifth brother william whose brief career as one of mrs buckners satellites will fall to be considered later on so soon then as the minotaur had struck upon the dogger bank stowting and the line of the jenkin family fell on the shoulders of the third brother charles  facility and selfindulgence are the family marks facility to judge by these imprudent marriages being at once their quality and their defect but in the case of charles a man of exceptional beauty and sweetness both of face and disposition the family fault had quite grown to be a virtue and we find him in consequence the drudge and milkcow of his relatives born in 1766 charles served at sea in his youth and smelt both saltwater and powder the jenkins had inclined hitherto as far as i can make out to the land service stephens son had been a soldier william fourth of stowting had been an officer of the unhappy braddocks in america where by the way he owned and afterwards sold an estate on the james river called after the parental seat of which i should like well to hear if it still bears the name it was probably by the influence of captain buckner already connected with the family by his first marriage that charles jenkin turned his mind in the direction of the navy and it was in buckners own ship the prothée 64 that the lad made his only campaign it was in the days of rodneys war when the prothée we read captured two large privateers to windward of barbadoes and was materially and distinguishedly engaged in both the actions with de grasse while at sea charles kept a journal and made strange archaic pilotbook sketches part plan part elevation some of which survive for the amusement of posterity he did a good deal of surveying so that here we may perhaps lay our finger on the beginning of fleemings education as an engineer what is still more strange among the relics of the handsome midshipman and his stay in the gunroom of the prothée i find a code of signals graphically represented for all the world as it would have been done by his grandson  on the declaration of peace charles because he had suffered from scurvy received his mothers orders to retire and he was not the man to refuse a request far less to disobey a command thereupon he turned farmer a trade he was to practise on a large scale and we find him married to a miss schirr a woman of some fortune the daughter of a london merchant stephen the not very reverend was still alive galloping about the country or skulking in his chancel it does not appear whether he let or sold the paternal manor to charles one or other it must have been and the sailorfarmer settled at stowting with his wife his mother his unmarried sister and his sick brother john out of the six people of whom his nearest family consisted three were in his own house and two others the horseleeches stephen and thomas he appears to have continued to assist with more amiability than wisdom he hunted belonged to the yeomanry owned famous horses maggie and lucy the latter coveted by royalty itself lord rokeby his neighbour called him kinsman writes my artless chronicler and altogether life was very cheery at stowting his three sons john charles and thomas frewen and his younger daughter anna were all born to him and the reader should here be told that it is through the report of this second charles born 1801 that he has been looking on at these confused passages of family history  in the year 1805 the ruin of the jenkins was begun it was the work of a fallacious lady already mentioned aunt anne frewen a sister of mrs john twice married first to her cousin charles frewen clerk to the court of chancery brunswick herald and usher of the black rod and secondly to admiral buckner she was denied issue in both beds and being very richshe died worth about £60000 mostly in landshe was in perpetual quest of an heir the mirage of this fortune hung before successive members of the jenkin family until her death in 1825 when it dissolved and left the latest alnaschar face to face with bankruptcy the grandniece stephens daughter the one who had not married imprudently appears to have been the first for she was taken abroad by the golden aunt and died in her care at ghent in 1792 next she adopted william the youngest of the five nephews took him abroad with herit seems as if that were in the formula was shut up with him in paris by the revolution brought him back to windsor and got him a place in the kings body guard where he attracted the notice of george iii by his proficiency in german in 1797 being on guard at st jamess palace william took a cold which carried him off and aunt anne was once more left heirless lastly in 1805 perhaps moved by the admiral who had a kindness for his old midshipman perhaps pleased by the good looks and the good nature of the man himself mrs buckner turned her eyes upon charles jenkin he was not only to be the heir however he was to be the chief hand in a somewhat wild scheme of family farming mrs jenkin the mother contributed 164 acres of land mrs buckner 570 some at northiam some farther off charles let onehalf of stowting to a tenant and threw the other and various scattered parcels into the common enterprise so that the whole farm amounted to near upon a thousand acres and was scattered over thirty miles of country the exseaman of thirtynine on whose wisdom and ubiquity the scheme depended was to live in the meanwhile without care or fear he was to check himself in nothing his two extravagances valuable horses and worthless brothers were to be indulged in comfort and whether the year quite paid itself or not whether successive years left accumulated savings or only a growing deficit the fortune of the golden aunt should in the end repair all  on this understanding charles jenkin transported his family to church house northiam charles the second then a child of three among the number through the eyes of the boy we have glimpses of the life that followed of admiral and mrs buckner driving up from windsor in a coach and six two posthorses and their own four of the house full of visitors the great roasts at the fire the tables in the servants hall laid for thirty or forty for a month together of the daily press of neighbours many of whom frewens lords bishops batchellors and dynes were also kinsfolk and the parties under the great spreading chestnuts of the old fore court where the young people danced and made merry to the music of the village band or perhaps in the depth of winter the father would bid young charles saddle his pony they would ride the thirty miles from northiam to stowting with the snow to the ponys saddlegirths and be received by the tenants like princes  this life of delights with the continual visible comings and goings of the golden aunt was well qualified to relax the fibre of the lads john the heir a yeoman and a foxhunter loud and notorious with his whip and spurs settled down into a kind of tony lumpkin waiting for the shoes of his father and his aunt thomas frewen the youngest is briefly dismissed as a handsome beau but he had the merit or the good fortune to become a doctor of medicine so that when the crash came he was not emptyhanded for the war of life charles at the dayschool of northiam grew so well acquainted with the rod that his floggings became matter of pleasantry and reached the ears of admiral buckner hereupon that tall roughvoiced formidable uncle entered with the lad into a covenant every time that charles was thrashed he was to pay the admiral a penny every day that he escaped the process was to be reversed i recollect writes charles going crying to my mother to be taken to the admiral to pay my debt it would seem by these terms the speculation was a losing one yet it is probable it paid indirectly by bringing the boy under remark the admiral was no enemy to dunces he loved courage and charles while yet little more than a baby would ride the great horse into the pond presently it was decided that here was the stuff of a fine sailor and at an early period the name of charles jenkin was entered on a ships books  from northiam he was sent to another school at boonshill near rye where the master took infinite delight in strapping him it keeps me warm and makes you grow he used to say and the stripes were not altogether wasted for the dunce though still very raw made progress with his studies it was known moreover that he was going to sea always a ground of preeminence with schoolboys and in his case the glory was not altogether future it wore a present form when he came driving to rye behind four horses in the same carriage with an admiral i was not a little proud you may believe says he  in 1814 when he was thirteen years of age he was carried by his father to chichester to the bishops palace the bishop had heard from his brother the admiral that charles was likely to do well and had an order from lord melville for the lads admission to the royal naval college at portsmouth both the bishop and the admiral patted him on the head and said charles will restore the old family by which i gather with some surprise that even in these days of open house at northiam and golden hope of my aunts fortune the family was supposed to stand in need of restoration but the past is apt to look brighter than nature above all to those enamoured of their genealogy and the ravages of stephen and thomas must have always given matter of alarm  what with the flattery of bishops and admirals the fine company in which he found himself at portsmouth his visits home with their gaiety and greatness of life his visits to mrs buckner soon a widow at windsor where he had a pony kept for him and visited at lord melvilles and lord harcourts and the levesongowers he began to have bumptious notions and his head was somewhat turned with fine people as to some extent it remained throughout his innocent and honourable life  in this frame of mind the boy was appointed to the conqueror captain davie humorously known as gentle johnnie the captain had earned this name by his style of discipline which would have figured well in the pages of marryat put the prisoners head in a bag and give him another dozen survives as a specimen of his commands and the men were often punished twice or thrice in a week on board the ship of this disciplinarian charles and his father were carried in a billyboat from sheerness in december 1816 charles with an outfit suitable to his pretensions a twentyguinea sextant and 120 dollars in silver which were ordered into the care of the gunner the old clerks and mates he writes used to laugh and jeer me for joining the ship in a billyboat and when they found i was from kent vowed i was an old kentish smuggler this to my pride you will believe was not a little offensive  the conqueror carried the flag of viceadmiral plampin commanding at the cape and st helena and at that allimportant islet in july 1817 she relieved the flagship of sir pulteney malcolm thus it befell that charles jenkin coming too late for the epic of the french wars played a small part in the dreary and disgraceful afterpiece of st helena life on the guardship was onerous and irksome the anchor was never lifted sail never made the great guns were silent none was allowed on shore except on duty all day the movements of the imperial captive were signalled to and fro all night the boats rowed guard around the accessible portions of the coast this prolonged stagnation and petty watchfulness in what napoleon himself called that unchristian climate told cruelly on the health of the ships company in eighteen months according to omeara the conqueror had lost one hundred and ten men and invalided home one hundred and seven being more than a third of her complement it does not seem that our young midshipman so much as once set eyes on bonaparte and yet in other ways jenkin was more fortunate than some of his comrades he drew in watercolour not so badly as his father yet ill enough and this art was so rare aboard the conqueror that even his humble proficiency marked him out and procured him some alleviations admiral plampin had succeeded napoleon at the briars and here he had young jenkin staying with him to make sketches of the historic house one of these is before me as i write and gives a strange notion of the arts in our old english navy yet it was again as an artist that the lad was taken for a run to rio and apparently for a second outing in a tengun brig these and a cruise of six weeks to windward of the island undertaken by the conqueror herself in quest of health were the only breaks in three years of murderous inaction and at the end of that period jenkin was invalided home having lost his health entirely  as he left the deck of the guardship the historic part of his career came to an end for fortytwo years he continued to serve his country obscurely on the seas sometimes thanked for inconspicuous and honourable services but denied any opportunity of serious distinction he was first two years in the larne captain tait hunting pirates and keeping a watch on the turkish and greek squadrons in the archipelago captain tait was a favourite with sir thomas maitland high commissioner of the ionian islandsking tom as he was calledwho frequently took passage in the larne king tom knew every inch of the mediterranean and was a terror to the officers of the watch he would come on deck at night and with his broad scots accent well sir he would say what depth of water have ye well now sound and yell just find so or so many fathoms as the case might be and the obnoxious passenger was generally right on one occasion as the ship was going into corfu sir thomas came up the hatchway and cast his eyes towards the gallows banghamcharles jenkin heard him say to his aidedecamp lord banghamwhere the devil is that other chap i left four fellows hanging there now i can only see three mind there is another there tomorrow and sure enough there was another greek dangling the next day captain hamilton of the cambrian kept the greeks in order afloat writes my author and king tom ashore  from 1823 onward the chief scene of charles jenkins activities was in the west indies where he was engaged off and on till 1844 now as a subaltern now in a vessel of his own hunting out pirates then very notorious in the leeward islands cruising after slavers or carrying dollars and provisions for the government while yet a midshipman he accompanied mr cockburn to caraccas and had a sight of bolivar in the brigantine griffon which he commanded in his last years in the west indies he carried aid to guadeloupe after the earthquake and twice earned the thanks of government once for an expedition to nicaragua to extort under threat of a blockade proper apologies and a sum of money due to certain british merchants and once during an insurrection in san domingo for the rescue of certain others from a perilous imprisonment and the recovery of a chest of money of which they had been robbed once on the other hand he earned his share of public censure this was in 1837 when he commanded the romney lying in the inner harbour of havannah the romney was in no proper sense a manofwar she was a slavehulk the bonded warehouse of the mixed slave commission where negroes captured out of slavers under spanish colours were detained provisionally till the commission should decide upon their case and either set them free or bind them to apprenticeship to this ship already an eyesore to the authorities a cuban slave made his escape the position was invidious on one side were the tradition of the british flag and the state of public sentiment at home on the other the certainty that if the slave were kept the romney would be ordered at once out of the harbour and the object of the mixed commission compromised without consultation with any other officer captain jenkin then lieutenant returned the man to shore and took the captaingenerals receipt lord palmerston approved his course but the zealots of the antislave trade movement never to be named without respect were much dissatisfied and thirtynine years later the matter was again canvassed in parliament and lord palmerston and captain jenkin defended by admiral erskine in a letter to the times march 13 1876  in 1845 while still lieutenant charles jenkin acted as admiral pigots flagcaptain in the cove of cork where there were some thirty pennants and about the same time closed his career by an act of personal bravery he had proceeded with his boats to the help of a merchant vessel whose cargo of combustibles had taken fire and was smouldering under hatches his sailors were in the hold where the fumes were already heavy and jenkin was on deck directing operations when he found his orders were no longer answered from below he jumped down without hesitation and slung up several insensible men with his own hand for this act he received a letter from the lords of the admiralty expressing a sense of his gallantry and pretty soon after was promoted commander superseded and could never again obtain employment  in 1828 or 1829 charles jenkin was in the same watch with another midshipman robert colin campbelljackson who introduced him to his family in jamaica the father the honourable robert jackson custos rotulorum of kingston came of a yorkshire family said to be originally scottish and on the mothers side counted kinship with some of the forbeses the mother was susan campbell one of the campbells of auchenbreck her father colin a merchant in greenock is said to have been the heir to both the estate and the baronetcy he claimed neither which casts a doubt upon the fact but he had pride enough himself and taught enough pride to his family for any station or descent in christendom he had four daughters one married an edinburgh writer as i have it on a first accounta minister according to anothera man at least of reasonable station but not good enough for the campbells of auchenbreck and the erring one was instantly discarded another married an actor of the name of adcock whom as i receive the tale she had seen acting in a barn but the phrase should perhaps be regarded rather as a measure of the family annoyance than a mirror of the facts the marriage was not in itself unhappy adcock was a gentleman by birth and made a good husband the family reasonably prospered and one of the daughters married no less a man than clarkson stanfield but by the father and the two remaining miss campbells people of fierce passions and a truly highland pride the derogation was bitterly resented for long the sisters lived estranged then mrs jackson and mrs adcock were reconciled for a moment only to quarrel the more fiercely the name of mrs adcock was proscribed nor did it again pass her sisters lips until the morning when she announced mary adcock is dead i saw her in her shroud last night secondsight was hereditary in the house and sure enough as i have it reported on that very night mrs adcock had passed away thus of the four daughters two had according to the idiotic notions of their friends disgraced themselves in marriage the others supported the honour of the family with a better grace and married west indian magnates of whom i believe the world has never heard and would not care to hear so strange a thing is this hereditary pride of mr jackson beyond the fact that he was fleemings grandfather i know naught his wife as i have said was a woman of fierce passions she would tie her house slaves to the bed and lash them with her own hand and her conduct to her wild and downgoing sons was a mixture of almost insane selfsacrifice and wholly insane violence of temper she had three sons and one daughter two of the sons went utterly to ruin and reduced their mother to poverty the third went to india a slim delicate lad and passed so wholly from the knowledge of his relatives that he was thought to be long dead years later when his sister was living in genoa a redbearded man of great strength and stature tanned by years in india and his hands covered with barbaric gems entered the room unannounced as she was playing the piano lifted her from her seat and kissed her it was her brother suddenly returned out of a past that was never very clearly understood with the rank of general many strange gems many cloudy stories of adventure and next his heart the daguerreotype of an indian prince with whom he had mixed blood  the last of this wild family the daughter henrietta camilla became the wife of the midshipman charles and the mother of the subject of this notice fleeming jenkin she was a woman of parts and courage not beautiful she had a far higher gift the art of seeming so played the part of a belle in society while far lovelier women were left unattended and up to old age had much of both the exigency and the charm that mark that character she drew naturally for she had no training with unusual skill and it was from her and not from the two naval artists that fleeming inherited his eye and hand she played on the harp and sang with something beyond the talent of an amateur at the age of seventeen she heard pasta in paris flew up in a fire of youthful enthusiasm and the next morning all alone and without introduction found her way into the presence of the prima donna and begged for lessons pasta made her sing kissed her when she had done and though she refused to be her mistress placed her in the hands of a friend nor was this all for when pasta returned to paris she sent for the girl once at least to test her progress but mrs jenkins talents were not so remarkable as her fortitude and strength of will and it was in an art for which she had no natural taste the art of literature that she appeared before the public her novels though they attained and merited a certain popularity both in france and england are a measure only of her courage they were a task not a beloved task they were written for money in days of poverty and they served their end in the least thing as well as in the greatest in every province of life as well as in her novels she displayed the same capacity of taking infinite pains which descended to her son when she was about forty as near as her age was known she lost her voice set herself at once to learn the piano working eight hours a day and attained to such proficiency that her collaboration in chamber music was courted by professionals and more than twenty years later the old lady might have been seen dauntlessly beginning the study of hebrew this is the more ethereal part of courage nor was she wanting in the more material once when a neighbouring groom a married man had seduced her maid mrs jenkin mounted her horse rode over to the stable entrance and horsewhipped the man with her own hand  how a match came about between this talented and spirited girl and the young midshipman is not very easy to conceive charles jenkin was one of the finest creatures breathing loyalty devotion simple natural piety boyish cheerfulness tender and manly sentiment in the old sailor fashion were in him inherent and inextinguishable either by age suffering or injustice he looked as he was every inch a gentleman he must have been everywhere notable even among handsome men both for his face and his gallant bearing not so much that of a sailor you would have said as like one of those gentle and graceful soldiers that to this day are the most pleasant of englishmen to see but though he was in these ways noble the dunce scholar of northiam was to the end no genius upon all points that a man must understand to be a gentleman to be upright gallant affectionate and dead to self captain jenkin was more knowing than one among a thousand outside of that his mind was very largely blank he had indeed a simplicity that came near to vacancy and in the first forty years of his married life this want grew more accentuated in both families imprudent marriages had been the rule but neither jenkin nor campbell had ever entered into a more unequal union it was the captains good looks we may suppose that gained for him this elevation and in some ways and for many years of his life he had to pay the penalty his wife impatient of his incapacity and surrounded by brilliant friends used him with a certain contempt she was the managing partner the life was hers not his after his retirement they lived much abroad where the poor captain who could never learn any language but his own sat in the corner mumchance and even his son carried away by his bright mother did not recognise for long the treasures of simple chivalry that lay buried in the heart of his father yet it would be an error to regard this marriage as unfortunate it not only lasted long enough to justify itself in a beautiful and touching epilogue but it gave to the world the scientific work and what while time was were of far greater value the delightful qualities of fleeming jenkin the kentishwelsh family facile extravagant generous to a fault and far from brilliant had given in the father an extreme example of its humble virtues on the other side the wild cruel proud and somewhat blackguard stock of the scots campbelljacksons had put forth in the person of the mother all its force and courage  the marriage fell in evil days in 1823 the bubble of the golden aunts inheritance had burst she died holding the hand of the nephew she had so wantonly deceived at the last she drew him down and seemed to bless him surely with some remorseful feeling for when the will was opened there was not found so much as the mention of his name he was deeply in debt in debt even to the estate of his deceiver so that he had to sell a piece of land to clear himself my dear boy he said to charles there will be nothing left for you i am a ruined man and here follows for me the strangest part of this story from the death of the treacherous aunt charles jenkin senior had still some nine years to live it was perhaps too late for him to turn to saving and perhaps his affairs were past restoration but his family at least had all this while to prepare they were still young men and knew what they had to look for at their fathers death and yet when that happened in september 1831 the heir was still apathetically waiting poor john the days of his whips and spurs and yeomanry dinners were quite over and with that incredible softness of the jenkin nature he settled down for the rest of a long life into something not far removed above a peasant the mill farm at stowting had been saved out of the wreck and here he built himself a house on the mexican model and made the two ends meet with rustic thrift gathering dung with his own hands upon the road and not at all abashed at his employment in dress voice and manner he fell into mere country plainness lived without the least care for appearances the least regret for the past or discontentment with the present and when he came to die died with stoic cheerfulness announcing that he had had a comfortable time and was yet well pleased to go one would think there was little active virtue to be inherited from such a race and yet in this same voluntary peasant the special gift of fleeming jenkin was already half developed the old man to the end was perpetually inventing his strange illspelled unpunctuated correspondence is full when he does not drop into cookery receipts of pumps roadengines steamdiggers steamploughs and steam threshingmachines and i have it on fleemings word that what he did was full of ingenuityonly as if by some cross destiny useless these disappointments he not only took with imperturbable good humour but rejoiced with a particular relish over his nephews success in the same field i glory in the professor he wrote to his brother and to fleeming himself with a touch of simple drollery i was much pleased with your lecture but why did you hit me so hard with conisures connoisseurs quasi amateurs engineering oh what presumptioneither of you or myself a quaint pathetic figure this of uncle john with his dungcart and his inventions and the romantic fancy of his mexican house and his craze about the lost tribes which seemed to the worthy man the key of all perplexities and his quiet conscience looking back on a life not altogether vain for he was a good son to his father while his father lived and when evil days approached he had proved himself a cheerful stoic  it followed from johns inertia that the duty of winding up the estate fell into the hands of charles he managed it with no more skill than might be expected of a sailor ashore saved a bare livelihood for john and nothing for the rest eight months later he married miss jackson and with her money bought in some twothirds of stowting in the beginning of the little family history which i have been following to so great an extent the captain mentions with a delightful pride a court baron and court leet are regularly held by the lady of the manor mrs henrietta camilla jenkin and indeed the pleasure of so describing his wife was the most solid benefit of the investment for the purchase was heavily encumbered and paid them nothing till some years before their death in the meanwhile the jackson family also what with wild sons an indulgent mother and the impending emancipation of the slaves was moving nearer and nearer to beggary and thus of two doomed and declining houses the subject of this memoir was born heir to an estate and to no money yet with inherited qualities that were to make him known and loved       chapter ii    18331851     birth and childhoodedinburghfrankfortonthemainparisthe    revolution of 1848the

family was born in a government building on the coast of kent near dungeness where his father was serving at the time in the coastguard on march 25 1833 and named after admiral fleeming one of his fathers protectors in the navy  his childhood was vagrant like his life once he was left in the care of his grandmother jackson while mrs jenkin sailed in her husbands ship and stayed a year at the havannah the tragic woman was besides from time to time a member of the family she was in distress of mind and reduced in fortune by the misconduct of her sons her destitution and solitude made it a recurring duty to receive her her violence continually enforced fresh separations in her passion of a disappointed mother she was a fit object of pity but her grandson who heard her load his own mother with cruel insults and reproaches conceived for her an indignant and impatient hatred for which he blamed himself in later life it is strange from this point of view to see his childish letters to mrs jackson and to think that a man distinguished above all by stubborn truthfulness should have been brought up to such dissimulation but this is of course unavoidable in life it did no harm to jenkin and whether he got harm or benefit from a so early acquaintance with violent and hateful scenes is more than i can guess the experience at least was formative and in judging his character it should not be forgotten but mrs jackson was not the only stranger in their gates the captains sister aunt anna jenkin lived with them until her death she had all the jenkin beauty of countenance though she was unhappily deformed in body and of frail health and she even excelled her gentle and ineffectual family in all amiable qualities so that each of the two races from which fleeming sprang had an outpost by his very cradle the one he instinctively loved the other hated and the lifelong war in his members had begun thus early by a victory for what was best  we can trace the family from one country place to another in the south of scotland where the child learned his taste for sport by riding home the pony from the moors before he was nine he could write such a passage as this about a halloween observance i pulled a middlingsized cabbagerunt with a pretty sum of gold about it no witches would run after me when i was sowing my hempseed this year my nuts blazed away together very comfortably to the end of their lives and when mamma put hers in which were meant for herself and papa they blazed away in the like manner before he was ten he could write with a really irritating precocity that he had been making some pictures from a book called les français peints par euxmêmes  it is full of pictures of all classes with a description of each in french the pictures are a little caricatured but not much doubtless this was only an echo from his mother but it shows the atmosphere in which he breathed it must have been a good change for this art critic to be the playmate of mary macdonald their gardeners daughter at barjarg and to sup with her family on potatoes and milk and fleeming himself attached some value to this early and friendly experience of another class  his education in the formal sense began at jedburgh thence he went to the edinburgh academy where clerk maxwell was his senior and tait his classmate bore away many prizes and was once unjustly flogged by rector williams he used to insist that all his bad schoolfellows had died early a belief amusingly characteristic of the mans consistent optimism in 1846 the mother and son proceeded to frankfortonthemain where they were soon joined by the father now reduced to inaction and to play something like third fiddle in his narrow household the emancipation of the slaves had deprived them of their last resource beyond the halfpay of a captain and life abroad was not only desirable for the sake of fleemings education it was almost enforced by reasons of economy but it was no doubt somewhat hard upon the captain certainly that perennial boy found a companion in his son they were both active and eager both willing to be amused both young if not in years then in character they went out together on excursions and sketched old castles sitting side by side they had an angry rivalry in walking doubtless equally sincere upon both sides and indeed we may say that fleeming was exceptionally favoured and that no boy had ever a companion more innocent engaging gay and airy but although in this case it would be easy to exaggerate its import yet in the jenkin family also the tragedy of the generations was proceeding and the child was growing out of his fathers knowledge his artistic aptitude was of a different order already he had his quick sight of many sides of life he already overflowed with distinctions and generalisations contrasting the dramatic art and national character of england germany italy and france if he were dull he would write stories and poems i have written he says at thirteen a very long story in heroic measure 300 lines and another scotch story and innumerable bits of poetry and at the same age he had not only a keen feeling for scenery but could do something with his pen to call it up i feel i do always less than justice to the delightful memory of captain jenkin but with a lad of this character cutting the teeth of his intelligence he was sure to fall into the background  the family removed in 1847 to paris where fleeming was put to school under one deluc there he learned french and if the captain is right first began to show a taste for mathematics but a far more important teacher than deluc was at hand the year 1848 so momentous for europe was momentous also for fleemings character the family politics were liberal mrs jenkin generous before all things was sure to be upon the side of exiles and in the house of a paris friend of hers mrs turneralready known to fame as shelleys cornelia de boinvillefleeming saw and heard such men as manin gioberti and the ruffinis he was thus prepared to sympathise with revolution and when the hour came and he found himself in the midst of stirring and influential events the lads whole character was moved he corresponded at that time with a young edinburgh friend one frank scott and i am here going to draw somewhat largely on this boyish correspondence it gives us at once a picture of the revolution and a portrait of jenkin at fifteen not so different his friends will think from the jenkin of the endboyish simple opinionated delighting in action delighting before all things in any generous sentiment       february 23 1848    when at 7 oclock today i went out i met a large band going round   the streets calling on the inhabitants to illuminate their houses   and bearing torches this was all very good fun and everybody was   delighted but as they stopped rather long and were rather turbulent   in the place de la madeleine near where we live in the rue   caumartin a squadron of dragoons came up formed and charged at a   handgallop this was a very pretty sight the crowd was not too   thick so they easily got away and the dragoons only gave blows with   the back of the sword which hurt but did not wound i was as close to   them as i am now to the other side of the table it was rather   impressive however at the second charge they rode on the pavement   and knocked the torches out of the fellows hands rather a shame   toowouldnt be stood in england    at ten minutes to ten i went a long way along the boulevards   passing by the office of foreign affairs where guizot lives and   where tonight there were about a thousand troops protecting him from   the fury of the populace after this was passed the number of the   people thickened till about half a mile further on i met a troop of   vagabonds the wildest vagabonds in the worldparis vagabonds well   armed having probably broken into gunsmiths shops and taken the guns   and swords they were about a hundred these were followed by about a   thousand i am rather diminishing than exaggerating numbers all   through indifferently armed with rusty sabres sticks etc an   uncountable troop of gentlemen workmen shopkeepers wives paris   women dare anything ladiesmaids common womenin fact a crowd of   all classes though by far the greater number were of the   betterdressed classfollowed indeed it was a splendid sight the   mob in front chanting the marseillaise the national warhymn grave   and powerful sweetened by the night airthough night in these   splendid streets was turned into day every window was filled with   lamps dim torches were tossing in the crowd  for guizot has late   this night given in his resignation and this was an improvised   illumination    i and my father had turned with the crowd and were close behind the   second troop of vagabonds joy was on every face i remarked to papa   that i would not have missed the scene for anything i might never   see such a splendid one when plong went one shotevery face went   palerrrrr went the whole detachment and the whole crowd of   gentlemen and ladies turned and cut such a sceneladies gentlemen   and vagabonds went sprawling in the mud not shot but tripped up and   those that went down could not rise they were trampled over i ran   a short time straight on and did not fall then turned down a side   street ran fifty yards and felt tolerably safe looked for papa did   not see him so walked on quickly giving the news as i went it   appears from another letter the boy was the first to carry word of   the firing to the rue st honoré and that his news wherever he   brought it was received with hurrahs it was an odd entrance upon life   for a little english lad thus to play the part of rumour in such a   crisis of the history of france    but now a new fear came over me i had little doubt but my papa was   safe but my fear was that he should arrive at home before me and tell   the story in that case i knew my mamma would go half mad with fright   so on i went as quick as possible i heard no more discharges when i   got half way home i found my way blocked up by troops that way or   the boulevards i must pass in the boulevards they were fighting and   i was afraid all other passages might be blocked up  and i should   have to sleep in a hotel in that case and then my mammahowever   after a long détour i found a passage and ran home and in our   street joined papa     ill tell you tomorrow the other facts gathered from newspapers   and papa tonight i have given you what i have seen with my own   eyes an hour ago and began trembling with excitement and fear if i   have been too long on this one subject it is because it is yet before   my eyes       monday 24    it was that fire raised the people there was fighting all through   the night in the rue notre dame de lorette on the boulevards where   they had been shot at and at the porte st denis at ten oclock they   resigned the house of the minister of foreign affairs where the   disastrous volley was fired to the people who immediately took   possession of it i went to school but was hardly there when the row   in that quarter commenced barricades began to be fixed every one was   very grave now the externes went away but no one came to fetch me   so i had to stay no lessons could go on a troop of armed men took   possession of the barricades so it was supposed i should have to   sleep there the revolters came and asked for arms but deluc   headmaster is a national guard and he said he had only his own and   he wanted them but he said he would not fire on them then they asked   for wine which he gave them they took good care not to get drunk   knowing they would not be able to fight they were very polite and   behaved extremely well    about twelve oclock a servant came for a boy who lived near me   and deluc thought it best to send me with him we heard a good deal   of firing near but did not come across any of the parties as we   approached the railway the barricades were no longer formed of   palings planks or stones but they had got all the omnibuses as they   passed sent the horses and passengers about their business and   turned them over a double row of overturned coaches made a capital   barricade with a few pavingstones    when i got home i found to my astonishment that in our fighting   quarter it was much quieter mamma had just been out seeing the troops   in the place de la concorde when suddenly the municipal guard now   fairly exasperated prevented the national guard from proceeding and   fired at them the national guard had come with their musquets not   loaded but at length returned the fire mamma saw the national guard   fire the municipal guard were round the corner she was delighted   for she saw no person killed though many of the municipals were    i immediately went out with my papa mamma had just come back with   him and went to the place de la concorde there was an enormous   quantity of troops in the place suddenly the gates of the gardens of   the tuileries opened we rushed forward out galloped an enormous   number of cuirassiers in the middle of which were a couple of low   carriages said first to contain the count de paris and the duchess of   orleans but afterwards they said it was the king and queen and then   i heard he had abdicated i returned and gave the news    went out again up the boulevards the house of the minister of   foreign affairs was filled with people and hôtel du peuple written   on it the boulevards were barricaded with fine old trees that were   cut down and stretched all across the road we went through a great   many little streets all strongly barricaded and sentinels of the   people at the principal of them the streets are very unquiet filled   with armed men and women for the troops had followed the exking to   neuilly and left paris in the power of the people we met the captain   of the third legion of the national guard who had principally   protected the people badly wounded by a municipal guard stretched on   a litter he was in possession of his senses he was surrounded by a   troop of men crying our brave captainwe have him yethes not   dead vive la réforme this cry was responded to by all and every   one saluted him as he passed i do not know if he was mortally   wounded that third legion has behaved splendidly    i then returned and shortly afterwards went out again to the garden   of the tuileries they were given up to the people and the palace was   being sacked the people were firing blank cartridge to testify their   joy and they had a cannon on the top of the palace it was a sight to   see a palace sacked and armed vagabonds firing out of the windows   and throwing shirts papers and dresses of all kinds out of the   windows they are not rogues these french they are not stealing   burning or doing much harm in the tuileries they have dressed up   some of the statues broken some and stolen nothing but queer   dresses i say frank you must not hate the french hate the germans   if you like the french laugh at us a little and call out goddam in   the streets but today in civil war when they might have put a   bullet through our heads i never was insulted once    at present we have a provisional government consisting of odion   sic barrot lamartine marast and some others among them a   common workman but very intelligent this is a triumph of   libertyrather    now then frank what do you think of it i in a revolution and out   all day just think what fun so it was at first till i was fired at   yesterday but today i was not frightened but it turned me sick at   heart i dont know why there has been no great bloodshed though i   certainly have seen mens blood several times but theres something   shocking to see a whole armed populace though not furious for not   one single shop has been broken open except the gunsmiths shops and   most of the arms will probably be taken back again for the french   have no cupidity in their nature they dont like to stealit is not   in their nature i shall send this letter in a day or two when i am   sure the post will go again i know i have been a long time writing   but i hope you will find the matter of this letter interesting as   coming from a person resident on the spot though probably you dont   take much interest in the french but i can think write and speak on   no other subject       feb 25    there is no more fighting the people have conquered but the   barricades are still kept up and the people are in arms more than   ever fearing some new act of treachery on the part of the exking the   fight where i was was the principal cause of the revolution i was in   little danger from the shot for there was an immense crowd in front   of me though quite within gunshot by another letter a hundred   yards from the troops i wished i had stopped there    the paris streets are filled with the most extraordinary crowds of   men women and children ladies and gentlemen every person joyful   the bands of armed men are perfectly polite mamma and aunt today   walked through armed crowds alone that were firing blank cartridges   in all directions every person made way with the greatest politeness   and one common man with a blouse coming by accident against her   immediately stopped to beg her pardon in the politest manner there   are few drunken men the tuileries is still being run over by the   people they only broke two things a bust of louis philippe and one   of marshal bugeaud who fired on the people    i have been out all day again today and precious tired i am the   republican party seems the strongest and are going about with red   ribbons in their buttonholes    the title of mister is abandoned they say nothing but citizen   and the people are shaking hands amazingly they have got to the top   of the public monuments and mingling with bronze or stone statues   five or six make a sort of tableau vivant the top man holding up   the red flag of the republic and right well they do it and very   picturesque they look i think i shall put this letter in the post   tomorrow as we got a letter tonight       on envelope    m lamartine has now by his eloquence conquered the whole armed crowd   of citizens threatening to kill him if he did not immediately proclaim   the republic and red flag he said he could not yield to the citizens   of paris alone that the whole country must be consulted that he   chose the tricolour for it had followed and accompanied the triumphs   of france all over the world and that the red flag had only been   dipped in the blood of the citizens for sixty hours he has been   quieting the people he is at the head of everything dont be   prejudiced frank by what you see in the papers the french have   acted nobly splendidly there has been no brutality plundering or   stealing i did not like the french before but in this respect   they are the finest people in the world i am so glad to have been   here  and there one could wish to stop with this apotheosis of liberty and order read with the generous enthusiasm of a boy but as the reader knows it was but the first act of the piece the letters vivid as they are written as they were by a hand trembling with fear and excitement yet do injustice in their boyishness of tone to the profound effect produced at the sound of these songs and shot of cannon the boys mind awoke he dated his own appreciation of the art of acting from the day when he saw and heard rachel recite the marseillaise at the français the tricolor in her arms what is still more strange he had been up to then invincibly indifferent to music insomuch that he could not distinguish god save the queen from bonnie dundee and now to the chanting of the mob he amazed his family by learning and singing mourir pour la patrie but the letters though they prepare the mind for no such revolution in the boys tastes and feelings are yet full of entertaining traits let the reader note fleemings eagerness to influence his friend frank an incipient tory no less as further history displayed his unconscious indifference to his father and devotion to his mother betrayed in so many significant expressions and omissions the sense of dignity of this diminutive person resident on the spot who was so happy as to escape insult and the strange picture of the householdfather mother son and even poor aunt annaall day in the streets in the thick of this rough business and the boy packed off alone to school in a distant quarter on the very morrow of the massacre  they had all the gift of enjoying lifes texture as it comes they were all born optimists the name of liberty was honoured in that family its spirit also but within stringent limits and some of the foreign friends of mrs jenkin were as i have said men distinguished on the liberal side like wordsworth they beheld    france standing on the top of golden hours    and human nature seeming born again  at once by temper and belief they were formed to find their element in such a decent and whiggish convulsion spectacular in its course moderate in its purpose for them    bliss was it in that dawn to be alive    but to be young was very heaven  and i cannot but smile when i think that again like wordsworth they should have so specially disliked the consequence  it came upon them by surprise liberal friends of the precise right shade of colour had assured them in mrs turners drawingroom that all was for the best and they rose on february 28 without fear about the middle of the day they heard the sound of musketry and the next morning they were wakened by the cannonade the french who had behaved so splendidly pausing at the voice of lamartine just where judicious liberals could have desiredthe french who had no cupidity in their nature were now about to play a variation on the theme rebellion the jenkins took refuge in the house of mrs turner the house of the false prophets anna going with mrs turner that she might be prevented speaking english fleeming miss h and i it is the mother who writes walking together as we reached the rue de clichy the report of the cannon sounded close to our ears and made our hearts sick i assure you the fighting was at the barrier rochechouart a few streets off all saturday and sunday we were a prey to great alarm there came so many reports that the insurgents were getting the upper hand one could tell the state of affairs from the extreme quiet or the sudden hum in the street when the news was bad all the houses closed and the people disappeared when better the doors half opened and you heard the sound of men again from the upper windows we could see each discharge from the bastillei mean the smoke risingand also the flames and smoke from the boulevard la chapelle we were four ladies and only fleeming by way of a man and difficulty enough we had to keep him from joining the national guardshis pride and spirit were both fired you cannot picture to yourself the multitudes of soldiers guards and armed men of all sorts we watchednot close to the window however for such havoc had been made among them by the firing from the windows that as the battalions marched by they cried fermez vos fenêtres and it was very painful to watch their looks of anxiety and suspicion as they marched by  the revolution writes fleeming to frank scott was quite delightful getting popped at and run at by horses and giving sous for the wounded into little boxes guarded by the raggedest picturesquest delightfullest sentinels but the insurrection ugh i shudder to think at sic it he found it not a bit of fun sitting boxed up in the house four days almost i was the only gentleman to four ladies and didnt they keep me in order i did not dare to show my face at a window for fear of catching a stray ball or being forced to enter the national guard for they would have it i was a man full grown french and every way fit to fight and my mamma was as bad as any of them she that told me i was a coward last time if i stayed in the house a quarter of an hour but i drew examined the pistols of which i found lots with caps powder and ball while sometimes murderous intentions of killing a dozen insurgents and dying violently overpowered by numbers we may drop this sentence here under the conduct of its boyish writer it was to reach no legitimate end  four days of such a discipline had cured the family of paris the same year fleeming was to write in answer apparently to a question of frank scotts i could find no national game in france but revolutions and the witticism was justified in their experience on the first possible day they applied for passports and were advised to take the road to geneva it appears it was scarce safe to leave paris for england charles reade with keen dramatic gusto had just smuggled himself out of that city in the bottom of a cab english gold had been found on the insurgents the name of england was in evil odour and it was thusfor strategic reasons so to speakthat fleeming found himself on the way to that italy where he was to complete his education and for which he cherished to the end a special kindness  it was in genoa they settled partly for the sake of the captain who might there find naval comrades partly because of the ruffinis who had been friends of mrs jenkin in their time of exile and were now considerable men at home partly in fine with hopes that fleeming might attend the university in preparation for which he was put at once to school it was the year of novara mazzini was in rome the dry bones of italy were moving and for people of alert and liberal sympathies the time was inspiriting what with exiles turned ministers of state universities thrown open to protestants fleeming himself the first protestant student in genoa and thus as his mother writes a living instance of the progress of liberal ideasit was little wonder if the enthusiastic young woman and the clever boy were heart and soul upon the side of italy it should not be forgotten that they were both on their first visit to that country the mother still child enough to be delighted when she saw real monks and both mother and son thrilling with the first sight of snowy alps the blue mediterranean and the crowded port and the palaces of genoa nor was their zeal without knowledge ruffini deputy for genoa and soon to be head of the university was at their side and by means of him the family appear to have had access to much italian society to the end fleeming professed his admiration of the piedmontese and his unalterable confidence in the future of italy under their conduct for victor emanuel cavour the first la marmora and garibaldi he had varying degrees of sympathy and praise perhaps highest for the king whose good sense and temper filled him with respectperhaps least for garibaldi whom he loved but yet mistrusted  but this is to look forward these were the days not of victor emanuel but of charles albert and it was on charles albert that mother and son had now fixed their eyes as on the swordbearer of italy on fleemings sixteenth birthday they were the mother writes in great anxiety for news from the army you can have no idea what it is to live in a country where such a struggle is going on the interest is one that absorbs all others we eat drink and sleep to the noise of drums and musketry you would enjoy and almost admire fleemings enthusiasm and earnestnessand courage i may sayfor we are among the small minority of english who side with the italians the other day at dinner at the consuls boy as he is and in spite of my admonitions fleeming defended the italian cause and so well that he tripped up the heels of his adversary simply from being wellinformed on the subject and honest he is as true as steel and for no one will he bend right or left do not fancy him a bobadil she adds he is only a very true candid boy i am so glad he remains in all respects but information a great child  if this letter is correctly dated the cause was already lost and the king had already abdicated when these lines were written no sooner did the news reach genoa than there began tumultuous movements and the jenkins received hints it would be wise to leave the city but they had friends and interests even the captain had english officers to keep him company for lord hardwickes ship the vengeance lay in port and supposing the danger to be real i cannot but suspect the whole family of a divided purpose prudence being possibly weaker than curiosity stay at least they did and thus rounded their experience of the revolutionary year on sunday april 1 fleeming and the captain went for a ramble beyond the walls leaving aunt anna and mrs jenkin to walk on the bastions with some friends on the way back this party turned aside to rest in the church of the madonna delle grazie we had remarked writes mrs jenkin the entire absence of sentinels on the ramparts and how the cannons were left in solitary state and i had just remarked how quiet everything is when suddenly we heard the drums begin to beat and distant shouts accustomed as we are to revolutions we never thought of being frightened for all that they resumed their return home on the way they saw men running and vociferating but nothing to indicate a general disturbance until near the dukes palace they came upon and passed a shouting mob dragging along with it three cannon it had scarcely passed before they heard a rushing sound one of the gentlemen thrust back the party of ladies under a shed and the mob passed again a finelooking young man was in their hands and mrs jenkin saw him with his mouth open as if he sought to speak saw him tossed from one to another like a ball and then saw him no more he was dead a few instants after but the crowd hid that terror from us my knees shook under me and my sight left me with this street tragedy the curtain rose upon the second revolution  the attack on spirito santo and the capitulation and departure of the troops speedily followed genoa was in the hands of the republicans and now came a time when the english residents were in a position to pay some return for hospitality received nor were they backward our consul the same who had the benefit of correction from fleeming carried the intendente on board the vengeance escorting him through the streets getting along with him on board a shore boat and when the insurgents levelled their muskets standing up and naming himself console inglese a friend of the jenkins captain glynne had a more painful if a less dramatic part one colonel nosozzo had been killed i read while trying to prevent his own artillery from firing on the mob but in that hells caldron of a distracted city there were no distinctions made and the colonels widow was hunted for her life in her grief and peril the glynnes received and hid her captain glynne sought and found her husbands body among the slain saved it for two days brought the widow a lock of the dead mans hair but at last the mob still strictly searching seems to have abandoned the body and conveyed his guest on board the vengeance the jenkins also had their refugees the family of an employé threatened by a decree you should have seen me making a union jack to nail over our door writes mrs jenkin i never worked so fast in my life monday and tuesday she continues were tolerably quiet our hearts beating fast in the hope of la marmoras approach the streets barricaded and none but foreigners and women allowed to leave the city on wednesday la marmora came indeed but in the ugly form of a bombardment and that evening the jenkins sat without lights about their drawingroom window watching the huge red flashes of the cannon from the brigato and la specula forts and hearkening not without some awful pleasure to the thunder of the cannonade  lord hardwicke intervened between the rebels and la marmora and there followed a troubled armistice filled with the voice of panic now the vengeance was known to be cleared for action now it was rumoured that the galleyslaves were to be let loose upon the town and now that the troops would enter it by storm crowds trusting in the union jack over the jenkins door came to beg them to receive their linen and other valuables nor could their instances be refused and in the midst of all this bustle and alarm piles of goods must be examined and long inventories made at last the captain decided things had gone too far he himself apparently remained to watch over the linen but at five oclock on the sunday morning aunt anna fleeming and his mother were rowed in a pour of rain on board an english merchantman to suffer nine mortal hours of agonising suspense with the end of that time peace was restored on tuesday morning officers with white flags appeared on the bastions then regiment by regiment the troops marched in two hundred men sleeping on the ground floor of the jenkins house thirty thousand in all entering the city but without disturbance old la marmora being a commander of a roman sternness  with the return of quiet and the reopening of the universities we behold a new character signor flaminio the professors it appears made no attempt upon the jenkin and thus readily italianised the fleeming he came well recommended for their friend ruffini was then or soon after raised to be the head of the university and the professors were very kind and attentive possibly to ruffinis protégé perhaps also to the first protestant student it was no joke for signor flaminio at first certificates had to be got from paris and from rector williams the classics must be furbished up at home that he might follow latin lectures examinations bristled in the path the entrance examination with latin and english essay and oral trials much softened for the foreigner in horace tacitus and cicero and the first university examination only three months later in italian eloquence no less and other wider subjects on one point the first protestant student was moved to thank his stars that there was no greek required for the degree little did he think as he set down his gratitude how much in later life and among cribs and dictionaries he was to lament this circumstance nor how much of that later life he was to spend acquiring with infinite toil a shadow of what he might then have got with ease and fully but if his genoese education was in this particular imperfect he was fortunate in the branches that more immediately touched on his career the physical laboratory was the best mounted in italy bancalari the professor of natural philosophy was famous in his day by what seems even an odd coincidence he went deeply into electromagnetism and it was principally in that subject that signor flaminio questioned in latin and answering in italian passed his master of arts degree with firstclass honours that he had secured the notice of his teachers one circumstance sufficiently proves a philosophical society was started under the presidency of mamiani one of the examiners and one of the leaders of the moderate party and out of five promising students brought forward by the professors to attend the sittings and present essays signor flaminio was one i cannot find that he ever read an essay and indeed i think his hands were otherwise too full he found his fellowstudents not such a bad set of chaps and preferred the piedmontese before the genoese but i suspect he mixed not very freely with either not only were his days filled with university work but his spare hours were fully dedicated to the arts under the eye of a beloved taskmistress he worked hard and well in the art school where he obtained a silver medal for a couple of legs the size of life drawn from one of raphaels cartoons his holidays were spent in sketching his evenings when they were free at the theatre here at the opera he discovered besides a taste for a new art the art of music and it was he wrote as if he had found out a heaven on earth i am so anxious that whatever he professes to know he should really perfectly possess his mother wrote that i spare no pains neither to him nor to myself she might have added and so when he begged to be allowed to learn the piano she started him with characteristic barbarity on the scales and heard in consequence heartrending groans and saw anguished claspings of hands as he lost his way among their arid intricacies  in this picture of the lad at the piano there is something for the period girlish he was indeed his mothers boy and it was fortunate his mother was not altogether feminine she gave her son a womanly delicacy in morals to a mans tasteto his own taste in later lifetoo finely spun and perhaps more elegant than healthful she encouraged him besides in drawingroom interests but in other points her influence was manlike filled with the spirit of thoroughness she taught him to make of the least of these accomplishments a virile task and the teaching lasted him through life immersed as she was in the days movements and buzzed about by leading liberals she handed on to him her creed in politics an enduring kindness for italy and a loyalty like that of many clever women to the liberal party with but small regard to men or measures this attitude of mind used often to disappoint me in a man so fond of logic but i see now how it was learned from the bright eyes of his mother and to the sound of the cannonades of 1848 to some of her defects besides she made him heir kind as was the bond that united her to her son kind and even pretty she was scarce a woman to adorn a home loving as she did to shine careless as she was of domestic studious of public graces she probably rejoiced to see the boy grow up in somewhat of the image of herself generous excessive enthusiastic external catching at ideas brandishing them when caught fiery for the right but always fiery ready at fifteen to correct a consul ready at fifty to explain to any artist his own art  the defects and advantages of such a training were obvious in fleeming throughout life his thoroughness was not that of the patient scholar but of an untrained woman with fits of passionate study he had learned too much from dogma given indeed by cherished lips and precocious as he was in the use of the tools of the mind he was truly backward in knowledge of life and of himself such as it was at least his home and school training was now complete and you are to conceive the lad as being formed in a household of meagre revenue among foreign surroundings and under the influence of an imperious drawingroom queen from whom he learned a great refinement of morals a strong sense of duty much forwardness of bearing all manner of studious and artistic interests and many readymade opinions which he embraced with a sons and a disciples loyalty       chapter iii    18511858     return to englandfleeming at fairbairnsexperience in a    strikedr bell and greek architecturethe gaskellsfleeming at    greenwichthe austinsfleeming and the austinshis    engagementfleeming and sir w thomson   in 1851 the year of aunt annas death the family left genoa and came to manchester where fleeming was entered in fairbairns works as an apprentice from the palaces and alps the mole the blue mediterranean the humming lanes and the bright theatres of genoa he felland he was sharply conscious of the fallto the dim skies and the foul ways of manchester england he found on his return a horrid place and there is no doubt the family found it a dear one the story of the jenkin finances is not easy to follow the family i am told did not practise frugality only lamented that it should be needful and mrs jenkin who was always complaining of those dreadful bills was always a good deal dressed but at this time of the return to england things must have gone further a holiday tour of a fortnight fleeming feared would be beyond what he could afford and he only projected it to have a castle in the air and there were actual pinches fresh from a warmer sun he was obliged to go without a greatcoat and learned on railway journeys to supply the place of one with wrappings of old newspaper  from halfpast eight till six he must file and chip vigorously in a moleskin suit and infernally dirty the work was not new to him for he had already passed some time in a genoese shop and to fleeming no work was without interest whatever a man can do or know he longed to know and do also i never learned anything he wrote not even standing on my head but i found a use for it in the spare hours of his first telegraph voyage to give an instance of his greed of knowledge he meant to learn the whole art of navigation every rope in the ship and how to handle her on any occasion and once when he was shown a young ladys holiday collection of seaweeds he must cry out it showed me my eyes had been idle nor was his the case of the mere literary smatterer content if he but learn the names of things in him to do and to do well was even a dearer ambition than to know anything done well any craft despatch or finish delighted and inspired him i remember him with a twopenny japanese box of three drawers so exactly fitted that when one was driven home the others started from their places the whole spirit of japan he told me was pictured in that box that plain piece of carpentry was as much inspired by the spirit of perfection as the happiest drawing or the finest bronze and he who could not enjoy it in the one was not fully able to enjoy it in the others thus too he found in leonardos engineering and anatomical drawings a perpetual feast and of the former he spoke even with emotion nothing indeed annoyed fleeming more than the attempt to separate the fine arts from the arts of handicraft any definition or theory that failed to bring these two together according to him had missed the point and the essence of the pleasure received lay in seeing things well done other qualities must be added he was the last to deny that but this of perfect craft was at the bottom of all and on the other hand a nail ill driven a joint ill fitted a tracing clumsily done anything to which a man had set his hand and not set it aptly moved him to shame and anger with such a character he would feel but little drudgery at fairbairns there would be something daily to be done slovenliness to be avoided and a higher mark of skill to be attained he would chip and file as he had practised scales impatient of his own imperfection but resolute to learn  and there was another spring of delight for he was now moving daily among those strange creations of mans brain to some so abhorrent to him of an interest so inexhaustible in which iron water and fire are made to serve as slaves now with a tread more powerful than an elephants and now with a touch more precise and dainty than a pianists the taste for machinery was one that i could never share with him and he had a certain bitter pity for my weakness once when i had proved for the hundredth time the depth of this defect he looked at me askance and the best of the joke said he is that he thinks himself quite a poet for to him the struggle of the engineer against brute forces and with inert allies was nobly poetic habit never dulled in him the sense of the greatness of the aims and obstacles of his profession habit only sharpened his inventors gusto in contrivance in triumphant artifice in the odyssean subtleties by which wires are taught to speak and iron hands to weave and the slender ship to brave and to outstrip the tempest to the ignorant the great results alone are admirable to the knowing and to fleeming in particular rather the infinite device and sleight of mind that made them possible  a notion was current at the time that in such a shop as fairbairns a pupil would never be popular unless he drank with the workmen and imitated them in speech and manner fleeming who would do none of these things they accepted as a friend and companion and this was the subject of remark in manchester where some memory of it lingers till today he thought it one of the advantages of his profession to be brought in a close relation with the working classes and for the skilled artisan he had a great esteem liking his company his virtues and his taste in some of the arts but he knew the classes too well to regard them like a platform speaker in a lump he drew on the other hand broad distinctions and it was his profound sense of the difference between one working man and another that led him to devote so much time in later days to the furtherance of technical education in 1852 he had occasion to see both men and masters at their worst in the excitement of a strike and very foolishly after their custom both would seem to have behaved beginning with a fair show of justice on either side the masters stultified their cause by obstinate impolicy and the men disgraced their order by acts of outrage on wednesday last writes fleeming about three thousand banded round fairbairns door at 6 oclock men women and children factory boys and girls the lowest of the low in a very low place orders came that no one was to leave the works but the men inside knobsticks as they are called were precious hungry and thought they would venture two of my companions and myself went out with the very first and had the full benefit of every possible groan and bad language but the police cleared a lane through the crowd the pupils were suffered to escape unhurt and only the knobsticks followed home and kicked with clogs so that fleeming enjoyed as we may say for nothing that fine thrill of expectant valour with which he had sallied forth into the mob i never before felt myself so decidedly somebody instead of nobody he wrote  outside as inside the works he was pretty merry and welltodo zealous in study welcome to many friends unwearied in lovingkindness to his mother for some time he spent three nights a week with dr bell working away at certain geometrical methods of getting the greek architectural proportions a business after fleemings heart for he was never so pleased as when he could marry his two devotions art and science this was besides in all likelihood the beginning of that love and intimate appreciation of things greek from the least to the greatest from the agamemnon perhaps his favourite tragedy down to the details of grecian tailoring which he used to express in his familiar phrase the greeks were the boys dr bellthe son of george joseph the nephew of sir charles and though he made less use of it than some a sharer in the distinguished talents of his racehad hit upon the singular fact that certain geometrical intersections gave the proportions of the doric order fleeming under dr bells direction applied the same method to the other orders and again found the proportions accurately given numbers of diagrams were prepared but the discovery was never given to the world perhaps because of the dissensions that arose between the authors for dr bell believed that these intersections were in some way connected with or symbolical of the antagonistic forces at work but his pupil and helper with characteristic trenchancy brushed aside this mysticism and interpreted the discovery as a geometrical method of dividing the spaces or as might be said of setting out the work purely empirical and in no way connected with any laws of either force or beauty many a hard and pleasant fight we had over it wrote jenkin in later years and impertinent as it may seem the pupil is still unconvinced by the arguments of the master i do not know about the antagonistic forces in the doric order in fleeming they were plain enough and the bobadil of these affairs with dr bell was still like the corrector of italian consuls a great child in everything but information at the house of colonel cleather he might be seen with a family of children and with these there was no word of the greek orders with these fleeming was only an uproarious boy and an entertaining draughtsman so that his coming was the signal for the young people to troop into the playroom where sometimes the roof rang with romping and sometimes they gathered quietly about him as he amused them with his pencil  in another manchester family whose name will be familiar to my readersthat of the gaskellsfleeming was a frequent visitor to mrs gaskell he would often bring his new ideas a process that many of his later friends will understand and in their own cases remember with the girls he had constant fierce wrangles forcing them to reason out their thoughts and to explain their prepossessions and i hear from miss gaskell that they used to wonder how he could throw all the ardour of his character into the smallest matters and to admire his unselfish devotion to his parents of one of these wrangles i have found a record most characteristic of the man fleeming had been laying down his doctrine that the end justifies the means and that it is quite right to boast of your six menservants to a burglar or to steal a knife to prevent a murder and the miss gaskells with girlish loyalty to what is current had rejected the heresy with indignation from such passagesatarms many retire mortified and ruffled but fleeming had no sooner left the house than he fell into delighted admiration of the spirit of his adversaries from that it was but a step to ask himself what truth was sticking in their heads for even the falsest form of words in fleemings lifelong opinion reposed upon some truth just as he could not even allow that people admire ugly things they admire what is pretty in the ugly thing and before he sat down to write his letter he thought he had hit upon the explanation i fancy the true idea he wrote is that you must never do yourself or any one else a moral injurymake any man a thief or a liarfor any end quite a different thing as he would have loved to point out from never stealing or lying but this perfervid disputant was not always out of key with his audience one whom he met in the same house announced that she would never again be happy what does that signify cried fleeming we are not here to be happy but to be good and the words as his hearer writes to me became to her a sort of motto during life  from fairbairns and manchester fleeming passed to a railway survey in switzerland and thence again to mr penns at greenwich where he was engaged as draughtsman there in 1856 we find him in a terribly busy state finishing up engines for innumerable gunboats and steam frigates for the ensuing campaign from halfpast eight in the morning till nine or ten at night he worked in a crowded office among uncongenial comrades saluted by chaff generally low personal and not witty pelted with oranges and apples regaled with dirty stories and seeking to suit himself with his surroundings or as he writes it trying to be as little like himself as possible his lodgings were hard by across a dirty green and through some halfbuilt streets of twostoried houses he had carlyle and the poets engineering and mathematics to study by himself in such spare time as remained to him and there were several ladies young and not so young with whom he liked to correspond but not all of these could compensate for the absence of that mother who had made herself so large a figure in his life for sorry surroundings unsuitable society and work that leaned to the mechanical sunday says he i generally visit some friends in town and seem to swim in clearer water but the dirty green seems all the dirtier when i get back luckily i am fond of my profession or i could not stand this life it is a question in my mind if he could have long continued to stand it without loss we are not here to be happy but to be good quoth the young philosopher but no man had a keener appetite for happiness than fleeming jenkin there is a time of life besides when apart from circumstances few men are agreeable to their neighbours and still fewer to themselves and it was at this stage that fleeming had arrived later than common and even worse provided the letter from which i have quoted is the last of his correspondence with frank scott and his last confidential letter to one of his own sex if you consider it rightly he wrote long after you will find the want of correspondence no such strange want in mens friendships there is believe me something noble in the metal which does not rust though not burnished by daily use it is well said but the last letter to frank scott is scarcely of a noble metal it is plain the writer has outgrown his old self yet not made acquaintance with the new this letter from a busy youth of threeandtwenty breathes of seventeen the sickening alternations of conceit and shame the expense of hope in vacuo the lack of friends the longing after love the whole world of egoism under which youth stands groaning a voluntary atlas  with fleeming this disease was never seemingly severe the very day before this to me distasteful letter he had written to miss bell of manchester in a sweeter strain i do not quote the one i quote the other fair things are the best i keep my own little lodgings he writes but come up every night to see mamma who was then on a visit to london if not kept too late at the works and have singinglessons once more and sing donne lamore è scaltro pargoletto and think and talk about you and listen to mammas projects de stowting everything turns to gold at her touchshes a fairy and no mistake we go on talking till i have a picture in my head and can hardly believe at the end the original is stowting even you dont know half how good mamma is in other things too which i must not mention she teaches me how it is not necessary to be very rich to do much good i begin to understand that mamma would find useful occupation and create beauty at the bottom of a volcano she has little weaknesses but is a real generoushearted woman which i suppose is the finest thing in the world though neither mother nor son could be called beautiful they make a pretty picture the ugly generous ardent woman weaving rainbow illusions the ugly clearsighted loving son sitting at her side in one of his rare hours of pleasure halfbeguiled halfamused wholly admiring as he listens but as he goes home and the fancy pictures fade and stowting is once more burthened with debt and the noisy companions and the long hours of drudgery once more approach no wonder if the dirty green seems all the dirtier or if atlas must resume his load  but in healthy natures this time of moral teething passes quickly of itself and is easily alleviated by fresh interests and already in the letter to frank scott there are two words of hope his friends in london his love for his profession the last might have saved him for he was ere long to pass into a new sphere where all his faculties were to be tried and exercised and his life to be filled with interest and effort but it was not left to engineering another and more influential aim was to be set before him he must in any case have fallen in love in any case his love would have ruled his life and the question of choice was for the descendant of two such families a thing of paramount importance innocent of the world fiery generous devoted as he was the son of the wild jacksons and the facile jenkins might have been led far astray by one of those partialities that fill men at once with gratitude and wonder his choosing was directed well or are we to say that by a mans choice in marriage as by a crucial merit he deserves his fortune one thing at least reason may discern that a man but partly chooses he also partly forms his helpmate and he must in part deserve her or the treasure is but won for a moment to be lost fleeming chanced if you will and indeed all these opportunities are as random as blindmansbuff upon a wife who was worthy of him but he had the wit to know it the courage to wait and labour for his prize and the tenderness and chivalry that are required to keep such prizes precious upon this point he has himself written well as usual with fervent optimism but as usual in his own phrase with a truth sticking in his head  love he wrote is not an intuition of the person most suitable to us most required by us of the person with whom life flowers and bears fruit if this were so the chances of our meeting that person would be small indeed intuition would often fail the blindness of love would then be fatal as it is proverbial no love works differently and in its blindness lies its strength man and woman each strongly desires to be loved each opens to the other that heart of ideal aspirations which they have often hid till then each thus knowing the ideal of the other tries to fulfil that ideal each partially succeeds the greater the love the greater the success the nobler the idea of each the more durable the more beautiful the effect meanwhile the blindness of each to the others defects enables the transformation to proceed unobserved so that when the veil is withdrawn if it ever is and this i do not know neither knows that any change has occurred in the person whom they loved do not fear therefore i do not tell you that your friend will not change but as i am sure that her choice cannot be that of a man with a base ideal so i am sure the change will be a safe and a good one do not fear that anything you love will vanishhe must love it too  among other introductions in london fleeming had presented a letter from mrs gaskell to the alfred austins this was a family certain to interest a thoughtful young man alfred the youngest and least known of the austins had been a beautiful goldenhaired child petted and kept out of the way of both sport and study by a partial mother bred an attorney he had like both his brothers changed his way of life and was called to the bar when past thirty a commission of inquiry into the state of the poor in dorsetshire gave him an opportunity of proving his true talents and he was appointed a poor law inspector first at worcester next at manchester where he had to deal with the potato famine and the irish immigration of the forties and finally in london where he again distinguished himself during an epidemic of cholera he was then advanced to the permanent secretaryship of her majestys office of works and public buildings a position which he filled with perfect competence but with an extreme of modesty and on his retirement in 1868 he was made a companion of the bath while apprentice to a norwich attorney alfred austin was a frequent visitor in the house of mr barren a rallyingplace in those days of intellectual society edward barren the son of a rich saddler or leather merchant in the borough was a man typical of the time when he was a child he had once been patted on the head in his fathers shop by no less a man than samuel johnson as the doctor went round the borough canvassing for mr thrale and the child was true to this early consecration a life of lettered ease spent in provincial retirement it is thus that the biographer of that remarkable man william taylor announces his subject and the phrase is equally descriptive of the life of edward barron the pair were close friends w t and a pipe render everything agreeable writes barron in his diary in 1828 and in 1833 after barron had moved to london and taylor had tasted the first public failure of his powers the latter wrote to my ever dearest mr barron say if you please that i miss him more than i regret himthat i acquiesce in his retirement from norwich because i could ill brook his observation of my increasing debility of mind this chosen companion of william taylor must himself have been no ordinary man and he was the friend besides of borrow whom i find him helping in his latin but he had no desire for popular distinction lived privately married a daughter of dr enfield of enfields speaker and devoted his time to the education of his family in a deliberate and scholarly fashion and with certain traits of stoicism that would surprise a modern from these children we must single out his youngest daughter eliza who learned under his care to be a sound latin an elegant grecian and to suppress emotion without outward sign after the manner of the godwin school this was the more notable as the girl really derived from the enfields whose highflown romantic temper i wish i could find space to illustrate she was but seven years old when alfred austin remarked and fell in love with her and the union thus early prepared was singularly full where the husband and wife differed and they did so on momentous subjects they differed with perfect temper and content and in the conduct of life and in depth and durability of love they were at one each full of high spirits each practised something of the same repression no sharp word was uttered in their house the same point of honour ruled them a guest was sacred and stood within the pale from criticism it was a house besides of unusual intellectual tension mrs austin remembered in the early days of the marriage the three brothers john charles and alfred marching to and fro each with his hands behind his back and reasoning high till morning and how like dr johnson they would cheer their speculations with as many as fifteen cups of tea and though before the date of fleemings visit the brothers were separated charles long ago retired from the world at brandeston and john already near his end in the rambling old house at weybridge alfred austin and his wife were still a centre of much intellectual society and still as indeed they remained until the last youthfully alert in mind there was but one child of the marriage annie and she was herself something new for the eyes of the young visitor brought up as she had been like her mother before her to the standard of a mans acquirements only one art had she been denied she must not learn the violinthe thought was too monstrous even for the austins and indeed it would seem as if that tide of reform which we may date from the days of mary wollstonecraft had in some degree even receded for though miss austin was suffered to learn greek the accomplishment was kept secret like a piece of guilt but whether this stealth was caused by a backward movement in public thought since the time of edward barron or by the change from enlightened norwich to barbarian london i have no means of judging  when fleeming presented his letter he fell in love at first sight with mrs austin and the life and atmosphere of the house there was in the society of the austins outward stoical conformers to the world something gravely suggestive of essential eccentricity something unpretentiously breathing of intellectual effort that could not fail to hit the fancy of this hotbrained boy the unbroken enamel of courtesy the selfrestraint the dignified kindness of these married folk had besides a particular attraction for their visitor he could not but compare what he saw with what he knew of his mother and himself whatever virtues fleeming possessed he could never count on being civil whatever brave truehearted qualities he was able to admire in mrs jenkin mildness of demeanour was not one of them and here he found persons who were the equals of his mother and himself in intellect and width of interest and the equals of his father in mild urbanity of disposition show fleeming an active virtue and he always loved it he went away from that house struck through with admiration and vowing to himself that his own married life should be upon that pattern his wife whoever she might be like eliza barron himself such another husband as alfred austin what is more strange he not only brought away but left behind him golden opinions he must have beenhe was i am tolda trying lad but there shone out of him such a light of innocent candour enthusiasm intelligence and appreciation that to persons already some way forward in years and thus able to enjoy indulgently the perennial comedy of youth the sight of him was delightful by a pleasant coincidence there was one person in the house whom he did not appreciate and who did not appreciate him annie austin his future wife his boyish vanity ruffled her his appearance never impressive was then by reason of obtrusive boyishness still less so she found occasion to put him in the wrong by correcting a false quantity and when mr austin after doing his visitor the almost unheardof honour of accompanying him to the door announced that was what young men were like in my timeshe could only reply looking on her handsome father i thought they had been betterlooking  this first visit to the austins took place in 1855 and it seems it was some time before fleeming began to know his mind and yet longer ere he ventured to show it the corrected quantity to those who knew him well will seem to have played its part he was the man always to reflect over a correction and to admire the castigator and fall in love he did not hurriedly but step by step not blindly but with critical discrimination not in the fashion of romeo but before he was done with all romeos ardour and more than romeos faith the high favour to which he presently rose in the esteem of alfred austin and his wife might well give him ambitious notions but the poverty of the present and the obscurity of the future were there to give him pause and when his aspirations began to settle round miss austin he tasted perhaps for the only time in his life the pangs of diffidence there was indeed opening before him a wide door of hope he had changed into the service of messrs liddell and gordon these gentlemen had begun to dabble in the new field of marine telegraphy and fleeming was already face to face with his lifes work that impotent sense of his own value as of a ship aground which makes one of the agonies of youth began to fall from him new problems which he was endowed to solve vistas of new inquiry which he was fitted to explore opened before him continually his gifts had found their avenue and goal and with this pleasure of effective exercise there must have sprung up at once the hope of what is called by the world success but from these low beginnings it was a far look upward to miss austin the favour of the loved one seems always more than problematical to any lover the consent of parents must be always more than doubtful to a young man with a small salary and no capital except capacity and hope but fleeming was not the lad to lose any good thing for the lack of trial and at length in the autumn of 1857 this boyishsized boyishmannered and superlatively illdressed young engineer entered the house of the austins with such sinkings as we may fancy and asked leave to pay his addresses to the daughter mrs austin already loved him like a son she was but too glad to give him her consent mr austin reserved the right to inquire into his character from neither was there a word about his prospects by neither was his income mentioned are these people he wrote struck with wonder at this dignified disinterestedness are these people the same as other people it was not till he was armed with this permission that miss austin even suspected the nature of his hopes so strong in this unmannerly boy was the principle of true courtesy so powerful in this impetuous nature the springs of selfrepression and yet a boy he was a boy in heart and mind and it was with a boys chivalry and frankness that he won his wife his conduct was a model of honour hardly of tact to conceal love from the loved one to court her parents to be silent and discreet till these are won and then without preparation to approach the ladythese are not arts that i would recommend for imitation they lead to final refusal nothing saved fleeming from that fate but one circumstance that cannot be counted uponthe hearty favour of the mother and one gift that is inimitable and that never failed him throughout life the gift of a nature essentially noble and outspoken a happy and highminded anger flashed through his despair it won for him his wife  nearly two years passed before it was possible to marry two years of activitynow in london now at birkenhead fitting out ships inventing new machinery for new purposes and dipping into electrical experiment now in the elba on his first telegraph cruise between sardinia and algiers a busy and delightful period of bounding ardour incessant toil growing hope and fresh interests with behind and through all the image of his beloved a few extracts from his correspondence with his betrothed will give the note of these truly joyous years my profession gives me all the excitement and interest i ever hope for but the sorry jade is obviously jealous of youpoor fleeming in spite of wet cold and wind clambering over moist tarry slips wandering among pools of slush in waste places inhabited by wandering locomotives grows visibly stronger has dismissed his office cough and cured his toothachethe whole of the paying out and lifting machinery must be designed and ordered in two or three days and i am half crazy with work i like it though its like a good ball the excitement carries you throughi was running to and from the ships and warehouse through fierce gusts of rain and wind till near eleven and you cannot think what a pleasure it was to be blown about and think of you in your pretty dressi am at the works till ten and sometimes eleven but i have a nice office to sit in with a fire to myself and bright brass scientific instruments all round me and books to read and experiments to make and enjoy myself amazingly i find the study of electricity so entertaining that i am apt to neglect my other work and for a last taste yesterday i had some charming electrical experiments what shall i compare them toa new song a greek play  it was at this time besides that he made the acquaintance of professor now sir william thomson23 to describe the part played by these two in each others lives would lie out of my way they worked together on the committee on electrical standards they served together at the laying down or the repair of many deepsea cables and sir william was regarded by fleeming not only with the worship the word is his own due to great scientific gifts but with an ardour of personal friendship not frequently excelled to their association fleeming brought the valuable element of a practical understanding but he never thought or spoke of himself where sir william was in question and i recall quite in his last days a singular instance of this modest loyalty to one whom he admired and loved he drew up a paper in a quite personal interest of his own services yet even here he must step out of his way he must add where it had no claim to be added his opinion that in their joint work the contributions of sir william had been always greatly the most valuable again i shall not readily forget with what emotion he once told me an incident of their associated travels on one of the mountain ledges of madeira fleemings pony bolted between sir william and the precipice above by strange good fortune and thanks to the steadiness of sir williams horse no harm was done but for the moment fleeming saw his friend hurled into the sea and almost by his own act it was a memory that haunted him   footnote    23 afterwards lord kelvined       chapter iv    18591868     fleemings

four days fleeming was married to miss austin at northiam a place connected not only with his own family but with that of his bride as well by tuesday morning he was at work again fitting out cableships at birkenhead of the walk from his lodgings to the works i find a graphic sketch in one of his letters out over the railway bridge along a wide road raised to the level of a ground floor above the land which not being built upon harbours puddles ponds pigs and irish hovelsso to the dock warehouses four huge piles of building with no windows surrounded by a wall about twelve feet highin through the large gates round which hang twenty or thirty rusty irish playing pitch and toss and waiting for employmenton along the railway which came in at the same gates and which branches down between each vast blockpast a pilotengine butting refractory trucks into their placeson to the last block and down the branch sniffing the guanoscented air and detecting the old bones the hartshorn flavour of the guano becomes very strong as i near the docks where across the elbas decks a huge vessel is discharging her cargo of the brown dust and where huge vessels have been discharging that same cargo for the last five months this was the walk he took his young wife on the morrow of his return she had been used to the society of lawyers and civil servants moving in that circle which seems to itself the pivot of the nation and is in truth only a clique like another and fleeming was to her the nameless assistant of a nameless firm of engineers doing his inglorious business as she now saw for herself among unsavoury surroundings but when their walk brought them within view of the river she beheld a sight to her of the most novel beauty four great seagoing ships dressed out with flags how lovely she cried what is it for for you said fleeming her surprise was only equalled by her pleasure but perhaps for what we may call private fame there is no life like that of the engineer who is a great man in outoftheway places by the dockside or on the desert island or in populous ships and remains quite unheard of in the coteries of london and fleeming had already made his mark among the few who had an opportunity of knowing him  his marriage was the one decisive incident of his career from that moment until the day of his death he had one thought to which all the rest were tributary the thought of his wife no one could know him even slightly and not remark the absorbing greatness of that sentiment nor can any picture of the man be drawn that does not in proportion dwell upon it this is a delicate task but if we are to leave behind us as we wish some presentment of the friend we have lost it is a task that must be undertaken  for all his play of mind and fancy for all his indulgenceand as time went on he grew indulgentfleeming had views of duty that were even stern he was too shrewd a student of his fellowmen to remain long content with rigid formulæ of conduct ironbound impersonal ethics the procrustean bed of rules he soon saw at their true value as the deification of averages as to miss i declare i forget her name being bad i find him writing people only mean that she has broken the decaloguewhich is not at all the same thing people who have kept in the high road of life really have less opportunity for taking a comprehensive view of it than those who have leaped over the hedges and strayed up the hills not but what the hedges are very necessary and our stray travellers often have a weary time of it so you may say have those in the dusty roads yet he was himself a very stern respecter of the hedgerows sought safety and found dignity in the obvious path of conduct and would palter with no simple and recognised duty of his epoch of marriage in particular of the bond so formed of the obligations incurred of the debt men owe to their children he conceived in a truly antique spirit not to blame others but to constrain himself it was not to blame i repeat that he held these views for others he could make a large allowance and yet he tacitly expected of his friends and his wife a high standard of behaviour nor was it always easy to wear the armour of that ideal  acting upon these beliefs conceiving that he had indeed given himself in the full meaning of these words for better for worse painfully alive to his defects of temper and deficiency in charm resolute to make up for these thinking last of himself fleeming was in some ways the very man to have made a noble uphill fight of an unfortunate marriage in other ways it is true he was one of the most unfit for such a trial and it was his beautiful destiny to remain to the last hour the same absolute and romantic lover who had shown to his new bride the flagdraped vessels in the mersey no fate is altogether easy but trials are our touchstone trials overcome our reward and it was given to fleeming to conquer it was given to him to live for another not as a task but till the end as an enchanting pleasure people may write novels he wrote in 1869 and other people may write poems but not a man or woman among them can write to say how happy a man may be who is desperately in love with his wife after ten years of marriage and again in 1885 after more than twentysix years of marriage and within but five weeks of his death your first letter from bournemouth he wrote gives me heavenly pleasurefor which i thank heaven and you toowho are my heaven on earth the mind hesitates whether to say that such a man has been more good or more fortunate  any woman it is the defect of her sex comes sooner to the stable mind of maturity than any man and jenkin was to the end of a most deliberate growth in the next chapter when i come to deal with his telegraphic voyages and give some taste of his correspondence the reader will still find him at twentyfive an arrant schoolboy his wife besides was more thoroughly educated than he in many ways she was able to teach him and he proud to be taught in many ways she outshone him and he delighted to be outshone all these superiorities and others that after the manner of lovers he no doubt forged for himself added as time went on to the humility of his original love only once in all i know of his career did he show a touch of smallness he could not learn to sing correctly his wife told him so and desisted from her lessons and the mortification was so sharply felt that for years he could not be induced to go to a concert instanced himself as a typical man without an ear and never sang again i tell it for the fact that this stood singular in his behaviour and really amazed all who knew him is the happiest way i can imagine to commend the tenor of his simplicity and because it illustrates his feeling for his wife others were always welcome to laugh at him if it amused them or if it amused him he would proceed undisturbed with his occupation his vanity invulnerable with his wife it was different his wife had laughed at his singing and for twenty years the fibre ached nothing again was more notable than the formal chivalry of this unmannered man to the person on earth with whom he was the most familiar he was conscious of his own innate and often rasping vivacity and roughness and he was never forgetful of his first visit to the austins and the vow he had registered on his return there was thus an artificial element in his punctilio that at times might almost raise a smile but it stood on noble grounds for this was how he sought to shelter from his own petulance the woman who was to him the symbol of the household and to the end the beloved of his youth  i wish in this chapter to chronicle small beer taking a hasty glance at some ten years of married life and of professional struggle and reserving till the next all the more interesting matter of his cruises of his achievements and their worth it is not for me to speak his friend and partner sir william thomson has contributed a note on the subject to which i must refer the reader24 he is to conceive in the meanwhile for himself fleemings manifold engagements his service on the committee on electrical standards his lectures on electricity at chatham his chair at the london university his partnership with sir william thomson and mr varley in many ingenious patents his growing credit with engineers and men of science and he is to bear in mind that of all this activity and acquist of reputation the immediate profit was scanty soon after his marriage fleeming had left the service of messrs liddell and gordon and entered into a general engineering partnership with mr forde a gentleman in a good way of business it was a fortunate partnership in this that the parties retained their mutual respect unlessened and separated with regret but mens affairs like men have their times of sickness and by one of those unaccountable variations for hard upon ten years the business was disappointing and the profits meagre inditing drafts of german railways which will never get made it is thus i find fleeming not without a touch of bitterness describe his occupation even the patents hung fire at first there was no salary to rely on children were coming and growing up the prospect was often anxious in the days of his courtship fleeming had written to miss austin a dissuasive picture of the trials of poverty assuring her these were no figments but truly bitter to support he told her this he wrote beforehand so that when the pinch came and she suffered she should not be disappointed in herself nor tempted to doubt her own magnanimity a letter of admirable wisdom and solicitude but now that the trouble came he bore it very lightly it was his principle as he once prettily expressed it to enjoy each days happiness as it arises like birds or children his optimism if driven out at the door would come in again by the window if it found nothing but blackness in the present would hit upon some ground of consolation in the future or the past and his courage and energy were indefatigable in the year 1863 soon after the birth of their first son they moved into a cottage at claygate near esher and about this time under manifold troubles both of money and health i find him writing from abroad the country will give us please god health and strength i will love and cherish you more than ever you shall go where you wish you shall receive whom you wishand as for money you shall have that too i cannot be mistaken i have now measured myself with many men i do not feel weak i do not feel that i shall fail in many things i have succeeded and i will in this and meanwhile the time of waiting which please heaven shall not be long shall also not be so bitter well well i promise much and do not know at this moment how you and the dear child are if he is but better courage my girl for i see light  this cottage at claygate stood just without the village well surrounded with trees and commanding a pleasant view a piece of the garden was turfed over to form a croquetgreen and fleeming became i need scarce say a very ardent player he grew ardent too in gardening this he took up at first to please his wife having no natural inclination but he had no sooner set his hand to it than like everything else he touched it became with him a passion he budded roses he potted cuttings in the coachhouse if there came a change of weather at night he would rise out of bed to protect his favourites when he was thrown with a dull companion it was enough for him to discover in the man a fellowgardener on his travels he would go out of his way to visit nurseries and gather hints and to the end of his life after other occupations prevented him putting his own hand to the spade he drew up a yearly programme for his gardener in which all details were regulated he had begun by this time to write his paper on darwin which had the merit of convincing on one point the philosopher himself had indeed been written before this in london lodgings but his pen was not idle at claygate and it was here he wrote among other things that review of fecundity fertility sterility and allied topics which dr matthews duncan prefixed by way of introduction to the second edition of the work the mere act of writing seems to cheer the vanity of the most incompetent but a correction accepted by darwin and a whole review borrowed and reprinted by matthews duncan are compliments of a rare strain and to a man still unsuccessful must have been precious indeed there was yet a third of the same kind in store for him and when munro himself owned that he had found instruction in the paper on lucretius we may say that fleeming had been crowned in the capitol of reviewing  croquet charades christmas magic lanterns for the village children an amateur concert or a review article in the evening plenty of hard work by day regular visits to meetings of the british association from one of which i find him characteristically writing i cannot say that i have had any amusement yet but i am enjoying the dulness and dry bustle of the whole thing occasional visits abroad on business when he would find the time to glean as i have said gardening hints for himself and old folksongs or new fashions of dress for his wife and the continual study and care of his children these were the chief elements of his life nor were friends wanting captain and mrs jenkin mr and mrs austin clerk maxwell miss bell of manchester and others came to them on visits mr hertslet of the foreign office his wife and his daughter were neighbours and proved kind friends in 1867 the howitts came to claygate and sought the society of the two bright clever young people25 and in a house close by mr frederick ricketts came to live with his family mr ricketts was a valued friend during his short life and when he was lost with every circumstance of heroism in the la plata fleeming mourned him sincerely  i think i shall give the best idea of fleeming in this time of his early married life by a few sustained extracts from his letters to his wife while she was absent on a visit in 1864    nov 11sunday was too wet to walk to isleworth for which i was   sorry so i stayed and went to church and thought of you at ardwick   all through the commandments and heard dr  expound in a   remarkable way a prophecy of st paul about roman catholics which   mutatis mutandis would do very well for protestants in some parts   then i made a little nursery of borecole and enfield market cabbage   grubbing in wet earth with leggings and grey coat on then i tidied up   the coachhouse to my own and christines admiration then encouraged   by boutsrimés i wrote you a copy of verses high time i think i   shall just save my tenth year of knowing my lady love without inditing   poetry or rhymes to her    then i rummaged over the box with my fathers letters and found   interesting notes from myself one i should say my first letter which   little austin i should say would rejoice to see and shall seewith a   drawing of a cottage and a spirited cob what was more to the   purpose i found with it a pastecutter which mary begged humbly for   christine and i generously gave this morning    then i read some of congreve there are admirable scenes in the   manner of sheridan all wit and no character or rather one character   in a great variety of situations and scenes i could show you some   scenes but others are too coarse even for my stomach hardened by a   course of french novels    all things look so happy for the rain    nov 16verbenas looking well i am but a poor creature   without you i have naturally no spirit or fun or enterprise in me   only a kind of mechanical capacity for ascertaining whether two really   is half four etc but when you are near me i can fancy that i too   shine and vainly suppose it to be my proper light whereas by my   extreme darkness when you are not by it clearly can only be by a   reflected brilliance that i seem aught but dull then for the moral   part of me if it were not for you and little odden i should feel by   no means sure that i had any affection power in me even the   muscular me suffers a sad deterioration in your absence i dont get   up when i ought to i have snoozed in my chair after dinner i do not   go in at the garden with my wonted vigour and feel ten times as tired   as usual with a walk in your absence so you see when you are not by   i am a person without ability affections or vigour but droop dull   selfish and spiritless can you wonder that i love you    nov 17 i am very glad we married young i would not have   missed these five yearsno not for any hopes they are my own    nov 30i got through my chatham lecture very fairly though   almost all my apparatus went astray i dined at the mess and got home   to isleworth the same evening your father very kindly sitting up for   me    dec 1back at dear claygate many cuttings flourish especially   those which do honour to your hand your californian annuals are up   and about badger is fat the grass green    dec 3odden will not talk of you while you are away having   inherited as i suspect his fathers way of declining to consider a   subject which is painful as your absence is i certainly should   like to learn greek and i think it would be a capital pastime for the   long winter evenings how things are misrated i declare croquet is   a noble occupation compared to the pursuits of business men as for   socalled idlenessthat is one form of iti vow it is the noblest   aim of man when idle one can love one can be good feel kindly to   all devote oneself to others be thankful for existence educate   ones mind ones heart ones body when busy as i am busy now or   have been busy today one feels just as you sometimes felt when you   were too busy owing to want of servants    dec 5on sunday i was at isleworth chiefly engaged in playing   with odden we had the most enchanting walk together through the   brickfields it was very muddy and as he remarked not fit for   nanna but fit for us men the dreary waste of bared earth thatched   sheds and standing water was a paradise to him and when we walked up   planks to deserted mixing and crushing mills and actually saw where   the clay was stirred with long iron prongs and chalk or lime ground   with a tind of a mill his expression of contentment and triumphant   heroism knew no limit to its beauty of course on returning i found   mrs austin looking out at the door in an anxious manner and thinking   we had been out quite long enough i am reading don quixote   chiefly and am his fervent admirer but i am so sorry he did not   place his affections on a dulcinea of somewhat worthier stamp in fact   i think there must be a mistake about it don quixote might and would   serve his lady in most preposterous fashion but i am sure he would   have chosen a lady of merit he imagined her to be such no doubt   and drew a charming picture of her occupations by the banks of the   river but in his other imaginations there was some kind of peg on   which to hang the false costumes he created windmills are big and   wave their arms like giants sheep in the distance are somewhat like   an army a little boat on the riverside must look much the same   whether enchanted or belonging to millers but except that dulcinea is   a woman she bears no resemblance at all to the damsel of his   imagination  at the time of these letters the oldest son only was born to them in september of the next year with the birth of the second charles frewen there befell fleeming a terrible alarm and what proved to be a lifelong misfortune mrs jenkin was taken suddenly and alarmingly ill fleeming ran a matter of two miles to fetch the doctor and drenched with sweat as he was returned with him at once in an open gig on their arrival at the house mrs jenkin half unconsciously took and kept hold of her husbands hand by the doctors orders windows and doors were set open to create a thorough draught and the patient was on no account to be disturbed thus then did fleeming pass the whole of that night crouching on the floor in the draught and not daring to move lest he should wake the sleeper he had never been strong energy had stood him in stead of vigour and the result of that nights exposure was flying rheumatism varied with settled sciatica sometimes it quite disabled him sometimes it was less acute but he was rarely free from it until his death i knew him for many years for more than ten we were closely intimate i have lived with him for weeks and during all this time he only once referred to his infirmity and then perforce as an excuse for some trouble he put me to and so slightly worded that i paid no heed this is a good measure of his courage under sufferings of which none but the untried will think lightly and i think it worth noting how this optimist was acquainted with pain it will seem strange only to the superficial the disease of pessimism springs never from real troubles which it braces men to bear which it delights men to bear well nor does it readily spring at all in minds that have conceived of life as a field of ordered duties not as a chase in which to hunt for gratifications we are not here to be happy but to be good i wish he had mended the phrase we are not here to be happy but to try to be good comes nearer the modesty of truth with such oldfashioned morality it is possible to get through life and see the worst of it and feel some of the worst of it and still acquiesce piously and even gladly in mans fate feel some of the worst of it i say for some of the rest of the worst is by this simple faith excluded  it was in the year 1868 that the clouds finally rose the business in partnership with mr forde began suddenly to pay well about the same time the patents showed themselves a valuable property and but a little after fleeming was appointed to the new chair of engineering in the university of edinburgh thus almost at once pecuniary embarrassments passed for ever out of his life here is his own epilogue to the time at claygate and his anticipations of the future in edinburgh     the dear old house at claygate is not let and the pretty garden   a mass of weeds i feel rather as if we had behaved unkindly to them   we were very happy there but now that it is over i am conscious of   the weight of anxiety as to money which i bore all the time with you   in the garden with austin in the coachhouse with pretty songs in   the little low white room with the moonlight in the dear room   upstairsah it was perfect but the long walk wondering   pondering fearing scheming and the dusty jolting railway and the   horrid fusty office with its endless disappointments they are well   gone it is well enough to fight and scheme and bustle about in the   eager crowd here in london for a while now and then but not for a   lifetime what i have now is just perfect study for winter action   for summer lovely country for recreation a pleasant town for   talk   footnotes    24 the note by lord kelvin appended in

telegraph voyages 18581873   but it is now time to see jenkin at his lifes work i have before me certain imperfect series of letters written as he says at hazard for one does not know at the time what is important and what is not the earlier addressed to miss austin after the betrothal the later to mrs jenkin the young wife i should premise that i have allowed myself certain editorial freedoms leaving out and splicing together much as he himself did with the bona cable thus edited the letters speak for themselves and will fail to interest none who love adventure or activity addressed as they were to her whom he called his dear engineering pupil they give a picture of his work so clear that a child may understand and so attractive that i am half afraid their publication may prove harmful and still further crowd the ranks of a profession already overcrowded but their most engaging quality is the picture of the writer with his indomitable selfconfidence and courage his readiness in every pinch of circumstance or change of plan and his ever fresh enjoyment of the whole web of human experience nature adventure science toil and rest society and solitude it should be borne in mind that the writer of these buoyant pages was even while he wrote harassed by responsibility stinted in sleep and often struggling with the prostration of seasickness to this last enemy which he never overcame i have omitted in my search after condensation a good many references if they were all left such was the mans temper they would not represent one hundredth part of what he suffered for he was never given to complaint but indeed he had met this ugly trifle as he met every thwart circumstance of life with a certain pleasure of pugnacity and suffered it not to check him whether in the exercise of his profession or the pursuit of amusement     i      birkenhead april 18 1858    well you should know mr  having a contract to lay down a   submarine telegraph from sardinia to africa failed three times in the   attempt the distance from land to land is about 140 miles on the   first occasion after proceeding some 70 miles he had to cut the   cablethe cause i forget he tried again same result then picked up   about 20 miles of the lost cable spliced on a new piece and very   nearly got across that time but ran short of cable and when but a   few miles off galita in very deep water had to telegraph to london   for more cable to be manufactured and sent out whilst he tried to   stick to the end for five days i think he lay there sending and   receiving messages but heavy weather coming on the cable parted and   mr  went home in despairat least i should think so    he then applied to those eminent engineers r s newall and co who   made and laid down a cable for him last autumnfleeming jenkin at   the time in considerable mental agitation having the honour of   fitting out the elba for that purpose on this occasion the   elba has no cable to lay but is going out in the beginning of may   to endeavour to fish up the cables mr  lost there are two ends   at or near the shore the third will probably not be found within 20   miles from land one of these ends will be passed over a very big   pulley or sheave at the bows passed six times round a big barrel or   drum which will be turned round by a steamengine on deck and thus   wind up the cable while the elba slowly steams ahead the cable is   not wound round and round the drum as your silk is wound on its reel   but on the contrary never goes round more than six times going off at   one side as it comes on at the other and going down into the hold of   the elba to be coiled along in a big coil or skein    i went down to gateshead to discuss with mr newall the form which   this tolerably simple idea should take and have been busy since i   came here drawing ordering and putting up the   machineryuninterfered with thank goodness by any one i own i like   responsibility it flatters one and then your father might say i   have more to gain than to lose moreover i do like this bloodless   painless combat with wood and iron forcing the stubborn rascals to do   my will licking the clumsy cubs into an active shape seeing the   child of todays thought working tomorrow in full vigour at his   appointed task       may 12    by dint of bribing bullying cajoling and going day by day to see   the state of things ordered all my work is very nearly ready now but   those who have neglected these precautions are of course disappointed   five hundred fathoms of chain were ordered by  some three weeks   since to be ready by the 10th without fail he sends for it   today150 fathoms all they can let us have by the 15thand how the   rest is to be got who knows he ordered a boat a month since and   yesterday we could see nothing of her but the keel and about two   planks i could multiply instances without end at first one goes   nearly mad with vexation at these things but one finds so soon that   they are the rule that then it becomes necessary to feign a rage one   does not feel i look upon it as the natural order of things that if   i order a thing it will not be doneif by accident it gets done it   will certainly be done wrong the only remedy being to watch the   performance at every stage    today was a grand fieldday i had steam up and tried the engine   against pressure or resistance one part of the machinery is driven by   belt or strap of leather i always had my doubts this might slip and   so it did wildly i had made provision for doubling it putting on   two belts instead of one no useoff they went slipping round and   off the pulleys instead of driving the machinery tighten themno   use more strength theredown with the leversmash something tear   the belts but get them tightnow then stand clear on with the   steamand the belts slip away as if nothing held them men begin to   look queer the circle of quidnuncs make sage remarks once moreno   use i begin to know i ought to feel sheepish and beat but somehow i   feel cocky instead i laugh and say well i am bound to break   something downand suddenly see oho theres the place get weight   on there and the belt wont slip with much labour on go the belts   again now then a spar thro there and six mens weight on mind   youre not carried away ay ay sir but evidently no one believes   in the plan hurrah round she goesstick to your spar all right   shut off steam and the difficulty is vanquished    this or such as this not always quite so bad occurs hour after   hour while five hundred tons of coal are rattling down into the holds   and bunkers riveters are making their infernal row all round and   riggers bend the sails and fit the rigginga sort of pandemonium it   appeared to young mrs newall who was here on monday and half choked   with guano but it suits the likes of me       ss elba river mersey may 17    we are delayed in the river by some of the ships papers not being   ready such a scene at the dock gates not a sailor will join till the   last moment and then just as the ship forges ahead through the   narrow pass beds and baggage fly on board the men half tipsy   clutch at the rigging the captain swears the women scream and sob   the crowd cheer and laugh while one or two pretty little girls stand   still and cry outright regardless of all eyes    these two days of comparative peace have quite set me on my legs   again i was getting worn and weary with anxiety and work as usual i   have been delighted with my shipwrights i gave them some beer on   saturday making a short oration today when they went ashore and i   came on board they gave three cheers whether for me or the ship i   hardly know but i had just bid them goodbye and the ship was out of   hail but i was startled and hardly liked to claim the compliment by   acknowledging it       ss elba may 25    my first intentions of a long journal have been fairly frustrated by   seasickness on tuesday last about noon we started from the mersey in   very dirty weather and were hardly out of the river when we met a   gale from the southwest and a heavy sea both right in our teeth and   the poor elba had a sad shaking had i not been very seasick the   sight would have been exciting enough as i sat wrapped in my oilskins   on the bridge but in spite of all my efforts to talk to eat and   to grin i soon collapsed into imbecility and i was heartily thankful   towards evening to find myself in bed    next morning i fancied it grew quieter and as i listened heard   let go the anchor whereon i concluded we had run into holyhead   harbour as was indeed the case all that day we lay in holyhead but   i could neither read nor write nor draw the captain of another   steamer which had put in came on board and we all went for a walk on   the hill and in the evening there was an exchange of presents we   gave some tobacco i think and received a cat two pounds of fresh   butter a cumberland ham westward ho and thackerays english   humourists i was astonished at receiving two such fair books from   the captain of a little coasting screw our captain said he the   captain of the screw had plenty of money five or six hundred a year   at least what in the world makes him go rolling about in such a   craft then why i fancy hes reckless hes desperate in love with   that girl i mentioned and she wont look at him our honest fat   old captain says this very grimly in his thick broad voice    my head wont stand much writing yet so i will run up and take a   look at the blue night sky off the coast of portugal       may 26    a nice lad of some twoandtwenty a by name goes out in a   nondescript capacity as part purser part telegraph clerk part   generally useful person a was a great comfort during the miseries   of the gale for when with a dead head wind and a heavy sea plates   books papers stomachs were being rolled about in sad confusion we   generally managed to lie on our backs and grin and try discordant   staves of the flowers of the forest and the lowbacked car we   could sing and laugh when we could do nothing else though a was   ready to swear after each fit was past that that was the first time   he had felt anything and at this moment would declare in broad scotch   that hed never been sick at all qualifying the oath with except for   a minute now and then he brought a cornetàpiston to practise on   having had three weeks instructions on that melodious instrument and   if you could hear the horrid sounds that come i especially at heavy   rolls when i hint he is not improving there comes a confession i   dont feel quite right yet you see but he blows away manfully and   in selfdefence i try to roar the tune louder      1130 pm    long past cape st vincent now we went within about 400 yards of the   cliffs and lighthouse in a calm moonlight with porpoises springing   from the sea the men crooning long ballads as they lay idle on the   forecastle and the sails flapping uncertain on the yards as we   passed there came a sudden breeze from land hot and heavyscented   and now as i write its warm rich flavour contrasts strongly with the   salt air we have been breathing    i paced the deck with h the second mate and in the quiet night   drew a confession that he was engaged to be married and gave him a   world of good advice he is a very nice active little fellow with a   broad scotch tongue and dirty little rascal appearance he had a   sad disappointment at starting having been second mate on the last   voyage when the first mate was discharged he took charge of the   elba all the time she was in port and of course looked forward to   being chief mate this trip liddell promised him the post he had not   authority to do this and when newall heard of it he appointed   another man fancy poor h having told all the men and most of all   his sweetheart but more remains behind for when it came to signing   articles it turned out that o the new first mate had not a   certificate which allowed him to have a second mate then came rather   an affecting scene for h proposed to sign as chief he having the   necessary higher certificate but to act as second for the lower   wages at first o would not give in but offered to go as second   but our brave little h said no the owners wished mr o to   be chief mate and chief mate he should be so he carried the day   signed as chief and acts as second shakespeare and byron are his   favourite books i walked into byron a little but can well understand   his stirring up a rough young sailors romance i lent him westward   ho from the cabin but to my astonishment he did not care much for   it he said it smelt of the shilling railway library perhaps i had   praised it too highly scott is his standard for novels i am very   happy to find good taste by no means confined to gentlemen h   having no pretensions to that title he is a man after my own heart    then i came down to the cabin and heard young as schemes for the   future his highest picture is a commission in the prince of   vizianagrams irregular horse his eldest brother is tutor to his   highnesss children and grand vizier and magistrate and on his   highnesss household staff and seems to be one of those scotch   adventurers one meets with and hears of in queer berthsraising   cavalry building palaces and using some petty eastern kings long   purse with their long scotch heads       off bona june 4    i read your letter carefully leaning back in a maltese boat to   present the smallest surface of my body to a grilling sun and sailing   from the elba to cape hamrah about three miles distant how we   fried and sighed at last we reached land under fort geneva and i was   carried ashore pickaback and plucked the first flower i saw for   annie it was a strange scene far more novel than i had imagined the   high steep banks covered with rich spicy vegetation of which i   hardly knew one plant the dwarf palm with fanlike leaves growing   about two feet high formed the staple of the verdure as we brushed   through them the gummy leaves of a cistus stuck to the clothes and   with its small white flower and yellow heart stood for our english   dogrose in place of heather we had myrtle and lentisque with leaves   somewhat similar that large bulb with long flat leaves do not touch   it if your hands are cut the arabs use it as blisters for their   horses is that the same sort no take that one up it is the bulb of   a dwarf palm each layer of the onion peels off brown and netted   like the outside of a cocoanut it is a clever plant that from the   leaves we get a vegetable horsehairand eat the bottom of the centre   spike all the leaves you pull have the same aromatic scent but here   a little patch of cleared ground shows old friends who seem to cling   by abused civilisationfine hardy thistles one of them bright   yellow thoughhonest scotchlooking large daisies or   gowanspotatoes here and there looking but sickly and dark sturdy   figtrees looking cool and at their ease in the burning sun    here we are at fort genova crowning the little point a small old   building due to my old genoese acquaintance who fought and traded   bravely once upon a time a broken cannon of theirs forms the   threshold and through a dark low arch we enter upon broad terraces   sloping to the centre from which rainwater may collect and run into   that well largebreeched french troopers lounge about and are most   civil and the whole party sit down to breakfast in a little   whitewashed room from the door of which the long mountain coastline   and the sparkling sea show of an impossible blue through the openings   of a whitewashed rampart i try a seaegg one of those prickly   fellowsseaurchins they are called sometimes the shell is of a   lovely purple and when opened there are rays of yellow adhering to   the inside these i eat but they are very fishy    we are silent and shy of one another and soon go out to watch while   turbaned bluebreeched barelegged arabs dig holes for the land   telegraph posts on the following principle one man takes a pick and   bangs lazily at the hard earth when a little is loosened his mate   with a small spade lifts it on one side and da capo they have   regular features and look quite in place among the palms our english   workmen screw the earthenware insulators on the posts strain the   wire and order the arabs about by the generic term of johnny i find   w has nothing for me to do and that in fact no one has anything   to do some instruments for testing have stuck at lyons some at   cagliari and nothing can be doneor at any rate is done i wander   about thinking of you and staring at big green   grasshopperslocusts some people call themand smelling the rich   brushwood there was nothing for a pencil to sketch and i soon got   tired of this work though i have paid willingly much money for far   less strange and lovely sights       off cape spartivento june 8    at two this morning we left cagliari at five cast anchor here i got   up and began preparing for the final trial and shortly afterwards   every one else of note on board went ashore to make experiments on the   state of the cable leaving me with the prospect of beginning to lift   at 12 oclock i was not ready by that time but the experiments were   not concluded and moreover the cable was found to be imbedded some   four or five feet in sand so that the boat could not bring off the   end at three messrs liddell etc came on board in good spirits   having found two wires good or in such a state as permitted messages   to be transmitted freely the boat now went to grapple for the cable   some way from shore while the elba towed a small lateen craft which   was to take back the consul to cagliari some distance on its way on   our return we found the boat had been unsuccessful she was allowed to   drop astern while we grappled for the cable in the elba without   more success the coast is a low mountain range covered with   brushwood or heatherpools of water and a sandy beach at their feet   i have not yet been ashore my hands having been very full all day       june 9    grappling for the cable outside the bank had been voted too   uncertain and the day was spent in efforts to pull the cable off   through the sand which has accumulated over it by getting the cable   tight on to the boat and letting the swell pitch her about till it   got slack and then tightening again with blocks and pulleys we   managed to get out from the beach towards the ship at the rate of   about twenty yards an hour when they had got about 100 yards from   shore we ran in round the elba to try and help them letting go the   anchor in the shallowest possible water this was about sunset   suddenly some one calls out he sees the cable at the bottom there it   was sure enough apparently wriggling about as the waves rippled   great excitement still greater when we find our own anchor is foul of   it and it has been the means of bringing it to light we let go a   grapnel get the cable clear of the anchor on to the grapnelthe   captain in an agony lest we should drift ashore meanwhilehand the   grappling line into the big boat steam out far enough and anchor   again a little more work and one end of the cable is up over the bows   round my drum i go to my engine and we start hauling in all goes   pretty well but it is quite dark lamps are got at last and men   arranged we go on for a quarter of a mile or so from shore and then   stop at about halfpast nine with orders to be up at three grand work   at last a number of the saturday review here it reads so hot and   feverish so tomblike and unhealthy in the midst of dear natures   hills and sea with good wholesome work to do pray that all go well   tomorrow       june 10    thank heaven for a most fortunate day at three oclock this morning   in a damp chill mist all hands were roused to work with a small   delay for one or two improvements i had seen to be necessary last   night the engine started and since that time i do not think there   has been half an hours stoppage a rope to splice a block to change   a wheel to oil an old rusted anchor to disengage from the cable which   brought it up these have been our only obstructions sixty seventy   eighty a hundred a hundred and twenty revolutions at last my little   engine tears away the even black rope comes straight out of the blue   heaving water passes slowly round an openhearted   goodtemperedlooking pulley five feet diameter aft past a vicious   nipper to bring all up should anything go wrong through a gentle   guide on to a huge bluff drum who wraps him round his body and says   come you must as plain as drum can speak the chattering pauls say   ive got him ive got him he cant get back whilst black cable   much slacker and easier in mind and body is taken by a slim vpulley   and passed down into the huge hold where half a dozen men put him   comfortably to bed after his exertion in rising from his long bath in   good sooth it is one of the strangest sights i know to see that black   fellow rising up so steadily in the midst of the blue sea we are more   than half way to the place where we expect the fault and already the   one wire supposed previously to be quite bad near the african coast   can be spoken through i am very glad i am here for my machines are   my own children and i look on their little failings with a parents   eye and lead them into the path of duty with gentleness and firmness   i am naturally in good spirits but keep very quiet for misfortunes   may arise at any instant moreover tomorrow my payingout apparatus   will be wanted should all go well and that will be another nervous   operation fifteen miles are safely in but no one knows better than i   do that nothing is done till all is done       june 11    9 amwe have reached the splice supposed to be faulty and no   fault has been found the two men learned in electricity l and   w squabble where the fault is    eveninga weary day in a hot broiling sun no air after the   experiments l said the fault might be ten miles ahead by that   time we should be according to a chart in about a thousand fathoms   of waterrather more than a mile it was most difficult to decide   whether to go on or not i made preparations for a heavy pull set   small things to rights and went to sleep about four in the afternoon   mr liddell decided to proceed and we are now at seven grinding in   at the rate of a mile and threequarters per hour which appears a   grand speed to us if the payingout only works well i have just   thought of a great improvement in it i cant apply it this time   howeverthe sea is of an oily calm and a perfect fleet of brigs and   ships surrounds us their sails hardly filling in the lazy breeze the   sun sets behind the dim coast of the isola san pietro the coast of   sardinia high and rugged becomes softer and softer in the distance   while to the westward still the isolated rock of toro springs from the   horizonit would amuse you to see how cool in head and jolly   everybody is a testy word now and then shows the wires are strained a   little but every one laughs and makes his little jokes as if it were   all in fun yet we are all as much in earnest as the most earnest of   the earnest bastard german school or demonstrative of frenchmen i   enjoy it very much       june 12    530 amout of sight of land about thirty nautical miles in the   hold the wind rising a little experiments being made for a fault   while the engine slowly revolves to keep us hanging at the same spot   depth supposed about a mile the machinery has behaved admirably o   that the payingout were over the new machinery there is but rough   meant for an experiment in shallow water and here we are in a mile of   water    630i have made my calculations and find the new payingout gear   cannot possibly answer at this depth some portion would give way   luckily i have brought the old things with me and am getting them   rigged up as fast as may be bad news from the cable number four has   given in some portion of the last ten miles the fault in number three   is still at the bottom of the sea number two is now the only good   wire and the hold is getting in such a mess through keeping bad bits   out and cutting for splicing and testing that there will be great   risk in paying out the cable is somewhat strained in its ascent from   one mile below us what it will be when we get to two miles is a   problem we may have to determine    9 pma most provoking unsatisfactory day we have done nothing   the wind and sea have both risen too little notice has been given to   the telegraphists who accompany this expedition they had to leave all   their instruments at lyons in order to arrive at bona in time our   tests are therefore of the roughest and no one really knows where the   faults are mr l in the morning lost much time then he told us   after we had been inactive for about eight hours that the fault in   number three was within six miles and at six oclock in the evening   when all was ready for a start to pick up these six miles he comes   and says there must be a fault about thirty miles from bona by this   time it was too late to begin paying out today and we must lie here   moored in a thousand fathoms till light tomorrow morning the ship   pitches a good deal but the wind is going down       june 13 sunday    the wind has not gone down however it now at 1030 blows a pretty   stiff gale the sea has also risen and the elbas bows rise and   fall about 9 feet we make twelve pitches to the minute and the poor   cable must feel very seasick by this time we are quite unable to do   anything and continue riding at anchor in one thousand fathoms the   engines going constantly so as to keep the ships bows up to the   cable which by this means hangs nearly vertical and sustains no   strain but that caused by its own weight and the pitching of the   vessel we were all up at four but the weather entirely forbade work   for today so some went to bed and most lay down making up our   leeway as we nautically term our loss of sleep i must say liddell is   a fine fellow and keeps his patience and temper wonderfully and yet   how he does fret and fume about trifles at home this wind has blown   now for thirtysix hours and yet we have telegrams from bona to say   the sea there is as calm as a mirror it makes one laugh to remember   one is still tied to the shore click click click the pecker is at   work i wonder what herr p says to herr l tests tests   tests nothing more this will be a very anxious day       june 14    another day of fatal inaction       june 15    930the wind has gone down a deal but even now there are doubts   whether we shall start today when shall i get back to you    9 pmfour miles from land our run has been successful and   eventless now the work is nearly over i feel a little out of   spiritswhy i should be puzzled to saymere wantonness or reaction   perhaps after suspense       june 16    up this morning at three coupled my selfacting gear to the break   and had the satisfaction of seeing it pay out the last four miles in   very good style with one or two little improvements i hope to make   it a capital thing the end has just gone ashore in two boats three   out of four wires good thus ends our first expedition by some odd   chance a times of june the 7th has found its way on board through   the agency of a wretched old peasant who watches the end of the line   here a long account of breakages in the atlantic trial trip tonight   we grapple for the heavy cable eight tons to the mile i long to   have a tug at him he may puzzle me and though misfortunes or rather   difficulties are a bore at the time life when working with cables is   tame without them    2 pmhurrah he is hooked the big fellow almost at the first   cast he hangs under our bows looking so huge and imposing that i   could find it in my heart to be afraid of him       june 17    we went to a little bay called chia where a freshwater stream falls   into the sea and took in water this is rather a long operation so i   went a walk up the valley with mr liddell the coast here consists of   rocky mountains 800 to 1000 feet high covered with shrubs of a   brilliant green on landing our first amusement was watching the   hundreds of large fish who lazily swam in shoals about the river the   big canes on the further side hold numberless tortoises we are told   but see none for just now they prefer taking a siesta a little   further on and what is this with large pink flowers in such   abundancethe oleander in full flower at first i fear to pluck   them thinking they must be cultivated and valuable but soon the   banks show a long line of thick tall shrubs one mass of glorious pink   and green set these in a little valley framed by mountains whose   rocks gleam out blue and purple colours such as preraphaelites only   dare attempt shining out hard and weirdlike amongst the clumps of   castoroil plants cistus arbor vitæ and many other evergreens   whose names alas i know not the cistus is brown now the rest all   deep or brilliant green large herds of cattle browse on the baked   deposit at the foot of these large crags one or two halfsavage   herdsmen in sheepskin kilts etc ask for cigars partridges whirr up   on either side of us pigeons coo and nightingales sing amongst the   blooming oleander we get six sheep and many fowls too from the   priest of the small village and then run back to spartivento and make   preparations for the morning       june 18    the big cable is stubborn and will not behave like his smaller   brother the gear employed to take him off the drum is not strong   enough he gets slack on the drum and plays the mischief luckily for   my own conscience the gear i had wanted was negatived by mr newall   mr liddell does not exactly blame me but he says we might have had a   silver pulley cheaper than the cost of this delay he has telegraphed   for more men to cagliari to try to pull the cable off the drum into   the hold by hand i look as comfortable as i can but feel as if   people were blaming me i am trying my best to get something rigged   which may help us i wanted a little difficulty and feel much   betterthe short length we have picked up was covered at places with   beautiful sprays of coral twisted and twined with shells of those   small fairy animals we saw in the aquarium at home poor little   things they died at once with their little bells and delicate bright   tints    12 oclockhurrah victory for the present anyhow whilst in our   first dejection i thought i saw a place where a flat roller would   remedy the whole misfortune but a flat roller at cape spartivento   hard easily unshipped running freely there was a grooved pulley   used for the payingout machinery with a spindle wheel which might   suit me i filled him up with tarry spunyarn nailed sheet copper   round him bent some parts in the fire and we are payingin without   more trouble now you would think some one would praise me nono   more praise than blame before perhaps now they think better of me   though    10 pmwe have gone on very comfortably for nearly six miles an   hour and a half was spent washing down for along with many coloured   polypi from corals shells and insects the big cable brings up much   mud and rust and makes a fishy smell by no means pleasant the bottom   seems to teem with lifebut now we are startled by a most   unpleasant grinding noise which appeared at first to come from the   large low pulley but when the engines stopped the noise continued   and we now imagine it is something slipping down the cable and the   pulley but acts as soundingboard to the big fiddle whether it is   only an anchor or one of the two other cables we know not we hope it   is not the cable just laid down       june 19    10 amall our alarm groundless it would appear the odd noise   ceased after a time and there was no mark sufficiently strong on the   large cable to warrant the suspicion that we had cut another line   through i stopped up on the lookout till three in the morning which   made 23 hours between sleep and sleep one goes dozing about though   most of the day for it is only when something goes wrong that one has   to look alive hour after hour i stand on the forecastlehead picking   off little specimens of polypi and coral or lie on the saloon deck   reading back numbers of the timestill something hitches and then   all is hurlyburly once more there are awnings all along the ship   and a most ancient fishlike smell beneath    1 oclocksuddenly a great strain in only 95 fathoms of   waterbelts surging and general dismay grapnels being thrown out in   the hope of finding what holds the cableshould it prove the young   cable we are apparently crossing its pathnot the working one but   the lost child mr liddell would start the big one first though it   was laid first he wanted to see the job done and meant to leave us   to the small one unaided by his presence    330grapnel caught something lost it again it left its marks on   the prongs started lifting gear again and after hauling in some 50   fathomsgrunt grunt gruntwe hear the other cable slipping down   our big one playing the selfsame tune we heard last nightlouder   however    10 pmthe pull on the deck engines became harder and harder i got   steam up in a boiler on deck and another little engine starts hauling   at the grapnel i wonder if there ever was such a scene of confusion   mr liddell and w and the captain all giving orders contradictory   etc on the forecastle d the foreman of our men the mates   etc following the example of our superiors the ships engine and   boilers below a 50horse engine on deck a boiler 14 feet long on   deck beside it a little steamwinch tearing round a dozen italians   20 have come to relieve our hands the men we telegraphed for to   cagliari hauling at the rope wiremen sailors in the crevices left   by ropes and machinery everything that could swear swearingi found   myself swearing like a trooper at last we got the unknown difficulty   within ten fathoms of the surface but then the forecastle got   frightened that if it was the small cable which we had got hold of   we should certainly break it by continuing the tremendous and   increasing strain so at last mr liddell decided to stop cut the big   cable buoying its end go back to our pleasant wateringplace at   chia take more water and start lifting the small cable the end of   the large one has even now regained its sandy bed and three   buoysone to grapnel foul of the supposed small cable two to the big   cableare dipping about on the surface one morea flagbuoywill   soon follow and then straight for shore       june 20    it is an illwind etc i have an unexpected opportunity of   forwarding this engineering letter for the craft which brought out   our italian sailors must return to cagliari tonight as the little   cable will take us nearly to galita and the italian skipper could   hardly find his way from thence todaysundaynot much rest mr   liddell is at spartivento telegraphing we are at chia and shall   shortly go to help our boats crew in getting the small cable on   board we dropped them some time since in order that they might dig it   out of the sand as far as possible       june 21    yesterdaysunday as it wasall hands were kept at work all day   coaling watering and making a futile attempt to pull the cable from   the shore on board through the sand this attempt was rather silly   after the experience we had gained at cape spartivento this morning   we grappled hooked the cable at once and have made an excellent   start though i have called this the small cable it is much larger   than the bona onehere comes a breakdown and a bad one       june 22    we got over it however but it is a warning to me that my future   difficulties will arise from parts wearing out yesterday the cable   was often a lovely sight coming out of the water one large   incrustation of delicate netlike corals and long white curling   shells no portion of the dirty black wires was visible instead we   had a garland of soft pink with little scarlet sprays and white enamel   intermixed all was fragile however and could hardly be secured in   safety and inexorable iron crushed the tender leaves to atomsthis   morning at the end of my watch about 4 oclock we came to the buoys   proving our anticipations right concerning the crossing of the cables   i went to bed for four hours and on getting up found a sad mess a   tangle of the sixwire cable hung to the grapnel which had been left   buoyed and the small cable had parted and is lost for the present   our hauling of the other day must have done the mischief       june 23    we contrived to get the two ends of the large cable and to pick the   short end up the long end leading us seaward was next put round the   drum and a mile of it picked up but then fearing another tangle   the end was cut and buoyed and we returned to grapple for the   threewire cable all this is very tiresome for me the buoying and   dredging are managed entirely by w who has had much experience in   this sort of thing so i have not enough to do and get very homesick   at noon the wind freshened and the sea rose so high that we had to run   for land and are once more this evening anchored at chia       june 24    the whole day spent in dredging without success this operation   consists in allowing the ship to drift slowly across the line where   you expect the cable to be while at the end of a long rope fast   either to the bow or stern a grapnel drags along the ground this   grapnel is a small anchor made like four pothooks tied back to back   when the rope gets taut the ship is stopped and the grapnel hauled up   to the surface in the hopes of finding the cable on its prongsi am   much discontented with myself for idly lounging about and reading   westward ho for the second time instead of taking to electricity   or picking up nautical information i am uncommonly idle the sea is   not quite so rough but the weather is squally and the rain comes in   frequent gusts       june 25    today about 1 oclock we hooked the threewire cable buoyed the   long sea end and picked up the short or shore end now it is dark   and we must wait for morning before lifting the buoy we lowered today   and proceeding seawardsthe depth of water here is about 600 feet   the height of a respectable english hill our fishing line was about a   quarter of a mile long it blows pretty fresh and there is a great   deal of sea       26th    this morning it came on to blow so heavily that it was impossible to   take up our buoy the elba recommenced rolling in true baltic style   and towards noon we ran for land       27th sunday    this morning was a beautiful calm we reached the buoys at about 430   and commenced picking up at 630 shortly a new cause of anxiety   arose kinks came up in great quantities about thirty in the hour to   have a true conception of a kink you must see one it is a loop drawn   tight all the wires get twisted and the guttapercha inside pushed   out these much diminish the value of the cable as they must all be   cut out the guttapercha made good and the cable spliced they arise   from the cable having been badly laid down so that it forms folds and   tails at the bottom of the sea these kinks have another disadvantage   they weaken the cable very muchat about six oclock pm we had   some twelve miles lifted when i went to the bows the kinks were   exceedingly tight and were giving way in a most alarming manner i got   a cage rigged up to prevent the end if it broke from hurting any   one and sat down on the bowsprit thinking i should describe kinks to   anniesuddenly i saw a great many coils and kinks altogether at the   surface i jumped to the guttapercha pipe by blowing through which   the signal is given to stop the engine i blow but the engine does   not stop againno answer the coils and kinks jam in the bows and i   rush aft shouting stop too late the cable had parted and must lie in   peace at the bottom some one had pulled the guttapercha tube across   a bare part of the steam pipe and melted it it had been used hundreds   of times in the last few days and gave no symptoms of failing i   believe the cable must have gone at any rate however since it went   in my watch and since i might have secured the tubing more strongly   i feel rather sad       june 28    since i could not go to annie i took down shakespeare and by the   time i had finished antony and cleopatra read the second half of   troilus and got some way in coriolanus i felt it was childish to   regret the accident had happened in my watch and moreover i felt   myself not much to blame in the tubing matterit had been torn down   it had not fallen down so i went to bed and slept without fretting   and woke this morning in the same good moodfor which thank you and   our friend shakespeare i am happy to say mr liddell said the loss of   the cable did not much matter though this would have been no   consolation had i felt myself to blamethis morning we have grappled   for and found another length of small cable which mr  dropped in   100 fathoms of water if this also gets full of kinks we shall   probably have to cut it after 10 miles or so or more probably still   it will part of its own free will or weight    10 pmthis second length of threewire cable soon got into the   same condition as its fellowie came up twenty kinks an hourand   after seven miles were in parted on the pulley over the bows at one   of the said kinks during my watch again but this time no earthly   power could have saved it i had taken all manner of precautions to   prevent the end doing any damage when the smash came for come i knew   it must we now return to the sixwire cable as i sat watching the   cable tonight large phosphorescent globes kept rolling from it and   fading in the black water       29th    today we returned to the buoy we had left at the end of the sixwire   cable and after much trouble from a series of tangles got a fair   start at noon you will easily believe a tangle of iron rope inch and   a half diameter is not easy to unravel especially with a ton or so   hanging to the ends it is now eight oclock and we have about six   and a half miles safe it becomes very exciting however for the   kinks are coming fast and furious       july 2    twentyeight miles safe in the hold the ship is now so deep that the   men are to be turned out of their aft hold and the remainder coiled   there so the good elbas nose need not burrow too far into the   waves there can only be about 10 or 12 miles more but these weigh 80   or 100 tons       july 5    our first mate was much hurt in securing a buoy on the evening of the   2nd as interpreter with the italians i am useful in all these   cases but for no fortune would i be a doctor to witness these scenes   continually pain is a terrible thingour work is done the whole of   the sixwire cable has been recovered only a small part of the   threewire but that wire was bad and owing to its twisted state the   value small we may therefore be said to have been very successful     ii  i have given this cruise nearly in full from the notes unhappily imperfect of two others i will take only specimens for in all there are features of similarity and it is possible to have too much even of submarine telegraphy and the romance of engineering and first from the cruise of 1859 in the greek islands and to alexandria take a few traits incidents and pictures       may 10 1859    we had a fair wind and we did very well seeing a little bit of   cerigo or cythera and lots of turtledoves wandering about over the   sea and perching tired and timid in the rigging of our little craft   then falconera antimilo and milo topped with huge white clouds   barren deserted rising bold and mysterious from the blue chafing   seaargentiera siphano scapho paros antiparos and late at night   syra itself adam bede in one hand a sketchbook in the other   lying on rugs under an awning i enjoyed a very pleasant day       may 14    syra is semieastern the pavement huge shapeless blocks sloping to   a central gutter from this bare twostoried houses sometimes plaster   manycoloured sometimes roughhewn marble rise dirty and   illfinished to straight plain flat roofs shops guiltless of   windows with signs in greek letters dogs greeks in blue baggy   zouave breeches and a fez a few narghilehs and a sprinkling of the   ordinary continental shopboysin the evening i tried one more walk   in syra with a but in vain endeavoured to amuse myself or to   spend money the first effort resulting in singing doodah to a   passing greek or two the second in spending no in making a   spend threepence on coffee for three       may 16    on coming on deck i found we were at anchor in canea bay and saw   one of the most lovely sights man could witness far on either hand   stretch bold mountain capes spada and maleka tender in colour bold   in outline rich sunny levels lie beneath them framed by the azure   sea right in front a dark brown fortress girdles white mosques and   minarets rich and green our mountain capes here join to form a   setting for the town in whose dark wallsstill darkeropen a dozen   higharched caves in which the huge venetian galleys used to lie in   wait high above all higher and higher yet up into the firmament   range after range of blue and snowcapped mountains i was bewildered   and amazed having heard nothing of this great beauty the town when   entered is quite eastern the streets are formed of open stalls under   the first story in which squat tailors cooks sherbetvendors and   the like busy at their work or smoking narghilehs cloths stretched   from house to house keep out the sun mules rattle through the crowd   curs yelp between your legs negroes are as hideous and bright clothed   as usual grave turks with long chibouques continue to march solemnly   without breaking them a little arab in one dirty rag pokes fun at two   splendid little turks with brilliant fezzes wiry mountaineers in   dirty full white kilts shouldering long guns and one hand on their   pistols stalk untamed past a dozen turkish soldiers who look   sheepish and brutal in worn cloth jacket and cotton trousers a   headless wingless lion of st mark still stands upon a gate and has   left the mark of his strong clutch of ancient times when crete was   crete not a trace remains save perhaps in the full wellcut nostril   and firm tread of that mountaineer and i suspect that even his sires   were albanians mere outer barbarians       may 17    i spent the day at the little station where the cable was landed   which has apparently been first a venetian monastery and then a   turkish mosque at any rate the big dome is very cool and the little   ones hold our electric batteries capitally a handsome young   bashibazouk guards it and a still handsomer mountaineer is the   servant so i draw them and the monastery and the hill till im black   in the face with heat and come on board to hear the canea cable is   still bad       may 23    we arrived in the morning at the east end of candia and had a   glorious scramble over the mountains which seem built of adamant   time has worn away the softer portions of the rock only leaving sharp   jagged edges of steel seaeagles soaring above our heads old tanks   ruins and desolation at our feet the ancient arsinoë stood here a   few blocks of marble with the cross attest the presence of venetian   christians but nowthe desolation of desolations mr liddell and i   separated from the rest and when we had found a sure bay for the   cable had a tremendous lively scramble back to the boat these are   the bits of our life which i enjoy which have some poetry some   grandeur in them       may 29     yesterday we ran round to the new harbour of alexandria landed the   shoreend of the cable close to cleopatras bath and made a very   satisfactory start about one in the afternoon we had scarcely gone   200 yards when i noticed that the cable ceased to run out and i   wondered why the ship had stopped people ran aft to tell me not to   put such a strain on the cable i answered indignantly that there was   no strain and suddenly it broke on every one in the ship at once that   we were aground here was a nice mess a violent scirocco blew from   the land making ones skin feel as if it belonged to some one else   and didnt fit making the horizon dim and yellow with fine sand   oppressing every sense and raising the thermometer 20 degrees in an   hour but making calm water round us which enabled the ship to lie   for the time in safety the wind might change at any moment since the   scirocco was only accidental and at the first wave from seaward bump   would go the poor ship and there would might be an end of our   voyage the captain without waiting to sound began to make an effort   to put the ship over what was supposed to be a sandbank but by the   time soundings were made this was found to be impossible and he had   only been jamming the poor elba faster on a rock now every effort   was made to get her astern an anchor taken out a rope brought to a   winch i had for the cable and the engines backed but all in vain a   small turkish government steamer which is to be our consort came to   our assistance but of course very slowly and much time was occupied   before we could get a hawser to her i could do no good after having   made a chart of the soundings round the ship and went at last on to   the bridge to sketch the scene but at that moment the strain from the   winch and a jerk from the turkish steamer got off the boat after we   had been some hours aground the carpenter reported that she had made   only two inches of water in one compartment the cable was still   uninjured astern and our spirits rose whenwill you believe   itafter going a short distance astern the pilot ran us once more   fast aground on what seemed to me nearly the same spot the very same   scene was gone through as on the first occasion and dark came on   whilst the wind shifted and we were still aground dinner was served   up but poor mr liddell could eat very little and bump bump grind   grind went the ship fifteen or sixteen times as we sat at dinner the   slight sea however did enable us to bump off this morning we appear   not to have suffered in any way but a sea is rolling in which a few   hours ago would have settled the poor old elba       june     the alexandria cable has again failed after paying out twothirds of   the distance successfully an unlucky touch in deep water snapped the   line luckily the accident occurred in mr liddells watch though   personally it may not really concern me the accident weighs like a   personal misfortune still i am glad i was present a failure is   probably more instructive than a success and this experience may   enable us to avoid misfortune in still greater undertakings       june     we left syra the morning after our arrival on saturday the 4th this   we did first because we were in a hurry to do something and   second because coming from alexandria we had four days quarantine   to perform we were all mustered along the side while the doctor   counted us the letters were popped into a little tin box and taken   away to be smoked the guardians put on board to see that we held no   communication with the shorewithout them we should still have had   four more days quarantine and with twelve greek sailors besides we   started merrily enough picking up the canea cable to our utter   dismay the yarn covering began to come up quite decayed and the   cable which when laid should have borne half a ton was now in danger   of snapping with a tenth part of that strain we went as slow as   possible in fear of a break at every instant my watch was from eight   to twelve in the morning and during that time we had barely secured   three miles of cable once it broke inside the ship but i seized hold   of it in timethe weight being hardly anythingand the line for the   nonce was saved regular nooses were then planted inboard with men to   draw them taut should the cable break inboard a who should have   relieved me was unwell so i had to continue my lookout and about   one oclock the line again parted but was again caught in the last   noose with about four inches to spare five minutes afterwards it   again parted and was yet once more caught mr liddell whom i had   called could stand this no longer so we buoyed the line and ran into   a bay in siphano waiting for calm weather though i was by no means   of opinion that the slight sea and wind had been the cause of our   failuresall next day monday we lay off siphano amusing ourselves   on shore with fowlingpieces and navy revolvers i need not say we   killed nothing and luckily we did not wound any of ourselves a   guardiano accompanied us his functions being limited to preventing   actual contact with the natives for they might come as near and talk   as much as they pleased these isles of greece are sad interesting   places they are not really barren all over but they are quite   destitute of verdure and tufts of thyme wild mastic or mint though   they sound well are not nearly so pretty as grass many little   churches glittering white dot the islands most of them i believe   abandoned during the whole year with the exception of one day sacred   to their patron saint the villages are mean but the inhabitants do   not look wretched and the men are good sailors there is something in   this greek race yet they will become a powerful levantine nation in   the course of timewhat a lovely moonlight evening that was the   barren island cutting the clear sky with fantastic outline marble   cliffs on either hand fairly gleaming over the calm sea next day the   wind still continuing i proposed a boating excursion and decoyed   a l and s into accompanying me we took the little gig   and sailed away merrily enough round a point to a beautiful white bay   flanked with two glistening little churches fronted by beautiful   distant islands when suddenly to my horror i discovered the elba   steaming full speed out from the island of course we steered after   her but the wind that instant ceased and we were left in a dead   calm there was nothing for it but to unship the mast get out the   oars and pull the ship was nearly certain to stop at the buoy and i   wanted to learn how to take an oar so here was a chance with a   vengeance l steered and we three pulleda broiling pull it was   about half way across to palikandro still we did come in pulling an   uncommon good stroke and i had learned to hang on my oar l had   pressed me to let him take my place but though i was very tired at   the end of the first quarter of an hour and then every successive   half hour i would not give in i nearly paid dear for my obstinacy   however for in the evening i had alternate fits of shivering and   burning     iii  the next extracts and i am sorry to say the last are from fleemings letters of 1860 when he was back at bona and spartivento and for the first time at the head of an expedition unhappily these letters are not only the last but the series is quite imperfect and this is the more to be lamented as he had now begun to use a pen more skilfully and in the following notes there is at times a touch of real distinction in the manner       cagliari october 5 1860    all tuesday i spent examining what was on board the elba and   trying to start the repairs of the spartivento land line which has   been entirely neglectedand no wonder for no one has been paid for   three months no not even the poor guards who have to keep   themselves their horses and their families on their pay wednesday   morning i started for spartivento and got there in time to try a   good many experiments spartivento looks more wild and savage than   ever but is not without a strange deadly beauty the hills covered   with bushes of a metallic green with coppery patches of soil in   between the valleys filled with dry salt mud and a little stagnant   water where that very morning the deer had drunk where herons   curlews and other fowl abound and where alas malaria is breeding   with this rain no fear for those who do not sleep on shore a   little iron hut had been placed there since 1858 but the windows had   been carried off the door broken down the roof pierced all over in   it we sat to make experiments and how it recalled birkenhead there   was thomson there was my testingboard the strings of guttapercha   harry p even battering with the batteries but where was my   darling annie whilst i sat feet in sand with harry alone inside the   hutmats coats and wood to darken the windowthe others visited   the murderous old friar who is of the order of scaloppi and for whom   i brought a letter from his superior ordering him to pay us   attention but he was away from home gone to cagliari in a boat with   the produce of the farm belonging to his convent then they visited   the tower of chia but could not get in because the door is thirty   feet off the ground so they came back and pitched a magnificent tent   which i brought from the bahiana a long time agoand where they   will live if i mistake not in preference to the friars or the owl   and bathaunted tower mm t and s will be left there t an   intelligent hardworking frenchman with whom i am well pleased he   can speak english and italian well and has been two years at genoa   s is a french german with a face like an ancient gaul who has   been sergeantmajor in the french line and who is i see a great   big muscular fainéant we left the tent pitched and some stores in   charge of a guide and ran back to cagliari    certainly being at the head of things is pleasanter than being   subordinate we all agree very well and i have made the testing   office into a kind of private room where i can come and write to you   undisturbed surrounded by my dear bright brass things which all of   them remind me of our nights at birkenhead then i can work here too   and try lots of experiments you know how i like that and now and   then i readshakespeare principally thank you so much for making me   bring him i think i must get a pocket edition of hamlet and henry   the fifth so as never to be without them       cagliari october 7    the town was full  of redshirted english garibaldini a very   finelooking set of fellows they are too the officers rather raffish   but with medals crimean and indian the men a very sturdy set with   many lads of good birth i should say they still wait their consort   the emperor and will i fear be too late to do anything i meant   to have called on them but they are all gone into barracks some way   from the town and i have been much too busy to go far    the view from the ramparts was very strange and beautiful cagliari   rises on a very steep rock at the mouth of a wide plain circled by   large hills and threequarters filled with lagoons it looks   therefore like an old island citadel large heaps of salt mark the   border between the sea and the lagoons thousands of flamingoes whiten   the centre of the huge shallow marsh hawks hover and scream among the   trees under the high mouldering battlementsa little lower down the   band played men and ladies bowed and pranced the costumes posed   church bells tinkled processions processed the sun set behind thick   clouds capping the hills i pondered on you and enjoyed it all    decidedly i prefer being master to being man boats at all hours   stewards flying for marmalade captain inquiring when ship is to sail   clerks to copy my writing the boat to steer when we go outi have   run her nose on several times decidedly i begin to feel quite a   little king confound the cable though i shall never be able to   repair it       bona october 14    we left cagliari at 430 on the 9th and soon got to spartivento i   repeated some of my experiments but found thomson who was to have   been my grand standby would not work on that day in the wretched   little hut even if the windows and door had been put in the wind   which was very high made the lamp flicker about and blew it out so i   sent on board and got old sails and fairly wrapped the hut up in   them and then we were as snug as could be and i left the hut in   glorious condition with a nice little stove in it the tent which   should have been forthcoming from the curés for the guards had gone   to cagliari but i found another a green turkish tent in the   elba and soon had him up the square tent left on the last occasion   was standing all right and tight in spite of wind and rain we landed   provisions two beds plates knives forks candles cooking   utensils and were ready for a start at 6 pm but the wind meanwhile   had come on to blow at such a rate that i thought better of it and   we stopped t and s slept ashore however to see how they   liked it at least they tried to sleep for s the ancient   sergeantmajor had a toothache and t thought the tent was coming   down every minute next morning they could only complain of sand and a   leaky coffeepot so i leave them with a good conscience the little   encampment looked quite picturesque the green round tent the square   white tent and the hut all wrapped up in sails on a sandhill   looking on the sea and masking those confounded marshes at the back   one would have thought the cagliaritans were in a conspiracy to   frighten the two poor fellows who i believe will be safe enough if   they do not go into the marshes after nightfall s brought a   little dog to amuse themsuch a jolly ugly little cur without a   tail but full of fun he will be better than quinine    the wind drove a barque which had anchored near us for shelter out   to sea we started however at 2 pm and had a quick passage but a   very rough one getting to bona by daylight on the 11th such a   place as this is for getting anything done the health boat went away   from us at 730 with w on board and we heard nothing of them till   930 when w came back with two fat frenchmen who are to look on   on the part of the government they are exactly alike only one has   four bands and the other three round his cap and so i know them then   i sent a boat round to fort gênois fort geneva of 1858 where the   cable is landed with all sorts of things and directions whilst i   went ashore to see about coals and a room at the fort we hunted   people in the little square in their shops and offices but only   found them in cafés one amiable gentleman wasnt up at 930 was out   at 10 and as soon as he came back the servant said he would go to bed   and not get up till 3 he came however to find us at a café and said   that on the contrary two days in the week he did not do so then my   two fat friends must have their breakfast after their something at a   café and all the shops shut from 10 to 2 and the post does not open   till 12 and there was a road to fort gênois only a bridge had been   carried away etc at last i got off and we rowed round to fort   gênois where my men had put up a capital gipsy tent with sails and   there was my big board and thomsons number 5 in great glory i soon   came to the conclusion there was a break two of my faithful   cagliaritans slept all night in the little tent to guard it and my   precious instruments and the sea which was rather rough silenced my   frenchmen    next day i went on with my experiments whilst a boat grappled for   the cable a little way from shore and buoyed it where the elba   could get hold i brought all back to the elba tried my machinery   and was all ready for a start next morning but the wretched coal had   not come yet government permission from algiers to be got lighters   men baskets and i know not what forms to be got or got throughand   everybody asleep coals or no coals i was determined to start next   morning and start we did at four in the morning picked up the buoy   with our deckengine popped the cable across a boat tested the wires   to make sure the fault was not behind us and started picking up at   11 everything worked admirably and about 2 pm in came the fault   there is no doubt the cable was broken by coralfishers twice they   have had it up to their own knowledge    many men have been ashore today and have come back tipsy and the   whole ship is in a state of quarrel from top to bottom and they will   gossip just within my hearing and we have had moreover three french   gentlemen and a french lady to dinner and i had to act host and try   to manage the mixtures to their taste the goodnatured little   frenchwoman was most amusing when i asked her if she would have some   apple tartmon dieu with heroic resignation je veux bien   or a little plomboddingmais ce que vous voudrez monsieur       ss elba somewhere not far from bona oct 19    yesterday after three previous days of useless grappling was   destined to be very eventful we began dredging at daybreak and   hooked at once every time in rocks but by capital luck just as we   were deciding it was no use to continue in that place we hooked the   cable up it came was tested and lo another complete break a   quarter of a mile off i was amazed at my own tranquillity under these   disappointments but i was not really half so fussy as about getting a   cab well there was nothing for it but grappling again and as you   may imagine we were getting about six miles from shore but the water   did not deepen rapidly we seemed to be on the crest of a kind of   submarine mountain in prolongation of cape de gonde and pretty havoc   we must have made with the crags what rocks we did hook no sooner   was the grapnel down than the ship was anchored and then came such a   business ships engines going deckengine thundering belt slipping   fear of breaking ropes actually breaking grapnels it was always an   hour or more before we could get the grapnel down again at last we   had to give up the place though we knew we were close to the cable   and go farther to sea in much deeper water to my great fear as i   knew the cable was much eaten away and would stand but little strain   well we hooked the cable first dredge this time and pulled it slowly   and gently to the top with much trepidation was it the cable was   there any weight on it was evidently too small imagine my dismay   when the cable did come up but hanging loosely thus    illustration    instead of taut thus    illustration    showing certain signs of a break close by for a moment i felt   provoked as i thought here we are in deep water and the cable will   not stand lifting i tested at once and by the very first wire found   it had broken towards shore and was good towards sea this was of   course very pleasant but from that time to this though the wires   test very well not a signal has come from spartivento i got the   cable into a boat and a guttapercha line from the ship to the boat   and we signalled away at a great ratebut no signs of life the tests   however make me pretty sure one wire at least is good so i determined   to lay down cable from where we were to the shore and go to   spartivento to see what had happened there i fear my men are ill the   night was lovely perfectly calm so we lay close to the boat and   signals were continually sent but with no result this morning i had   the cable down to fort gênois in style and now we are picking up odds   and ends of cable between the different breaks and getting our buoys   on board etc tomorrow i expect to leave for spartivento     iv  and now i am quite at an end of journalkeeping diaries and diary letters being things of youth which fleeming had at length outgrown but one or two more fragments from his correspondence may be taken and first this brief sketch of the laying of the norderney cable mainly interesting as showing under what defects of strength and in what extremities of pain this cheerful man must at times continue to go about his work    i slept on board 29th september having arranged everything to start   by daybreak from where we lay in the roads but at daybreak a heavy   mist hung over us so that nothing of land or water could be seen at   midday it lifted suddenly and away we went with perfect weather but   could not find the buoys forde left that evening i saw the captain   was not strong in navigation and took matters next day much more into   my own hands and before nine oclock found the buoys the weather had   been so fine we had anchored in the open sea near texel it took us   till the evening to reach the buoys get the cable on board test the   first half speak to lowestoft make the splice and start h had   not finished his work at norderney so i was alone on board for   reuter moreover the buoys to guide us in our course were not placed   and the captain had very vague ideas about keeping his course so i   had to do a good deal and only lay down as i was for two hours in the   night i managed to run the course perfectly everything went well   and we found norderney just where we wanted it next afternoon and if   the shoreend had been laid could have finished there and then   october 1st but when we got to norderney we found the caroline   with shoreend lying apparently aground and could not understand her   signals so we had to anchor suddenly and i went off in a small boat   with the captain to the caroline it was cold by this time and my   arm was rather stiff and i was tired i hauled myself up on board the   caroline by a rope and found h and two men on board all the   rest were trying to get the shoreend on shore but had failed and   apparently had stuck on shore and the waves were getting up we had   anchored in the right place and next morning we hoped the shoreend   would be laid so we had only to go back it was of course still   colder and quite night i went to bed and hoped to sleep but alas   the rheumatism got into the joints and caused me terrible pain so   that i could not sleep i bore it as long as i could in order to   disturb no one for all were tired but at last i could bear it no   longer and i managed to wake the steward and got a mustard poultice   which took the pain from the shoulder but then the elbow got very   bad and i had to call the second steward and get a second poultice   and then it was daylight and i felt very ill and feverish the sea   was now rather roughtoo rough rather for small boats but luckily a   sort of thing called a scoot came out and we got on board her with   some trouble and got on shore after a good tossing about which made   us all seasick the cable sent from the caroline was just 60 yards   too short and did not reach the shore so although the caroline did   make the splice late that night we could neither test nor speak   reuter was at norderney and i had to do the best i could which was   not much and went to bed early i thought i should never sleep again   but in sheer desperation got up in the middle of the night and gulped   a lot of raw whisky and slept at last but not long a mr f   washed my face and hands and dressed me and we hauled the cable out   of the sea and got it joined to the telegraph station and on october   3rd telegraphed to lowestoft first and then to london miss clara   volkman a niece of mr reuters sent the first message to mrs   reuter who was waiting varley used miss claras hand as a kind of   key and i sent one of the first messages to odden i thought a   message addressed to him would not frighten you and that he would   enjoy a message through papas cable i hope he did they were all   very merry but i had been so lowered by pain that i could not enjoy   myself in spite of the success     v  of the 1869 cruise in the great eastern i give what i am able only sorry it is no more for the sake of the ship itself already almost a legend even to the generation that saw it launched    june 17 1869here are the names of our staff in whom i expect   you to be interested as future great eastern stories may be full of   them theophilus smith a man of latimer clarks leslie c hill my   prizeman at university college lord sackville cecil king one of the   thomsonian kings laws goes for willoughby smith who will also be on   board varley clark and sir james anderson make up the sum of all   you know anything of a captain halpin commands the big ship there   are four smaller vessels the wm cory which laid the norderney   cable has already gone to st pierre to lay the shoreends the   hawk and chiltern have gone to brest to lay shoreends the hawk   and scanderia go with us across the atlantic and we shall at st   pierre be transhipped into one or the other    june 18 somewhere in londonthe shoreend is laid as you may   have seen and we are all under pressing orders to march so we start   from london tonight at 510    june 20 off ushanti am getting quite fond of the big ship   yesterday morning in the quiet sunlight she turned so slowly and   lazily in the great harbour at portland and by and by slipped out   past the long pier with so little stir that i could hardly believe we   were really off no men drunk no women crying no singing or   swearing no confusion or bustle on decknobody apparently aware that   they had anything to do the look of the thing was that the ship had   been spoken to civilly and had kindly undertaken to do everything   that was necessary without any further interference i have a nice   cabin with plenty of room for my legs in my berth and have slept two   nights like a top then we have the ladies cabin set apart as an   engineers office and i think this decidedly the nicest place in the   ship 35 ft × 20 ft broadfour tables three great mirrors plenty   of air and no heat from the funnels which spoil the great   diningroom i saw a whole library of books on the walls when here   last and this made me less anxious to provide light literature but   alas today i find that they are every one bibles or prayerbooks   now one cannot read many hundred bibles as for the motion of the   ship it is not very much but twill suffice thomson shook hands and   wished me well i do like thomson tell austin that the great   eastern has six masts and four funnels when i get back i will make a   little model of her for all the chicks and pay out cotton reels   here we are at 420 at brest we leave probably tomorrow morning    july 12 great easternhere as i write we run our last course for   the buoy at the st pierre shoreend it blows and lightens and our   good ship rolls and buoys are hard to find but we must soon now   finish our work and then this letter will start for home   yesterday we were mournfully groping our way through the wet grey fog   not at all sure where we were with one consort lost and the other   faintly answering the roar of our great whistle through the mist as   to the ship which was to meet us and pioneer us up the deep channel   we did not know if we should come within twenty miles of her when   suddenly up went the fog out came the sun and there straight   ahead was the wm cory our pioneer and a little dancing boat the   gulnare sending signals of welcome with manycoloured flags since   then we have been steaming in a grand procession but now at 2 am   the fog has fallen and the great roaring whistle calls up the distant   answering notes all around us shall we or shall we not find the buoy    july 13all yesterday we lay in the damp dripping fog with   whistles all round and guns firing so that we might not bump up   against one another this little delay has let us get our reports into   tolerable order we are now at seven oclock getting the cable end   again with the main cable buoy close to us    a telegram of july 20i have received your four welcome letters   the americans are charming people     vi  and here to make an end are a few random bits about the cruise to pernambuco    plymouth june 21 1873i have been down to the seashore and   smelt the salt sea and like it and i have seen the hooper pointing   her great bow seaward while light smoke rises from her funnels   telling that the fires are being lighted and sorry as i am to be   without you something inside me answers to the call to be off and   doing    lalla rookh plymouth june 22we have been a little cruise in   the yacht over to the eddystone lighthouse and my sealegs seem very   well on strange how alike all these starts arefirst on shore   steaming hot days with a smell of bonedust and tar and salt water   then the little puffing panting steamlaunch that bustles out across   a port with green woody sides little yachts sliding about menofwar   trainingships and then a great big black hulk of a thing with a mass   of smaller vessels sticking to it like parasites and that is ones   home being coaled then comes the champagne lunch where every one   says all that is polite to every one else and then the uncertainty   when to start so far as we know now we are to start tomorrow   morning at daybreak letters that come later are to be sent to   pernambuco by first mail my father has sent me the heartiest sort   of jack tars cheer    ss hooper off funchal june 29here we are off madeira at   seven oclock in the morning thomson has been sounding with his   special toy ever since halfpast three 1087 fathoms of water i have   been watching the day break and long jagged islands start into being   out of the dull night we are still some miles from land but the sea   is calmer than loch eil often was and the big hooper rests very   contentedly after a pleasant voyage and favourable breezes i have not   been able to do any real work except the testing of the cable for   though not seasick i get a little giddy when i try to think on   board the ducks have just had their daily souse and are quacking   and gabbling in a mighty way outside the door of the captains deck   cabin where i write the cocks are crowing and newlaid eggs are   said to be found in the coops four mild oxen have been untethered and   allowed to walk along the broad iron decksa whole drove of sheep   seem quite content while licking big lumps of bay salt two   exceedingly impertinent goats lead the cook a perfect life of misery   they steal round the galley and will nibble the carrots or turnips   if his back is turned for one minute and then he throws something at   them and misses them and they scuttle off laughing impudently and   flick one ear at him from a safe distance this is the most impudent   gesture i ever saw winking is nothing to it the ear normally hangs   down behind the goat turns sideways to her enemyby a little knowing   cock of the head flicks one ear over one eye and squints from behind   it for half a minutetosses her head back skips a pace or two   further off and repeats the manoeuvre the cook is very fat and   cannot run after that goat much    pernambuco aug 1we landed here yesterday all well and cable   sound after a good passage i am on familiar terms with   cocoanuts mangoes and breadfruit trees but i think i like the   negresses best of anything i have seen in turbans and loose seagreen   robes with beautiful blackbrown complexions and a stately carriage   they really are a satisfaction to my eye the weather has been windy   and rainy the hooper has to lie about a mile from the town in an   open roadstead with the whole swell of the atlantic driving straight   on shore the little steamlaunch gives all who go in her a good   ducking as she bobs about on the big rollers and my old gymnastic   practice stands me in good stead on boarding and leaving her we   clamber down a ropeladder hanging from the high stern and then   taking a rope in one hand swing into the launch at the moment when   she can contrive to steam up under usbobbing about like an apple   thrown into a tub all the while the president of the province and his   suite tried to come off to a state luncheon on board on sunday but   the launch being rather heavily laden behaved worse than usual and   some green seas stove in the presidents hat and made him wetter than   he had probably ever been in his life so after one or two rollers he   turned back and indeed he was wise to do so for i dont see how he   could have got on board being fully convinced that the world will   not continue to go round unless i pay it personal attention i must   run away to my work       chapter vi    18691885     edinburghcolleaguesfarrago vitæi the family circlefleeming    and his

honours fresh interests new friends are not such as will bear to be told at any length or in the temporal order and it is now time to lay narration by and to look at the man he was and the life he lived more largely  edinburgh which was thenceforth to be his home is a metropolitan small town where college professors and the lawyers of the parliament house give the tone and persons of leisure attracted by educational advantages make up much of the bulk of society not therefore an unlettered place yet not pedantic edinburgh will compare favourably with much larger cities a hard and disputatious element has been commented on by strangers it would not touch fleeming who was himself regarded even in this metropolis of disputation as a thorny tablemate to golf unhappily he did not take and golf is a cardinal virtue in the city of the winds nor did he become an archer of the queens body guard which is the chiltern hundreds of the distasted golfer he did not even frequent the evening club where his colleague tait in my day was so punctual and so genial so that in some ways he stood outside of the lighter and kindlier life of his new home i should not like to say that he was generally popular but there as elsewhere those who knew him well enough to love him loved him well and he upon his side liked a place where a dinnerparty was not of necessity unintellectual and where men stood up to him in argument  the presence of his old classmate tait26 was one of his early attractions to the chair and now that fleeming is gone again tait still remains ruling and really teaching his great classes sir robert christison was an old friend of his mothers sir alexander grant kelland and sellar were new acquaintances and highly valued and these too all but the last27 have been taken from their friends and labours death has been busy in the senatus i will speak elsewhere of fleemings demeanour to his students and it will be enough to add here that his relations with his colleagues in general were pleasant to himself  edinburgh then with its society its university work its delightful scenery and its skating in the winter was thenceforth his base of operations but he shot meanwhile erratic in many directions twice to america as we have seen on telegraph voyages continually to london on business often to paris year after year to the highlands to shoot to fish to learn reels and gaelic to make the acquaintance and fall in love with the character of highlanders and once to styria to hunt chamois and dance with peasant maidens all the while he was pursuing the course of his electrical studies making fresh inventions taking up the phonograph filled with theories of graphic representation reading writing publishing founding sanitary associations interested in technical education investigating the laws of metre drawing acting directing private theatricals going a long way to see an actora long way to see a picture in the very bubble of the tideway of contemporary interests and all the while he was busied about his father and mother his wife and in particular his sons anxiously watching anxiously guiding these and plunging with his whole fund of youthfulness into their sports and interests and all the while he was himself maturingnot in character or body for these remained youngbut in the stocked mind in the tolerant knowledge of life and man in pious acceptance of the universe here is a farrago for a chapter here is a world of interests and activities human artistic social scientific at each of which he sprang with impetuous pleasure on each of which he squandered energy the arrow drawn to the head the whole intensity of his spirit bent for the moment on the momentary purpose it was this that lent such unusual interest to his society so that no friend of his can forget that figure of fleeming coming charged with some new discovery it is this that makes his character so difficult to represent our fathers upon some difficult theme would invoke the muse i can but appeal to the imagination of the reader when i dwell upon some one thing he must bear in mind it was only one of a score that the unweariable brain was teeming at the very time with other thoughts that the good heart had left no kind duty forgotten     i  in edinburgh for a considerable time fleemings family to three generations was united mr and mrs austin at hailes captain and mrs jenkin in the suburb of merchiston fleeming himself in the city it is not every family that could risk with safety such close interdomestic dealings but in this also fleeming was particularly favoured even the two extremes mr austin and the captain drew together it is pleasant to find that each of the old gentlemen set a high value on the good looks of the other doubtless also on his own and a fine picture they made as they walked the green terrace at hailes conversing by the hour what they talked of is still a mystery to those who knew them but mr austin always declared that on these occasions he learned much to both of these families of elders due service was paid of attention to both fleemings easy circumstances had brought joy and the eyes of all were on the grandchildren in fleemings scheme of duties those of the family stood first a man was first of all a child nor did he cease to be so but only took on added obligations when he became in turn a father the care of his parents was always a first thought with him and their gratification his delight and the care of his sons as it was always a grave subject of study with him and an affair never neglected so it brought him a thousand satisfactions hard work they are as he once wrote but what fit work and again o its a cold house where a dog is the only representative of a child not that dogs were despised we shall drop across the name of jack the harumscarum irish terrier ere we have done his own dog plato went up with him daily to his lectures and still like other friends feels the loss and looks visibly for the reappearance of his master and martin the cat fleeming has himself immortalised to the delight of mr swinburne in the columns of the spectator indeed there was nothing in which men take interest in which he took not some and yet always most in the strong human bonds ancient as the race and woven of delights and duties  he was even an anxious father perhaps that is the part where optimism is hardest tested he was eager for his sons eager for their health whether of mind or body eager for their education in that i should have thought too eager but he kept a pleasant face upon all things believed in play loved it himself shared boyishly in theirs and knew how to put a face of entertainment upon business and a spirit of education into entertainment if he was to test the progress of the three boys this advertisement would appear in their little manuscript papernotice the professor of engineering in the university of edinburgh intends at the close of the scholastic year to hold examinations in the following subjects 1 for boys in the fourth class of the academygeometry and algebra 2 for boys at mr hendersons schooldictation and recitation 3 for boys taught exclusively by their mothersarithmetic and reading prizes were given but what prize would be so conciliatory as this boyish little joke it may read thin here it would smack racily in the playroom whenever his sons started a new fad as one of them writes to me they had only to tell him about it and he was at once interested and keen to help he would discourage them in nothing unless it was hopelessly too hard for them only if there was any principle of science involved they must understand the principle and whatever was attempted that was to be done thoroughly if it was but play if it was but a puppetshow they were to build he set them the example of being no sluggard in play when frewen the second son embarked on the ambitious design to make an engine for a toy steamboat fleeming made him begin with a proper drawingdoubtless to the disgust of the young engineer but once that foundation laid helped in the work with unflagging gusto tinkering away for hours and assisted at the final trial in the big bath with no less excitement than the boy he would take any amount of trouble to help us writes my correspondent we never felt an affair was complete till we had called him to see and he would come at any time in the middle of any work there was indeed one recognised playhour immediately after the despatch of the days letters and the boys were to be seen waiting on the stairs until the mail should be ready and the fun could begin but at no other time did this busy man suffer his work to interfere with that first duty to his children and there is a pleasant tale of the inventive master frewen engaged at the time upon a toy crane bringing to the study where his father sat at work a halfwound reel that formed some part of his design and observing papa you might finiss windin this for me i am so very busy today  i put together here a few brief extracts from fleemings letters none very important in itself but all together building up a pleasant picture of the father with his sons    jan 15th 1875frewen contemplates suspending soapbubbles by   silk threads for experimental purposes i dont think he will manage   that bernard the youngest volunteered to blow the bubbles with   enthusiasm    jan 17thi am learning a great deal of electrostatics in   consequence of the perpetual crossexamination to which i am   subjected i long for you on many grounds but one is that i may not   be obliged to deliver a running lecture on abstract points of science   subject to crossexamination by two acute students bernie does not   crossexamine much but if any one gets discomfited he laughs a sort   of little silverwhistle giggle which is trying to the unhappy   blunderer    may 9thfrewen is deep in parachutes i beg him not to drop from   the top landing in one of his own making    june 6th 1876frewens crank axle is a failure just at   presentbut he bears up    june 14ththe boys enjoy their riding it gets them whole funds   of adventures one of their caps falling off is matter for delightful   reminiscences and when a horse breaks his step the occurrence   becomes a rear a shy or a plunge as they talk it over austin with   quiet confidence speaks of the greater pleasure in riding a spirited   horse even if he does give a little trouble it is the stolid brute   that he dislikes nbyou can still see six inches between him and   the saddle when his pony trots i listen and sympathise and throw out   no hint that their achievements are not really great    june 18thbernard is much impressed by the fact that i can be   useful to frewen about the steamboat which the latter irrepressible   inventor was making he says quite with awe he would not have got   on nearly so well if you had not helped him    june 27thi do not see what i could do without austin he talks   so pleasantly and is so truly good all through    july 7thmy chief difficulty with austin is to get him measured   for a pair of trousers hitherto i have failed but i keep a stout   heart and mean to succeed frewen the observer in describing the   paces of two horses says polly takes twentyseven steps to get   round the school i couldnt count sophy but she takes more than a   hundred    feb 18th 1877we all feel very lonely without you frewen had   to come up and sit in my room for company last night and i actually   kissed him a thing that has not occurred for years jack poor   fellow bears it as well as he can and has taken the opportunity of   having a fester on his foot so he is lame and has it bathed and   this occupies his thoughts a good deal    feb 19thas to mill austin has not got the list yet i think it   will prejudice him very much against millbut that is not my affair   education of that kind i would as soon cram my boys with food and   boast of the pounds they had eaten as cram them with literature  but if fleeming was an anxious father he did not suffer his anxiety to prevent the boys from any manly or even dangerous pursuit whatever it might occur to them to try he would carefully show them how to do it explain the risks and then either share the danger himself or if that were not possible stand aside and wait the event with that unhappy courage of the lookeron he was a good swimmer and taught them to swim he thoroughly loved all manly exercises and during their holidays and principally in the highlands helped and encouraged them to excel in as many as possible to shoot to fish to walk to pull an oar to hand reef and steer and to run a steamlaunch in all of these and in all parts of highland life he shared delightedly he was well on to forty when he took once more to shooting he was fortythree when he killed his first salmon but no boy could have more singlemindedly rejoiced in these pursuits his growing love for the highland character perhaps also a sense of the difficulty of the task led him to take up at fortyone the study of gaelic in which he made some shadow of progress but not much the fastnesses of that elusive speech retaining to the last their independence at the house of his friend mrs blackburn who plays the part of a highland lady as to the manner born he learned the delightful custom of kitchen dances which became the rule at his own house and brought him into yet nearer contact with his neighbours and thus at fortytwo he began to learn the reel a study to which he brought his usual smiling earnestness and the steps diagrammatically represented by his own hand are before me as i write  it was in 1879 that a new feature was added to the highland life a steamlaunch called the purgle the styrian corruption of walpurga after a friend to be hereafter mentioned the steamlaunch goes fleeming wrote i wish you had been present to describe two scenes of which she has been the occasion already one during which the population of ullapool to a baby was harnessed to her hurrahingand the other in which the same population sat with its legs over a little pier watching frewen and bernie getting up steam for the first time the purgle was got with educational intent and it served its purpose so well and the boys knew their business so practically that when the summer was at an end fleeming mrs jenkin frewen the engineer bernard the stoker and kenneth robertson a highland seaman set forth in her to make the passage south the first morning they got from loch broom into gruinard bay where they lunched upon an island but the wind blowing up in the afternoon with sheets of rain it was found impossible to beat to sea and very much in the situation of castaways upon an unknown coast the party landed at the mouth of gruinard river a shootinglodge was spied among the trees there fleeming went and though the master mr murray was from home though the two jenkin boys were of course as black as colliers and all the castaways so wetted through that as they stood in the passage pools formed about their feet and ran before them into the house yet mrs murray kindly entertained them for the night on the morrow however visitors were to arrive there would be no room and in so outoftheway a spot most probably no food for the crew of the purgle and on the morrow about noon with the bay white with spindrift and the wind so strong that one could scarcely stand against it they got up steam and skulked under the land as far as sanda bay here they crept into a seaside cave and cooked some food but the weather now freshening to a gale it was plain they must moor the launch where she was and find their way overland to some place of shelter even to get their baggage from on board was no light business for the dingy was blown so far to leeward every trip that they must carry her back by hand along the beach but this once managed and a cart procured in the neighbourhood they were able to spend the night in a pothouse at ault bea next day the sea was unapproachable but the next they had a pleasant passage to poolewe hugging the cliffs the falling swell bursting close by them in the gullies and the black scarts that sat like ornaments on the top of every stack and pinnacle looking down into the purgle as she passed the climate of scotland had not done with them yet for three days they lay stormstayed in poolewe and when they put to sea on the morning of the fourth the sailors prayed them for gods sake not to attempt the passage their setting out was indeed merely tentative but presently they had gone too far to return and found themselves committed to double rhu reay with a foul wind and a cross sea from halfpast eleven in the morning until halfpast five at night they were in immediate and unceasing danger upon the least mishap the purgle must either have been swamped by the seas or bulged upon the cliffs of that rude headland fleeming and robertson took turns baling and steering mrs jenkin so violent was the commotion of the boat held on with both hands frewen by robertsons direction ran the engine slacking and pressing her to meet the seas and bernard only twelve years old deadly seasick and continually thrown against the boiler so that he was found next day to be covered with burns yet kept an even fire it was a very thankful party that sat down that evening to meat in the hotel at gairloch and perhaps although the thing was new in the family no one was much surprised when fleeming said grace over that meal thenceforward he continued to observe the form so that there was kept alive in his house a grateful memory of peril and deliverance but there was nothing of the muff in fleeming he thought it a good thing to escape death but a becoming and a healthful thing to run the risk of it and what is rarer that which he thought for himself he thought for his family also in spite of the terrors of rhu reay the cruise was persevered in and brought to an end under happier conditions  one year instead of the highlands altaussee in the steiermark was chosen for the holidays and the place the people and the life delighted fleeming he worked hard at german which he had much forgotten since he was a boy and what is highly characteristic equally hard at the patois in which he learned to excel he won a prize at a schützenfest and though he hunted chamois without much success brought down more interesting game in the shape of the styrian peasants and in particular of his gillie joseph this joseph was much of a character and his appreciations of fleeming have a fine note of their own the bringing up of the boys he deigned to approve of fast so gut wie ein bauer was his trenchant criticism the attention and courtly respect with which fleeming surrounded his wife was something of a puzzle to the philosophic gillie he announced in the village that mrs jenkindie silberne frau as the folk had prettily named her from some silver ornamentswas a geborene gräfin who had married beneath her and when fleeming explained what he called the english theory though indeed it was quite his own of married relations joseph admiring but unconvinced avowed it was gar schön josephs cousin walpurga moser to an orchestra of clarionet and zither taught the family the country dances the steierisch and the ländler and gained their hearts during the lessons her sister loys too who was up at the alp with the cattle came down to church on sundays made acquaintance with the jenkins and must have them up to see the sunrise from her house upon the loser where they had supper and all slept in the loft among the hay the mosers were not lost sight of walpurga still corresponds with mrs jenkin and it was a late pleasure of fleemings to choose and despatch a wedding present for his little mountain friend this visit was brought to an end by a ball in the big inn parlour the refreshments chosen the list of guests drawn up by joseph the best music of the place in attendance and hosts and guests in their best clothes the ball was opened by mrs jenkin dancing steierisch with a lordly bauer in grey and silver and with a plumed hat and fleeming followed with walpurga moser  there ran a principle through all these holiday pleasures in styria as in the highlands the same course was followed fleeming threw himself as fully as he could into the life and occupations of the native people studying everywhere their dances and their language and conforming always with pleasure to their rustic etiquette just as the ball at altaussee was designed for the taste of joseph the parting feast at attadale was ordered in every particular to the taste of murdoch the keeper fleeming was not one of the common socalled gentlemen who take the tricks of their own coterie to be eternal principles of taste he was aware on the other hand that rustic people dwelling in their own places follow ancient rules with fastidious precision and are easily shocked and embarrassed by what if they used the word they would have to call the vulgarity of visitors from town and he who was so cavalier with men of his own class was sedulous to shield the more tender feelings of the peasant he who could be so trying in a drawingroom was even punctilious in the cottage it was in all respects a happy virtue it renewed his life during these holidays in all particulars it often entertained him with the discovery of strange survivals as when by the orders of murdoch mrs jenkin must publicly taste of every dish before it was set before her guests and thus to throw himself into a fresh life and a new school of manners was a grateful exercise of fleemings mimetic instinct and to the pleasures of the open air of hardships supported of dexterities improved and displayed and of plain and elegant society added a spice of drama     ii  fleeming was all his life a lover of the play and all that belonged to it dramatic literature he knew fully he was one of the not very numerous people who can read a play a knack the fruit of much knowledge and some imagination comparable to that of reading score few men better understood the artificial principles on which a play is good or bad few more unaffectedly enjoyed a piece of any merit of construction his own play was conceived with a double design for he had long been filled with his theory of the true story of griselda used to gird at father chaucer for his misconception and was perhaps first of all moved by the desire to do justice to the marquis of saluces and perhaps only in the second place by the wish to treat a story as he phrased it like a sum in arithmetic i do not think he quite succeeded but i must own myself no fit judge fleeming and i were teacher and taught as to the principles disputatious rivals in the practice of dramatic writing  acting had always ever since rachel and the marseillaise a particular power on him if i do not cry at the play he used to say i want to have my money back even from a poor play with poor actors he could draw pleasure glacomettis elisabetta i find him writing fetched the house vastly poor queen elizabeth and yet it was a little good and again after a night of salvini i do not suppose any one with feelings could sit out othello if iago and desdemona were acted salvini was in his view the greatest actor he had seen we were all indeed moved and bettered by the visit of that wonderful mani declare i feel as if i could pray cried one of us on the return from hamletthat is prayer said fleeming w b hole and i in a fine enthusiasm of gratitude determined to draw up an address to salvini did so and carried it to fleeming and i shall never forget with what coldness he heard and deleted the eloquence of our draft nor with what spirit our vanities once properly mortified he threw himself into the business of collecting signatures it was his part on the ground of his italian to see and arrange with the actor it was mine to write in the academy a notice of the first performance of macbeth fleeming opened the paper read so far and flung it on the floor no he cried that wont do you were thinking of yourself not of salvini the criticism was shrewd as usual but it was unfair through ignorance it was not of myself that i was thinking but of the difficulties of my trade which i had not well mastered another unalloyed dramatic pleasure which fleeming and i shared the year of the paris exposition was the marquis de villemer that blameless play performed by madeleine brohan delaunay worms and broisatan actress in such parts at least to whom i have never seen full justice rendered he had his fill of weeping on that occasion and when the piece was at an end in front of a café in the mild midnight air we had our fill of talk about the art of acting  but what gave the stage so strong a hold on fleeming was an inheritance from norwich from edward barren and from enfield of the speaker the theatre was one of edward barrens elegant hobbies he read plays as became enfields soninlaw with a good discretion he wrote plays for his family in which eliza barron used to shine in the chief parts and later in life after the norwich home was broken up his little granddaughter would sit behind him in a great armchair and be introduced with his stately elocution to the world of dramatic literature from this in a direct line we can deduce the charades at claygate and after money came in the edinburgh days that private theatre which took up so much of fleemings energy and thought the companymr and mrs r o carter of colwall w b hole captain charles douglas mr kunz mr burnett professor lewis campbell mr charles baxter and many moremade a charming society for themselves and gave pleasure to their audience mr carter in sir toby belch it would be hard to beat mr hole in broad farce or as the herald in the trachiniæ showed true stage talent as for mrs jenkin it was for her the rest of us existed and were forgiven her powers were an endless spring of pride and pleasure to her husband he spent hours hearing and schooling her in private and when it came to the performance though there was perhaps no one in the audience more critical none was more moved than fleeming the rest of us did not aspire so high there were always five performances and weeks of busy rehearsal and whether we came to sit and stifle as the prompter to be the dumb or rather the inarticulate recipients of carters dog whip in the taming of the shrew or having earned our spurs to lose one more illusion in a leading part we were always sure at least of a long and an exciting holiday in mirthful company  in this laborious annual diversion fleemings part was large i never thought him an actor but he was something of a mimic which stood him in stead thus he had seen got in poirier and his own poirier when he came to play it breathed meritoriously of the model the last part i saw him play was triplet and at first i thought it promised well but alas the boys went for a holiday missed a train and were not heard of at home till late at night poor fleeming the man who never hesitated to give his sons a chisel or a gun or to send them abroad in a canoe or on a horse toiled all day at his rehearsal growing hourly paler triplet growing hourly less meritorious and though the return of the children none the worse for their little adventure brought the colour back into his face it could not restore him to his part i remember finding him seated on the stairs in some rare moment of quiet during the subsequent performances hullo jenkin said i you look down in the mouth my dear boy said he havent you heard me i have not had one decent intonation from beginning to end  but indeed he never supposed himself an actor took a part when he took any merely for convenience as one takes a hand at whist and found his true service and pleasure in the more congenial business of the manager augier racine shakespeare aristophanes in hookham freres translation sophocles and Æschylus in lewis campbells such were some of the authors whom he introduced to his public in putting these upon the stage he found a thousand exercises for his ingenuity and taste a thousand problems arising which he delighted to study a thousand opportunities to make those infinitesimal improvements which are so much in art and for the artist our first greek play had been costumed by the professional costumier with unforgettable results of comicality and indecorum the second the trachiniæ of sophocles he took in hand himself and a delightful task he made of it his study was then in antiquarian books where he found confusion and on statues and basreliefs where he at last found clearness after an hour or so at the british museum he was able to master the chitôn sleeves and all and before the time was ripe he had a theory of greek tailoring at his fingers ends and had all the costumes made under his eye as a greek tailor would have made them the greeks made the best plays and the best statues and were the best architects of course they were the best tailors too said he and was never weary when he could find a tolerant listener of dwelling on the simplicity the economy the elegance both of means and effect which made their system so delightful  but there is another side to the stagemanagers employment the discipline of acting is detestable the failures and triumphs of that business appeal too directly to the vanity and even in the course of a careful amateur performance such as ours much of the smaller side of man will be displayed fleeming among conflicting vanities and levities played his part to my admiration he had his own view he might be wrong but the performances he would remind us were after all his and he must decide he was in this as in all other things an iron taskmaster sparing not himself nor others if you were going to do it at all he would see that it was done as well as you were able i have known him to keep two culprits and one of these his wife repeating the same action and the same two or three words for a whole weary afternoon and yet he gained and retained warm feelings from far the most of those who fell under his domination and particularly it is pleasant to remember from the girls after the slipshod training and the incomplete accomplishments of a girls school there was something at first annoying at last exciting and bracing in this high standard of accomplishment and perseverance     iii  it did not matter why he entered upon any study or employment whether for amusement like the greek tailoring or the highland reels whether from a desire to serve the public as with his sanitary work or in the view of benefiting poorer men as with his labours for technical education he pitched into it as he would have said himself with the same headlong zest i give in the appendix28 a letter from colonel fergusson which tells fully the nature of the sanitary work and of fleemings part and success in it it will be enough to say here that it was a scheme of protection against the blundering of builders and the dishonesty of plumbers started with an eye rather to the houses of the rich fleeming hoped his sanitary associations would soon extend their sphere of usefulness and improve the dwellings of the poor in this hope he was disappointed but in all other ways the scheme exceedingly prospered associations sprang up and continue to spring up in many quarters and wherever tried they have been found of use  here then was a serious employment it has proved highly useful to mankind and it was begun besides in a mood of bitterness under the shock of what fleeming would so sensitively feelthe death of a whole family of children yet it was gone upon like a holiday jaunt i read in colonel fergussons letter that his schoolmates bantered him when he began to broach his scheme so did i at first and he took the banter as he always did with enjoyment until he suddenly posed me with the question and now do you see any other jokes to make well then said he thats all right i wanted you to have your fun out first now we can be serious and then with a glowing heat of pleasure he laid his plans before me revelling in the details revelling in hope it was as he wrote about the joy of electrical experiment what shall i compare them toa new song a greek play delight attended the exercise of all his powers delight painted the future of these ideal visions some as i have said failed of their fruition and the illusion was characteristic fleeming believed we had only to make a virtue cheap and easy and then all would practise it that for an end unquestionably good men would not grudge a little trouble and a little money though they might stumble at laborious pains and generous sacrifices he could not believe in any resolute badness i cannot quite say he wrote in his young manhood that i think there is no sin or misery this i can say i do not remember one single malicious act done to myself in fact it is rather awkward when i have to say the lords prayer i have nobodys trespasses to forgive and to the point i remember one of our discussions i said it was a dangerous error not to admit there were bad people he that it was only a confession of blindness on our part and that we probably called others bad only so far as we were wrapped in ourselves and lacking in the transmigratory forces of imagination i undertook to describe to him three persons irredeemably bad and whom he should admit to be so in the first case he denied my evidence you cannot judge a man upon such testimony said he for the second he owned it made him sick to hear the tale but then there was no spark of malice it was mere weakness i had described and he had never denied nor thought to set a limit to mans weakness at my third gentleman he struck his colours yes said he im afraid that is a bad man and then looking at me shrewdly i wonder if it isnt a very unfortunate thing for you to have met him i showed him radiantly how it was the world we must know the world as it was not a world expurgated and prettified with optimistic rainbows yes yes said he but this badness is such an easy lazy explanation wont you be tempted to use it instead of trying to understand people  in the year 1878 he took a passionate fancy for the phonograph it was a toy after his heart a toy that touched the skirts of life art and science a toy prolific of problems and theories something fell to be done for a university cricketground bazaar and the thought struck him mr ewing writes to me to exhibit edisons phonograph then the very newest scientific marvel the instrument itself was not to be purchasedi think no specimen had then crossed the atlanticbut a copy of the times with an account of it was at hand and by the help of this we made a phonograph which to our great joy talked and talked too with the purest american accent it was so good that a second instrument was got ready forthwith both were shown at the bazaar one by mrs jenkin to people willing to pay half a crown for a private view and the privilege of hearing their own voices while jenkin perfervid as usual gave halfhourly lectures on the other in an adjoining roomi as his lieutenant taking turns the thing was in its way a little triumph a few of the visitors were deaf and hugged the belief that they were the victims of a new kind of fancyfair swindle of the others many who came to scoff remained to take raffle tickets and one of the phonographs was finally disposed of in this way the other remained in fleemings hands and was a source of infinite occupation once it was sent to london to bring back on the tinfoil the tones of a lady distinguished for clear vocalisation at another time sir robert christison was brought in to contribute his powerful bass and there scarcely came a visitor about the house but he was made the subject of experiment the visitors i am afraid took their parts lightly mr hole and i with unscientific laughter commemorating various shades of scottish accent or proposing to teach the poor dumb animal to swear but fleeming and mr ewing when we butterflies were gone were laboriously ardent many thoughts that occupied the later years of my friend were caught from the small utterance of that toy thence came his inquiries into the roots of articulate language and the foundations of literary art his papers on vowelsounds his papers in the saturday review upon the laws of verse and many a strange approximation many a just note thrown out in talk and now forgotten i pass over dozens of his interests and dwell on this trifling matter of the phonograph because it seems to me that it depicts the man so for fleeming one thing joined into another the greater with the less he cared not where it was he scratched the surface of the ultimate mysteryin the childs toy in the great tragedy in the laws of the tempest or in the properties of energy or masscertain that whatever he touched it was a part of lifeand however he touched it there would flow for his happy constitution interest and delight all fables have their morals says thoreau but the innocent enjoy the story there is a truth represented for the imagination in those lines of a noble poem where we are told that in our highest hours of visionary clearness we can but          see the children sport upon the shore   and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore  to this clearness fleeming had attained and although he heard the voice of the eternal seas and weighed its message he was yet able until the end of his life to sport upon these shores of death and mystery with the gaiety and innocence of children     iv  it was as a student that i first knew fleeming as one of that modest number of young men who sat under his ministrations in a soulchilling classroom at the top of the university buildings his presence was against him as a professor no one least of all students would have been moved to respect him at first sight rather short in stature markedly plain boyishly young in manner cocking his head like a terrier with every mark of the most engaging vivacity and readiness to be pleased full of words full of paradox a stranger could scarcely fail to look at him twice a man thrown with him in a train could scarcely fail to be engaged by him in talk but a student would never regard him as academical yet he had that fibre in him that order always existed in his classroom i do not remember that he ever addressed me in language at the least sign of unrest his eye would fall on me and i was quelled such a feat is comparatively easy in a small class but i have misbehaved in smaller classes and under eyes more olympian than fleeming jenkins he was simply a man from whose reproof one shrank in manner the least buckramed of mankind he had in serious moments an extreme dignity of goodness so it was that he obtained a power over the most insubordinate of students but a power of which i was myself unconscious i was inclined to regard any professor as a joke and fleeming as a particularly good joke perhaps the broadest in the vast pleasantry of my curriculum i was not able to follow his lectures i somehow dared not misconduct myself as was my customary solace and i refrained from attending this brought me at the end of the session into a relation with my contemned professor that completely opened my eyes during the year bad student as i was he had shown a certain leaning to my society i had been to his house he had asked me to take a humble part in his theatricals i was a master in the art of extracting a certificate even at the cannons mouth and i was under no apprehension but when i approached fleeming i found myself in another world he would have naught of me it is quite useless for you to come to me mr stevenson there may be doubtful cases there is no doubt about yours you have simply not attended my class the document was necessary to me for family considerations and presently i stooped to such pleadings and rose to such adjurations as make my ears burn to remember he was quite unmoved he had no pity for meyou are no fool said he and you chose your course i showed him that he had misconceived his duty that certificates were things of form attendance a matter of taste two things he replied had been required for graduation a certain competency proved in the final trials and a certain period of genuine training proved by certificate if he did as i desired not less than if he gave me hints for an examination he was aiding me to steal a degree you see mr stevenson these are the laws and i am here to apply them said he i could not say but that this view was tenable though it was new to me i changed my attack it was only for my fathers eye that i required his signature it need never go to the senatus i had already certificates enough to justify my years attendance bring them to me i cannot take your word for that said he then i will consider the next day i came charged with my certificates a humble assortment and when he had satisfied himself remember said he that i can promise nothing but i will try to find a form of words he did find one and i am still ashamed when i think of his shame in giving me that paper he made no reproach in speech but his manner was the more eloquent it told me plainly what a dirty business we were on and i went from his presence with my certificate indeed in my possession but with no answerable sense of triumph that was the bitter beginning of my love for fleeming i never thought lightly of him afterwards  once and once only after our friendship was truly founded did we come to a considerable difference it was by the rules of poor humanity my fault and his i had been led to dabble in society journalism and this coming to his ears he felt it like a disgrace upon himself so far he was exactly in the right but he was scarce happily inspired when he broached the subject at his own table and before guests who were strangers to me it was the sort of error he was always ready to repent but always certain to repeat and on this occasion he spoke so freely that i soon made an excuse and left the house with the firm purpose of returning no more about a month later i met him at dinner at a common friends now said he on the stairs i engage youlike a lady to dancefor the end of the evening you have no right to quarrel with me and not give me a chance i have often said and thought that fleeming had no tact he belied the opinion then i remember perfectly how so soon as we could get together he began his attack you may have grounds of quarrel with me you have none against mrs jenkin and before i say another word i want you to promise you will come to her house as usual an interview thus begun could have but one ending if the quarrel were the fault of both the merit of reconciliation was entirely fleemings  when our intimacy first began coldly enough accidentally enough on his part he had still something of the puritan something of the inhuman narrowness of the good youth it fell from him slowly year by year as he continued to ripen and grow milder and understand more generously the mingled characters of men in the early days he once read me a bitter lecture and i remember leaving his house in a fine spring afternoon with the physical darkness of despair upon my eyesight long after he made me a formal retractation of the sermon and a formal apology for the pain he had inflicted adding drolly but truly you see at that time i was so much younger than you and yet even in those days there was much to learn from him and above all his fine spirit of piety bravely and trustfully accepting life and his singular delight in the heroic  his piety was indeed a thing of chief importance his views as they are called upon religious matters varied much and he could never be induced to think them more or less than views all dogma is to me mere form he wrote dogmas are mere blind struggles to express the inexpressible i cannot conceive that any single proposition whatever in religion is true in the scientific sense and yet all the while i think the religious view of the world is the most true view try to separate from the mass of their statements that which is common to socrates isaiah david st bernard the jansenists luther mahomet bunyanyes and george eliot of course you do not believe that this something could be written down in a set of propositions like euclid neither will you deny that there is something common and this something very valuable i shall be sorry if the boys ever give a moments thought to the question of what community they belong toi hope they will belong to the great community i should observe that as time went on his conformity to the church in which he was born grew more complete and his views drew nearer the conventional the longer i live my dear louis he wrote but a few months before his death the more convinced i become of a direct care by godwhich is reasonably impossiblebut there it is and in his last year he took the communion  but at the time when i fell under his influence he stood more aloof and this made him the more impressive to a youthful atheist he had a keen sense of language and its imperial influence on men language contained all the great and sound metaphysics he was wont to say and a word once made and generally understood he thought a real victory of man and reason but he never dreamed it could be accurate knowing that words stand symbol for the indefinable i came to him once with a problem which had puzzled me out of measure what is a cause why out of so many innumerable millions of conditions all necessary should one be singled out and ticketed the cause you do not understand said he a cause is the answer to a question it designates that condition which i happen to know and you happen not to know it was thus with partial exception of the mathematical that he thought of all means of reasoning they were in his eyes but means of communication so to be understood so to be judged and only so far to be credited the mathematical he made i say exception of number and measure he believed in to the extent of their significance but that significance he was never weary of reminding you was slender to the verge of nonentity science was true because it told us almost nothing with a few abstractions it could deal and deal correctly conveying honestly faint truths apply its means to any concrete fact of life and this high dialect of the wise became a childish jargon  thus the atheistic youth was met at every turn by a scepticism more complete than his own so that the very weapons of the fight were changed in his grasp to swords of paper certainly the church is not right he would argue but certainly not the antichurch either men are not such fools as to be wholly in the wrong nor yet are they so placed as to be ever wholly in the right somewhere in mid air between the disputants like hovering victory in some design of a greek battle the truth hangs undiscerned and in the meanwhile what matter these uncertainties right is very obvious a great consent of the best of mankind a loud voice within us whether of god or whether by inheritance and in that case still from god guide and command us in the path of duty he saw life very simple he did not love refinements he was a friend to much conformity in unessentials for he would argue it is in this life as it stands about us that we are given our problem the manners of the day are the colours of our palette they condition they constrain us and a man must be very sure he is in the right must in a favourite phrase of his be either very wise or very vain to break with any general consent in ethics i remember taking his advice upon some point of conduct now he said how do you suppose christ would have advised you and when i had answered that he would not have counselled me anything unkind or cowardly no he said with one of his shrewd strokes at the weakness of his hearer nor anything amusing later in life he made less certain in the field of ethics the old story of the knowledge of good and evil is a very true one i find him writing only he goes on the effect of the original dose is much worn out leaving adams descendants with the knowledge that there is such a thingbut uncertain where his growing sense of this ambiguity made him less swift to condemn but no less stimulating in counsel you grant yourself certain freedoms very well he would say i want to see you pay for them some other way you positively cannot do this then there positively must be something else that you can do and i want to see you find that out and do it fleeming would never suffer you to think that you were living if there were not somewhere in your life some touch of heroism to do or to endure  this was his rarest quality far on in middle age when men begin to lie down with the bestial goddesses comfort and respectability the strings of his nature still sounded as high a note as a young mans he loved the harsh voice of duty like a call to battle he loved courage enterprise brave natures a brave word an ugly virtue everything that lifts us above the table where we eat or the bed we sleep upon this with no touch of the motivemonger or the ascetic he loved his virtues to be practical his heroes to be great eaters of beef he loved the jovial heracles loved the astute odysseus not the robespierres and wesleys a fine buoyant sense of life and of mans unequal character ran through all his thoughts he could not tolerate the spirit of the pickthank being what we are he wished us to see others with a generous eye of admiration not with the smallness of the seeker after faults if there shone anywhere a virtue no matter how incongruously set it was upon the virtue we must fix our eyes i remember having found much entertainment in voltaires saül and telling him what seemed to me the drollest touches he heard me out as usual when displeased and then opened fire on me with redhot shot to belittle a noble story was easy it was not literature it was not art it was not morality there was no sustenance in such a form of jesting there was in his favourite phrase no nitrogenous food in such literature and then he proceeded to show what a fine fellow david was and what a hard knot he was in about bathsheba so that the initial wrong committed honour might well hesitate in the choice of conduct and what owls those people were who marvelled because an eastern tyrant had killed uriah instead of marvelling that he had not killed the prophet also now if voltaire had helped me to feel that said he i could have seen some fun in it he loved the comedy which shows a hero human and yet leaves him a hero and the laughter which does not lessen love  it was this taste for what is fine in humankind that ruled his choice in books these should all strike a high note whether brave or tender and smack of the open air the noble and simple presentation of things noble and simple that was the nitrogenous food of which he spoke so much which he sought so eagerly enjoyed so royally he wrote to an author the first part of whose story he had seen with sympathy hoping that it might continue in the same vein that this may be so he wrote i long with the longing of david for the water of bethlehem but no man need die for the water a poet can give and all can drink it to the end of time and their thirst be quenched and the pool never dryand the thirst and the water are both blessed it was in the greeks particularly that he found this blessed water he loved a fresh air which he found about the greek things even in translations he loved their freedom from the mawkish and the rancid the tale of david in the bible the odyssey sophocles Æschylus shakespeare scott old dumas in his chivalrous note dickens rather than thackeray and the tale of two cities out of dickens such were some of his preferences to ariosto and boccaccio he was always faithful burnt njal was a late favourite and he found at least a passing entertainment in the arcadia and the grand cyrus george eliot he outgrew finding her latterly only sawdust in the mouth but her influence while it lasted was great and must have gone some way to form his mind he was easily set on edge however by didactic writing and held that books should teach no other lesson but what real life would teach were it as vividly presented again it was the thing made that took him the drama in the book to the book itself to any merit of the making he was long strangely blind he would prefer the agamemnon in the prose of mr buckley ay to keats but he was his mothers son learning to the last he told me one day that literature was not a trade that it was no craft that the professed author was merely an amateur with a doorplate very well said i the first time you get a proof i will demonstrate that it is as much a trade as bricklaying and that you do not know it by the very next post a proof came i opened it with fear for he was indeed a formidable amateur always wrote brightly because he always thought trenchantly and sometimes wrote brilliantly as the worst of whistlers may sometimes stumble on a perfect intonation but it was all for the best in the interests of his education and i was able over that proof to give him a quarter of an hour such as fleeming loved both to give and to receive his subsequent training passed out of my hands into those of our common friend w e henley henley and i he wrote have fairly good times wigging one another for not doing better i wig him because he wont try to write a real play and he wigs me because i cant try to write english when i next saw him he was full of his new acquisitions and yet i have lost something too he said regretfully up to now scott seemed to me quite perfect he was all i wanted since i have been learning this confounded thing i took up one of the novels and a great deal of it is both careless and clumsy     v  he spoke four languages with freedom not even english with any marked propriety what he uttered was not so much well said as excellently acted so we may hear every day the inexpressive language of a poorly written drama assume character and colour in the hands of a good player no man had more of the vis comica in private life he played no character on the stage as he could play himself among his friends it was one of his special charms now when the voice is silent and the face still it makes it impossible to do justice to his power in conversation he was a delightful companion to such as can bear bracing weather not to the very vain not to the owlishly wise who cannot have their dogmas canvassed not to the painfully refined whose sentiments become articles of faith the spirit in which he could write that he was much revived by having an opportunity of abusing whistler to a knot of his special admirers is a spirit apt to be misconstrued he was not a dogmatist even about whistler the house is full of pretty things he wrote when on a visit but mrs s taste in pretty things has one very bad fault it is not my taste and that was the true attitude of his mind but these eternal differences it was his joy to thresh out and wrangle over by the hour it was no wonder if he loved the greeks he was in many ways a greek himself he should have been a sophist and met socrates he would have loved socrates and done battle with him staunchly and manfully owned his defeat and the dialogue arranged by plato would have shone even in platos gallery he seemed in talk aggressive petulant full of a singular energy as vain you would have said as a peacock until you trod on his toes and then you saw that he was at least clear of all the sicklier elements of vanity soundly rang his laugh at any jest against himself he wished to be taken as he took others for what was good in him without dissimulation of the evil for what was wise in him without concealment of the childish he hated a draped virtue and despised a wit on its own defence and he drew if i may so express myself a human and humorous portrait of himself with all his defects and qualities as he thus enjoyed in talk the robust sports of the intelligence giving and taking manfully always without pretence always without paradox always with exuberant pleasure speaking wisely of what he knew foolishly of what he knew not a teacher a learner but still combative picking holes in what was said even to the length of captiousness yet aware of all that was said rightly jubilant in victory delighted by defeat a greek sophist a british schoolboy  among the legends of what was once a very pleasant spot the old savile club not then divorced from savile row there are many memories of fleeming he was not popular at first being known simply as the man who dines here and goes up to scotland but he grew at last i think the most generally liked of all the members to those who truly knew and loved him who had tasted the real sweetness of his nature fleemings porcupine ways had always been a matter of keen regret they introduced him to their own friends with fear sometimes recalled the step with mortification it was not possible to look on with patience while a man so lovable thwarted love at every step but the course of time and the ripening of his nature brought a cure it was at the savile that he first remarked a change it soon spread beyond the walls of the club presently i find him writing will you kindly explain what has happened to me all my life i have talked a good deal with the almost unfailing result of making people sick of the sound of my tongue it appeared to me that i had various things to say and i had no malevolent feelings but nevertheless the result was that expressed above well lately some change has happened if i talk to a person one day they must have me the next faces light up when they see me ah i say come herecome and dine with me its the most preposterous thing i ever experienced it is curiously pleasant you have enjoyed it all your life and therefore cannot conceive how bewildering a burst of it is for the first time at fortynine and this late sunshine of popularity still further softened him he was a bit of a porcupine to the last still shedding darts or rather he was to the end a bit of a schoolboy and must still throw stones but the essential toleration that underlay his disputatiousness and the kindness that made of him a tender sicknurse and a generous helper shone more conspicuously through a new pleasure had come to him and as with all sound natures he was bettered by the pleasure  i can best show fleeming in this later stage by quoting from a vivid and interesting letter of m Émile trélats here admirably expressed is how he appeared to a friend of another nation whom he encountered only late in life m trélat will pardon me if i correct even before i quote him but what the frenchman supposed to flow from some particular bitterness against france was only fleemings usual address had m trélat been italian italy would have fared as ill and yet italy was fleemings favourite country    vous savez comment jai connu fleeming jenkin cétait en mai 1878   nous étions tous deux membres du jury de lexposition universelle on   navait rien fait qui vaille à la première séance de notre classe qui   avait eu lieu le matin tout le monde avait parlé et reparlé pour ne   rien dire cela durait depuis huit heures il était midi je demandai   la parole pour une motion dordre et je proposal que la séance fût   levée à la condition que chaque membre français emportât à déjeuner   un juré étranger jenkin applaudit je vous emmène déjeuner lui   criaije je veux bien  nous partîmes en chemin nous vous   rencontrions il vous présente et nous allons déjeuner tous trois   auprès du trocadéro    et depuis ce temps nous avons été de vieux amis non seulement nous   passions nos journées au jury où nous étions toujours ensemble   côteàcôte mais nos habitudes sétaient faites telles que non   contents de déjeuner en face lun de lautre je le ramenais dîner   presque tous les jours chez moi cela dura une quinzaine puis il fut   rappelé en angleterre mais il revint et nous fîmes encore une bonne   étape de vie intellectuelle morale et philosophique je crois quil   me rendait déjà tout ce que jéprouvais de sympathie et destime et   que je ne fus pas pour rien dans son retour à paris    chose singulière nous nous étions attachés lun à lautre par les   sousentendus bien plus que par la matière de nos conversations À   vrai dire nous étions presque toujours en discussion et il nous   arrivait de nous rire au nez lun et lautre pendant des heures tant   nous nous étonnions réciproquement de la diversité de nos points de   vue je le trouvais si anglais et il me trouvait si français il   était si franchement révolté de certaines choses quil voyait chez   nous et je comprenais si mal certaines choses qui se passaient chez   vous rien de plus intéressant que ces contacts qui étaient des   contrastes et que ces rencontres didées qui étaient des choses rien   de si attachant que les échappées de coeur ou desprit auxquelles ces   petits conflits donnaient à tout moment cours cest dans ces   conditions que pendant son séjour à paris en 1878 je conduisis un   peu partout mon nouvel ami nous allâmes chez madame edmond adam où   il vit passer beaucoup dhommes politiques avec lesquels il causa   mais cest chez les ministres quil fut intéressé le moment était   dailleurs curieux en france je me rappelle que lorsque je le   présentai au ministre du commerce il fit cette spirituelle repartie   cest la seconde fois que je viens en france sous la république la   première fois cétait en 1848 elle sétait coiffée de travers je   suis bien heureux de saluer aujourdhui votre excellence quand elle a   mis son chapeau droit une fois je le menai voir couronner la rosière   de nanterre il y suivit les cérémonies civiles et religieuses il y   assista au banquet donné par le maire il y vit notre de lesseps au   quel il porta un toast le soir nous revînmes tard à paris il   faisait chaud nous étions un peu fatigués nous entrâmes dans un des   rares cafés encore ouverts il devint silencieuxnêtesvous pas   content de votre journée lui disjeo si mais je réfléchis et   je me dis que vous êtes un peuple gaitous ces braves gens étaient   gais aujourdhui cest une vertu la gaieté et vous lavez en   france cette vertu il me disait cela mélancoliquement et cétait   la première fois que je lui entendais faire une louange adressée à la   france mais il ne faut pas que vous voyiez là une plainte de ma   part je serais un ingrat si je me plaignais car il me disait   souvent quel bon français vous faites et il maimait à cause de   cela quoi quil semblât naimer pas la france cétait là un trait de   son originalité il est vrai quil sen tirait en disant que je ne   ressemblai pas à mes compatriotes ce à quoi il ne connaissait   rientout cela était fort curieux car moimême je laimais   quoiquil en eût à mon pays    en 1879 il amena son fils austin à paris jattirai celuici il   déjeunait avec moi deux fois par semaine je lui montrai ce quétait   lintimité française en le tutoyant paternellement cela resserra   beaucoup nos liens dintimité avec jenkin je fis inviter mon ami   au congrès de lassociation française pour lavancement des   sciences qui se tenait à rheims en 1880 il y vint jeus le   plaisir de lui donner la parole dans la section du génie civil et   militaire que je présidais il y fit une très intéressante   communication qui me montrait une fois de plus loriginalité de ses   vues et la sûreté de sa science cest à lissue de ce congrès que je   passai lui faire visite à rochefort où je le trouvai installé en   famille et où je présentai pour la première fois mes hommages à son   éminente compagne je le vis là sous un jour nouveau et touchant pour   moi madame jenkin quil entourait si galamment et ses deux jeunes   fils donnaient plus de relief à sa personne jemportai des quelques   heures que je passai à côté de lui dans ce charmant paysage un   souvenir ému    jétais allé en angleterre en 1882 sans pouvoir gagner Édimbourg jy   retournai en 1883 avec la commission dassainissement de la ville de   paris dont je faisais partie jenkin me rejoignit je le fis entendre   par mes collègues car il était fondateur dune société de salubrité   il eut un grand succès parmi nous mais ce voyage me restera toujours   en mémoire parce que cest là que se fixa définitivement notre forte   amitié il minvita un jour à dîner à son club et au moment de me   faire asseoir à côté de lui il me retint et me dit je voudrais vous   demander de maccorder quelque chose cest mon sentiment que nos   relations ne peuvent pas se bien continuer si vous ne me donnez pas la   permission de vous tutoyer voulezvous que nous nous tutoyions je   lui pris les mains et je lui dis quune pareille proposition venant   dun anglais et dun anglais de sa haute distinction cétait une   victoire dont je serais fier toute ma vie et nous commencions à user   de cette nouvelle forme dans nos rapports vous savez avec quelle   finesse il parlait le français comme il en connaissait tous les   tours comme il jouait avec ses difficultés et même avec ses petites   gamineries je crois quil a été heureux de pratiquer avec moi ce   tutoiement qui ne sadapte pas à langlais et qui est si français   je ne puis vous peindre létendue et la variété de nos conversations   de la soirée mais ce que je puis vous dire cest que sous la   caresse du tu nos idées se sont élevées nous avions toujours   beaucoup ri ensemble mais nous navions jamais laissé des banalités   sintroduire dans nos échanges de pensées ce soirlà notre horizon   intellectuel sest élargi et nous y avons poussé des reconnaissances   profondes et lointaines après avoir vivement causé à table nous   avons longuement causé au salon et nous nous séparions le soir à   trafalgar square après avoir longé les trottoirs stationné aux coins   des rues et deux fois rebroussé chemin en nous reconduisant lun   lautre il était près dune heure du matin mais quelle belle passe   dargumentation quels beaux échanges de sentiments quelles fortes   confidences patriotiques nous avions fournies jai compris ce soirlà   que jenkin ne détestait pas la france et je lui serrai fort les mains   en lembrassant nous nous quittions aussi amis quon puisse lêtre   et notre affection sétait par lui étendue et comprise dans un tu   français   footnotes    26 robert lawson tait 18451899ed    27 william young sellar 18251890ed    28 not reprinted in this editioned       chapter vii    18751885

now i must resume my narrative for that melancholy business that concludes all human histories in january of the year 1875 while fleemings sky was still unclouded he was reading smiles i read my engineers lives steadily he writes but find biographies depressing i suspect one reason to be that misfortunes and trials can be graphically described but happiness and the causes of happiness either cannot be or are not a grand new branch of literature opens to my view a drama in which people begin in a poor way and end after getting gradually happier in an ecstasy of enjoyment the common novel is not the thing at all it gives struggle followed by relief i want each act to close on a new and triumphant happiness which has been steadily growing all the while this is the real antithesis of tragedy where things get blacker and blacker and end in hopeless woe smiles has not grasped my grand idea and only shows a bitter struggle followed by a little respite before death some feeble critic might say my new idea was not true to nature im sick of this oldfashioned notion of art hold a mirror up indeed lets paint a picture of how things ought to be and hold that up to nature and perhaps the poor old woman may repent and mend her ways the grand idea might be possible in art not even the ingenuity of nature could so round in the actual life of any man and yet it might almost seem to fancy that she had read the letter and taken the hint for to fleeming the cruelties of fate were strangely blended with tenderness and when death came it came harshly to others to him not unkindly  in the autumn of that same year 1875 fleemings father and mother were walking in the garden of their house at merchiston when the latter fell to the ground it was thought at the time to be a stumble it was in all likelihood a premonitory stroke of palsy from that day there fell upon her an abiding panic fear that glib superficial part of us that speaks and reasons could allege no cause science itself could find no mark of danger a sons solicitude was laid at rest but the eyes of the body saw the approach of a blow and the consciousness of the body trembled at its coming it came in a moment the brilliant spirited old lady leapt from her bed raving for about six months this stage of her disease continued with many painful and many pathetic circumstances her husband who tended her her son who was unwearied in his visits looked for no change in her condition but the change that comes to all poor mother i find fleeming writing i cannot get the tones of her voice out of my head i may have to bear this pain for a long time and so i am bearing it and sparing myself whatever pain seems useless mercifully i do sleep i am so weary that i must sleep and again later i could do very well if my mind did not revert to my poor mothers state whenever i stop attending to matters immediately before me and the next day i can never feel a moments pleasure without having my mothers suffering recalled by the very feeling of happiness a pretty young face recalls hers by contrasta careworn face recalls it by association i tell you for i can speak to no one else but do not suppose that i wilfully let my mind dwell on sorrow  in the summer of the next year the frenzy left her it left her stone deaf and almost entirely aphasic but with some remains of her old sense and courage stoutly she set to work with dictionaries to recover her lost tongues and had already made notable progress when a third stroke scattered her acquisitions thenceforth for nearly ten years stroke followed upon stroke each still further jumbling the threads of her intelligence but by degrees so gradual and with such partiality of loss and of survival that her precise state was always and to the end a matter of dispute she still remembered her friends she still loved to learn news of them upon the slate she still read and marked the list of the subscription library she still took an interest in the choice of a play for the theatricals and could remember and find parallel passages but alongside of these surviving powers were lapses as remarkable she misbehaved like a child and a servant had to sit with her at table to see her so sitting speaking with the tones of a deafmute not always to the purpose and to remember what she had been was a moving appeal to all who knew her such was the pathos of these two old people in their affliction that even the reserve of cities was melted and the neighbours vied in sympathy and kindness where so many were more than usually helpful it is hard to draw distinctions but i am directed and i delight to mention in particular the good dr joseph bell mr thomas and mr archibald constable with both their wives the rev mr belcombe of whose good heart and taste i do not hear for the first timethe news had come to me by way of the infirmary and their nextdoor neighbour unwearied in service miss hannah mayne nor should i omit to mention that john ruffini continued to write to mrs jenkin till his own death and the clever lady known to the world as vernon lee until the end a touching a becoming attention to what was only the wreck and survival of their brilliant friend  but he to whom this affliction brought the greatest change was the captain himself what was bitter in his lot he bore with unshaken courage only once in these ten years of trial has mrs fleeming jenkin seen him weep for the rest of the time his wifehis commanding officer now become his trying childwas served not with patience alone but with a lovely happiness of temper he had belonged all his life to the ancient formal speechmaking complimentpresenting school of courtesy the dictates of this code partook in his eyes of the nature of a duty and he must now be courteous for two partly from a happy illusion partly in a tender fraud he kept his wife before the world as a still active partner when he paid a call he would have her write with love upon a card or if that at the moment was too much he would go armed with a bouquet and present it in her name he even wrote letters for her to copy and sign an innocent substitution which may have caused surprise to ruffini or to vernon lee if they ever received in the hand of mrs jenkin the very obvious reflections of her husband he had always adored this wife whom he now tended and sought to represent in correspondence it was now if not before her turn to repay the compliment mind enough was left her to perceive his unwearied kindness and as her moral qualities seemed to survive quite unimpaired a childish love and gratitude were his reward she would interrupt a conversation to cross the room and kiss him if she grew excited as she did too often it was his habit to come behind her chair and pat her shoulder and then she would turn round and clasp his hand in hers and look from him to her visitor with a face of pride and love and it was at such moments only that the light of humanity revived in her eyes it was hard for any stranger it was impossible for any that loved them to behold these mute scenes to recall the past and not to weep but to the captain i think it was all happiness after these so long years he had found his wife again perhaps kinder than ever before perhaps now on a more equal footing certainly to his eyes still beautiful and the call made on his intelligence had not been made in vain the merchants of aux cayes who had seen him tried in some counterrevolution in 1845 wrote to the consul of his able and decided measures his cool steady judgment and discernment with admiration and of himself as a credit and an ornament to hm naval service it is plain he must have sunk in all his powers during the years when he was only a figure and often a dumb figure in his wifes drawingroom but with this new term of service he brightened visibly he showed tact and even invention in managing his wife guiding or restraining her by the touch holding family worship so arranged that she could follow and take part in it he took to the worlds surprise to readingvoyages biographies blairs sermons even for her letters sake a work of vernon lees which proved however more than he was quite prepared for he shone more in his remarkable way in society and twice he had a little holiday to glenmorven where as may be fancied he was the delight of the highlanders one of his last pleasures was to arrange his diningroom many and many a room in their wandering and thriftless existence had he seen his wife furnish with exquisite taste and perhaps with considerable luxury now it was his turn to be the decorator on the wall he had an engraving of lord rodneys action showing the prothée his fathers ship if the reader recollects on either side of this on brackets his fathers sword and his fathers telescope a gift from admiral buckner who had used it himself during the engagement higher yet the head of his grandsons first stag portraits of his son and his sons wife and a couple of old windsor jugs from mrs buckners but his simple trophy was not yet complete a device had to be worked and framed and hung below the engraving and for this he applied to his daughterinlaw i want you to work me something annie an anchor at each sidean anchorstands for an old sailor you knowstands for hope you knowan anchor at each side and in the middle thankful it is not easy on any system of punctuation to represent the captains speech yet i hope there may shine out of these facts even as there shone through his own troubled utterance some of the charm of that delightful spirit  in 1881 the time of the golden wedding came round for that sad and pretty household it fell on a good friday and its celebration can scarcely be recalled without both smiles and tears the drawingroom was filled with presents and beautiful bouquets these to fleeming and his family the golden bride and bridegroom displayed with unspeakable pride she so painfully excited that the guests feared every moment to see her stricken afresh he guiding and moderating her with his customary tact and understanding and doing the honours of the day with more than his usual delight thence they were brought to the diningroom where the captains idea of a feast awaited them tea and champagne fruit and toast and childish little luxuries set forth pellmell and pressed at random on the guests and here he must make a speech for himself and his wife praising their destiny their marriage their son their daughterinlaw their grandchildren their manifold causes of gratitude surely the most innocent speech the old sharp contemner of his innocence now watching him with eyes of admiration then it was time for the guests to depart and they went away bathed even to the youngest child in tears of inseparable sorrow and gladness and leaving the golden bride and bridegroom to their own society and that of the hired nurse  it was a great thing for fleeming to make even thus late the acquaintance of his father but the harrowing pathos of such scenes consumed him in a life of tense intellectual effort a certain smoothness of emotional tenor were to be desired or we burn the candle at both ends dr bell perceived the evil that was being done he pressed mrs jenkin to restrain her husband from too frequent visits but here was one of those clearcut indubitable duties for which fleeming lived and he could not pardon even the suggestion of neglect  and now after death had so long visibly but still innocuously hovered above the family it began at last to strike and its blows fell thick and heavy the first to go was uncle john jenkin taken at last from his mexican dwelling and the lost tribes of israel and nothing in this remarkable old gentlemans life became him like the leaving of it his sterling jovial acquiescence in mans destiny was a delight to fleeming my visit to stowting has been a very strange but not at all a painful one he wrote in case you ever wish to make a person die as he ought to die in a novel he said to me i must tell you all about my old uncle he was to see a nearer instance before long for this family of jenkin if they were not very aptly fitted to live had the art of manly dying uncle john was but an outsider after all he had dropped out of hail of his nephews way of life and station in society and was more like some shrewd old humble friend who should have kept a lodge yet he led the procession of becoming deaths and began in the mind of fleeming that train of tender and grateful thought which was like a preparation for his own already i find him writing in the plural of these impending deaths already i find him in quest of consolation there is little pain in store for these wayfarers he wrote and we have hopemore than hope trust  on may 19 1884 mr austin was taken he was seventyeight years of age suffered sharply with all his old firmness and died happy in the knowledge that he had left his wife well cared for this had always been a bosom concern for the barrons were longlived and he believed that she would long survive him but their union had been so full and quiet that mrs austin languished under the separation in their last years they would sit all evening in their own drawingroom hand in hand two old people who for all their fundamental differences had yet grown together and become all the world in each others eyes and hearts and it was felt to be a kind release when eight months after on january 14 1885 eliza barron followed alfred austin i wish i could save you from all pain wrote fleeming six days later to his sorrowing wife i would if i couldbut my way is not gods way and of this be assuredgods way is best  in the end of the same month captain jenkin caught cold and was confined to bed he was so unchanged in spirit that at first there seemed no ground of fear but his great age began to tell and presently it was plain he had a summons the charm of his sailors cheerfulness and ancient courtesy as he lay dying is not to be described there he lay singing his old seasongs watching the poultry from the window with a childs delight scribbling on the slate little messages to his wife who lay bedridden in another room glad to have psalms read aloud to him if they were of a pious strainchecking with an i dont think we need read that my dear any that were gloomy or bloody fleemings wife coming to the house and asking one of the nurses for news of mrs jenkin madam i do not know said the nurse for i am really so carried away by the captain that i can think of nothing else one of the last messages scribbled to his wife and sent her with a glass of the champagne that had been ordered for himself ran in his most finished vein of childish madrigal the captain bows to you my love across the table when the end was near and it was thought best that fleeming should no longer go home but sleep at merchiston he broke his news to the captain with some trepidation knowing that it carried sentence of death charming charmingcharming arrangement was the captains only commentary it was the proper thing for a dying man of captain jenkins school of manners to make some expression of his spiritual state nor did he neglect the observance with his usual abruptness fleeming said he i suppose you and i feel about all this as two christian gentlemen should a last pleasure was secured for him he had been waiting with painful interest for news of gordon and khartoum and by great good fortune a false report reached him that the city was relieved and the men of sussex his old neighbours had been the first to enter he sat up in bed and gave three cheers for the sussex regiment the subsequent correction if it came in time was prudently withheld from the dying man an hour before midnight on the 5th of february he passed away aged eightyfour  word of his death was kept from mrs jenkin and she survived him no more than nineandforty hours on the day before her death she received a letter from her old friend miss bell of manchester knew the hand kissed the envelope and laid it on her heart so that she too died upon a pleasure half an hour after midnight on the 8th of february she fell asleep it is supposed in her seventyeighth year  thus in the space of less than ten months the four seniors of this family were taken away but taken with such features of opportunity in time or pleasant courage in the sufferer that grief was tempered with a kind of admiration the effect on fleeming was profound his pious optimism increased and became touched with something mystic and filial the grave is not good the approaches to it are terrible he had written in the beginning of his mothers illness he thought so no more when he had laid father and mother side by side at stowting he had always loved life in the brief time that now remained to him he seemed to be half in love with death grief is no duty he wrote to miss bell it was all too beautiful for grief he said to me but the emotion call it by what name we please shook him to his depths his wife thought he would have broken his heart when he must demolish the captains trophy in the diningroom and he seemed thenceforth scarcely the same man  these last years were indeed years of an excessive demand upon his vitality he was not only worn out with sorrow he was worn out by hope the singular invention to which he gave the name of telpherage had of late consumed his time overtaxed his strength and overheated his imagination the words in which he first mentioned his discovery to mei am simply alnascharwere not only descriptive of his state of mind they were in a sense prophetic since whatever fortune may await his idea in the future it was not his to see it bring forth fruit alnaschar he was indeed beholding about him a world all changed a world filled with telpherage wires and seeing not only himself and family but all his friends enriched it was his pleasure when the company was floated to endow those whom he liked with stock one at least never knew that he was a possible rich man until the grave had closed over his stealthy benefactor and however fleeming chafed among material and business difficulties this rainbow vision never faded and he like his father and his mother may be said to have died upon a pleasure but the strain told and he knew that it was telling i am becoming a fossil he had written five years before as a kind of plea for a holiday visit to his beloved italy take care if i am mr fossil you will be mrs fossil and jack will be jack fossil and all the boys will be little fossils and then we shall be a collection there was no fear more chimerical for fleeming years brought him no repose he was as packed with energy as fiery in hope as at the first weariness to which he began to be no stranger distressed it did not quiet him he feared for himself not without ground the fate which had overtaken his mother others shared the fear in the changed life now made for his family the elders dead the sons going from home upon their education even their tried domestic mrs alice dunns leaving the house after twentytwo years of service it was not unnatural that he should return to dreams of italy he and his wife were to go as he told me on a real honeymoon tour he had not been alone with his wife to speak of he added since the birth of his children but now he was to enjoy the society of her to whom he wrote in these last days that she was his heaven on earth now he was to revisit italy and see all the pictures and the buildings and the scenes that he admired so warmly and lay aside for a time the irritations of his strenuous activity nor was this all a trifling operation was to restore his former lightness of foot and it was a renovated youth that was to set forth upon this reenacted honeymoon  the operation was performed it was of a trifling character it seemed to go well no fear was entertained and his wife was reading aloud to him as he lay in bed when she perceived him to wander in his mind it is doubtful if he ever recovered a sure grasp upon the things of life and he was still unconscious when he passed away june the 12th 1885 in the fiftythird year of his age he passed but something in his gallant vitality had impressed itself upon his friends and still impresses not from one or two only but from many i hear the same tale of how the imagination refuses to accept our loss and instinctively looks for his reappearing and how memory retains his voice and image like things of yesterday others the wellbeloved too die and are progressively forgotten two years have passed since fleeming was laid to rest beside his father his mother and his uncle john and the thought and the look of our friend still haunts us       end of vol ix                       printed
