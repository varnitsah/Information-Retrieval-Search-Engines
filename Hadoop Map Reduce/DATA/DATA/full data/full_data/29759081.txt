you pe in der american ship and you tink you are so good as der able seamen chris mine boy i haf ben a sailorman for twentytwo years und do you tink you are so good as me i vas a sailorman pefore you vas borned und i knot und reef und splice ven you play mit topstrings und fly kites  but you are unfair emil cried chris farrington his sensitive face flushed and hurt he was a slender though strongly built young fellow of seventeen with yankee ancestry writ large all over him  dere you go vonce again the swedish sailor exploded my name is mister johansen und a kid of a boy like you call me emil it vas insulting und comes pecause of der american ship  but you call me chris the boy expostulated reproachfully  but you vas a boy  who does a mans work chris retorted and because i do a mans work i have as much right to call you by your first name as you me we are all equals in this focastle and you know it when we signed for the voyage in san francisco we signed as sailors on the sophie sutherland and there was no difference made with any of us havent i always done my work did i ever shirk did you or any other man ever have to take a wheel for me or a lookout or go aloft  chris is right interrupted a young english sailor no man has had to do a tap of his work yet he signed as good as any of us and hes shown himself as good  better broke in a novia scotia man better than some of us when we struck the sealinggrounds he turned out to be next to the best boatsteerer aboard only french louis whod been at it for years could beat him im only a boatpuller and youre only a boatpuller too emil johansen for all your twentytwo years at sea why dont you become a boatsteerer  too clumsy laughed the englishman and too slow  little that counts one way or the other joined in dane jurgensen coming to the aid of his scandinavian brother emil is a man grown and an able seaman the boy is neither  and so the argument raged back and forth the swedes norwegians and danes because of race kinship taking the part of johansen and the english canadians and americans taking the part of chris from an unprejudiced point of view the right was on the side of chris as he had truly said he did a mans work and the same work that any of them did but they were prejudiced and badly so and out of the words which passed rose a standing quarrel which divided the forecastle into two parties                                       the sophie sutherland was a sealhunter registered out of san francisco and engaged in hunting the furry seaanimals along the japanese coast north to bering sea the other vessels were twomasted schooners but she was a threemaster and the largest in the fleet in fact she was a fullrigged threetopmast schooner newly built  although chris farrington knew that justice was with him and that he performed all his work faithfully and well many a time in secret thought he longed for some pressing emergency to arise whereby he could demonstrate to the scandinavian seamen that he also was an able seaman  but one stormy night by an accident for which he was in nowise accountable in overhauling a spare anchorchain he had all the fingers of his left hand badly crushed and his hopes were likewise crushed for it was impossible for him to continue hunting with the boats and he was forced to stay idly aboard until his fingers should heal yet although he little dreamed it this very accident was to give him the longlookedforopportunity  one afternoon in the latter part of may the sophie sutherland rolled sluggishly in a breathless calm the seals were abundant the hunting good and the boats were all away and out of sight and with them was almost every man of the crew besides chris there remained only the captain the sailingmaster and the chinese cook  the captain was captain only by courtesy he was an old man past eighty and blissfully ignorant of the sea and its ways but he was the owner of the vessel and hence the honorable title of course the sailingmaster who was really captain was a thoroughgoing seaman the mate whose post was aboard was out with the boats having temporarily taken chriss place as boatsteerer  when good weather and good sport came together the boats were accustomed to range far and wide and often did not return to the schooner until long after dark but for all that it was a perfect hunting day chris noted a growing anxiety on the part of the sailingmaster he paced the deck nervously and was constantly sweeping the horizon with his marine glasses not a boat was in sight as sunset arrived he even sent chris aloft to the mizzentopmasthead but with no better luck the boats could not possibly be back before midnight  since noon the barometer had been falling with startling rapidity and all the signs were ripe for a great stormhow great not even the sailingmaster anticipated he and chris set to work to prepare for it they put storm gaskets on the furled topsails lowered and stowed the foresail and spanker and took in the two inner jibs in the one remaining jib they put a single reef and a single reef in the mainsail  night had fallen before they finished and with the darkness came the storm a low moan swept over the sea and the wind struck the sophie sutherland flat but she righted quickly and with the sailingmaster at the wheel sheered her bow into within five points of the wind working as well as he could with his bandaged hand and with the feeble aid of the chinese cook chris went forward and backed the jib over to the weather side this with the flat mainsail left the schooner hove to  god help the boats its no gale its a typhoon the sailingmaster shouted to chris at eleven oclock too much canvas got to get two more reefs into the mainsail and got to do it right away he glanced at the old captain shivering in oilskins at the binnacle and holding on for dear life theres only you and i chrisand the cook but hes next to worthless  in order to make the reef it was necessary to lower the mainsail and the removal of this after pressure was bound to make the schooner fall off before the wind and sea because of the forward pressure of the jib  take the wheel the sailingmaster directed and when i give the word hard up with it and when shes square before it steady her and keep her there well heave to again as soon as i get the reefs in  gripping the kicking spokes chris watched him and the reluctant cook go forward into the howling darkness the sophie sutherland was plunging into the huge headseas and wallowing tremendously the tense steel stays and taut rigging humming like harpstrings to the wind a buffeted cry came to his ears and he felt the schooners bow paying off of its own accord the mainsail was down  he ran the wheel hardover and kept anxious track of the changing direction of the wind on his face and of the heave of the vessel this was the crucial moment in performing the evolution she would have to pass broadside to the surge before she could get before it the wind was blowing directly on his right cheek when he felt the sophie sutherland lean over and begin to rise toward the skyupupan infinite distance would she clear the crest of the gigantic wave  again by the feel of it for he could see nothing he knew that a wall of water was rearing and curving far above him along the whole weather side there was an instants calm as the liquid wall intervened and shut off the wind the schooner righted and for that instant seemed at perfect rest then she rolled to meet the descending rush  chris shouted to the captain to hold tight and prepared himself for the shock but the man did not live who could face it an ocean of water smote chriss back and his clutch on the spokes was loosened as if it were a babys stunned powerless like a straw on the face of a torrent he was swept onward he knew not whither missing the corner of the cabin he was dashed forward along the poop runway a hundred feet or more striking violently against the foot of the foremast a second wave crushing inboard hurled him back the way he had come and left him halfdrowned where the poop steps should have been  bruised and bleeding dimly conscious he felt for the rail and dragged himself to his feet unless something could be done he knew the last moment had come as he faced the poop the wind drove into his mouth with suffocating force this brought him back to his senses with a start the wind was blowing from dead aft the schooner was out of the trough and before it but the send of the sea was bound to breach her to again crawling up the runway he managed to get to the wheel just in time to prevent this the binnacle light was still burning they were safe  that is he and the schooner were safe as to the welfare of his three companions he could not say nor did he dare leave the wheel in order to find out for it took every second of his undivided attention to keep the vessel to her course the least fraction of carelessness and the heave of the sea under the quarter was liable to thrust her into the trough so a boy of one hundred and forty pounds he clung to his herculean task of guiding the two hundred straining tons of fabric amid the chaos of the great storm forces  half an hour later groaning and sobbing the captain crawled to chriss feet all was lost he whimpered he was smitten unto death the galley had gone by the board the mainsail and runninggear the cook every thing  wheres the sailingmaster chris demanded when he had caught his breath after steadying a wild lurch of the schooner it was no childs play to steer a vessel under single reefed jib before a typhoon  clean up forard the old man replied jammed under the focslehead but still breathing both his arms are broken he says and he doesnt know how many ribs hes hurt bad  well hell drown there the way shes shipping water through the hawsepipes go forard chris commanded taking charge of things as a matter of course tell him not to worry that im at the wheel help him as much as you can and make him helphe stopped and ran the spokes to starboard as a tremendous billow rose under the stern and yawed the schooner to portand make him help himself for the rest unship the focastle hatch and get him down into a bunk then ship the hatch again  the captain turned his aged face forward and wavered pitifully the waist of the ship was full of water to the bulwarks he had just come through it and knew death lurked every inch of the way  go chris shouted fiercely and as the fearstricken man started and take another look for the cook  two hours later almost dead from suffering the captain returned he had obeyed orders the sailingmaster was helpless although safe in a bunk the cook was gone chris sent the captain below to the cabin to change his clothes  after interminable hours of toil day broke cold and gray chris looked about him the sophie sutherland was racing before the typhoon like a thing possessed there was no rain but the wind whipped the spray of the sea masthigh obscuring everything except in the immediate neighborhood  two waves only could chris see at a timethe one before and the one behind so small and insignificant the schooner seemed on the long pacific roll rushing up a maddening mountain she would poise like a cockleshell on the giddy summit breathless and rolling leap outward and down into the yawning chasm beneath and bury herself in the smother of foam at the bottom then the recovery another mountain another sickening upward rush another poise and the downward crash abreast of him to starboard like a ghost of the storm chris saw the cook dashing apace with the schooner evidently when washed overboard he had grasped and become entangled in a trailing halyard  for three hours more alone with this gruesome companion chris held the sophie sutherland before the wind and sea he had long since forgotten his mangled fingers the bandages had been torn away and the cold salt spray had eaten into the halfhealed wounds until they were numb and no longer pained but he was not cold the terrific labor of steering forced the perspiration from every pore yet he was faint and weak with hunger and exhaustion and hailed with delight the advent on deck of the captain who fed him all of a pound of cakechocolate it strengthened him at once  he ordered the captain to cut the halyard by which the cooks body was towing and also to go forward and cut loose the jibhalyard and sheet when he had done so the jib fluttered a couple of moments like a handkerchief then tore out of the boltropes and vanished the sophie sutherland was running under bare poles  by noon the storm had spent itself and by six in the evening the waves had died down sufficiently to let chris leave the helm it was almost hopeless to dream of the small boats weathering the typhoon but there is always the chance in saving human life and chris at once applied himself to going back over the course along which he had fled he managed to get a reef in one of the inner jibs and two reefs in the spanker and then with the aid of the watchtackle to hoist them to the stiff breeze that yet blew and all through the night tacking back and forth on the back track he shook out canvas as fast as the wind would permit  the injured sailingmaster had turned delirious and between tending him and lending a hand with the ship chris kept the captain busy taught me more seamanship as he afterward said than id learned on the whole voyage but by daybreak the old mans feeble frame succumbed and he fell off into exhausted sleep on the weather poop  chris who could now lash the wheel covered the tired man with blankets from below and went fishing in the lazaretto for something to eat but by the day following he found himself forced to give in drowsing fitfully by the wheel and waking ever and anon to take a look at things  on the afternoon of the third day he picked up a schooner dismasted and battered as he approached closehauled on the wind he saw her decks crowded by an unusually large crew and on sailing in closer made out among others the faces of his missing comrades and he was just in the nick of time for they were fighting a losing fight at the pumps an hour later they with the crew of the sinking craft were aboard the sophie sutherland  having wandered so far from their own vessel they had taken refuge on the strange schooner just before the storm broke she was a canadian sealer on her first voyage and as was now apparent her last  the captain of the sophie sutherland had a story to tell also and he told it wellso well in fact that when all hands were gathered together on deck during the dogwatch emil johansen strode over to chris and gripped him by the hand  chris he said so loudly that all could hear chris i gif in you vas yoost so good a sailorman as i you vas a bully boy und able seaman und i pe proud for you  und chris he turned as if he had forgotten something and called back from dis time always you call me emil mitout der mister     typhoon off the coast of japan  jack londons first story published at the age of seventeen   it was four bells in the morning watch we had just finished breakfast when the order came forward for the watch on deck to stand by to heave her to and all hands stand by the boats  port hard a port cried our sailingmaster clew up the topsails let the flying jib run down back the jib over to windward and run down the foresail and so was our schooner sophie sutherland hove to off the japan coast near cape jerimo on april 10 1893  then came moments of bustle and confusion there were eighteen men to man the six boats some were hooking on the falls others casting off the lashings boatsteerers appeared with boatcompasses and waterbreakers and boatpullers with the lunch boxes hunters were staggering under two or three shotguns a rifle and heavy ammunition box all of which were soon stowed away with their oilskins and mittens in the boats  the sailingmaster gave his last orders and away we went pulling three pairs of oars to gain our positions we were in the weather boat and so had a longer pull than the others the first second and third lee boats soon had all sail set and were running off to the southward and westward with the wind beam while the schooner was running off to leeward of them so that in case of accident the boats would have fair wind home  it was a glorious morning but our boat steerer shook his head ominously as he glanced at the rising sun and prophetically muttered red sun in the morning sailor take warning the sun had an angry look and a few light fleecy niggerheads in that quarter seemed abashed and frightened and soon disappeared  away off to the northward cape jerimo reared its black forbidding head like some huge monster rising from the deep the winters snow not yet entirely dissipated by the sun covered it in patches of glistening white over which the light wind swept on its way out to sea huge gulls rose slowly fluttering their wings in the light breeze and striking their webbed feet on the surface of the water for over half a mile before they could leave it hardly had the patter patter died away when a flock of sea quail rose and with whistling wings flew away to windward where members of a large band of whales were disporting themselves their blowings sounding like the exhaust of steam engines the harsh discordant cries of a seaparrot grated unpleasantly on the ear and set half a dozen alert in a small band of seals that were ahead of us away they went breaching and jumping entirely out of water a seagull with slow deliberate flight and long majestic curves circled round us and as a reminder of home a little english sparrow perched impudently on the focastle head and cocking his head on one side chirped merrily the boats were soon among the seals and the bang bang of the guns could be heard from down to leeward  the wind was slowly rising and by three oclock as with a dozen seals in our boat we were deliberating whether to go on or turn back the recall flag was run up at the schooners mizzena sure sign that with the rising wind the barometer was falling and that our sailingmaster was getting anxious for the welfare of the boats  away we went before the wind with a single reef in our sail with clenched teeth sat the boatsteerer grasping the steering oar firmly with both hands his restless eyes on the alerta glance at the schooner ahead as we rose on a sea another at the mainsheet and then one astern where the dark ripple of the wind on the water told him of a coming puff or a large whitecap that threatened to overwhelm us the waves were holding high carnival performing the strangest antics as with wild glee they danced along in fierce pursuitnow up now down here there and everywhere until some great sea of liquid green with its milkwhite crest of foam rose from the oceans throbbing bosom and drove the others from view but only for a moment for again under new forms they reappeared in the suns path they wandered where every ripple great or small every little spit or spray looked like molten silver where the water lost its dark green color and became a dazzling silvery flood only to vanish and become a wild waste of sullen turbulence each dark foreboding sea rising and breaking then rolling on again the dash the sparkle the silvery light soon vanished with the sun which became obscured by black clouds that were rolling swiftly in from the west northwest apt heralds of the coming storm  we soon reached the schooner and found ourselves the last aboard in a few minutes the seals were skinned boats and decks washed and we were down below by the roaring focastle fire with a wash change of clothes and a hot substantial supper before us sail had been put on the schooner as we had a run of seventyfive miles to make to the southward before morning so as to get in the midst of the seals out of which we had strayed during the last two days hunting  we had the first watch from eight to midnight the wind was soon blowing half a gale and our sailingmaster expected little sleep that night as he paced up and down the poop the topsails were soon clewed up and made fast then the flying jib run down and furled quite a sea was rolling by this time occasionally breaking over the decks flooding them and threatening to smash the boats at six bells we were ordered to turn them over and put on storm lashings this occupied us till eight bells when we were relieved by the midwatch i was the last to go below doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker below all were asleep except our green hand the bricklayer who was dying of consumption the wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale flickering light through the focastle and turned to golden honey the drops of water on the yellow oilskins in all the corners dark shadows seemed to come and go while up in the eyes of her beyond the pall bits descending from deck to deck where they seemed to lurk like some dragon at the caverns mouth it was dark as erebus now and again the light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier than usual only to recede leaving it darker and blacker than before the roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the beach while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the focastle the creaking and groaning of the timbers stanchions and bulkheads as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt served to drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk the working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of flaky powder to fall and sent another sound mingling with the tumultuous storm small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the focastle head above and joining issue with the streams from the wet oilskins ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold  at two bells in the middle watchthat is in land parlance one oclock in the morningthe order was roared out on the focastle all hands on deck and shorten sail  then the sleepy sailors tumbled out of their bunk and into their clothes oilskins and seaboots and up on deck tis when that order comes on cold blustering nights that jack grimly mutters who would not sell a farm and go to sea  it was on deck that the force of the wind could be fully appreciated especially after leaving the stifling focastle it seemed to stand up against you like a wall making it almost impossible to move on the heaving decks or to breathe as the fierce gusts came dashing by the schooner was hove to under jib foresail and mainsail we proceeded to lower the foresail and make it fast the night was dark greatly impeding our labor still though not a star or the moon could pierce the black masses of storm clouds that obscured the sky as they swept along before the gale nature aided us in a measure a soft light emanated from the movement of the ocean each mighty sea all phosphorescent and glowing with the tiny lights of myriads of animalculae threatened to overwhelm us with a deluge of fire higher and higher thinner and thinner the crest grew as it began to curve and overtop preparatory to breaking until with a roar it fell over the bulwarks a mass of soft glowing light and tons of water which sent the sailors sprawling in all directions and left in each nook and cranny little specks of light that glowed and trembled till the next sea washed them away depositing new ones in their places sometimes several seas following each other with great rapidity and thundering down on our decks filled them full to the bulwarks but soon they were discharged through the lee scuppers  to reef the mainsail we were forced to run off before the gale under the single reefed jib by the time we had finished the wind had forced up such a tremendous sea that it was impossible to heave her to away we flew on the wings of the storm through the muck and flying spray a wind sheer to starboard then another to port as the enormous seas struck the schooner astern and nearly broached her to as day broke we took in the jib leaving not a sail unfurled since we had begun scudding she had ceased to take the seas over her bow but amidships they broke fast and furious it was a dry storm in the matter of rain but the force of the wind filled the air with fine spray which flew as high as the crosstrees and cut the face like a knife making it impossible to see over a hundred yards ahead the sea was a dark lead color as with long slow majestic roll it was heaped up by the wind into liquid mountains of foam the wild antics of the schooner were sickening as she forged along she would almost stop as though climbing a mountain then rapidly rolling to right and left as she gained the summit of a huge sea she steadied herself and paused for a moment as though affrighted at the yawning precipice before her like an avalanche she shot forward and down as the sea astern struck her with the force of a thousand battering rams burying her bow to the catheads in the milky foam at the bottom that came on deck in all directionsforward astern to right and left through the hawsepipes and over the rail  the wind began to drop and by ten oclock we were talking of heaving her to we passed a ship two schooners and a fourmasted barkentine under the smallest canvas and at eleven oclock running up the spanker and jib we hove her to and in another hour we were beating back again against the aftersea under full sail to regain the sealing ground away to the westward  below a couple of men were sewing the bricklayers body in canvas preparatory to the sea burial and so with the storm passed away the bricklayers soul     the lost poacher   but they wont take excuses youre across the line and thats enough theyll take you in you go siberia and the salt mines and as for uncle sam why whats he to know about it never a word will get back to the states the mary thomas the papers will say the mary thomas lost with all hands probably in a typhoon in the japanese seas thats what the papers will say and people too in you go siberia and the salt mines dead to the world and kith and kin though you live fifty years  in such manner john lewis commonly known as the sealawyer settled the matter out of hand  it was a serious moment in the forecastle of the mary thomas no sooner had the watch below begun to talk the trouble over than the watch on deck came down and joined them as there was no wind every hand could be spared with the exception of the man at the wheel and he remained only for the sake of discipline even bub russell the cabinboy had crept forward to hear what was going on  however it was a serious moment as the grave faces of the sailors bore witness for the three preceding months the mary thomas sealing schooner had hunted the seal pack along the coast of japan and north to bering sea here on the asiatic side of the sea they were forced to give over the chase or rather to go no farther for beyond the russian cruisers patrolled forbidden ground where the seals might breed in peace  a week before she had fallen into a heavy fog accompanied by calm since then the fogbank had not lifted and the only wind had been light airs and catspaws this in itself was not so bad for the sealing schooners are never in a hurry so long as they are in the midst of the seals but the trouble lay in the fact that the current at this point bore heavily to the north thus the mary thomas had unwittingly drifted across the line and every hour she was penetrating unwillingly farther and farther into the dangerous waters where the russian bear kept guard  how far she had drifted no man knew the sun had not been visible for a week nor the stars and the captain had been unable to take observations in order to determine his position at any moment a cruiser might swoop down and hale the crew away to siberia the fate of other poaching sealhunters was too well known to the men of the mary thomas and there was cause for grave faces  mine friends spoke up a german boatsteerer it vas a pad piziness shust as ve make a big catch und all honest somedings go wrong und der russians nab us dake our skins and our schooner und send us mit der anarchists to siberia ach a pretty pad piziness  yes thats where it hurts the sea lawyer went on fifteen hundred skins in the salt piles and all honest a big payday coming to every man jack of us and then to be captured and lose it all itd be different if wed been poaching but its all honest work in open water  but if we havent done anything wrong they cant do anything to us can they bub queried  it strikes me as ow it aint the proper thing for a boy o your age shovin in when is elders is talkin protested an english sailor from over the edge of his bunk  oh thats all right jack answered the sealawyer hes a perfect right to aint he just as liable to lose his wages as the rest of us  wouldnt give thruppence for them jack sniffed back he had been planning to go home and see his family in chelsea when he was paid off and he was now feeling rather blue over the highly possible loss not only of his pay but of his liberty  how are they to know the sealawyer asked in answer to bubs previous question here we are in forbidden water how do they know but what we came here of our own accord here we are fifteen hundred skins in the hold how do they know whether we got them in open water or in the closed sea dont you see bub the evidence is all against us if you caught a man with his pockets full of apples like those which grow on your tree and if you caught him in your tree besides whatd you think if he told you he couldnt help it and had just been sort of blown there and that anyway those apples came from some other treewhatd you think eh  bub saw it clearly when put in that light and shook his head despondently  youd rather be dead than go to siberia one of the boatpullers said they put you into the saltmines and work you till you die never see daylight again why ive heard tell of one fellow that was chained to his mate and that mate died and they were both chained together and if they send you to the quicksilver mines you get salivated id rather be hung than salivated  wots salivated jack asked suddenly sitting up in his bunk at the hint of fresh misfortunes  why the quicksilver gets into your blood i think thats the way and your gums all swell like you had the scurvy only worse and your teeth get loose in your jaws and big ulcers forms and then you die horrible the strongest man cant last long amining quicksilver  a pad piziness the boatsteerer reiterated dolorously in the silence which followed a pad piziness i vish i vas in yokohama eh vot vas dot  the vessel had suddenly heeled over the decks were aslant a tin pannikin rolled down the inclined plane rattling and banging from above came the slapping of canvas and the quivering rattattat of the after leech of the loosely stretched foresail then the mates voice sang down the hatch all hands on deck and make sail  never had such summons been answered with more enthusiasm the calm had broken the wind had come which was to carry them south into safety with a wild cheer all sprang on deck working with mad haste they flung out topsails flying jibs and staysails as they worked the fogbank lifted and the black vault of heaven bespangled with the old familiar stars rushed into view when all was shipshape the mary thomas was lying gallantly over on her side to a beam wind and plunging ahead due south  steamers lights ahead on the port bow sir cried the lookout from his station on the forecastlehead there was excitement in the mans voice  the captain sent bub below for his nightglasses everybody crowded to the leerail to gaze at the suspicious stranger which already began to loom up vague and indistinct in those unfrequented waters the chance was one in a thousand that it could be anything else than a russian patrol the captain was still anxiously gazing through the glasses when a flash of flame left the strangers side followed by the loud report of a cannon the worst fears were confirmed it was a patrol evidently firing across the bows of the mary thomas in order to make her heave to  hard down with your helm the captain commanded the steersman all the life gone out of his voice then to the crew back over the jib and foresail run down the flying jib clew up the foretopsail and aft here and swing on to the mainsheet  the mary thomas ran into the eye of the wind lost headway and fell to courtesying gravely to the long seas rolling up from the west  the cruiser steamed a little nearer and lowered a boat the sealers watched in heartbroken silence they could see the white bulk of the boat as it was slacked away to the water and its crew sliding aboard they could hear the creaking of the davits and the commands of the officers then the boat sprang away under the impulse of the oars and came toward them the wind had been rising and already the sea was too rough to permit the frail craft to lie alongside the tossing schooner but watching their chance and taking advantage of the boarding ropes thrown to them an officer and a couple of men clambered aboard the boat then sheered off into safety and lay to its oars a young midshipman sitting in the stern and holding the yokelines in charge  the officer whose uniform disclosed his rank as that of second lieutenant in the russian navy went below with the captain of the mary thomas to look at the ships papers a few minutes later he emerged and upon his sailors removing the hatchcovers passed down into the hold with a lantern to inspect the salt piles it was a goodly heap which confronted himfifteen hundred fresh skins the seasons catch and under the circumstances he could have had but one conclusion  i am very sorry he said in broken english to the sealing captain when he again came on deck but it is my duty in the name of the tsar to seize your vessel as a poacher caught with fresh skins in the closed sea the penalty as you may know is confiscation and imprisonment  the captain of the mary thomas shrugged his shoulders in seeming indifference and turned away although they may restrain all outward show strong men under unmerited misfortune are sometimes very close to tears just then the vision of his little california home and of the wife and two yellowhaired boys was strong upon him and there was a strange choking sensation in his throat which made him afraid that if he attempted to speak he would sob instead  and also there was upon him the duty he owed his men no weakness before them for he must be a tower of strength to sustain them in misfortune he had already explained to the second lieutenant and knew the hopelessness of the situation as the sealawyer had said the evidence was all against him so he turned aft and fell to pacing up and down the poop of the vessel over which he was no longer commander  the russian officer now took temporary charge he ordered more of his men aboard and had all the canvas clewed up and furled snugly away while this was being done the boat plied back and forth between the two vessels passing a heavy hawser which was made fast to the great towingbitts on the schooners forecastlehead during all this work the sealers stood about in sullen groups it was madness to think of resisting with the guns of a manofwar not a biscuittoss away but they refused to lend a hand preferring instead to maintain a gloomy silence  having accomplished his task the lieutenant ordered all but four of his men back into the boat then the midshipman a lad of sixteen looking strangely mature and dignified in his uniform and sword came aboard to take command of the captured sealer just as the lieutenant prepared to depart his eye chanced to alight upon bub without a word of warning he seized him by the arm and dropped him over the rail into the waiting boat and then with a parting wave of his hand he followed him  it was only natural that bub should be frightened at this unexpected happening all the terrible stories he had heard of the russians served to make him fear them and now returned to his mind with double force to be captured by them was bad enough but to be carried off by them away from his comrades was a fate of which he had not dreamed  be a good boy bub the captain called to him as the boat drew away from the mary thomass side and tell the truth  aye aye sir he answered bravely enough by all outward appearance he felt a certain pride of race and was ashamed to be a coward before these strange enemies these wild russian bears  und be politeful the german boatsteerer added his rough voice lifting across the water like a foghorn  bub waved his hand in farewell and his mates clustered along the rail as they answered with a cheering shout he found room in the sternsheets where he fell to regarding the lieutenant he didnt look so wild or bearish after allvery much like other men bub concluded and the sailors were much the same as all other manofwars men he had ever known nevertheless as his feet struck the steel deck of the cruiser he felt as if he had entered the portals of a prison  for a few minutes he was left unheeded the sailors hoisted the boat up and swung it in on the davits then great clouds of black smoke poured out of the funnels and they were under wayto siberia bub could not help but think he saw the mary thomas swing abruptly into line as she took the pressure from the hawser and her sidelights red and green rose and fell as she was towed through the sea  bubs eyes dimmed at the melancholy sight butbut just then the lieutenant came to take him down to the commander and he straightened up and set his lips firmly as if this were a very commonplace affair and he were used to being sent to siberia every day in the week the cabin in which the commander sat was like a palace compared to the humble fittings of the mary thomas and the commander himself in gold lace and dignity was a most august personage quite unlike the simple man who navigated his schooner on the trail of the seal pack  bub now quickly learned why he had been brought aboard and in the prolonged questioning which followed told nothing but the plain truth the truth was harmless only a lie could have injured his cause he did not know much except that they had been sealing far to the south in open water and that when the calm and fog came down upon them being close to the line they had drifted across again and again he insisted that they had not lowered a boat or shot a seal in the week they had been drifting about in the forbidden sea but the commander chose to consider all that he said to be a tissue of falsehoods and adopted a bullying tone in an effort to frighten the boy he threatened and cajoled by turns but failed in the slightest to shake bubs statements and at last ordered him out of his presence  by some oversight bub was not put in anybodys charge and wandered up on deck unobserved sometimes the sailors in passing bent curious glances upon him but otherwise he was left strictly alone nor could he have attracted much attention for he was small the night dark and the watch on deck intent on its own business stumbling over the strange decks he made his way aft where he could look upon the sidelights of the mary thomas following steadily in the rear  for a long while he watched and then lay down in the darkness close to where the hawser passed over the stern to the captured schooner once an officer came up and examined the straining rope to see if it were chafing but bub cowered away in the shadow undiscovered this however gave him an idea which concerned the lives and liberties of twentytwo men and which was to avert crushing sorrow from more than one happy home many thousand miles away  in the first place he reasoned the crew were all guiltless of any crime and yet were being carried relentlessly away to imprisonment in siberiaa living death he had heard and he believed it implicitly in the second place he was a prisoner hard and fast with no chance to escape in the third it was possible for the twentytwo men on the mary thomas to escape the only thing which bound them was a fourinch hawser they dared not cut it at their end for a watch was sure to be maintained upon it by their russian captors but at this end ah at his end  bub did not stop to reason further wriggling close to the hawser he opened his jackknife and went to work the blade was not very sharp and he sawed away ropeyarn by ropeyarn the awful picture of the solitary siberian exile he must endure growing clearer and more terrible at every stroke such a fate was bad enough to undergo with ones comrades but to face it alone seemed frightful and besides the very act he was performing was sure to bring greater punishment upon him  in the midst of such somber thoughts he heard footsteps approaching he wriggled away into the shadow an officer stopped where he had been working halfstooped to examine the hawser then changed his mind and straightened up for a few minutes he stood there gazing at the lights of the captured schooner and then went forward again  now was the time bub crept back and went on sawing now two parts were severed now three but one remained the tension upon this was so great that it readily yielded splash the freed end went overboard he lay quietly his heart in his mouth listening no one on the cruiser but himself had heard  he saw the red and green lights of the mary thomas grow dimmer and dimmer then a faint hallo came over the water from the russian prize crew still nobody heard the smoke continued to pour out of the cruisers funnels and her propellers throbbed as mightily as ever  what was happening on the mary thomas bub could only surmise but of one thing he was certain his comrades would assert themselves and overpower the four sailors and the midshipman a few minutes later he saw a small flash and straining his ears heard the very faint report of a pistol then oh joy both the red and green lights suddenly disappeared the mary thomas was retaken  just as an officer came aft bub crept forward and hid away in one of the boats not an instant too soon the alarm was given loud voices rose in command the cruiser altered her course an electric searchlight began to throw its white rays across the sea here there everywhere but in its flashing path no tossing schooner was revealed  bub went to sleep soon after that nor did he wake till the gray of dawn the engines were pulsing monotonously and the water splashing noisily told him the decks were being washed down one sweeping glance and he saw that they were alone on the expanse of ocean the mary thomas had escaped as he lifted his head a roar of laughter went up from the sailors even the officer who ordered him taken below and locked up could not quite conceal the laughter in his eyes bub thought often in the days of confinement which followed that they were not very angry with him for what he had done  he was not far from right there is a certain innate nobility deep down in the hearts of all men which forces them to admire a brave act even if it is performed by an enemy the russians were in nowise different from other men true a boy had outwitted them but they could not blame him and they were sore puzzled as to what to do with him it would never do to take a little mite like him in to represent all that remained of the lost poacher  so two weeks later a united states manofwar steaming out of the russian port of vladivostok was signaled by a russian cruiser a boat passed between the two ships and a small boy dropped over the rail upon the deck of the american vessel a week later he was put ashore at hakodate and after some telegraphing his fare was paid on the railroad to yokohama  from the depot he hurried through the quaint japanese streets to the harbor and hired a sampan boatman to put him aboard a certain vessel whose familiar rigging had quickly caught his eye her gaskets were off her sails unfurled she was just starting back to the united states as he came closer a crowd of sailors sprang upon the forecastle head and the windlassbars rose and fell as the anchor was torn from its muddy bottom  yankee ship come down the ribber the sealawyers voice rolled out as he led the anchor song  pull my bully boys pull roared back the old familiar chorus the mens bodies lifting and bending to the rhythm  bub russell paid the boatman and stepped on deck the anchor was forgotten a mighty cheer went up from the men and almost before he could catch his breath he was on the shoulders of the captain surrounded by his mates and endeavoring to answer twenty questions to the second  the next day a schooner hove to off a japanese fishing village sent ashore four sailors and a little midshipman and sailed away these men did not talk english but they had money and quickly made their way to yokohama from that day the japanese village folk never heard anything more about them and they are still a muchtalkedof mystery as the russian government never said anything about the incident the united states is still ignorant of the whereabouts of the lost poacher nor has she ever heard officially of the way in which some of her citizens shanghaied five subjects of the tsar even nations have secrets sometimes     the banks of the sacramento            and its blow ye winds heighho            for californio            for theres plenty of gold so ive been told            on the banks of the sacramento   it was only a little boy singing in a shrill treble the sea chantey which seamen sing the wide world over when they man the capstan bars and break the anchors out for frisco port it was only a little boy who had never seen the sea but two hundred feet beneath him rolled the sacramento young jerry he was called after old jerry his father from whom he had learned the song as well as received his shock of brightred hair his blue dancing eyes and his fair and inevitably freckled skin  for old jerry had been a sailor and had followed the sea till middle life haunted always by the words of the ringing chantey then one day he had sung the song in earnest in an asiatic port swinging and thrilling round the capstancircle with twenty others and at san francisco he turned his back upon his ship and upon the sea and went to behold with his own eyes the banks of the sacramento  he beheld the gold too for he found employment at the yellow dream mine and proved of utmost usefulness in rigging the great orecables across the river and two hundred feet above its surface  after that he took charge of the cables and kept them in repair and ran them and loved them and became himself an indispensable fixture of the yellow dream mine then he loved pretty margaret kelly but she had left him and young jerry the latter barely toddling to take up her last long sleep in the little graveyard among the great sober pines  old jerry never went back to the sea he remained by his cables and lavished upon them and young jerry all the love of his nature when evil days came to the yellow dream he still remained in the employ of the company as watchman over the all but abandoned property  but this morning he was not visible young jerry only was to be seen sitting on the cabin step and singing the ancient chantey he had cooked and eaten his breakfast all by himself and had just come out to take a look at the world twenty feet before him stood the steel drum round which the endless cable worked by the drum snug and fast was the orecar following with his eyes the dizzy flight of the cables to the farther bank he could see the other drum and the other car  the contrivance was worked by gravity the loaded car crossing the river by virtue of its own weight and at the same time dragging the empty car back the loaded car being emptied and the empty car being loaded with more ore the performance could be repeateda performance which had been repeated tens of thousands of times since the day old jerry became the keeper of the cables  young jerry broke off his song at the sound of approaching footsteps a tall blueshirted man a rifle across the hollow of his arm came out from the gloom of the pinetrees it was hall watchman of the yellow dragon mine the cables of which spanned the sacramento a mile farther up  yello younker was his greeting what you doin here by your lonesome  oh bachin jerry tried to answer unconcernedly as if it were a very ordinary sort of thing dads away you see  wheres he gone the man asked  san francisco went last night his brothers dead in the old country and hes gone down to see the lawyers wont be back till tomorrow night  so spoke jerry and with pride because of the responsibility which had fallen to him of keeping an eye on the property of the yellow dream and the glorious adventure of living alone on the cliff above the river and of cooking his own meals  well take care of yourself hall said and dont monkey with the cables im goin to see if i can pick up a deer in the cripple cow cañon  its goin to rain i think jerry said with mature deliberation  and its little i mind a wettin hall laughed as he strode away among the trees  jerrys prediction concerning rain was more than fulfilled by ten oclock the pines were swaying and moaning the cabin windows rattling and the rain driving by in fierce squalls at half past eleven he kindled a fire and promptly at the stroke of twelve sat down to his dinner  no outofdoors for him that day he decided when he had washed the few dishes and put them neatly away and he wondered how wet hall was and whether he had succeeded in picking up a deer  at one oclock there came a knock at the door and when he opened it a man and a woman staggered in on the breast of a great gust of wind they were mr and mrs spillane ranchers who lived in a lonely valley a dozen miles back from the river  wheres hall was spillanes opening speech and he spoke sharply and quickly  jerry noted that he was nervous and abrupt in his movements and that mrs spillane seemed laboring under some strong anxiety she was a thin washedout workedout woman whose life of dreary and unending toil had stamped itself harshly upon her face it was the same life that had bowed her husbands shoulders and gnarled his hands and turned his hair to a dry and dusty gray  hes gone hunting up cripple cow jerry answered did you want to cross  the woman began to weep quietly while spillane dropped a troubled exclamation and strode to the window jerry joined him in gazing out to where the cables lost themselves in the thick downpour  it was the custom of the backwoods people in that section of country to cross the sacramento on the yellow dragon cable for this service a small toll was charged which tolls the yellow dragon company applied to the payment of halls wages  weve got to get across jerry spillane said at the same time jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of his wife her fathers hurt at the clover leaf powder explosion not expected to live we just got word  jerry felt himself fluttering inwardly he knew that spillane wanted to cross on the yellow dream cable and in the absence of his father he felt that he dared not assume such a responsibility for the cable had never been used for passengers in fact had not been used at all for a long time  maybe hall will be back soon he said  spillane shook his head and demanded wheres your father  san francisco jerry answered briefly  spillane groaned and fiercely drove his clenched fist into the palm of the other hand his wife was crying more audibly and jerry could hear her murmuring and daddys dyin dyin  the tears welled up in his own eyes and he stood irresolute not knowing what he should do but the man decided for him  look here kid he said with determination the wife and me are goin over on this here cable of yours will you run it for us  jerry backed slightly away he did it unconsciously as if recoiling instinctively from something unwelcome  better see if halls back he suggested  and if he aint  again jerry hesitated  ill stand for the risk spillane added dont you see kid weve simply got to cross  jerry nodded his head reluctantly  and there aint no use waitin for hall spillane went on you know as well as me he aint back from cripple cow this time of day so come along and lets get started  no wonder that mrs spillane seemed terrified as they helped her into the orecarso jerry thought as he gazed into the apparently fathomless gulf beneath her for it was so filled with rain and cloud hurtling and curling in the fierce blast that the other shore seven hundred feet away was invisible while the cliff at their feet dropped sheer down and lost itself in the swirling vapor by all appearances it might be a mile to bottom instead of two hundred feet  all ready he asked  let her go spillane shouted to make himself heard above the roar of the wind  he had clambered in beside his wife and was holding one of her hands in his  jerry looked upon this with disapproval youll need all your hands for holdin on the way the winds yowlin  the man and the woman shifted their hands accordingly tightly gripping the sides of the car and jerry slowly and carefully released the brake the drum began to revolve as the endless cable passed round it and the car slid slowly out into the chasm its trolley wheels rolling on the stationary cable overhead to which it was suspended  it was not the first time jerry had worked the cable but it was the first time he had done so away from the supervising eye of his father by means of the brake he regulated the speed of the car it needed regulating for at times caught by the stronger gusts of wind it swayed violently back and forth and once just before it was swallowed up in a rain squall it seemed about to spill out its human contents  after that jerry had no way of knowing where the car was except by means of the cable this he watched keenly as it glided around the drum three hundred feet he breathed to himself as the cable markings went by three hundred and fifty four hundred four hundred and  the cable had stopped jerry threw off the brake but it did not move he caught the cable with his hands and tried to start it by tugging smartly something had gone wrong what he could not guess he could not see looking up he could vaguely make out the empty car which had been crossing from the opposite cliff at a speed equal to that of the loaded car it was about two hundred and fifty feet away that meant he knew that somewhere in the gray obscurity two hundred feet above the river and two hundred and fifty feet from the other bank spillane and his wife were suspended and stationary  three times jerry shouted with all the shrill force of his lungs but no answering cry came out of the storm it was impossible for him to hear them or to make himself heard as he stood for a moment thinking rapidly the flying clouds seemed to thin and lift he caught a brief glimpse of the swollen sacramento beneath and a briefer glimpse of the car and the man and woman then the clouds descended thicker than ever  the boy examined the drum closely and found nothing the matter with it evidently it was the drum on the other side that had gone wrong he was appalled at the thought of the man and woman out there in the midst of the storm hanging over the abyss rocking back and forth in the frail car and ignorant of what was taking place on shore and he did not like to think of their hanging there while he went round by the yellow dragon cable to the other drum  but he remembered a block and tackle in the toolhouse and ran and brought it they were double blocks and he murmured aloud a purchase of four as he made the tackle fast to the endless cable then he heaved upon it heaved until it seemed that his arms were being drawn out from their sockets and that his shoulder muscles would be ripped asunder yet the cable did not budge nothing remained but to cross over to the other side  he was already soaking wet so he did not mind the rain as he ran over the trail to the yellow dragon the storm was with him and it was easy going although there was no hall at the other end of it to man the brake for him and regulate the speed of the car this he did for himself however by means of a stout rope which he passed with a turn round the stationary cable  as the full force of the wind struck him in midair swaying the cable and whistling and roaring past it and rocking and careening the car he appreciated more fully what must be the condition of mind of spillane and his wife and this appreciation gave strength to him as safely across he fought his way up the other bank in the teeth of the gale to the yellow dream cable  to his consternation he found the drum in thorough working order everything was running smoothly at both ends where was the hitch in the middle without a doubt  from this side the car containing spillane was only two hundred and fifty feet away he could make out the man and woman through the whirling vapor crouching in the bottom of the car and exposed to the pelting rain and the full fury of the wind in a lull between the squalls he shouted to spillane to examine the trolley of the car  spillane heard for he saw him rise up cautiously on his knees and with his hands go over both trolleywheels then he turned his face toward the bank  shes all right kid  jerry heard the words faint and far as from a remote distance then what was the matter nothing remained but the other and empty car which he could not see but which he knew to be there somewhere in that terrible gulf two hundred feet beyond spillanes car  his mind was made up on the instant he was only fourteen years old slightly and wirily built but his life had been lived among the mountains his father had taught him no small measure of sailoring and he was not particularly afraid of heights  in the toolbox by the drum he found an old monkeywrench and a short bar of iron also a coil of fairly new manila rope he looked in vain for a piece of board with which to rig a boatswains chair there was nothing at hand but large planks which he had no means of sawing so he was compelled to do without the more comfortable form of saddle  the saddle he rigged was very simple with the rope he made merely a large loop round the stationary cable to which hung the empty car when he sat in the loop his hands could just reach the cable conveniently and where the rope was likely to fray against the cable he lashed his coat in lieu of the old sack he would have used had he been able to find one  these preparations swiftly completed he swung out over the chasm sitting in the rope saddle and pulling himself along the cable by his hands with him he carried the monkeywrench and short iron bar and a few spare feet of rope it was a slightly uphill pull but this he did not mind so much as the wind when the furious gusts hurled him back and forth sometimes half twisting him about and he gazed down into the gray depths he was aware that he was afraid it was an old cable what if it should break under his weight and the pressure of the wind  it was fear he was experiencing honest fear and he knew that there was a gone feeling in the pit of his stomach and a trembling of the knees which he could not quell  but he held himself bravely to the task the cable was old and worn sharp pieces of wire projected from it and his hands were cut and bleeding by the time he took his first rest and held a shouted conversation with spillane the car was directly beneath him and only a few feet away so he was able to explain the condition of affairs and his errand  wish i could help you spillane shouted at him as he started on but the wifes gone all to pieces anyway kid take care of yourself i got myself in this fix but its up to you to get me out  oh ill do it jerry shouted back tell mrs spillane that shell be ashore now in a jiffy  in the midst of pelting rain which halfblinded him swinging from side to side like a rapid and erratic pendulum his torn hands paining him severely and his lungs panting from his exertions and panting from the very air which the wind sometimes blew into his mouth with strangling force he finally arrived at the empty car  a single glance showed him that he had not made the dangerous journey in vain the front trolleywheel loose from long wear had jumped the cable and the cable was now jammed tightly between the wheel and the sheaveblock  one thing was clearthe wheel must be removed from the block a second thing was equally clearwhile the wheel was being removed the car would have to be fastened to the cable by the rope he had brought  at the end of a quarter of an hour beyond making the car secure he had accomplished nothing the key which bound the wheel on its axle was rusted and jammed he hammered at it with one hand and held on the best he could with the other but the wind persisted in swinging and twisting his body and made his blows miss more often than not ninetenths of the strength he expended was in trying to hold himself steady for fear that he might drop the monkeywrench he made it fast to his wrist with his handkerchief  at the end of half an hour jerry had hammered the key clear but he could not draw it out a dozen times it seemed that he must give up in despair that all the danger and toil he had gone through were for nothing then an idea came to him and he went through his pockets with feverish haste and found what he soughta tenpenny nail  but for that nail put in his pocket he knew not when or why he would have had to make another trip over the cable and back thrusting the nail through the looped head of the key he at last had a grip and in no time the key was out  then came punching and prying with the iron bar to get the wheel itself free from where it was jammed by the cable against the side of the block after that jerry replaced the wheel and by means of the rope heaved up on the car till the trolley once more rested properly on the cable  all this took time more than an hour and a half had elapsed since his arrival at the empty car and now for the first time he dropped out of his saddle and down into the car he removed the detaining ropes and the trolleywheel began slowly to revolve the car was moving and he knew that somewhere beyond although he could not see the car of spillane was likewise moving and in the opposite direction  there was no need for a brake for his weight sufficiently counterbalanced the weight in the other car and soon he saw the cliff rising out of the cloud depths and the old familiar drum going round and round  jerry climbed out and made the car securely fast he did it deliberately and carefully and then quite unherolike he sank down by the drum regardless of the pelting storm and burst out sobbing  there were many reasons why he sobbedpartly from the pain of his hand which was excruciating partly from exhaustion partly from relief and release from the nervetension he had been under for so long and in a large measure for thankfulness that the man and woman were saved  they were not there to thank him but somewhere beyond that howling stormdriven gulf he knew they were hurrying over the trail toward the clover leaf  jerry staggered to the cabin and his hand left the white knob red with blood as he opened the door but he took no notice of it  he was too proudly contented with himself for he was certain that he had done well and he was honest enough to admit to himself that he had done well but a small regret arose and persisted in his thoughtsif his father had only been there to see     in yeddo bay   somewhere along theater street he had lost it he remembered being hustled somewhat roughly on the bridge over one of the canals that cross that busy thoroughfare possibly some slanteyed lightfingered pickpocket was even then enjoying the fiftyodd yen his purse had contained and then again he thought he might have lost it himself just lost it carelessly  hopelessly and for the twentieth time he searched in all his pockets for the missing purse it was not there his hand lingered in his empty hippocket and he woefully regarded the voluble and vociferous restaurantkeeper who insanely clamored twentyfive sen you pay now twentyfive sen  but my purse the boy said i tell you ive lost it somewhere  whereupon the restaurantkeeper lifted his arms indignantly and shrieked twentyfive sen twentyfive sen you pay now  quite a crowd had collected and it was growing embarrassing for alf davis  it was so ridiculous and petty alf thought such a disturbance about nothing and decidedly he must be doing something thoughts of diving wildly through that forest of legs and of striking out at whomsoever opposed him flashed through his mind but as though divining his purpose one of the waiters a short and chunky chap with an evillooking cast in one eye seized him by the arm  you pay now you pay now twentyfive sen yelled the proprietor hoarse with rage  alf was red in the face too from mortification but he resolutely set out on another exploration he had given up the purse pinning his last hope on stray coins in the little changepocket of his coat he found a tensen piece and fivecopper sen and remembering having recently missed a tensen piece he cut the seam of the pocket and resurrected the coin from the depths of the lining twentyfive sen he held in his hand the sum required to pay for the supper he had eaten he turned them over to the proprietor who counted them grew suddenly calm and bowed obsequiouslyin fact the whole crowd bowed obsequiously and melted away  alf davis was a young sailor just turned sixteen on board the annie mine an american sailingschooner which had run into yokohama to ship its seasons catch of skins to london and in this his second trip ashore he was beginning to snatch his first puzzling glimpses of the oriental mind he laughed when the bowing and kotowing was over and turned on his heel to confront another problem how was he to get aboard ship it was eleven oclock at night and there would be no ships boats ashore while the outlook for hiring a native boatman with nothing but empty pockets to draw upon was not particularly inviting  keeping a sharp lookout for shipmates he went down to the pier at yokohama there are no long lines of wharves the shipping lies out at anchor enabling a few hundred of the shortlegged people to make a livelihood by carrying passengers to and from the shore  a dozen sampan men and boys hailed alf and offered their services he selected the most favorablelooking one an old and beneficentappearing man with a withered leg alf stepped into his sampan and sat down it was quite dark and he could not see what the old fellow was doing though he evidently was doing nothing about shoving off and getting under way at last he limped over and peered into alfs face  ten sen he said  yes i know ten sen alf answered carelessly but hurry up american schooner  ten sen you pay now the old fellow insisted  alf felt himself grow hot all over at the hateful words pay now you take me to american schooner then i pay he said  but the man stood up patiently before him held out his hand and said ten sen you pay now  alf tried to explain he had no money he had lost his purse but he would pay as soon as he got aboard the american schooner then he would pay no he would not even go aboard the american schooner he would call to his shipmates and they would give the sampan man the ten sen first after that he would go aboard so it was all right of course  to all of which the beneficentappearing old man replied you pay now ten sen and to make matters worse the other sampan men squatted on the pier steps listening  alf chagrined and angry stood up to step ashore but the old fellow laid a detaining hand on his sleeve you give shirt now i take you merican schooner he proposed  then it was that all of alfs american independence flamed up in his breast the anglosaxon has a born dislike of being imposed upon and to alf this was sheer robbery ten sen was equivalent to six american cents while his shirt which was of good quality and was new had cost him two dollars  he turned his back on the man without a word and went out to the end of the pier the crowd laughing with great gusto following at his heels the majority of them were heavyset muscular fellows and the july night being one of sweltering heat they were clad in the least possible raiment the waterpeople of any race are rough and turbulent and it struck alf that to be out at midnight on a pierend with such a crowd of wharfmen in a big japanese city was not as safe as it might be  one burly fellow with a shock of black hair and ferocious eyes came up the rest shoved in after him to take part in the discussion  give me shoes the man said give me shoes now i take you merican schooner  alf shook his head whereat the crowd clamored that he accept the proposal now the anglosaxon is so constituted that to browbeat or bully him is the last way under the sun of getting him to do any certain thing he will dare willingly but he will not permit himself to be driven so this attempt of the boatmen to force alf only aroused all the dogged stubbornness of his race the same qualities were in him that are in men who lead forlorn hopes and there under the stars on the lonely pier encircled by the jostling and shouldering gang he resolved that he would die rather than submit to the indignity of being robbed of a single stitch of clothing not value but principle was at stake  then somebody thrust roughly against him from behind he whirled about with flashing eyes and the circle involuntarily gave ground but the crowd was growing more boisterous each and every article of clothing he had on was demanded by one or another and these demands were shouted simultaneously at the tops of very healthy lungs  alf had long since ceased to say anything but he knew that the situation was getting dangerous and that the only thing left to him was to get away his face was set doggedly his eyes glinted like points of steel and his body was firmly and confidently poised this air of determination sufficiently impressed the boatmen to make them give way before him when he started to walk toward the shoreend of the pier but they trooped along beside more noisily than ever one of the youngsters about alfs size and build impudently snatched his cap from his head and before he could put it on his own head alf struck out from the shoulder and sent the fellow rolling on the stones  the cap flew out of his hand and disappeared among the many legs alf did some quick thinking his sailor pride would not permit him to leave the cap in their hands he followed in the direction it had sped and soon found it under the bare foot of a stalwart fellow who kept his weight stolidly upon it alf tried to get the cap by a sudden jerk but failed he shoved against the mans leg but the man only grunted it was challenge direct and alf accepted it like a flash one leg was behind the man and alf had thrust strongly with his shoulder against the fellows chest nothing could save the man from the fierce vigorousness of the trick and he was hurled over and backward  next the cap was on alfs head and his fists were up before him then he whirled about to prevent attack from behind and all those in that quarter fled precipitately this was what he wanted none remained between him and the shore end the pier was narrow facing them and threatening with his fist those who attempted to pass him on either side he continued his retreat it was exciting work walking backward and at the same time checking that surging mass of men but the darkskinned peoples the world over have learned to respect the white mans fist and it was the battles fought by many sailors more than his own warlike front that gave alf the victory  where the pier adjoins the shore was the station of the harbor police and alf backed into the electriclighted office very much to the amusement of the dapper lieutenant in charge the sampan men grown quiet and orderly clustered like flies by the open door through which they could see and hear what passed  alf explained his difficulty in few words and demanded as the privilege of a stranger in a strange land that the lieutenant put him aboard in the policeboat the lieutenant in turn who knew all the rules and regulations by heart explained that the harbor police were not ferrymen and that the policeboats had other functions to perform than that of transporting belated and penniless sailormen to their ships he also said he knew the sampan men to be naturalborn robbers but that so long as they robbed within the law he was powerless it was their right to collect fares in advance and who was he to command them to take a passenger and collect fare at the journeys end alf acknowledged the justice of his remarks but suggested that while he could not command he might persuade the lieutenant was willing to oblige and went to the door from where he delivered a speech to the crowd but they too knew their rights and when the officer had finished shouted in chorus their abominable ten sen you pay now you pay now  you see i can do nothing said the lieutenant who by the way spoke perfect english but i have warned them not to harm or molest you so you will be safe at least the night is warm and half over lie down somewhere and go to sleep i would permit you to sleep here in the office were it not against the rules and regulations  alf thanked him for his kindness and courtesy but the sampan men had aroused all his pride of race and doggedness and the problem could not be solved that way to sleep out the night on the stones was an acknowledgment of defeat  the sampan men refuse to take me out  the lieutenant nodded  and you refuse to take me out  again the lieutenant nodded  well then its not in the rules and regulations that you can prevent my taking myself out  the lieutenant was perplexed there is no boat he said  thats not the question alf proclaimed hotly if i take myself out everybodys satisfied and no harm done  yes what you say is true persisted the puzzled lieutenant but you cannot take yourself out  you just watch me was the retort  down went alfs cap on the office floor right and left he kicked off his lowcut shoes trousers and shirt followed  remember he said in ringing tones i as a citizen of the united states shall hold you the city of yokohama and the government of japan responsible for those clothes good night  he plunged through the doorway scattering the astounded boatmen to either side and ran out on the pier but they quickly recovered and ran after him shouting with glee at the new phase the situation had taken on it was a night long remembered among the waterfolk of yokohama town straight to the end alf ran and without pause dived off cleanly and neatly into the water he struck out with a lusty singleoverhand stroke till curiosity prompted him to halt for a moment out of the darkness from where the pier should be voices were calling to him  he turned on his back floated and listened  all right all right he could distinguish from the babel no pay now pay bime by come back come back now pay bime by  no thank you he called back no pay at all good night  then he faced about in order to locate the annie mine she was fully a mile away and in the darkness it was no easy task to get her bearings first he settled upon a blaze of lights which he knew nothing but a manofwar could make that must be the united states warship lancaster somewhere to the left and beyond should be the annie mine but to the left he made out three lights close together that could not be the schooner for the moment he was confused he rolled over on his back and shut his eyes striving to construct a mental picture of the harbor as he had seen it in daytime with a snort of satisfaction he rolled back again the three lights evidently belonged to the big english tramp steamer therefore the schooner must lie somewhere between the three lights and the lancaster he gazed long and steadily and there very dim and low but at the point he expected burned a single lightthe anchorlight of the annie mine  and it was a fine swim under the starshine the air was warm as the water and the water as warm as tepid milk the good salt taste of it was in his mouth the tingling of it along his limbs and the steady beat of his heart heavy and strong made him glad for living  but beyond being glorious the swim was uneventful on the right hand he passed the manylighted lancaster on the left hand the english tramp and ere long the annie mine loomed large above him he grasped the hanging ropeladder and drew himself noiselessly on deck there was no one in sight he saw a light in the galley and knew that the captains son who kept the lonely anchorwatch was making coffee alf went forward to the forecastle the men were snoring in their bunks and in that confined space the heat seemed to him insufferable so he put on a thin cotton shirt and a pair of dungaree trousers tucked blanket and pillow under his arm and went up on deck and out on the forecastlehead  hardly had he begun to doze when he was roused by a boat coming alongside and hailing the anchorwatch it was the policeboat and to alf it was given to enjoy the excited conversation that ensued yes the captains son recognized the clothes they belonged to alf davis one of the seamen what had happened no alf davis had not come aboard he was ashore he was not ashore then he must be drowned here both the lieutenant and the captains son talked at the same time and alf could make out nothing then he heard them come forward and rouse out the crew the crew grumbled sleepily and said that alf davis was not in the forecastle whereupon the captains son waxed indignant at the yokohama police and their ways and the lieutenant quoted rules and regulations in despairing accents  alf rose up from the forecastlehead and extended his hand saying  i guess ill take those clothes thank you for bringing them aboard so promptly  i dont see why he couldnt have brought you aboard inside of them said the captains son  and the police lieutenant said nothing though he turned the clothes over somewhat sheepishly to their rightful owner  the next day when alf started to go ashore he found himself surrounded by shouting and gesticulating though very respectful sampan men all extraordinarily anxious to have him for a passenger nor did the one he selected say you pay now when he entered his boat when alf prepared to step out on to the pier he offered the man the customary ten sen but the man drew himself up and shook his head  you all right he said you no pay you never no pay you bully boy and all right  and for the rest of the annie mines stay in port the sampan men refused money at alf daviss hand out of admiration for his pluck and independence they had given him the freedom of the harbor
