canopy supported by four attendants motionless as bronze figures  by his side is a betelnut box glittering with gems  on either side of him but much lower down are the two ambassadors of the king of

simplicity they smoke gravely at the invitation of meng beng  round about are grouped the courtiers the poonygees and the kneeling servants while in the background wait the dancing girls banners propelled with a measured rhythm create an agreeable breeze  on a great table of gold stand goblets of gold and heapedup fruits  everywhere will be observed the emblems of the royal peacock and the sacred white elephant  burmese musical instruments sound an abrupt but charming discord  the poinsettias flower punctuates points of deepest colour from out of vases fashioned like the lotus  orchids are everywhere  the indescribable scent of burmah steals across the footlights  the glow the colour the sunswept vista sweeps across the senses  the king claps his hands  the dancing girls at the signal advance  they are clad in dresses made of fish scales which are fastened with diamonds and pale emeralds to imitate the upthrown spray on the crest of a wave  the dance concluded the cingalese ambassadors rise and prepare to take ceremonious leave of the king who hands to them through his vizier his message to his majesty of ceylon inscribed on palm leaves and enclosed in a bejewelled casket  many flowery speeches pass  exit l walking backwards  the king expresses a desire for rest before starting by the moon of taboung 4 for the pagoda of golden flowers  exit meng beng c an alcove of satin hangings which commands a view of the great hall  the crowd break up into groups  u rai gyan thoo and moung pho mhin converse on the tendency of the king to interference in affairs of state his extreme youth and delicacy of temperament the pity that the marriage is to be so long delayed the necessity to find him some distraction in the meantime  suddenly the tomtoms sound loudly  there is much movement  the moon rises over the sea  torches flare as the attendants move to and fro in the gardens beyond  the white elephant of the king with its trappings of gold is led to the entrance where at a word it sinks obediently to the ground  the king appears  he has changed his gay applegreen dress to one of more sombre hue  he enters the howdahthe elephant risesthe procession starts  it consists of not fewer than two hundred persons keeping in view of the audience until lost by a bend in the avenue    scene ii   the pagoda of golden flowers  midnight  surrounded by peepultrees the great htee 6 with its crown of a myriad jewels rises towards the violet starstudded sky its golden bells tinkling in a soft nightwind  when the curtain rises the circular platform is deserted  statues of buddha seated and recumbent fill the numberless niches in the wall and before each burn long candles heapedup pink roses and japonica on brass trays are lit from above by swinging coloured lamps  at intervals are stalls laden with fruit and cheroots  all is mysterious solemn beautiful  a deep burmese gong tolls  people emerge from the four staircases that lead up to the platform  men women and children all in gala attire  the young people conversing gesticulating smiling the older people more subdued carry beads and votive offering to buddha  charming burmese girls with huge cigars meet and greet handsome burmese men smoking cheroots and wearing flowers in their ears children play silently with coloured balls  in the corners under canopies are seated fortunetellers busy casting horoscopes  it is a veritable riot of colour with never a discordant note  through the crowd the king passes alone and unrecognised and disappears through double doors of heavily carved teak wood  he has hardly passed when mah phru a very lovely girl enters in distress she whispers that she desires an audience of the king who has come amongst them  the few who hear her shrug their shoulders smile and pass on  they are incredulous  she goes from group to group but the people turn from her with disdain  then the great doors open and the king is seen  the girl throws herself oriental fashion in his path  her beauty and her pathos arrest his attention and he waves aside those who would interfere  she implores the kings protection  she is willing to be his slave  he listens with deep attention  she explains that since her fathers death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty  the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says  with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads  she rises  the crowd gathers roundall are hushed to silence  the king as one entranced puts aside all who would in any way interfere  the girl precedes him going from the pagoda towards the night  when she reaches the great staircase she beckons oriental fashion with downward hand  the scene should in grouping and colour make for rare beauty    scene iii   a humble dhunnithatched hut set amidst the whispering grandeur of the jungle with its mighty trees its trackless paths its indescribable silence  the curtain discovers mah phru and the king who expresses his amazement at the loneliness and the poverty of her lot  she explains that poverty is not what frightens her but the enmity of those who live yonder and who make it almost impossible for her to sell her cucumbers or her pineapples  the kings gaze never leaves the face or figure of the girl  he declares that he will protect herthat he will build her a home here in the shadow of the loneliness around them  he has two years of an unfettered freedomfor those years he can command his life  he loves her he desires herthey will find a paradise together  the girl trembles with joywith fearwith surprise  and after two years she asks  death he answers     act ii   scene i   the jungle once more  time noonday  in

the broad white steps that lead from the house to the garden  the crows croak drowsily at intervals  parrots scream intermittently  the sound of a guitar playing a venetian lovesong can be heard coming from the interior  otherwise life apparently sleeps  two elderly retainers break the silence  when will the thakin tire of this one asks the other in kindly contempt  the end is already at hand

the peacocks fills the silence  act drop     act iii   scene i   seven years have elapsed  the same scene  curtain discovers mah phru seated on a high verandah  a clearance has been made in the

queen  what queen demands mah phru  the queen of burmah  so mah phru learns for the first time that her lover is the ruler of the country supreme master of and dictator to everyone  weeping but not daring to disobey she summons the children to her then sinking on her knees entreats in moving and pathetic words to be permitted to go with them in the lowest most menial capacity  u rai gyan thoo refuses  there is no place for her in the greatness of the world yonder  even kings forget he says  it is the command of the supreme lord of the earth and of the sky that she remain where she is  then he orders his followers to make the necessary arrangements for the safe journey of their future king and his brother  the children stand passive in their gay dress but are bewildered and afraid  mah phru has risen to her feet  she appears as if turned to bronzea model of restraint and dignity blent with colour and beauty and infinite grace  the curtain descends slowly    scene ii   the same night  the home of the chinese wizard hip loong by the rivera place fitted with chinese things dragons of gold with eyes of jade gleaming from out dim corners buddhas of gigantic size fashioned of priceless metals with heads that move swinging banners with fringes of manycoloured stones lanterns with glass slides on which are painted grotesque figures  the air is full of the scent of joss sticks  the wizard reclines on a divan inhaling opium slowly clothed with the subdued gorgeousness of chinablue and tomatored predominate  he has the appearance of a wrinkled walnut  his forehead is a lattice work of wrinkles  his pigtail braided with red is twisted round his head  his hands are as claws  the effect is weird unearthly  enter mah phru  the wizard silently motions her to some piledup cushions at a little distance  he listens to what she tells him  he appears unmoved at a recital apparently full of tragedy  only the eyes of the dragons move and the heads of the buddhas go slowly like pendulums  when she has finished speaking hip loong makes reply  this is how passion always ends  i have lived for a thousand years and on this planet it is ever the same  mah phru is not listening  how can i go to my children she demands once again  i can turn you into a bird the wizard says  you can fly to the palace and walk and watch ever on that terrace in the rose gardens above the sea  what bird she asks trembling  you shall have the form of the white paddy bird because though a woman and foolish as women ever are you are very pure ivory  o daughter of man and of love  to this mah phru dissents  she paces the long room  transform me into a peacock they are more beautiful  the wizard leaning on his elbow smiles and the smile is a revelation of a mocking comprehension  so be it  he bows his head  the lights fade one by one  curtain    scene iii   the gardens of the palace of the king  time late afternoon  colonnades of roses stretch away on every side  fountains play throwing a shower on waterlilies of monstrous size  peacocks walk with stately tread across the green turf  only one larger and more beautiful than the rest is perched alone with drooping head and folded tail on the broadpillared terrace that overhangs the sea the scene is aglow with light and colour yet holds a shadowed silence  enter some courtiers who converse in perturbed fashion as they go towards the palace  enter moung pho mhin and u rai gyan thoo accompanied by the court physicians and astrologers  the king cannot live beyond the night the physicians say  the sudden mysterious illness that has attacked him defies their skill  the astrologers declare that the stars in their courses fight against his recovery unless a miracle should happen the new day will see him dead  the ministers regard each other in consternation then walk the terrace with bent heads  the peacock on the wall spreads its tail and utters a melancholy cry of poignant pain  the listeners start in superstitious horror  the peacock folds its tail and resumes its meditations  that bird is not as other birds one astrologer declares  i have watched it for years pastit is ever alonethe others all avoid it  i think it has a soul  you mistake replies his colleague it is but an evil nat 32 observe its eyes they are not those of a bird they are those of a spirit in prison  they pass on in the wake of the ministers  the peacock closes its eyes  enter the two young princes accompanied by two great pegu hounds they converse in subdued tones strolling slowly  they are followed by pages of honour carrying grain which the young men proceed to distribute amongst the birds as they rapidly approach them  the peacock on the wall never stirs she watches the young men always then the elder one comes with a handful of food and proffers it but the peacock does not eat  i shall never understand you queen of the kingdom of birds he says and strokes her feathers  at his touch the plumage scintillates with a brighter a more exquisite sheen  he murmurs to the bird in soft tones and mythical words  he tells it that the fear of everyone is that the king is mortally stricken for he lies yonder in most strange and evil agony that the hearts of himself and his brother are numb with the sorrow that knows no language  the bird listens eagerly  and if the king should go he the speaker will reign in his stead  the prospect fills him with fear  he desires as also his brother if the king must die to return to dwell in the forest with the mother who he knows awaits them there  the peacock spreads its wings as if for flight then crouches down once more and over it watches the young prince  the sun envelops them both in a sudden shaft of rose and purple and gold  a servant descends and comes across the grass  he shikoes profoundly to the two young men lifting up his hands in the deepest reverence of burmah  the lord of the earth and the sky desires his sons he nears the great unknown  curtain    scene iv   the retreat of hip loong the wizard  time the same night  the curtain discovers mah phru who has returned to human form and the wizard together  he tells her that he has restored her to her former state only because she has implored him to do so that her life is measured by hours as a consequence of such insensate folly in breaking the vow of five years back  but the king will live she murmurs  the king will live  he will find happiness with someone fairer than you  that is well  your life for his  it is the price  the price is nothing  have i not looked on my hearts beloved one for five yearslooked on his faceheard his voicetrembled with joy at his footsteps  have i not waited and watched  have i not gazed on my sons and seen their royal bearing and known their touch  you are then content  you are a wizardyou can read that i am  it is not i that am a wizardit is love  that is the only wizard this world knows  curtain    scene v   the bedchamber of the kingvast and shadowy  on heapedup cushions and covers of yellow and blue under a pearlsewn creamy velvet baldaquin embroidered with peacocks lies meng beng mortally stricken his face bears the ashen pallor that only dark skins know  the ministers the servants the courtiers the countless motley gathering of an eastern court are scattered in anxious groups watching waiting murmuring  only the space near the couch is clear  without the dawn breaks over the sea and stealing through the opening makes the great chamber flush till it looks like porphyry  the tolling of a deep gong and the voices of a myriad birds invade the throbbing silence of the palace  he passes murmur the physicians  everyones gaze turns to the dying man  yet his star is in the ascendant say the astrologers  the risen sun touches him with its light like a caress  he opens his eyes  his sons advance  they raise him high on his cushions and give a restorative  the end has come  suddenly he rallies slightly  the doors at the far end are rudely opened  a woman young and lovely advances thrusting roughly aside the many hands stretched out to bar her path  she reaches the king  i bring you life star of my soul she cries i bring you life and so saying falls dead at his feet  the courtiers rush forward  the king rises  he stands erect  the sun lies like a golden benediction over all  jewels glitter  the whole world of birds sing  the
