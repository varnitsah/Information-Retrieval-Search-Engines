i watched my leaden soldiers go     with different uniforms and drills     among the bedclothes through the hills      and sometimes sent my ships in fleets     all up and down among the sheets     or brought my trees and houses out     and planted cities all about      i was the giant great and still     that sits upon the pillowhill     and sees before him dale and plain     the pleasant land of

several nails     and water in the nursery pails     and tom said let us also take     an apple and a slice of cake     which was enough for tom and me     to go asailing on till tea      we sailed along for days and days     and had the very best of plays     but tom fell out and hurt his knee     so there was no one left but me  illustration     looking forward       when i am grown to mans

from breakfast on through all the day     at home among my friends i stay     but every night i go abroad     afar into the land of nod      all by myself i have to go     with none to tell me what to do     all alone beside the streams     and up the mountain sides of dreams      the strangest things are there for me     both things to eat and things to see     and many frightening sights abroad     till morning in the land of nod      try as i like to find the way     i never can get back by day     nor can remember plain and clear     the curious music that i hear     system       every night

is more than i can see     he is very very like me from the heels up to the head     and i see him jump before me when i jump into my bed      the funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow     not at all like proper children which is always very slow     for he sometimes shoots up taller like an indiarubber ball     and he sometimes gets so little that theres none of him at all  illustration       he hasnt got a notion of how children ought to play     and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way     he stays so close beside me hes a coward you can see     id think

to play      and now at last the sun is going down behind the wood     and i am very happy for i know that ive been good      my bed is waiting cool and fresh with linen smooth and fair     and i must off to sleepsinby and not forget my prayer      i know that till tomorrow i shall see the sun arise     no ugly dream shall fright my mind no ugly sight my eyes      but slumber hold me tightly till i waken in the dawn     and hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn     escape at bedtime       the lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out       through the blinds and the windows and bars     and high overhead and all moving about       there were thousands of millions of stars     there neer were such thousands of leaves on a tree       nor of people in church or the park     as the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me       and that glittered and winked in the dark      the dog and the plough and the hunter and all       and the star of the sailor and mars     these shone in the sky and the pail by the wall       would be half full of water and stars     they saw me at last and they chased me with cries       and they soon had me packed into bed     but the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes       and the stars going round in my head  illustration     at the seaside       when i was down beside the sea     a wooden spade they gave to me       to

a field at the end of the grounds     of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own     it was nursie who made it and nursie alone      the stone with the white and the yellow and gray     we discovered i cannot tell how far away     and i carried it back although weary and cold     for though father denies it im sure it is gold      but of all my treasures the last is the king     for

and whereer i may be     ill always remember my town by the sea  illustration     the land of storybooks       at evening when the lamp is lit     around the fire my parents sit     they sit at home and talk and sing     and do not play at anything      now with my little gun i crawl     all in the dark along the wall     and follow round the forest track     away behind the sofa back      there in the night where none can spy     all in my hunters camp i lie     and play at books that i have read     till it is time to go to bed      these are the hills these are the woods     these are my starry solitudes     and there the river by whose brink     the roaring lions come to drink      i see the others far away     as if in firelit camp they lay     and i like an indian scout     around their party prowled about      so when my nurse comes in for me     home i return across the sea     and go to bed with backward looks     at my dear land of storybooks  illustration     the little land       when at home alone i sit     and am very tired of it     i have just to shut my eyes     to go sailing through the skies     to go sailing far away     to the pleasant land of play     to the fairy land afar     where the little people are     where the clovertops are trees     and the rainpools are the seas     and the leaves like little ships     sail about on tiny trips         and above the daisy tree         through the grasses     high oerhead the bumble bee         hums and passes  illustration      in that forest to and fro     i can wander i can go     see the spider and the fly     and the ants go marching by     carrying parcels with their feet     down the green and grassy street     i can in the sorrel sit     where the ladybird alit     i can climb the jointed grass         and on high     see the greater swallows pass         in the sky     and the round sun rolling by     heeding no such things as i      through that forest i can pass     till as in a lookingglass     humming fly and daisy tree     and my tiny self i see     painted very clear and neat     on the rainpool at my feet     should a leaflet come to land     drifting near to where i stand     straight ill board that tiny boat     round the rainpool sea to float  illustration      little thoughtful creatures sit     on the grassy coasts of it     little things with lovely eyes
