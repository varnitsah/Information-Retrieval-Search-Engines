farmhouse in a midland county it lay in a hollow nestled close up against rothland wood the dark closegrowing trees of which formed a picturesque background to the worn greystone whereof it was fashioned  in front just across the road was the boundarywall of ravenor park with its black fir spinneys huge masses of lichencovered rock clear fishponds and breezy hills from the summits of which were visible the sombre grey towers of ravenor castle standing out with grim rugged boldness against the sky  forbidden ground though it was there was not a yard of the park up to the inner boundary fence which i did not know not a spinney where i had not searched for birds nests or raided in quest of the first primrose not a hill on which i had not spent some part of a summer afternoon  i was a trespasser of course but i was the son of farmer morton an old tenant on the estate and much in favour with the keepers by reason of a famous brew which he was ever ready to offer a thirsty man or to drink himself so mortons young un was unmolested and save for an occasional goodhumoured warning from crooks the headgamekeeper during breedingtime i had the run of the place  moreover the great estates of which ravenor park was the centre knew at that time no other master than a lawyer of nonsporting proclivities so the preserves were only looked after as a matter of form  i was eight years old and an unusually hot summer was at its height it was past midday and i had just come out from the house with the intention of settling down for an afternoons reading in a shady corner of the orchard i had reached the stackyard gate when i stopped short my hand upon the fastening  a most unusual sound was floating across the meadows through the breathless air the churchbells of rothland the village on the other side of the wood had suddenly burst out into a wild clashing peal of joy  in a country district everybody knows everyone elses business and child though i was i knew that no marriage was taking place anywhere near  i stood listening in wonderment for i had never heard such a thing before and while i was lingering the bells from annerley a village a little farther away and the grand mellowsounding chimes from the chapel at ravenor castle breaking the silence of many years took up the peal and the lazy summer day seemed all of a sudden to wake up into a state of unaccountable delight  i ran back towards the house and met my mother standing in the cool stone porch the men about the farm were all grouped together wondering no one had the least idea of what had happened  and then jim harrison the waggoner who had just come in from the home meadow called out quickly pointing with his finger and far away along the white dusty road we could see the figure of a man on horseback riding towards us at a furious gallop  it be the master he cried excitedly it be the master for sure there beant no mistaking brown besss gallop lordamercy how e be ariding her  we all trooped out on to the road to meet my father eager to hear the news in a few moments he reached us and brought brown bess to a standstill bathed in sweat and dust and quivering in every limb  hurrah lads he shouted waving his whip above his head hurrah there never was such a bit o news as ive got for you all mellborough be gone crazy about it  what is it george why dont you tell us my mother asked quickly and to my surprise her hand in which mine was resting was as cold as ice notwithstanding the august heat  he raised himself in his stirrups and shouted so that all might hear  squire ravenor be come to life again they a found him on an island in the pacific close against the coral reef where his yacht went down six years ago hes on his way home again lads think of that sal lass bring us up a gallon of ale and another after it well drink to his homecoming lads  there was a burst of applause and many exclamations of wonder my mothers hand had moved as though unconsciously to my shoulder and she was leaning heavily upon me  where did you hear this george she asked in a subdued tone  why it be in all the london papers this morning he answered taking off his hat and wiping his forehead the steamer thats bringing him home a sent a message from some foreign port and lawyer cox hes got one and its all written up large on the walls of the corn exchange i reckon itll make those deuced lawyers sit up chuckled my father as he slowly dismounted  lordamercy only to think on it six year on a little bit o an island and not a living soul to speak a word to and now hes on his way home again it beats all storytelling i ever heerd on why alice lass it a quite upset you he added looking anxiously at my mother youre all white and scaredlike dost feel badly  she was standing with her back to us and when she turned round it seemed to me that a change had crept into her face  it is the heat and excitement she said quietly this is strange news i think that i will go in and rest  all right lass get thee indoors and lie down for a bit now then lads hurrah for the squire and long life to him pour it out jimpour it out dont be afraid on it such news as this dont coom every day  and with the vision of my stalwart yeoman father the centre of a little group of farmlabourers holding his foaming glass high above his head and his honest face ruddy with heat and excitement my memories of this scene grow dim and fade away                                   chapter ii                               mr francis   i was alone with my father in the kitchen and he was looking as i had never seen him look before it was late in the afternoonas near as i can remember about six weeks after the news had reached us of mr ravenors wonderful adventures he had just come in for tea flushed with toil and labouring in the hot sun but as he stood on the flags before me reading a letter which had been sent up from the village the glow seemed to die out from his face and his strong rough hands trembled  its a lie i heard him mutter to himself in a hoarse whispera wicked lie  then he sank back in one of the highbacked chairs and i watched him frightened  philip lad he said to me speaking slowly and yet with a certain eagerness in his tone has your mother had any visitors lately whilst i a been out on the farm  i shook my head  no one except mr francis i added doubtfully  he groaned and hid his face for a moment  how often has he been here he asked after a while when did he come first dost remember  yes i answered promptly it was on the day tom foulds fell from the oatstack and broke his leg there was another gentleman with him then i saw them looking in at the orchard gate so i asked them if they wanted anything and the strange gentleman said that he was thirsty and would like some milk so i took him into the dairy and i think that mother must have known him before for she seemed so surprised to see him  he gave me half a crown too i went on to run away and watch for a friend of his but the friend never came although i waited ever so long hes been often since but i dont like him and  i broke off in sudden dismay had not my mother forbidden my mentioning these visits to anyone what had i done i began to cry silently  my father rose from his chair and leaned against the oaken chimneypiece with his back turned towards me  its he sure enough he gasped heaven forgive her but himhim  his voice seemed choked with passion and he did not finish his sentence i knew that i had done wrong and a vague apprehension of threatening evil stole swiftly upon me but i sat still and waited  it was long before my father turned round and spoke again when he did so i scarcely knew him for there were deep lines across his forehead and all the healthy sunburnt tan seemed to have gone from his face he looked ten years older and i trembled when he spoke  listen philip lad he said gravely your mother thinks i be gone straight away to farmer woods to see about the colt dont she  i nodded silently we had not expected him home again until late in the evening  now look you here philip he continued shes gone to bed wi a headache you say very well just you promise me that you wont go near her  i promised readily enough then he bade me get my tea and he sank back again into his chair once i asked him timidly if he were not going to have some but he took no notice when i had finished he led me softly upstairs and locked me in my room never to this day have i forgotten that dull look of hopeless agony in his face as he turned away and left me                                   chapter iii                      the murder at the slatepits   it was late on this same evening all day long the thunder had been rumbling and growling and now the storm seemed close at hand  i had partly undressed but it was too hot to get into bed so i leaned out of my wideopen window watching the black clouds hanging down from the sky and listening to the rustling of leaves in the woodsure sign of the coming storm  the air was stifling and longing feverishly for the rain i sat in the deep windowsill and looked out into the scented darkness for honeysuckle and clematis drooped around my window and the garden below was overgrown with homely sweetsmelling flowers  suddenly i started i was quick at hearing and i had distinctly caught the sound of a light firm step passing down the garden path beneath my first impulse was to call out but i checked it when i recognised the tall graceful figure moving swiftly along the gravel walk in the shade of the yewhedge it was my mother  i watched her scarcely believing my eyes what could she be wanting in the garden at this hour and while i sat on the window casement wondering a cold shiver of alarm chilled me for i saw a man creep stealthily out from the wood and hurry across the little stretch of meadow towards the garden gate where she was standing  the moon was shining with a sickly light through a thick halo of mist and i could only just distinguish the figures of my mother and this man side by side talking earnestly i watched them with riveted eyes until i heard a quick step on the floor behind me and a hand was laid upon my mouth stifling my cry of surprise  its only me philip lad whispered a hoarse tremulous voice i didnt want you to call outthats all hast seen anything of this before and he pointed with shaking finger towards the window from which he had drawn me back a little  i looked at him a great horror stealing over me his ruddy face was blanched and drawn as though with pain and there was a terrible light in his eyes i was frightened and half inclined to cry  no i faltered its only mr francis isnt it  only mr francis i heard my father repeat with a groan oh alice lassalice how could you  he staggered blindly towards the door i rushed after him piteously calling him back but he pushed me off roughly and hurried out  i heard him leave the house but he did not go down the garden then in a few minutes every one of which seemed to me like an hour the low voices at the gate ceased and my mother came slowly up the path towards the house  i rushed downstairs and met her in the hall she seemed half surprised half angry to see me  philip she exclaimed i thought you were in bed long ago what are you doing here  i am frightened i sobbed out father has been in my room watching you at the gate and he talked so strangely he is very angry and he looks as though he were going to hurt someone  my mother leaned against the wall every vestige of colour gone from her face and her hand pressed to her side she understood better than i did then  where is he now she asked hysterically quick philipquick tell me  he is gone i answered he went out by the front door and up the road  a sudden calmness seemed to come to her and she stood for a moment thinking aloud  he has gone up to the wood gate they will meet in the wood oh heaven prevent it she cried passionately  she turned and rushed into the garden down the path and through the wicket gate towards the wood i followed her afraid to stay alone a vast mass of inkyblack clouds had sailed in front of the moon and the darkness especially in the wood was intense  more than once i fell headlong down scratching my face and hands with the brambles but each time i was on my feet immediately scarcely conscious of the pain in my wild desire to keep near my mother  how she found her way i cannot tell great pieces of her dress were torn off and remained hanging to the bushes into which she stepped and many times i saw her run against a tree and recoil half stunned by the shock  but still we made progress and at last we came to a part of the wood where the trees and undergrowth were less dense and there was a steep ascent up it we ran and when we reached the top my mother paused to listen while i stood breathless by her side  save that the leaves above us were stirring with a curious motion there was not a sound in the whole wood birds and animals even insects seemed to have crept away to their holes before the coming storm we could see nothing for a thick mantle of darknessa darkness which could almost be felthad fallen upon the earth we stood crouched together trembling and fearful  thank heaven for the darkness my mother murmured to herself philip she went on stooping down and feeling for my hand do you know where we are we should be close to the slatepits  i was on the point of answering her but the words died away on my parted lips such a sight as was revealed to us at that moment might have driven a strong man mad  although half a lifetime has passed away i can see it now as at that moment but describe it i cannot for no words of mine could paint the thrilling beauty and at the same time the breathless horror of the scene which opened like a flash before us  trees sky and space were suddenly bathed in a brilliant lurid light the like of which i have never since seen nor ever shall again it came and went in a space of time which only thought could measure and this is what it showed us  yawning at our feet the deep pit and sullen waters of the quarry for we were scarcely a single step from the precipitous edge the huge piles of slate and the sheds with the workmens tools scattered around and my father his arms thrown upwards in agony and a wild cry bursting from his lips at the very moment that he was hurled over the opposite side of the chasm  we saw the frantic convulsions of despair upon his ashen face his eyes starting from their sockets as he felt himself falling into space and we saw the dim outline of another man staggering back from the brink with his hands outstretched before his face in horror at what he had done  then as suddenly as it had come the fierce glare vanished the heavensonly a moment before open and flooding the land with sheets of living firewere black and impenetrable and the crashing thunder shook the air around and made the earth tremble as though it were splitting up and the very elements were being dissolved  with a cry the heartrending anguish of which will ring for ever in my ears my mother sank down a white scared heap and i my limbs unstrung and my senses numbed crouched helpless beside her then the rain fell and there was silence                                   chapter iv                           my mothers warning   for many weeks after that terrible night in rothland wood i lay wrestling with a fierce fever my recovery from which was deemed little short of miraculous a sound constitution however and careful nursing brought me round and i opened my eyes one sunny morning upon what seemed to me almost a new world  the first thing that i can clearly remember after my return to consciousness was the extraordinary change which had taken place in my mother from a beautiful active woman she seemed to have become transformed into a stern cold statue  even now i can recall how frightened i was of her during those first days of convalescence and how i shrank from her constant presence by my bedside with a nameless dread  the change was in her appearance as well as in her manner her rich brown hair had turned completely grey and there was a frigid set look in her face denuded of all expression or affection which chilled me every time i looked into it it was the facenot of my mother but of a stranger  as i began to regain strength and the doctors pronounced me fit to leave the sickroom she began to display signs of uneasiness and often looked at me in a singular kind of way as though there were something which she would say to me  and one night i woke up suddenly to find her standing by my bedside wrapped in a long dressinggown her grey hair streaming down her back and a wild gleam in her burning eyes i started up in bed with a cry of fear but she held out her hand with a gesture which she intended to be reassuring  nothing is the matter philip she said lie down but listen  i obeyed and had she noticed me closely she would have seen that i was shivering for her strange appearance and the total lack of affection in her manner had filled me with something approaching to horror  philip you will soon be well enough to go out she continued people will ask you questions about that night  it was the first time the subject had been broached between us i raised myself a little in the bed and gazed at her with blanched cheeks and fascinated eyes  listen philip you must remember nothing do you understand me  yes i answered faintly  you must forget that you saw me in the garden you must forget everything your father said to you do you hear  yes i repeated butbut mother  well  will he be caughtthe man who killed father i asked timidly oh i hope he will  her lips parted slowly and she laugheda bitter hysterical laugh which seemed to me the most awful sound i had ever heard  hope yes you may hopehope if you will she cried but remember this boy if your hope comes true it will be an evil day for you and for me remember  then she turned and walked to the door without another word i sat in bed and watched her piteously with a great lump in my throat and a sore heart the moonlight was pouring in through my latticed window falling full upon the long graceful lines of her stately figure and her hard cold face i was forlorn and unhappy but to look at her froze the words upon my lips  merciless and cruel her features seemed to me there was no pity no love not a shadow of response to my halfformed appealing gesture i let her go and sank back upon my pillows weeping bitterly with a deep sense of utter loneliness and desolation  on the following day i was allowed to leave my room and very soon i was able to get about as my mother had anticipated many people asked me questions concerning the events of that hideous night to one and all my answer was the same i remembered nothing my illness had left my memory a blank  long afterwards i saw more clearly how well it was that i had obeyed my mothers bidding  a brief extract from a county newspaper will be sufficient to show what the universal opinion was concerning my fathers murder i copy it here  in another column will be found an account of the inquest on the body of george morton farmer late of rothland wood farm the verdict returned by the jurynamely wilful murder against john franciswas in the face of the evidence the only possible one and everyone must unite in hoping that the efforts of the police will be successful and that the criminal will not be allowed to escape the facts are simple and conclusive  it appears from the evidence of mr bullson landlord of the george hotel mellborough and of several other habitués of the place that only a few days before the deed was committed there was a violent dispute between deceased and francis and that threats were freely used on both sides on the night in question francis started from rothland village shortly after nine oclock with the intention of making his way through the wood to ravenor castle owing no doubt to the extraordinary darkness of the night he appears to have lost his way and to have been directed by mrs morton who noticed him wandering about near her garden gate  mrs morton declines to swear to his identity owing in the darkness but this in the face of other circumstances must count for little in his favour he was also seen by the deceased who enraged at finding him on his land and addressing his wife started in pursuit followed by mrs morton and her little boy who arrived at the slatepits in time to witness but too late to prevent the awful tragedy which we fully reported a few days since  in face of the flight of the man francis and the known fact that he was in the wood that night there is little room for doubt as to his being the actual perpetrator of the deed although the details of the struggle must remain for the present shrouded in mystery mr ravenor who has just arrived in england has offered a reward of £500 for information leading to the arrest of francis who was a servant at the castle                                    chapter v                           ravenor of ravenor   it was generally expected that my mother would be anxious to depart as soon as possible from a neighbourhood which had such terrible associations for her as a matter of fact she showed no intention of doing anything of the sort at the time i rather wondered at this but i am able now to divine her reason  it chanced that the farm of which my father had been tenant for nearly a quarter of a century was taken by a neighbour who had no use for the house and so it was arranged that we should stay on at a merely nominal rent then began a chapter of my life without event which i can pass rapidly over  every morning i walked over to rothland and received two hours instruction from the curate and in the afternoon my mother taught me modern languages the rest of the day i spent alone wandering whithersoever i pleased staying away as long as i chose and returning when i felt inclined the results of such a life at my age soon developed themselves i became something of a misanthrope a great reader and a passionate lover of nature at any rate it was healthy and my taste for all sorts of outdoor sport prevented my becoming a bookworm  it had its influence too upon my disposition it strengthened and gave colour to my imagination expanded my mind and filled me with a strong love for everything that was vigorous and fresh and pure in the books i read  shakespeare and goethe were my first favourites in literature but as i grew older the fascination of lyric poetry obtained a hold upon me and shelley and keats for a time reigned supreme in my fancy but my tastes were catholic i read everything that came in my way and was blessed with a wonderful memory which enabled me to retain much that was worth retaining  meanwhile the more purely technical part of my education was being steadily persevered in and so i was not surprised although it was rather a blow to me when the clergyman who had been my tutor walked home with me through the wood one summer evening and told my mother that it was useless my going to him any longer for i already knew all that he could teach me  i watched her covertly hoping that she would show some sign of gratification at what i felt to be a high compliment but she simply remarked that if such was the case she supposed the present arrangement had better terminate thanked him for the trouble he had taken with me and dismissed the matter i scanned her cold beautiful face in vain for any signs of interest the cloud which had fallen between us on the night of my fathers murder had never been lifted  the curate stayed to tea with us and afterwards i walked back through the woods with him for he was a sociable fellow fond of companyeven mine  when i reached home again i found my mother looking out for me and i knew from her manner that she had something important to say to me  philip i have heard today that mr ravenor is expected home she said slowly  i started and a little exclamation of pleasure escaped me there was no man whom i longed so much to see what a reputation was his a scholar of european fame a poet and a great sinner a croesus at times a reckless sybarite at others an ascetic and a hermit a student of voltaire the founder of a new school of philosophy all these things i had heard of him at different times but as yet i had never seen him something more than my curiosity had been excited and i looked forward now to its gratification  my mother took no note of my exclamation but her brow darkened we were standing together on the lawn in front of the house and she was in the shadow of a tall cypress tree  i do not suppose that he will remain here long she continued in a hard strained tone but while he is at the castle it is my wish that you do not enter the park at all  not enter the park i repeated the words and stared at my mother in blank astonishment what difference could mr ravenors presence make to us  surely you do not mean this i cried bitterly disappointed why i have been looking forward for years to see mr ravenor he is a famous man  i know it she interrupted and a very dangerous one i do not wish you to meet him the chances are that he would not notice you if he saw you but it is better to run no risks you will remember what i have said a man of his strange views and principles is to be avoidedespecially by an impressionable boy like you  she left me dumbfounded crossed the lawn with smooth even footsteps and entered the house i watched her disappear disturbed and uneasy something in her manner had conveyed a strange impression to me i could not help thinking she had other reasons than those she had given for wishing to keep mr ravenor and me apart it seemed on the face of it to be a very absurd notion but it had laid hold of me and her subsequent conduct did not tend to dispel it  on the afternoon of his expected arrival i lingered about for hours in the orchard hoping to catch a glimpse of him for the gates of the park opposite our house were the nearest to mellborough station but i was disappointed he came it is true but in a closed brougham drawn by a pair of swift highstepping bays which swept like a flash by the hedge over which i was looking leaving a confused recollection of glistening harness handsome liveries and a dark noble face partly turned towards me but imperfectly seen it was a glimpse which only increased my interest yet how to gratify my curiosity in view of my mothers wishes i could not tell  that night she renewed her prohibition she came to me in the little room where i kept my books and penates and laid her hand upon my shoulder mr ravenor had returned she saidhow did she know save that she too had been watching for the flag was not yet hoistedand she hoped that i would remember what her wishes were  i promised that i would observe them as far as i could although they seemed to me ridiculous and i did not hesitate to hint as much what was more unlikely than that mr ravenor distinguished man of the world should take the slightest notice of a country boy much more attempt to gain any sort of influence over him the more i thought of it and of my mothers nervous fears the more i grew convinced against my will of some other motive which was to be kept secret from me  a week passed and very little was seen of mr ravenor by anyone as usual many rumours were circulated and discussed he was reported to have shut himself up in his library and to have refused admission to all visitors he was living like an anchorite fasting and working hard surrounded by books and manuscripts all day and night and far into the small hours of the morning he was doing penance for recent excesses he was preparing for some wild orgies he was writing a novel a philosophical pamphlet an article for the reviews or another volume of poems  among all classes of our neighbours nothing else was talked about but the doings or supposed doings of mr ravenor  one afternoon chance led me into the little room which my mother called her own a room i seldom entered there was a small volume lying on the table and carelessly i took it up and glanced at the title then with a quick exclamation of pleasure i carried it away with me it was mr ravenors first little volume of poems which i had tried in vain to get the mellborough bookseller of whom i had ordered it told me that it was out of print the first edition had been exhausted long since and the author had refused to allow a second edition to be issued  i met my mother in the hall and held out the volume to her  you never told me that you had a copy of mr ravenors poems i said reproachfully i have just found it in your room  she started and for a moment i feared that she was going to insist upon my giving up the book she did not do so however but i noticed that the hand which was resting upon the banister was grasping the handrail nervously as though for support and that she was white to the very lips  no i had forgotten she said slowlyi mean that i had forgotten you had ever asked for it take care of it philip and give it me back tonight it was given to me by a friend and i value it  i promised and left the house my range of pleasures was in some respects a limited one but it did not prevent me from being an epicure with regard to their enjoyment i did not glance inside the book although i was longing to do so until i had walked five or six miles and had reached one of my favourite haltingplaces then i threw myself down in the shadow of a great rock on the top of beacon hill and took the volume from my pocket  it was a small olivegreen book delicately bound and printed upon rough paper it had been given to my mother evidently for her christian name was inside written in a fine dashing hand and underneath were some initials which had become indistinct then having satisfied myself of this and handled it for a few moments i turned over the pages rapidly and began to read  the first part was composed almost entirely of sonnets and lovepoems one after another i read them and wondered there was nothing amateurish nothing weak here they were full of glowing imagery of brilliant colouring of passion of fire crude some of them seemed to me who had read no modern poetry and knew many of shakespeares and miltons sonnets by heart but full of genius nevertheless and with the breath of life warm in them  the second portion was devoted to longer poems and these i liked best there was in some more than a touch of the graceful fascinating mysticism of shelley the passionate outcry of a strong noble mind seeking to wrest from nature her vast secrets and to fathom the mysteries of existence the wail of bewildered nobility of soul turning in despair from the cold creeds of modern religion to seek some other and higher form of spiritual life  i read on until the sun had gone down and the shades of twilight had chased the afterglow from the western sky then i closed the book and rose suddenly with a great start  scarcely a dozen yards away on the extreme summit of the hill a man on horseback sat watching me his unusually tall figure and the fine shape of the coalblack horse which he was riding stood out against the background of the distant sky with a vividness which seemed almost more than natural such a face as his i had never seen never imagined i could neither describe it nor think of anything with which to compare it  dark with jetblack hair and complexion perfectly clear but tanned by southern suns a small firm mouth a high forehead furrowed with thought aquiline nose greyblue eyes powerful and expressiveany man might thus be described and yet lack altogether the wonderful charm of the face into which i looked it was the rare combination of perfect classical modelling with intensity of character and nobility of intellect it was the face of a king among men and yet there were times when a certain smile played around those iron lips and a certain light flashed in those brilliant eyes when to look into it made me shudder but that was afterwards  he remained looking at me and i at him for fully a minute then he beckoned to me with his whipa slight but imperious gesture i rose and walked to his side  who are you he asked curtly  my name is philip morton i answered i live at rothland wood farmhouse  son of the man who was murdered  i assented he gazed at me fixedly with the faintest possible expression of interest in his languid grey eyes  you were very intent upon your book he remarked what was it  i held it up  you should know it sir i answered  he glanced at the title and shrugged his shoulders slightly there were indications of a frown upon his fine forehead  you should be able to employ your time better than that he said  i dont think so i am fond of readingespecially poetry i replied  the idea seemed to amuse him for he smiled and the stem lines in his countenance relaxed for a moment directly his lips were parted his whole expression was transformed and i understood what women had meant when they talked about the fascination of his face  fond of reading are you a village bookworm well they say that to booklovers every volume has a language and a mission of its own what do my schoolboy voices tell you  that you were once in love i answered quickly  a halfamused halfcontemptuous shade passed across his face  youth has its follies like every other stage of life he said i daresay i experienced the luxury of the sensation once but it must have been a long time ago come is that all it tells you  it tells me that men lie when they call you an atheist  he sat quite still on his horse and the smile on his lips became a mocking one  atheism was most unfashionable when those verses were written he remarked any other ism was popular enough but atheism sounded ugly besides i was only a boy then perhaps i had some imagination left it is a gift which one loses in later life  but religion is not dependent upon imagination  wholly religion is an effort of imagination and therefore is more or less a matter of disposition that is one of its chief absurdities women and sensitive boys are easiest affected by it men of sturdy commonsense men with brains and the knowledge how to use them are every day bursting the trammels of an effete orthodoxy  and what can their commonsense and their brains give them in its place i asked i cannot conceive any practical religion without orthodoxy  a little measure of philosophy it is all they want only the fainthearted who have not the courage to contemplate physical annihilation console themselves by building up a hysterical faith in an impossible hereafter there is no hereafter  a horrible creed i exclaimed  by no means let men devote half the time and the efforts that they devote to this phantasy of religion to schooling themselves in philosophic thought and they will learn to contemplate it unmoved to recognise that the end of life is inevitable is to rob it of most of its terrors save to cowards the man who wastes a tissue of his body in regretting what he cannot prevent is a fool annihilation is a more comfortable doctrine and a more reasonable one too dont you agree with me boy  no not with a single word i cried growing hot and a little angry for i could see that he was only half in earnest and i had no fancy to be made a butt of imagination is not the groundwork of religion commonsense is why  oh spare me the stock arguments he broke in with a slight shudder keep your religion and hug it as close as you like if you find it any comfort to you where have you been to school  nowhere i answered i have read with mr sands the curate of rothland  he laughed softly to himself as though the idea amused him looking at me all the time as though i were some sort of natural curiosity  fond of reading are you he asked abruptly  yes fonder than i am of anything else  and your bookswhere do they come from  wherever i can get any from the library at mellborough or from mr sands most of them he laughed again and repeated my words as though amused  no wonder youre behind the times he remarked now shall i lend you some books  i shook my head feebly for i was longing to accept his offer  im afraid your sort of books would not suit me i said i dont want to be converted to your way of thinking it seems to me that there is such a thing as overtraining of the mind  so you look upon me as a sort of mephistopheles eh well ive no ambition to make a convert of you to be a pessimist is to be  an unhappy man i interrupted eagerly and a very narrowminded one too it is a cityborn creed no one could live out here in the country and espouse it  boy how old are you he asked abruptly  seventeen next birthday sir i answered  you have a glib tonguethe sign of an empty head i fear  better empty than full of unhealthy philosophy i answered bluntly  he laughed outright  the country air has sharpened your wits at any rate he said youre a fool philip morton but you will be happier in your folly than other men in their wisdom theres a great deal of comfort in ignorance  he gave me a careless yet not unkind nod and wheeling his great horse round with a turn of the wrist galloped down the hillside and across the soft spongy turf at a pace which soon carried him out of sight but i stood for a while on a piece of broken rock on the summit of the hill gazing after his retreating figure and watching the twinkling lights from the many villages stretched away in the valley below the sound of his low strong voice yet vibrated in my ears and the sad beautiful face with its languid grey eyes and weary expression seemed still by my side already i began to feel something of the influence which this man appeared to exercise over everyone whom he came near and i felt vaguely even then that if suffered to grow it would become an influence allpowerful with me  when i reached home it was lateso late that my mother who seldom betrayed any interest or curiosity in my doings asked me questions i felt a curious reluctance at first to tell her with whom i had been talking and it was justified when i saw the effect which my words had upon her a look almost of horror filled her eyes and her face was white with anger it was as though a longexpected blow had fallen  at last at last she murmured to herself as though forgetful of my presence then her eyes closed and her lips moved softly it seemed to me that she was praying  i was bewildered and inclined to be angry that she should carry her dislike of mr ravenor so far did she think me so weak and impressionable that a few minutes conversation with any man could bring me harm  you carry your dislike of mr ravenor a little too far mother i ventured to say what can you know of him so bad that you see danger in my having talked with him for a few minutes  she looked at me fixedly and grew more composed  it is too late now philip she said in a low tone the mischief is done if i could have foreseen this we would have gone away  to have avoided mr ravenor i cried wondering  yes                                   chapter vi                           a doubtful visitor   late in the afternoon of the following day a visitor rode through the stackyard and reined in his horse before our door i was reading in the room which my mother chiefly occupied and when i glanced out of the sidewindow overhung and darkened by jessamine and honeysuckle i had a great surprise the book dropped from my fingers and i stood still for a moment uncertain what to do for outside sitting composedly upon his fine black horse and apparently considering as to the best means of making his presence known was mr ravenor  he saw me and with a curt but not ungracious motion of the head beckoned me out i went at once and found him dismounted and standing upon the step  i want to see your mother boy he said sharply is there no one about who can hold my horse where are all the farm men  i hesitated and stood there for a moment awkward and confused my mothers strange words concerning him were still ringing in my ears supposing she refused to come down and receive as a visitor the man of whom she had spoken such mysterious words nothing appeared to me more likely and yet what was i to do  he watched me as though reading my thoughts that he was indeed doing so i very quickly discovered  quick boy he said i am not accustomed to be kept waiting i know as well as you do that i am not a welcome visitor but your mother will see me nevertheless call one of the men  i passed across the garden and entered the farmyard jim the waggoner was there turning over a manureheap and i returned with him at my heels mr ravenor tossed him the reins and stooping low followed me into our little sittingroom  he laid his whip upon the table and selecting the most comfortable chair sat down leisurely and crossed his legs he was of course entirely at his ease and was watching my discomposure with a quiet mocking smile  now go and tell your mother that i desire to see her he commanded  with slow steps i turned away and mounting the stairs knocked at her door  mother there is a visitor downstairs i called out softly it is  i know she answered calmly go away i shall be down in a few minutes  i went downstairs again and into the sittingroom breathing more freely mr ravenor had not stirred and when i entered appeared to be deep in thought at the sound of my footsteps however his expression changed at once into its former impassiveness he glanced round the room with an air of lazy curiosity and his halfclosed eyes rested upon my little case of books  what have you there he inquired read me out the titles  i did so with just an inkling of reluctance for my collection was altogether a haphazard one precious though it was to me halfway through he checked me  there thatll do he exclaimed laughing softly this is really idyllic abercrombie and robinson crusoe jeremy taylor and thomas à kempis my poor boy if you have a headpiece at all how it must want oiling  i was a little indignant at his tone and answered him quickly  i dont know im not sure that i should care for your kind of books very much  he arched his fine eyebrows and the smile still lingered around his lips  indeed and why not and how have you been able to divine what sort of books mine are without having seen them  well perhaps i dont mean that exactly i answered sitting on the edge of the table and thrusting my hands deep down into my trousers pockets with the uncomfortable sensation that i was making a fool of myself i was judging from what you said you were last night if study has only brought you to pessimism i would rather be ignorant  you really are a wonderfully wise boy for your years he said still smiling but you must remember that there are two distinct branches of study one the more popular and the more commonly recognised leads to acquired knowledgethe knowledge of facts and sciences and languages the other is the pure sharpening and training of the mind by reading other mens thoughts and ideas and theoriesin short by becoming master of all the philosophical writers of all nations now it is the latter which you would have to avoid in order to retain your present arcadian simplicity but without the former man is scarcely above the level of an animal  i think i see what you mean i admitted i should like to be a good classical scholar and mathematician and know a lot of things it seems to me i added hesitatingly that this sort of knowledge is quite sufficient to strengthen and train the mind the other would be very likely to overtrain it and prove unhealthy especially if it leads everyone where it has led you  oh i wanted no leading he said lightly i was born a pessimist schopenhauer was my earliest friend voltaire my teacher and shelley my god matter of disposition of course i had too little imagination to care a rap about cultivating a religion and too much to be a moralist your mother is coming at last then  the door opened and i looked up anxiously the words of introduction which had been trembling upon my lips were unuttered i stood as helpless and dumbfounded as a ploughboy with my eyes fixed upon my mother                                   chapter vii                      a meeting and a metamorphosis   that it was my mother i could not at first believe she wore a plain dark dress with a black lace kerchief about her neck but a dress simple though it was of a style and material unlike any that i had ever before seen her wear although i knew nothing of her history i had always suspected that she was of a very different station from my fathers and at that moment i knew it for it seemed as though she had of a sudden made up her mind to assume her proper position not only were her dress and the fashion of arranging her hair unusual but her manners her voice her whole bearing and appearance were utterly changed it was as though she had without the slightest warning dropped the mask of long years and stepped back like a flash into the personality which belonged to her  nor was this the only change a slight pink flush had chased the leaden pallor from her cheeks and her eyes which had of late seemed dull and heavy were full of sparkling light and suppressed animation her manners as well as her personal appearance all bore witness to some startling metamorphosis i was more than astonished i was thunderstruck what seemed to me most wonderful was that a visit from the man against whom she had so solemnly and passionately cautioned me should thus have galvanised her into another state of being  mr ravenor rose at her entrance and bowed with the easy grace of a man of the world my mother returned his greeting with a stately selfpossession which matched his own but it struck me watching them both closely that while he was perfectly collected she was in reality far from being so i could see the delicate white fingers of her left hand fold themselves convulsively around the lace handkerchief which she was carrying and when she entered a shivergone in a moment and perceptible only to me because my eyes were fastened upon hershook her slim lithe figure  but in the few commonplace remarks which first passed between them there was nothing in speech or manner that betrayed the least embarrassment she answered him as one of his own order graciously yet just allowing him to see that his visit was a surprise to her and that she expected him to declare its purpose i have dwelt somewhat upon this meeting for reasons which will be sufficiently apparent when i have finished my story  after a few remarks about the farm the crops and the favourable weather he gave the wishedfor explanation  i have come to say a few words to you about your son mrs morton he began abruptly  she and i looked equally astonished  i am a man of few words he continued the few which i desire to say upon this subject had better be said i think to you alone mrs morton  i would have left the room at once but my mother prevented me she laid a trembling hand upon my shoulder and drew me closer to her  you can have nothing to say to me mr ravenor which it would not be better for him to hear especially as you say that it concerns him  he shrugged his high square shoulders as though indifferent but i fancied nevertheless that a shade of annoyance lingered in his face for a moment  very good he said shortly rumour may have told you mrs morton if you ever listen to such things that i am a very wicked man possibly i dont deny it at any rate i am by disposition and custom profoundly selfish i owe to your son a luxurythat of having found my thoughts withdrawn from myself for a few minuteswith me a most rare event  i met him last evening and talked with him he talked like a fool it is true but that has nothing to do with it afterwards i thought of him again wondered what you were going to do with him rememberedpardon methat you must be poor and remembered also that you have suffered through a servant of mine  he paused for nearly half a minute they looked one another in the facemy mother and this man there was something in her rapt fascinated gaze and in the keen brilliant light which flashed from his dark eyes as he returned it which seemed strange to me it was like a challenge offered and accepteda duel in which neither was vanquished for neither flinched  it occurred to me then he continued calmly to call and ask you what you intended doing with him and to plead as excuses for the suggestion which i am about to make the reasons which i have just stated i am a rich man as you know and the money would be nothing to me i wish to be allowed to defray the expenses of finishing your sons education  it seemed to me a magnificently generous offer but a very simple one i could not understand the agitation and apparent indecision which it caused my mother her prompt refusal i could have understood although it would have been a blow to me but this mixture of horror and consternation of emotion and dismay i could make nothing of the feeling which i had imagined would surely be manifestedgratitudewas conspicuous by its absence what did it all mean  my mother sat down and mr ravenor leaned back in his armchair apparently content to wait for her decision i moved across the room to her side and took her cold fingers into mine  mother i cried with glowing cheeks and voice trembling with eagerness what is the matter why do you not say yes you know how i have wanted to go to college there is no reason why you should not consent is there  mr ravenor smileda very slight movement of the lips  if your mother considers your interests at all he said calmly she will certainly consent  i was about to speak but my mother looked up and i checked the words on my lips  mr ravenor she said quietly i accept your offer and i thank you for it that is all i can say  quite enough he remarked nonchalantly  but there is one thing i should like you to understand she added looking up at him i consent it is true but had it not been for another reason far more powerful with me than any you have urged i never should have done so it is a reason which you do not know ofand which i pray that you never may know of she added in a lower key  he made no answer indeed he seemed little interested in my mothers words he turned instead to me and read in my face all the enthusiasm which hers lacked i would have spoken but he held up his hand and checked me  only on one condition he said coldly no thanks i hate them what i do for you i do to please myself the money which it will cost me is no more than i have thrown away many times on the idlest passing pleasure i have simply chosen to gratify a whim and it happens that you are the gainer remember that you can best show your gratitude by silence  his words fell like drops of ice upon my impetuosity i remained silent without an effort  from what you said just now he continued i learn that it has been your desire to perfect your education in a fashion which you could not have done here have you any distinct aims i mean have you any definite ideas as to the future  i shook my head  i never dared to encourage any i answered truthfully enough i knew that we were poor and that i should have to think about earning my living soonprobably as a schoolmaster  you mean to say then that you have never had any distinct ambitionseverything has been vague  except one thing i answered slowly there is one thing which i have always set before me to accomplish some day but it is scarcely an ambition and it has nothing to do with a career  tell it to me he commanded  i did so without hesitation looking him full in the face with heightened colour but speaking with all the determination which i felt in my heart  i have made up my mind that some day i will find the man francisthe man who murdered my father  he was silent i could almost have fancied that he was in some measure moved by my words and the refined beauty of his dark face was heightened for a moment by the strange sad look which flashed across it then he rose and took up his ridingwhip from the table  a boyish enthusiasm he remarked contemptuously as he made his way towards the door where the cleverest detectives in england have failed you hope to succeed well i wish you success the rascal deserves to swing certainly you will hear further from me in a day or two goodmorning  he left the room abruptly and i followed him stepping bareheaded out into the sunshine to look about for jim who was leading his horse up and down the road  when i returned mr ravenor was still standing upon the doorstep watching me intently  i am going back to speak to your mother for a moment he said slowly withdrawing his eyes from my face at last no stop where you are he added imperatively i wish to speak to her alone  i obeyed him and wandered about the orchard until i saw him come out and gallop furiously away across the park then i hurried into the house  mother i exclaimed calling out to her before i had opened the door of the parlourmother what do you  i stopped short and hurried to her side alarmed at her appearance her cheeks even her lips were ashen pale and her eyes were closed she had fainted in her chair                                  chapter viii                           an abode of mystery   for the first time in my life i was on my way to ravenor castle summoned there by a brief imperious note from mr ravenor often had i looked longingly from the distant hills of the park upon its grey rugged towers and mighty battlements but i had never dared to clamber over the high wall into the inner grounds nor even to make my way up the servants drive to win a closer acquaintance with it  one reason why i had abstained from doing what on the face of it would seem a very natural thing to do was a solemn promise to my mother extracted from me almost as soon as i was able to get about by myself never to pass within that great boundarywall which completely encircled the inner grounds and wardens of the castle but apart from that the thing would have been impossible for me in any case  i have already said that mr ravenor bore the character of being a remarkably eccentric man perhaps one of the most striking manifestations of this eccentricity lay in the rigid seclusion in which he chose to live while at the castle and the extraordinary precautions which he had taken to prevent all intruders and visitors of every sort from obtaining access to him  from the outer part there was indeed no attempt to exclude anyone belonging to the neighbourhood who chose to ramble about there and in mr ravenors absence visitors who had obtained permission from the steward were occasionally permitted to drive through but to the grounds and the castle itself access was simply an impossibility had ravenor castle been the abode of a sovereign and the country around in possession of a hostile people the precautions could scarcely have been more rigorous  the high stone wall which encircled the castle and gardens for a circuit of threequarters of a mile effectually shut them off from the outside world the posterngates with which it was pierced were of solid iron and the locks which secured them were said to have been fashioned by a hindoo whom mr ravenor had once brought home with him from india and to be perfectly unique in their design and workmanship the two main carriage entrances about half a mile apart were remarkable for nothing but the fine proportions of the towering iron gates but they were always kept jealously locked and barred and the fate of the uninvited guest who presented himself there was inevitable there was no admittance  the afternoon was drawing towards a close when i turned the last corner of the winding avenue and approached the entrance it had been a wild blustering day but just before i started from home the wind had dropped and a watery sun feebly piercing the masses of heavy clouds with which the sky was strewn was shining down with a wan unnatural glow upon the clumps of firtrees on either side of the way and the massive frowning towers of the castle close above me  under foot and around me everything was wet with the faintest stir of the dying breeze showers of raindrops fell from shrubs and trees and at every step my feet sank into the soft soaked gravel or sent the moisture bubbling up from the layers of rotten leaves and twigs which the mornings gale had scattered along the road  it was an afternoon to damp anyones spirits and it was perhaps to the influence of the weather that i owed the sudden sinking of heart and courage which came over me as i slackened my pace before the grimlooking lodges and barred gate i had started from home notwithstanding my mothers white face and nervous trembling manner in a state of pleasurable excitement  i was about to penetrate into a mystery which had been the curiosity of my boyhood i was to become one of those favoured few who had been permitted to pass within the portals of ravenor castle and more than that i was about to visit there as the guest of a man whose marvellous reputation personality and career had kindled within me an almost passionate reverencea man who had long been the object of my devoted although boyish and unreasonable heroworship yet though it would seem that i had everything to gain and nothing to fear or lose from the coming interview no sooner had i arrived within sight of my destination than my spirits sank to zero  a woman would have called it a presentiment and have accepted it with mute despair to me it seemed only an unreasonable reaction from my previous state of suppressed excitementa feeling to be crushed at any cost lest i should stand with gloomy unthankful face before the man in whose power it lay to raise me from my present distasteful position and prospects so i threw my head back and quickened my steps keeping resolutely before me in my thoughts all that i had ventured to hope from my forthcoming interview and by the time i stood before the great iron gates and stretched out my hand to ring the bell the depression had almost passed away and the eagerness which i felt was no doubt fully reflected m my countenance  i had no need to ring my last quick footstep had fallen upon a harder substance than the gravel upon which i had been walking and the contact of my feet with it made my presence known in a manner which surprised me not a little there was a shrill ringing from the lodge door on my right and almost simultaneously it opened and a servant came out in the dark ravenor livery  will you be so good sir as to step off the planking he said  i moved a yard or two backwards and the bellit was an electric bell of courseinstantly ceased it was my first experience of any such means of communication and i stood for a moment looking down in some bewilderment  your name and business sir the man inquired respectfully did you wish to see mr clemson mr clemson was the steward  my name is morton and my business is with mr ravenor i answered i want to see him  i am afraid that mr ravenor will not be able to see you sir he said have you an appointment  yes for five oclock i answered and the words had scarcely left my lips before the first stroke of the hour boomed out from the great castle clock perhaps more than anything else could have done that sound brought home to me the realisation of where i was hour after hour all through my life from the depths of rothland wood from the home meadows or in my long rambles over the faraway barnwood hills i had heard those deep throbbing chimes sometimes faint and low when the wind bore the sound away from me sometimes harsh and piercing in the storm and often as dear and distinct as though only a sheet of water stretched between us and now i stood almost within a stones throw of them and marvelled no longer that the deep resounding notes should travel so far over hill and moor that i had never yet been able to wander out of hearing of them  the man accepted my explanation after a moments hesitation and standing aside from the doorway out of which he had issued motioned me to enter i did so and received a fresh surprise instead of finding myself in the home of one of the servants of the estate which would have seemed the natural thing i found myself in a most luxuriously furnished waitingroom hung with mirrors and oakframed paintings upon a dark panelled wall my feet sank into a thick carpet and i subsided a little dazed into a low crimson velvet chair and found beside me a table covered with magazines  the man followed me into the room and as he passed on his way to its upper end he wheeled towards me a smaller table on which were decanters and glasses and a long box of cigarettes scarcely glancing at them i watched him unlock a tall cupboard and half vanish inside it  he remained there for a space of almost five minutes then he stepped out carefully locked it and advanced towards me i fancied that there was a shade more respect in his manner and certainly some surprise  mr ravenors servant will be here in a few minutes sir to show you the way to the castle  i thought that i could have found it very well by myself but of course i could not say so i occupied myself by examining the contents of the room and struggled for a few moments between a feeling of strong curiosity and a natural disinclination to ask questions of a servant especially one whose manner seemed so little to invite them finally the former conquered  how did you find that out without leaving this room i asked  he pointed to the cupboard  we have a telephone there in connection with the castle sir he explained then he busied himself arranging some papers on a table at the other end of the apartment with the obvious air of not desiring to be questioned further  the explanation was so simple that i smiled i began to realise the very insufficient causes which had given rise to the stories which were always floating about concerning the mystery in which the master of ravenor castle chose to dwell what more natural than that a man of liberal education with a passion for absolute solitude should seek to insure it by some such means as these by the application of very simple scientific devices common enough in a city but unheard of in our quiet country neighbourhood  i was kept waiting for about a quarter of an hour then the door was opened noiselessly from without and a tall dark man cleanshaven and dressed in black relieved by an immaculate white tie entered and looked at me i rose to my feet and threw down the magazine which i had been pretending to read  you are mr morton he inquired in a subdued tone glancing steadily at me the while with somewhat puzzled criticising gaze which perhaps unreasonably annoyed me extremely it was an annoyance which i took pains not to show however for something about the personality of the man impressed me his manner though studiously respectful was not without a certain quiet dignity and his thin oval facethin almost to emaciationhad in it more than a suspicion of refinement my first glance whilst i was undergoing his brief scrutiny assured me that this was no ordinary servant  that is my name i answered you have come to take me to mr ravenor  if you will be so good as to follow me sir  i took up my cap and did so taking long swinging strides up the steep ascent hoping thereby to gain his side and ask him a few questions about the place but he prevented this by hurrying on when i was close behind him so after the third attempt i gave it up and contented myself by looking around me as much as i could and making the most of the short walk  on one side of the drivei had been along few highways as widewas a tall yew hedge which shut out little from my view for the thick black pinewood which overtopped and formed so striking a background to the grand old castle had never been thinned in this direction and stretched away in a wide irregular belt skirting the long line of outbuildings to the hills and beyond but on the right hand only a low ringfence separated us from the grounds immediately in front of the castle which a sudden bend in the sharply winding road brought into full view  my absolute ignorance of architecture forbids my attempting to describe it save in its general effect i remember even now what that effect was upon me when i stood for the first time almost at its foot at a distance its frowning battlements and worn grey turrets had a majestic appearance but standing as i did then within a few hundred yards of its vast imposing front and almost under the shadow of its walls and towers its effect was nothing short of aweinspiring  i almost held my breath as i gazed upon it and the terrace lawns sloping away below smoothshaven velvetty the very perfection of english turf not that i had much time to look about me on the contrary my conductor never once slackened his pace and when i involuntarily paused for a moment with eyes riveted upon the magnificent pile before me he looked round sharply and beckoned me impatiently to proceed  mr ravenor is not used to be kept waiting sir he remarked and will be expecting us  i pulled myself together with an effort and followed him more closely we passed under a bridge of solid masonry mossencrusted and indented with the storms of ages and the ruder marks of batteringram and cannon across a wide circular courtyard protected by massive iron gates which rolled slowly open before us with many ponderous creakings and gratings as though reluctant to admit a stranger into a great white stonepaved hall dimly lighted yet sufficiently so to enable me to perceive the long rows of armoured warriors which lined the walls and the lances and spears and shields which flashed above their heads  we passed straight across it our footsteps awakening clattering echoes as they fell on the polished flags through a door on the opposite side into a room which nearly took my breath away from the high vaulted ceiling to the floor on every side of the apartment were booksnothing but books  two menone old the other of about my own agelooked up from a table as we entered and paused in their work which seemed to be cataloguing but my guide passed them without remark or notice and walked straight across the room to where a crimson curtain hanging down in thick folds concealed a black oak door here he knocked and i waited by his side until the answer came in that clear low tone which though i had heard it but once or twice before i could have recognised in a thousand then my guide turned the handle and silently motioning me to enter left me                                   chapter ix                                mr marx   at first i had eyes only for the dark figure seated a few yards away from me at a small writingtable drawn into the centre of the room he was bending low over his desk and never even raised his eyes or ceased writing at my entrance before him on the table and scattered around his chair on the floor were many sheets of white foolscap covered with his broad firm handwriting some with the ink scarcely dry upon them and while i stood before him he impatiently swept another one from his desk and without waiting to see it flutter to the ground began a fresh sheet  a glass of water a few dry biscuits and a little pile of bookssome turned facedownwardswere by his side nothing else was on the table save a great pile of unused paper a watch detached from its chain and a heavilyshaded lamp which threw a ghastly light upon his white worn face and his dry brilliant eyes under which were faintly engraven the dark rims of the student  i watched him for a while fascinated then as he took not the slightest notice of me my eyes began to wander round the room it was hexagonal and on every side save one lined from the floor to the high ceiling with books the furniture was all of black oak as also were the bookshelves and the carpet and hangings were of a deep olivegreen the mantelpiece and inlaid grate were of black marble faintly relieved with gold and within the polished bars of the grate a small fire was burning  there was nothing cheerful about the apartment on the contrary it struck me as being though magnificent sombre and heavy wrapped as it was in the gloom of a dismal twilight which the flickering fire and the shaded lamp failed to pierce from the high french windows i could catch a glimpse of a long stretch of soddened lawn beyond which everything was shrouded in the semiobscurity of the fastfalling dusk deepened by the grey cloudy sky but i chose after my first glance around the room to keep my eyes fixed upon the man who sat writing before me the man in whom already i felt an interest so strong as to deaden all the curiosity which i might otherwise have felt as to my surroundings  at last he seemed conscious of my presence lifting his eyes to give them a momentary rest he encountered my fixed gaze for a moment he looked at me in a puzzled manner as though wondering how i came there then his expression changed and putting down his pen he pushed his papers away from him  so you have come philip morton he said  to so selfevident a statement i could return no answer save a brief affirmative he seemed to expect nothing more however  how old did you say you were he asked abruptly  seventeen sir  it was quite five minutes before he spoke again during which time he sat with knitted brows and eyes fixed intently but absently upon me deep in thought and thought of which it seemed to me somehow that i must be the subject  where were you born  at the farm sirat least i suppose so  it flashed into my mind at that moment that i had never heard the period of my earliest childhood spoken of either by my father or mother but it was only a passing thought dismissed almost as soon as conceived had we not always lived at the farm where else could i have been born  do you know any of your mothers relations mr ravenor asked taking no notice of the qualifying addition to my previous answer  i shook my head i had never seen or heard of any of them and it was a circumstance upon which i had more than once pondered but my mothers reserved demeanour towards me of late years had checked many questions which i might otherwise have felt inclined to ask her there was a brief silence during which mr ravenor sat with his face half turned away from me resting it lightly upon the long delicate fingers of his left hand  you are a little young for college he said presently in a more matteroffact tone besides which i doubt whether you are quite advanced enough i have decided therefore to send you for two years to a clergyman in lincolnshire who receives a few pupils my own nephew among them he is a friend of mine and will give some shape to your studies there are one or two things which i shall ask you to remember when you get there he went on  first that this little arrangement between your mother yourself and me remains absolutely a secret among us also that you seek or at any rate do not refuse the friendship of my nephew cecil lord silchester from what i can learn i fear that he is behaving in a most unsatisfactory manner and as i know him to be weakminded and easily led his behaviour at present and his character in the future are to a great extent dependent upon the influence which his immediate companions may have over him you understand me  i assented silently for words at that moment were not at my command my cheeks were flushed and my heart was beating with pleasure at the confidence in me which mr ravenors words implied that moment was one of the sweetest of my life  i do not of course wish you to play the spy in any way upon my nephew mr ravenor continued but i shall expect you to tell me the unbiassed truth should i at any time ask you any questions concerning him and if you think after you have been there some time and have had an opportunity of judging that he would be likely to do better elsewhere under stricter discipline than at dr randalls i shall expect you to tell me so in plain words philip morton i ask you to take an interest in and look after my nephew  i will do my best sir i answered fervently  a youthful mentor very  the words accompanied by something closely resembling a sneer came from neither mr ravenor nor myself either a third person must have been in the room before my arrival and during the whole of our conversation or he must have entered it since by some means unknown to me for almost at my elbow on the side remote from the door stood the man who had broken in without apology or explanation upon our interview  both from the strange manner of his attire and on account of his personality i could not repress a strong curiosity in the newcomer he was above the average height but of awkward and ungainly figure its massiveness enhanced by the long black dressinggown which was wrapped loosely around him his hair and beard were of a deep reddish hue the former partly concealed by a black silk skullcap and he wore thick blue spectacles which by no means added to the attractiveness of his face his featuresthose which were visiblewere good but their effect was completely spoilt by the disfiguring glasses and his curious complexion there was an air of power about him difficult to analyse but sufficiently apparent which altogether redeemed him from coarseness or even mediocrity and his voice too was good but my impressions concerning him were very mixed ones  he was evidently someone of account in the household for he stood on the hearthrug with his hands thrust into his loose pockets completely at his ease and without making any apology for his unceremonious appearance when i first turned to look at him he was examining me with a cold critical stare which made me feel uncomfortable without knowing why  who is the young gentleman he asked turning to mr ravenor wont you introduce me  mr ravenor took up some papers lying on the table before him and began to sort them  it is philip morton the son of the man who was murdered in rothland wood he answered quietly i am going to undertake his education  indeed youre becoming quite a philanthropist was the reply but why not send him to a public school at once  because a public school would be just the worst place for him mr ravenor answered coldly his education has been good enough up to now i dare say but it has not been systematic it wants shape and proportion and dr randall is just the man to see to that  the newcomer shrugged his shoulders  i dont believe in private tutors he remarked  that scarcely affects the question mr ravenor answered a little haughtily are you ready for me marx  i shall be presently i had very nearly finished when the sound of voices tempted me out to see whom you had admitted into your august presence you have not completed the introduction  mr ravenor turned to me with a slight frown upon his fine forehead  morton he said this is mr marx my private secretary and collaborator  we exchanged greetings and i looked at him with revived interest the man who was worthy to work with mr ravenor must be a scholar indeed and on the whole mr marx looked it i almost forgave him his supercilious speech and patronising manner  you have quite settled then to send this young man to dr randalls mr marx said calmly  i have there are one or two more matters which i have not yet mentioned to him so i shall be glad to see you again in half an hour mr ravenor remarked glancing at his watch  mr marx nodded to me in a not unfriendly manner and lifting a curtain which i had not noticed before disappeared into a smaller apartment  mr ravenor waited until he was out of hearing and then turned towards me  i do not know whether it is necessary for me to mention it as you may possibly not come into contact again he said slowly but in case you should do so remember this i wish you to have as little to do with mr marx as possible you  he broke off suddenly and i started and looked round half amazed half frightened the continuous sound of an electricbell which seemed to come from within a few feet of me was echoing through the room                                    chapter x                             lady silchester   mr ravenor sat like a man stunned by a sudden shock while the shrill ringing grew more and more imperative then suddenly when i least expected it he spoke and the fact that his calm even tone betrayed not the slightest sign of agitation or anything approaching to it was a great relief to me after all his silence might have meant indifference  go over there he said pointing to the corner of the room from which the sound came  i did so and saw just before me what seemed to be a dark mahogany box let into the wall  touch that knob he commanded and put your ear to the tube  i had scarcely done so when a quick agitated voice which i recognised as the voice of the man who had admitted me at the lodge gate began speaking i repeated his words to mr ravenor  i am very sorry sir but while i stepped in here to announce her lady silchester has driven through she is alone  mr ravenor made no sign of annoyance or surprise i could not tell whether the news was a relief to him or the reverse  is there any answer sir i inquired  yes tell him to come to the steward for his wages in an hours time and be prepared to leave this evening  i hesitated and then repeated the words mr ravenor watched me keenly  you are thinking that i am a stern master he said abruptly  it was exactly what had been passing through my mind and i confessed it he shrugged his shoulders  i like to be obeyed implicitly and to the letter he said if a quarter of the people who present themselves here to see me were allowed to pass through to my castle my leisure which is of some value to me would be continually broken in upon anderson has been careful hitherto however and this must be a lesson to him you can tell him as you go out that i will give him one more chance  i rose with my cap in hand but he waved me back  i have a letter to write to your mother he said drawing some notepaper towards him wait a minute or two  i strolled over to the high french windows and looked out upon the grey twilight i had scarcely stood there for a moment when the sound of horses feet and smoothly rolling wheels coming up the broad drive told me that mr ravenors visitor was at hand and immediately afterwards a small brougham flashed past the window and describing a semicircle pulled up in front of the hall door a footman leaped down from the box and several servants stood on the steps and respectfully saluted the lady who had alighted from the carriage a moment or two later there was a knock at the door  come in answered mr ravenor without looking up or even ceasing his writing for i could hear the broad quill dashing away without a pause over the notepaper  a servant threw open the door and announced lady silchester and a tall woman wrapped from head to foot in dark brown furs swept past him and entered the room  a single glance at the slim majestic figure and at the classical outline of her face told me who she was and told me rightly it was mr ravenors sister  mr ravenor rose and without putting his pen down welcomed lady silchester with cold frigid courtesy which she seemed determined however not to notice  quite an unexpected visit this isnt it she exclaimed sinking into an easy chair before the fire with a little shiver i never was so cold these autumn mists are awful and ive had a twelvemile drive what a dreary room you have made of this she added looking round with a little shrug of her shoulders and putting her hands farther into her muff how can you sit here in this ghostly light with only one lampand such a fire too  he smiled grimly but it was not a smile which heralded any increase of geniality in his manner  i am not in the habit of receiving ladies here he remarked and i did not expect you where have you come from i thought you were in rome  she shook her head  i wish we were we came back last week and i went straight down to the cedarstoms place at melton you know i dont think ive been warm since i landed in england just now im nearly frozen to death  i think you would find one of the rooms in the other wing more comfortable he said after a short pause besides which i am engaged at present you dine here of course  by all means she answered you wouldnt send me back to melton dinnerless would you even if i have come without an invitation i am dying for a cup of tea  mrs ross shall send you anything you want he said i will ring for her  she rose and shook out her skirts her eyes fell upon me  you have a visitor she remarked im sorry i disturbed you  she looked at me fixedly as i moved a few steps forward out of the deep shadows which hung about the further end of the apartment then she turned from me to mr ravenor who was holding open the door for her he met her gaze steadily with a calm inquiring look in his deep eyes as though wondering why she lingered  wont you introduce your visitor she asked slowly  he appeared wishful for her to go yet resigned  certainly he answered if you wish it cecilia let me present to you mr philip morton the son of a former neighbour of mine you may be interested to hear that mr morton is about to complete his education with dr randall morton this is my sister lady silchester  lady silchester held up a pair of gold eyeglasses and looked at me steadily i was not used to ladies but lady silchesters manner did not please me and after a very slight bow i drew myself up and returned her gaze without flinching she turned abruptly away  yes i am interesteda little surprised she said in a peculiar tone let me congratulate you my dear brother on  did i understand you to say that you would be ready in a quarter of an hour cecilia he interrupted calmly permit me to order your horses to be put up and he moved across the room towards the bell and rang it  she hesitated bit her lip and turned towards the door without another word a servant stood upon the threshold summoned by the bell  let mrs ross attend lady silchester at once mr ravenor ordered her ladyship will take tea in her room and will dine with me in the library at halfpast eight  very good sir  the door was closed and we were alone again mr ravenor returned to his letter with his lips slightly parted in a quiet smile i stood still hot and uncomfortable wondering in what possible manner i could have offended lady silchester the meaning of the little scene which had just taken place was beyond my comprehension but i knew that it had a meaning and that i was somehow concerned in it                                   chapter xi                          the cry in the avenue   the letter which mr ravenor had been writing to my mother was finished and sealed at last then he leaned back in his chair and looked steadily at me  i shall not see you again before you go philip morton he said so i wish to impress upon you once more what i said to you about my nephew who is lady silchesters son bythebye i know that he is going on badly but i wish to know how badly unfortunately he has no father and from what i can remember of him i should imagine that he is quite easily led and would be very amenable to the influence of a stronger mind if yours should be that mindand i do not see why it should notit will be well for him that delightfully utopian optimism of yours is at any rate healthy he added dryly  i felt my cheeks burn and would have spoken but mr ravenor checked me  let there be no misunderstanding between us he said i desire no gratitude from you and i deserve none what i am doing i am doing for my own gratificationperhaps for my own ultimate advantage that you are a gainer by it is purely a matter of chance the whim might just as well have been the other way i might have taken a fancy to have you turned out of the place and if so i would have done it on the whole it is i who should be grateful to you for not baulking me in my scheme and for letting me have my own way so understand please after this explanation that i shall look upon any expression of gratitude from you as a glaring mark of imbecility apart from which it will annoy me exceedingly  i listened in silence what could one reply to such a strange way of putting a case mr ravenors manner forbade any doubt as to his seriousness and i could only respect his wishes  as you wont let me thank you sir i think id better go i said bluntly im sure to forget if i stay here much longer  a good discipline for you to stay then he answered  again the tinkle of the telephone bell rang out from the corner and interrupted his speech mr ravenor motioned me towards it  go and hear what it is and repeat it to me he said  i put my ear to the tube and repeated the words as they came  a man desires to see you sir but refuses to give his name i have told him that it is quite useless my communicating with you without it but he is persistent and refuses to go away he is respectably dressed but rather roughlooking  mr ravenor shrugged his shoulders and took up his pen as though about to resume his writing  tell him to go to the deuce he said briefly  i repeated the message faithfully but its recipient was evidently not satisfied in less than a minute the bell sounded again  his name is richards siror rather he says he is known to you by that nameand he is very emphatic about seeing youand begging your pardon sir a little insolent he says that his business is of the utmost importance  i repeated the message and stood as though turned to stone was my fancy playing tricks with me in the dimlylit room or had mr ravenors face really become ghastly and livid like the face of a man who sees the phantom shadows of a hideous nightmare passing before his fixed gaze i closed my eyes for a moments relief and looked again surely it had been fancy mr ravenor was writing with only a slight frown upon his calm serene face  let mr richardsor whatever the fellows name isbe given to understand that i distinctly refuse to see him he said quietly if he has any business with me he can write  i repeated this and then took up my cap to go mr ravenor put down his pen and walked with me to the door i had expected that he would have offered me his hand but he did not he nodded kindly enough and held the door open while i passed out so i went  as i walked across the great hall on my way out i came face to face with lady silchester who was thoughtfully contemplating one of a long line of oilpaintings dark with age yet vivid still with the marvellous colouring of an old master to my surprise she stopped me  are you a judge of pictures mr morton she asked i was wondering whether that was a genuine reynolds and she pointed to the picture which she had been examining  i shook my head briefly acknowledging that i knew nothing whatever about them i was quite conscious at the time that the question was only a feint what was a farmers son likely to know of the old masters  ah never mind she remarked shutting up her eyeglasses with a snap i can ask mr ravenor this evening i thought perhaps that as you were here so often he might have talked to you about them i know that he is very proud of his pictures  had i been here often he might have done so i answered as it happens however this is my first visit to ravenor castle  indeed and yet mr ravenor seems to take a great interest in you why  i hesitated and wished that i could get away but lady silchester was standing immediately in front of me  your ladyship will pardon me i said but might not your question be better addressed to mr ravenor  she bit her lip and moved haughtily to one side i made a movement as though to pass her but she turned suddenly and prevented me  mr morton she said a little nervously my brother said that you were going to dr randalls i believe  i admitted that such was the fact  i daresay you know that my son is there she continued and i am afraid hes not behaving exactly as he should of course we dont hear anything definite but cecil is very goodnatured easily led into anything and i am a little doubtful about his companions there now mr morton youre not much more than a boy yourself of course but you dont look as though you would care for the sort of thing that im afraid cecil gets led into i do wish that you and he could be friends and thatthat  she broke off as though expecting me to say something and i felt a little awkward  its very kind of you to think so well of me when you dont know anything about me i said twirling my cap in my hands but you forget that i am only a farmers son and perhaps your son would not care to be friends with me  my son whatever his faults may be has all the instincts of a gentleman lady silchester answered proudly and if he liked you for yourself it would make no difference even if you were a tradesmans son promise me that if you have the opportunity you will do what you can  oh yes ill promise that with pleasure i assured her  lady silchester smiled and while the smile lasted i thought that i had never seen a more beautiful woman then she held out a delicate little hand sparkling with rings and placed it in mine which in those days was as brown as a berry and not very soft  thank you so much mr morton  she looked up at me quite kindly for a moment then suddenly her manner completelychanged she withdrew her eyes from my face with a slight flush in her cheeks and turned abruptly away  good evening mr morton i am much obliged to you for your promise she said in a colder tone  i drew myself up unconscious of having said or done anything which could possibly offend her and feeling boyishly hurt at her change of manner  good evening lady silchester i answered with all the dignity i could command then i turned away and left the castle  i walked down the broad avenue slowly casting many glances behind me at the vast gloomy pile around which the late evening mists were rising from the damp ground many lights were twinkling from the upper windows and from the east wing where the servants quarters were situated but the lower part of the building lay in a deep obscurity unilluminated save by one faint light from mr ravenors study there seemed something unnatural almost ghostly about the place which chilled while it fascinated me  what was that i stood suddenly still in the middle of the drive and listened a faint muffled cry which seemed to me at first to be a human cry had broken the deep evening stillness i held my breath and remained quite motionless with strained hearing there was no repetition of it no other sound i was puzzled more than half inclined to be alarmed it might have been the crying of a hare or the squealing of a rabbit caught by a stoat but my first impression had been a strong one improbable though it seemed poachers however daring would scarcely be likely to invade the closelyguarded inner grounds where the preserves were fewer and the risk of capture far greater than outside the park besides there had been no discharge of firearms no commotion no loud cries only that one muffled despairing moan what could it mean  a steep ascent lay before me after a moments hesitation i hurried forward and did not pause until i reached the summit and had clear view around through the hazy twilight                                   chapter xii                       a dark corner in the avenue   far away below mefor ravenor castle stood on the highest point in the countrya dullred glow in the sky and many twinkling lights stretched far and wide marked the place where a great town lay on my right hand was a smooth stretch of green turf dotted all over with thickly growing spreading oak trees on the left was a straggling plantation bounded by a low greystone wall which sloped down gradually to one of the brackencovered disused slatequarries with which the neighbourhood abounded  breathless i stood still and looked searchingly around save in the immediate vicinity the fast falling night had blotted out the view reducing fields woods and rocks to one blurred chaotic mass but where my eye could pierce the darkness i could see no sign of any moving object by degrees my apprehension grew less strong the cry if it had not been wholly a trick of the imagination must have been the cry of some animal i drew a long breath of relief and moved forward again  immediately in front of me the avenue curved through a small plantation of fir trees which growing thick and black on either side made it appear almost as though i were confronted with a tunnel around its mouth the darkness was intense but my eyesight always good had by this time become quite accustomed to the uncertain light and just as i was entering it i fancied that i could see something moving only a few yards in front of me i stopped short at once and waited peering forwards into the gloom with straining eyes and beating heart my suspense though keen was not of long duration for almost immediately the dark shape resolved itself into the figure of a man moving swiftly towards me  my first impulse was i am afraid to turn and run for it my next to give the advancing figure as wide a berth as possible with that idea i stepped swiftly on one side and leaned right back against the ring fence which bordered the drive but i was too late or too clumsy in my movements to escape notice with a quick startled exclamation the man whom i had nearly run into stopped and just at that moment the moon which had been struggling up from behind a thick mass of angry clouds shone feebly out and showed me the white scared face of mr ravenors secretary  good heavens  it seemed to me as though the ejaculation was hurled out from those trembling lips then with a sudden start he recovered himself and so changed was his manner that i could almost have fancied that his first emotion of terror had been imagination on my part  am i so formidable that you should leap out of my way as though you had seen a ghost he said with a short laugh come come a young man of your size should have more pluck than that  i felt rather ashamed of myself but i answered him as carelessly as possible  i dont think i was any more startled than you were we came upon one another suddenly and its a very dark night  dark dark is not the word this part of the drive is a veritable hades  bythebye mr marx i remarked i fancied that i heard a cry a few min  a cry what sort of a cry he interrupted sharply in an altered tone  well it sounded to me very much like the moan of a man in pain i explained looking half fearfully around of course it might have been a hare but it was wonderfully like a human voice listen cant you hear something now i cried laying my hand upon his arm  we stood close together in silence listening intently a faint wind had sprung up and was sighing mournfully through the trees which were soaked and weighed down by the heavy rain drip drip drip at every sigh of the breeze a little shower of raindrops fell pattering on to the soddened leaves and the melancholy music was resumed  it was altogether very depressing and i was palpably shivering  i can hear nothing he said with chattering teeth it must have been your fancy or a hare squealing perhaps  i suppose so i admitted glad enough to be forced into this conclusion  i wouldnt say anything about it at the lodge he remarked preparing to depart anderson is as nervous as a cat already  all right i wont good night  youre not frightened are you he asked if you like ill walk down to the lodge with you  not in the least thanks i answered a little indignantly i thought that noise was queer thats all good night  i walked swiftly away listening all the time but hearing no unusual sound in a few minutes i reached the gates and found anderson waiting about outside he let me through at once  may i go in here for a minute i asked pointing to the room in which i had been kept waiting on my way up to the castle i have a message to give you from mr ravenor  certainly sir he answered opening the door i stepped inside half expecting to see the man whom mr ravenor had refused to receive but it was quite empty  so mr richards has decided not to wait after all i remarked looking round he was wise im sure mr ravenor wouldnt have seen him  yes sir the man answered he slipped out without leaving any message or anything while i had gone across the way for some coal i was a bit taken aback when i returned and found the place empty for hed been swearing ever so a minute or two before that hed see mr ravenor or stop here for ever  he cant have gone on up to the castle can he i asked looking around  the man shook his head confidently  impossible sir the gates were locked and the keys in my pocket and there are no windows to this room you see on the castle side  but there is a door i said pointing to the upper end of the apartment  go and look at it sir anderson answered smiling  i did so and examined it closely there were no bolts but it was fastened with a particularly strong patent lock  who keeps the key i inquired  mr ravenor sir i havent got one at all you were saying something about a message  yes mr ravenor was annoyed with you for letting lady silchester through but he has decided to overlook it this time you need not go up to the castle for your money  the man was evidently pleased  im sure im very much obliged to you sir he said warmly thats good news and no mistake it isnt a place that one would care to lose  well good night anderson oh i say i added turning back on a sudden impulse how long is it since mr marx was here  anderson looked puzzled  mr marx sir why i havent seen him all day  what i exclaimed  i havent seen him all day he hasnt been here the man repeated  i stood still breathless full of swiftly rising but vague suspicions  not seen him today why i met him in the avenue just now i declared  i daresay sir the man remarked quietly he often walks down this way in fact he does most evenings before dinner queer sort he is and no mistake  the mans words changed the current of my thoughts and my halfconceived suspicions faded away almost before they had gathered shape i made some trifling remark and started homewards                                  chapter xiii                          the cloud between us   it was late when i reached home and from the darkness in all the windows i concluded that my mother and the one country domestic who comprised our little household had already retired my hand was raised to rap at the closed door when it occurred to me that i might just as well effect an entrance without disturbing anyone our sittingroom window opened on to the front garden in which i stood and was seldom fastened so i stole softly over the sodden grass and pressed the sash upwards it yielded easily to my touch and gently raising myself on to the low stone windowsill i vaulted into the room  at first i thought it was as i had expected to find it empty but it was not so through the open window by which i had just entered the moonlight was streaming in casting long fantastic rays upon the wellworn carpet and across the quaint oldfashioned furniture and on the white tablecloth on which my homely evening meal had been left prepared but my eyes never rested for a moment on any of these familiar objects scarcely even noticed them for another and a stranger sight held me spellbound at the farther end of the room where the shadows hung darkest and the moonbeams but feebly penetrated was the kneeling figure of a woman  her perfectly black dress threw the ghastly hue of her strained wild face into startling prominence and her slender arms were stretched passionately upwards in a gesture full of intense dramatic pathos her eyes were fixed upon a small ebony crucifix which hung against the wall and the words were bursting from her white trembling lips but whether of prayer or confession i could not or rather would not hear for i closed my eyes and the sound of her voice reached me only in an indistinct moan it was a sight which has lived in my memory and will never fade  since that awful night in rothland wood my mothers behaviour towards me had been a source of constant and painful wonder she had become an enigma and an enigma which i somehow felt that it would be well for me not to attempt to solve  but even at the times when my loveless surroundings and her coldness had plunged me into the lowest depths of depression it had never been an altogether hopeless state for somehow i had always felt that her coldness was not the coldness of indifference but rather an effort of will and that a time would come when she would cast it off and be to me again the mother of my earlier recollections but the change was long in coming  she was a devout roman catholica religion in which i had not been brought upand in all weathers and at all times of the year she paid long and frequent visits to the monastery chapel over the hills but to see her as she was now was a revelation to me i had seen her pray before but never like this she had always seemed to me more of a martyr than a sinner and her prayers more the prayers of reverent devotion than of passionate supplication but her attitude at this moment her wild haggard face and imploring eyes were full of revelation to me another possible explanation of her lonely joyless life and deep religious devotion flashed in upon me might it not be the dreary expiation the hard penance of her church meted out for sin  half fearing to disturb her i remained for a brief while silent but as the minutes went on the sight of her agony was too much for me and i cried out to her  mother i am here i did not know that you were up i came in through the window  at the first sound of my appealing tones her face changed as though frozen suddenly from passionate expressiveness to cold marble slowly she rose to her feet and confronted me  mother are you in trouble i said softly moving nearer to her cannot i share your sorrow cannot i comfort you why am i shut out of your life so tell me this great trouble of yours and let me share it  for many years i had longed to say these words to her but the cold impressiveness of her manner had checked them often upon my lips and thrust them back to my aching heart now when a great sorrow filled her face with a softer light and loosened for a moment its hard rigid lines i dared to yield to the impulse which i had so often feltand alas in vainin vain  keener agony deeper disappointment i have never felt coldness and indifference had been hard to bear but what came now was worse she shrank back from meshrank back with her hands outstretched towards me and her head averted  philip i did not know that you were here i cannot talk to you now go to your room tomorrowtomorrow  her voice died away but her sudden weakness inspired me with no hope for it was a physical weakness only there were no signs of softening in her face no answering tenderness in her tones so what could i do but go                                   chapter xiv                      a meeting in the coffeeroom   it was eleven oclock on the following morning i had been reading in the garden for some time and was just thinking of starting for a walk when a dogcart from the castle stopped at the gate and mr ravenors servantthe man who had conducted me from the lodge to the castlewas shown into the house i went to him at once and he handed me a note  mr ravenor has sent you this sir he said respectfully  i tore it open and read there was no orthodox commencement  before going to dr randalls there are a few things which you are not likely to have which you will find necessary remember that it is part of the education which i intend for you that you should associate with the other pupils on equal terms therefore be so good as to go into torchester with reynolds and place yourself entirely in his hands he has my full instructionsr  i folded the note up and put it into my pocket  am i to come with you now i asked  if you please sir  i went upstairs to get ready and in a few minutes was prepared to start the groom offered me the reins but i declined them and mounted instead to the vacant seat by his side which reynolds had silently relinquished to me  torchester was scarcely a dozen miles from the farm but nevertheless this was my first visit to it many a time i had looked down from beacon hill upon the widespreading dirtycoloured cloud of smoke from its tall factory chimneys which seemed like a marring blot upon the fair peaceful stretch of country around and by night at the dull red glow in the sky and the myriads of twinkling lights which showed me where it stood but neither by day nor night had the scene been an attractive one for me i had felt no curiosity to enter it i had never even cared to figure to myself what it would be like  so now for the first time in my life i found myself driving through the streets of a large manufacturing town it was the dinnerhour and on all sides the factories were disgorging streams of unhealthylooking men and women and even children the tramcars and omnibuses were crowded the busy streets were lined with swiftly rolling carriages smartlooking men and gailydressed girls and women within a few yards i saw types of men and women so different that it seemed impossible that they could be of the same species  this is the bell sir where we generally put up remarked reynolds at my elbow you will have some lunch sir before we go into the town  i shook my head but he was quietly though respectfully insistent so i let him have his way and allowed myself to be piloted into a long dark coffeeroom where my orders considerably augmented by reynolds in transit were received by a waiter whom we discovered fast asleep in an easychair and who seemed very much surprised to see us  afterwards we went out in the town reynolds and i and began our shopping i was measured at the principal tailors for more clothes than it seemed possible for me to wear out in a lifetime from ridingbreeches to a dresscoat and the quantity and variety of hats boots shirts and ties which reynolds put down as indispensable filled me with halfamused astonishment although i had made up my mind to be surprised at nothing but our shopping was not finished even when reynolds to my inexpressible relief declared my wardrobe to be as complete as could be furnished by a provincial town the gunsmiths the sporting emporium and the horserepository were all visited in turn and when we returned to the hotel about six oclock i was the possessor of two guns which were a perfect revelation to me a cricketbat a tennis racquet a small gymnasium a set of foils and besides other things a stylish wellbuilt dogcart and a sound useful cob  i sank into an easychair in the coffeeroom and refusing to listen to reynolds suggestion as to the propriety of dining before setting out homewards ordered a cup of tea while the waiter had left the room to fetch it i strolled to the window to look out at the weather which had been threatening for some time and on my way i discovered that i was not alone in the apartment a man was seated at one of the furthermost tables dining and as i passed he looked up and surveyed me with a cool critical stare which changed suddenly into a pleasant smile of recognition  mr morton isnt it he said holding out his hand mr ravenor told me that i should probably come across you  i was so surprised that for a moment i forgot to accept the offered hand mr ravenors secretary was the last person whom i should have expected to find eating a solitary dinner in a torchester hotel                                   chapter xv                          a tÊteÀtÊte dinner   what have you been up to in torchester eh shopping mr marx inquired i saw no reason for concealing anything from him nor did i do so rather awkwardly i told him of mr ravenors note to me and that i had been with reynolds all the afternoon perhaps i spoke with a little enthusiasm of our somewhat elaborate purchases at any rate when i had finished he laughed softly to himselfa long noiseless but not unpleasant laugh  well im glad i met you he said his lips still twitching as though with amusement sit down and have some dinner with me  i hesitated for just at that moment mr ravenors words concerning his secretary flashed into my mind besides i was not at all sure that i liked him but on the other hand what alternative was there for me what excuse could i find for declining so simple an invitation in a few minutes the waiter would appear with the modest meal which i had ordered and it would be impossible for me to order him to set it down in another part of the room or to leave it and walk out of the hotel just because this man was there to do so would be to tell him as plainly as possible that i had some particular desire for avoiding him and he would instantly divine that i was obeying a behest of mr ravenors no it was unavoidable i had better accept his invitation and briefly i did so  thats right he said pleasantly its a queer fancy of mine but i hate dining alone waiter bring some more soup at once this gentleman will dine with me  during dinner our conversation was interrupted hat in hand reynolds was standing before us looking at mr marx and then at me and the table before us with a look on his face which i did not altogether understand although it annoyed me excessively he spoke to me  the dogcart has come round sir  i half rose and threw down my napkin though with some reluctance i held out my hand regretfully to mr marx but he refused to take it  you neednt go home with reynolds unless you like he said i have a brougham from the castle here and i can drop you at the farm on my way home  i hesitated for the temptation to stay was strong in fact i should have accepted at once only that reynoldss grave frowning face somehow reminded me of mr ravenors injunction reynolds like a fool settled the matter  i think mr morton had better return with me sir he said to mr marx if you are ready sir he added to me the mare gets very fidgety if shes kept waiting  my boyish vanity was wounded to the quick by the style of his address and his unwise assumption of authority and i answered quickly  youd better be off at once then reynolds i shall accept mr marxs offer  he was evidently uneasy and made one more effort  i think mr ravenor would prefer your returning with me sir he said  mr marx had been leaning back in his chair sipping his coffee somewhat absently and to all appearance altogether indifferent as to which way i should decide he looked up now however and addressed reynolds for the first time  how the deuce do you know anything about what your master would prefer he said coolly  reynolds made no answer but looked appealingly at me i chose not to see him  i should imagine mr marx continued leaning back in his chair again and deliberately stirring his coffee that if mr ravenor has any choice about the matter at all which seems to me very unlikely he would prefer mr mortons riding home in safety with a dry skin listen  we did so and at that moment a fierce gust of wind drove a very deluge of rain against the shaking windowpanes  that decides it i exclaimed ill accept your offer mr marx if you dont mind  by far the more sensible thing to do he remarked carelessly have a glass of wine reynolds before you start youve a wet drive before you  reynolds shook his head and wishing me a respectful good evening withdrew  mr marx watched reynolds leave the room and then shrugged his shoulders slightly  honest but stupid well now youre in my charge morton i must see whether i cant amuse you somehow ever been to the theatre  i could not help a slight blush as i admitted that i had never even seen the outside of one  mr marx looked at me after my admission as though i were some sort of natural curiosity  well well go if you like he said theres a very good one here i believe for the provinces and it will be a change for you  it will make us very late wont it i ventured to say  not necessarily i suppose it will be over about halfpast ten and the carriage can meet us at the door  i said no more for fear that he would take me at my word and give up the idea of going in a few minutes mr marx called for his bill and settled it and glancing at his watch declared that it was time to be off the waiter called a hansom and we drove through the busy streets mr marx leisurely smoking a fragrant cigarette and i leaning forward watching the hurrying throngs of people some pleasureseekers but mostly just released from their daily toil at the factory or workshop  it was a wet night and the streets seemed like a perfect sea of umbrellas the rain was coming down in sheets beating against the closed glass front of our cab and dimming its surface until it became impossible to see farther than the horses head i leaned back by mr marxs side with a sigh and found that he had been watching me with an amused smile  busy little place torchester he remarked  it seems so to me i acknowledged i have never been in any other town except mellborough  lucky boy he exclaimed half lightly half in earnest you have all the pleasures of life before you with the sauce of novelty to help you to relish them what would i not give never to have seen paris or vienna or never to have been in love or tasted quails on toast but here we are at the theatre                                   chapter xvi                             miss mabel fay   the cab pulled up with a jerk underneath a long row of brightly burning lights we dismounted and i followed mr marx up a broad flight of thickly carpeted stairs into a semicircular corridor draped with crimson hangings and dimly lit with rosecoloured lights a faint perfume hung about the place and from below came the soft melody of a rhythmical german waltz which the orchestra was playing i almost held my breath with a curious mixture of expectation and excitement as i followed mr marx and an attendant down the corridor  the latter threw open the door of what appeared to be a little room and we entered mr marx at once moved to the front and throwing the curtains back beckoned me to his side i obeyed him and looked around in wonder  it happened to be a fashionable night and the place was crammed on the level with uswe were in a boxwere rows of men and women in evening attire above a somewhat disorderly mob in the gallery and below a dense throngat least it seemed so to meof seated people were betraying their impatience for the performance by a continual stamping of feet and other rumbling noises  to a regular playgoer it was a very ordinary sight indeed to me it was a revelation i stood at the front of the box looking round until mr marx smiling pushed a chair up to me and bade me sit down then i turned towards the stage and remained with my eyes fixed upon the curtain longing impatiently for it to rise  alas for my expectations when at last the time came it was a charming picture indeed upon which i looked but how different a group of girls in short skirts and picturesque peasant attire moving lightly about the stage and singing a man in uniform making passionate love to one of them who was coyly motioning him away with her hand and bidding him stay with her eyes a pretty picture it all made and a dazzling one but what did it all mean  mr marx had been watching my face and leaned over towards me with a question upon his lips  what does it all mean i whispered this isnt a play is it i dont remember one like it  a play no its a comic opera he answered  i turned away and watched the performance again i suppose i looked a little disappointed but by degrees my disappointment died away it was all so fresh to me  towards the close of the first act in connection with one of the incidents several fresh charactersamongst them the girl who was taking the principal partappeared on the stage there was a little round of applause and i was on the point of turning to make some remark to mr marx when i heard a sharp halfsuppressed exclamation escape from his lips and felt his hot breath upon my cheek  i looked at him in surprise he had risen from his chair and was standing close to my elbow leaning over me with eyes fixed upon the centre of the stage and an incredulous look on his pale face instinctively i followed the direction of his rapt gaze it seemed to me to be bent upon the girl who had last appeared and who with the skirts of her darkgreen ridinghabit gathered up in her hand was preparing to sing  he recovered from his surprise or whatever emotion it was very quickly and broke into a short laugh but i noticed that he pushed his chair farther back into the box and drew the curtains a little more forward  is anything the matter mr marx i asked  he shrugged his shoulders and frowned a little  nothing at all i fancied that i recognised a face upon the stage but i was mistaken goodlooking girl isnt shethe one singing i mean  i thought that goodlooking was a very feeble mode of expression and i said so emphatically in fact i thought her the most beautiful and most graceful creature i had ever seen and as the evening wore on i found myself applauding her songs so vigorously that she glanced smiling into our box and mr marx who was still sitting behind the curtain looked at me with an amused twitching of the lips  morton morton this wont do he exclaimed laughing youll be falling head over ears in love with that young woman presently  i became in a moment very red and uncomfortable for she had just cast a smiling glance up at us and mr marx had intercepted it i was both ashamed and angry with myself for having applauded so loudly as to have become noticeable but mr marx seemed to think nothing of it  there is a better way of showing your appreciation of that young ladys talentsmiss mabel fay i see her name isthan by applause see these flowers  i turned round and saw a large bouquet of white azaleas and roses which the attendant must have brought in  you can give them to her if you like mr marx suggested  i shook my head immediately fully determined that i would do nothing of the sort but mr marx was equally determined that i should it was quite the correct thing he assured me he had sent for them on purpose and i had only to stand up and throw them to her while he talked he was writing on a plain card which he pinned to the flowers and then thrust them into my hand  how it happened i dont quite know but mr marx had his own way it was the close of the act and everyone was applauding mabel fays song she stood facing the house bowing and smiling and her laughing eyes met mine for a moment then rested upon the flowers which i was holding and finally glanced back into mine full of mute invitation  i raised my hand mr marx whispered now and the bouquet was lying at her feet she picked it up gracefully shot a coquettish glance up towards me and then the curtain fell and i sat back in my chair feeling quite convinced that i had made an utter fool of myself  about the middle of the third act mr marx rose and walked to the door holding it open in his hand for a moment he paused and looked round  i am going to leave you for a few minutes he said i shall not be very long  then he went and i heard him walk down the corridor  an hour passed and he did not return the last act came the curtain fell and with a sigh of regret i rose to go still he had not come back  i put on my coat and lingered about uncertain what to do then there came a knock at the boxdoor but instead of mr marx an attendant entered and handed me a note i tore it open and read hastily scrawled in pencil  i am round at the back of the house come to me the bearer will show you the waym                                  chapter xvii               behind the scenes at the torchester theatre   i followed my guide to the end of the corridor through a door which he unlocked and carefully locked again and past the side of the deserted stage on which i paused for a moment to gaze with wonder at the array of ropes and pulleys and runners which the carpenters were busy putting to rights and at the canvascovered unlit auditorium which looked nowstrange transformationlike the mouth of some dark cavern after picking our way carefully we reached a door on which was painted managers room a voice from inside bade us enter and i was ushered in  mr marx was seated in an easychair talking somewhat earnestly to a slim dark young man who was leaning against the mantelpiece an older man was writing at a table at the other end of the room with his back to the door  mr marx welcomed me with a nod and introduced me briefly to the young man by his side  mr mortonmr isaacs mr isaacs is the manager of the company who are playing here  mr isaacs turned an unmistakably jewish face towards me and extended his hand  glad to meet you mr morton hope you liked the performance he said with a smile which disclosed the whole of a very white set of teeth very fair wasnt it ha ha ha  i replied that i had enjoyed it exceedingly and looked at mr marx wondering how long he meant to stay i had taken a sudden but strong dislike to mr isaacs  shall you be very long mr marx i asked  i have sent for the carriage he answered it will be here in ten minutes  it seemed to me that there was something a little strange in mr marxs manner and the way in which he kept glancing towards the door  just at that moment someone knocked at the door  come in cried mr isaacs  a lady obeyed his summons and swept into the room with a most unnecessary rustling of silk skirts mr isaacs welcomed her effusively  miss fay your most humble servant he exclaimed bowing low let me introduce two of my friends mr morton and mr marx  the lady put out her ungloved hand covered with a profusion of rings  i know this young gentleman by sight she said in a loud and rather highpitched tone you threw me those lovely flowers didnt you so good of youawfully good ive sent them home by my young woman  i stammered out some incoherent response and heartily wished myself a hundred miles away what a disenchantment it was i looked at her thickly pencilled eyebrows at the smeared powder and paint which lay thick upon her face at her bold staring eyes the crowsfeet underneath which art had done what it could to conceal and failed at the masses of yellow hair which intuitively i knew to be false and i felt my cheeks burn with shame that i should have been tricked into admiring her for a moment unfortunately she put down my embarrassment to another cause for it seemed partly to gratify partly to amuse her  my young friend and i admired your performance equally miss fay although perhaps he was the more demonstrative said mr marx coming forward will you accept the congratulations and thanks of a provincial who seldom has the pleasure of seeing such acting or hearing such a voice  she thanked him with an affected little laugh which suddenly died away and she looked into his face intently  havent we met before she asked curiously there is something about your face or voice which seems familiar to me  he returned her gaze steadily but shook his head with a slight smile  i am afraid i may not claim that honour he said if we had there could not possibly have been any uncertainty in my mind about it it would have been a treasured memory  she looked doubtful but turned away carelessly  i suppose it is my mistake then she remarked you certainly seem to remind me of someone whom i have known fancy perhaps mr isaacs i came to beg for your escort home here she shot a quick glance at me which made my cheeks hot again i have sent julia on and i cant go alone can i mr morton she asked turning to me  ii suppose not i answered devoutly wishing that mr marx would take his departure but as though on purpose he had gone to the other end of the room and had his back turned towards me  there was a brief silence mr isaacs glanced at me whistled softly to himself and then strolled slowly over to the window as though to see what sort of a night it was miss fay glanced at me impatiently with a slight contraction in her eyebrows i longed desperately to get away but for the life of me could think of no excuse  you wont offer your escort then mr morton she whispered  i cant i dont know the townnever was here beforeand we have a twelvemile drive before us we are expecting the carriage every moment ah there it is i added with a sudden sense of relief as i heard the sound of horses feet stamping and pawing outside and the jingling of harness mr marx burdett has come i called out  he looked up frowning  all right theres no hurry he said if youre not ready pray dont study me i should enjoy a cigar and a brandyandsoda down at the bell before we start  im quite ready thanks i answered slowly for his words and manner had given me something to think about if you dont mind i should like to be getting away its a long way you know  oh pray dont let me detain you miss fay exclaimed tossing her head mr isaacs if youre ready i am goodnight mr marx goodnight mr morton  she drew me a little on one sidea manoeuvre which i was powerless to preventand whispered in my ear  you shy stupid boy there  she shook hands with me again and left something in my palm when they were gone and i was in the passage i looked at it it was a plain card and on it was hastily scribbled an address            miss mabel fay                 15 queen street  i felt my cheeks flush as i tore it into pieces and flung them on the ground then i followed mr marx out to the carriage and leaning back among the cushions by his side i began seriously to consider an idea which every trifling incident during the latter part of the evening had pointed to mr marx had deliberately tried to lead me into making a fool of myself with miss mabel fay why                                  chapter xviii                         at midnight on the moor   we were more than halfway home before mr marx broke a silence which was becoming oppressive  well have you enjoyed your evening he asked  of course i have and im very much obliged to you for taking me to the theatre i added after all perhaps i was misjudging him what possible motive could he have for being my enemy  oh thats all right he declared carefully lighting a cigar and throwing the match out of the window im afraid youve had more than one illusion dispelled this evening though he went on smiling you must have had plenty of time and opportunity too for weaving them out here all your life have you never been away to visit your relations or anything of that sort  i shook my head  i dont believe i have any relations i said i never heard of any my father used to say that he was the last of his family  but your mother surely you know some of her people  i have never even heard her speak of them i answered shortly  strange you dont happen to remember her maiden name do you  i dont know that i ever heard it i told him  i began to wish that mr marx would choose some other topic of conversation doubtless it was exceedingly kind of him to take so much interest in my affairs and his questions proceeded from perfectly genuine motives but my inability to answer any of them was becoming a little embarrassing  one more question i was going to ask you and it shall be the last he said as though divining my feeling were you born here  i suppose so i never heard that i was born anywhere else  there was another long silence and it seemed to me that mr marx was very deep in thought i was beginning to feel sleepy and closing my eyes i leaned right back among the soft yielding cushions  it was one of the wildest and roughest nights of the year both the carriagewindows were streaming with raindrops and we could hear the wind howling across the open country and whistling mournfully among the leafless trees  we had accomplished about threequarters of our journey and had just entered upon the blackest part of it on either side of the road and running close up to it without even the division of hedges was a stretch of bare open country pleasant enough in summer time but now a mere plain on which were dotted about a few straggling plantations of sickly stunted fir trees among which the hurricane was making weird music  we were in the middle of this dreary region mr marx was still smoking his cigar but with closed eyes and was either dozing or deep in thought i with my share of the fur rug wrapped closely around my knees was trying in vain to sleepin vain for my head was still in a whirl after what had been for me such an exciting day  exciting though it had been however its close was to be more so suddenly without the least warning we felt a sharp jerk and heard the coachman calling out to his horses who were plunging furiously mr marx and i both leaned forward and just as we did so there was a tremendous crash of breaking glass and through the splintered carriage window on the side nearest to him came a heavy piece of rock followed by a confused mass of stones and gravel and other débris  mr marx leapt to his feet with his hand on the door handle and the blood streaming from his forehead before he could open the door however a strange thing happened outside half visible through the remains of the glass and half without any intervening obstruction flashed for one single second the white ghastly face of a man peering in upon us it came and went so swiftly that i could gain only the very faintest idea of the features but with mr marx it seemed to be otherwise like a flash of lightning a look passed across his face which has never died out of my memory every feature seemed to be dilated and shaken with a spasmodic agony of horrified recognition for a moment he seemed struck helpless with every power of movement and every nerve numbed then a low cry such as i have never before or since heard from human throat burst from his shaking lips and his right hand tore open his coat and sought his breastpocket  the door of the carriage burst open as he sprang into the road like a wild animal and long streaks of fire flashed from the gleaming revolver which he grasped in his handa lurid illumination which gave me sudden glimpses of his white bleeding face as he stood in the road firing barrel after barrel into the darkness  i jumped out and hurried to his side looking eagerly around into the dark night and together we stood and listened in a breathless silence across the wild open moor the wind came rushing towards us with a deep booming sound and among the bare tree tops of a small plantation before us we heard it shrieking and yelling like the hellish laughter of an army of witches the inkblack clouds lowering close above our heads were dissolving in a mad torrent of rain and the darkness was so intense that although we could hear the frantic plunging of the horses behind us we could neither see them nor the carriage the elements seemed to have declared themselves on the side of our mysterious assailant the blackness of the night and the roaring of the wind and rain blotted out all our surroundings and deadened all sound save their own  wait here cried mr marx in a harsh unnatural tone and before i could open my mouth he had vanished out of sight and it seemed as though the black yawning darkness had swallowed him up  for a while i stood without moving then a cry for help from the coachman behind and the renewed sound of struggling horses reminded me of their plight and i groped my way back to the road again  i was only just in time the horses fine powerful creatures very nearly thoroughbred were perfectly mad with fright and the groom who had been holding and striving to subdue them was quite exhausted between us we managed to pacify them after a brief struggle and as soon as i could find sufficient breath i began to question burdettwho had stuck to his place on the box like an immovable statueabout the first cause of their alarm  what was it they shied at first i asked did you see anyone  just catched a glimpse of the blackguard sir and that was all burdett answered we were aspinning along beautiful for they knew as they were on their way home them animals did when all of a sudden like dandy shies and up goes the mare on her hind legs and as near as possible pitches me into the road i slackened the reins and laid the whip across them while tom jumped down and just then i saw a figure in the middle of the road and heard a crash through the carriage window tom hed catched hold of their heads by then which was lucky for when the firing began they was like mad creatures and i could never have held them its a mercy we arent altogether smashed up and no mistake the lord save me from ever being out wi my osses again on such a night as this  you didnt see the face of the man who attacked us then i asked eagerly  not being possessed of the eyes of a heagle or a cat sir i did not burdett replied just you look round and see what sort of a night it is why i can only just make out your outline sir although ive been looking at you this five minutes i cant see nothing of your face  neither did you i suppose tom i asked the groom  no sir nothing except just a black figure good thing that you was neither of you hurt sir  im not sure that mr marx isnt i answered his face was bleeding a good deal i wish hed come back  never did time pass so slowly as then when we waited in the storm and rain for mr marxs return it must have been nearly an hour before we heard him hailing us in the distance and soon afterwards saw his figure loom out of the darkness close at hand he was alone  splashed from head to foot with mud hatless and with great streaks of blood clotted upon his forehead and cheeks he presented at first a frightful figure but his face had lost that dreadful expression of numbed horror which had made it for a moment so terrible to me and as he sank back breathless and exhausted among the cushions he even attempted a smile  all in vain you see he said couldnt find a single trace of anyone anywhere  are you much hurt sir asked the groom who was tying up the broken carriagedoor  not at all only a scratch tell burdett to drive home as fast as he can now tom theres a good fellow  we were left together to talk over this strange affair mr marx seemed to have made up his mind about it already  without doubt he said deliberately it was some tramp desperate with want or drink who made up his mind to play the highwayman he started well and then seeing two of us instead of one funked it and bolted i dont think i ever had such a start in my life  you came off the worst i remarked pointing to his forehead  it wasnt that that upset me he answered it was a horrible idea which flashed upon me just for a moment the face which peered in at the windowyou saw itwas horribly like the face of a man who is deadwhom i know to be dead it gave me just while the idea lasted a sensation which i hope i shall never experience again as long as i live it was ghastly  the face of the dead it was not a cheerful thought but i looked at the wrecked door and window of the carriage and felt immediately reassured our assailant whoever he might have been was no ghostly one there was undeniable evidence of his material presence and strength in the shattered glass the wrenched woodwork and the wound on mr marxs forehead  the carriage pulled up with a jerk we had reached my home  hadnt you better come in and bathe your forehead mr marx i suggested hesitatingly  he shook his head and declined  no thanks ill get back to the castle as soon as i can and doctor it myself goodbye morton if i dont see you again before you go i wish you every success at mr randalls  i thanked him warmly shook his offered hand and shutting the carriagedoor called out to burdett to drive on for a moment or two i stood in the road watching the lights as they rapidly grew fainter and fainter in the distance then i turned slowly up the path towards the house  halfway there i stopped short and holding my breath listened intently the wind had dropped and the rain had almost ceased but the night was still as dark as pitch i listened with strained ears and beating heart and soon i knew that i had not been mistaken coming down the hill between rothland wood gate and where i was along the road by which we had just come i could hear the faint but nevertheless unmistakable sound of light running footsteps turning back i stole softly down the path and stood in the middle of the road waiting                                   chapter xix                            a strange attack   it could not in reality have been more than a minute or two although it seemed to me then a terribly long while before i again heard the sound which had attracted my attention when i did it was quite close at hand just at the beginning of the range of farmbuildings which skirted the road there was no possibility of any mistake the situation was sufficiently plain at any rate scarcely fifty yards away a man was coming running towards me either barefooted or with very soft shoes on and it was past midnight pitch dark and a lonely road  nearer and nearer the steps came and my heart began to beat very fast indeed at last peering earnestly through the gloom i made out the shadowy figure of a man only a yard or two away from me running in the middle of the road and a pair of wild burning eyes glistened like fire against the dark background i felt his warm panting breath upon my cheek heard a low fierce cry and a second later saw the figure give a spring sideways and vanish in the shade of the barn wall  i followed cautiously but although i groped about in all directions i could see nothing so i stood quite still with my back to the wall and called out softly  who are you why are you hiding from me  no answer i tried again  i dont want to hurt you i wont do you any harm i only want to know who you are and what  i never finished the sentence i became suddenly conscious of two glaring eyes looking at me like pieces of live coal from a crumpled heap on the ground then there was a quick panting snort a spring and i felt a mans long nervous fingers clutching my throat gasping and choking for breath i flung them off only to find myself held as though in a vice by a pair of long arms drawing a deep breath i braced myself up for the struggle with my unknown assailant  more than once i gave myself up for lost for my opponent was evidently a powerful man and seemed bent on strangling me but fiercely though he struggled at first i soon saw that his strength was only the frenzy of nervous desperation and that it was fast leaving him by degrees i began to gain the upper hand and at last with a supreme effort i threw him on his back and before he could recover himself i had my knee upon his chest and drew a long breath of relief  i spoke to him shouted threatened commanded but he took no notice then i peered down close into his upturned face and fierce eyes and the truth flashed upon me at once i had been struggling with a madman a hopeless raving lunatic and it was probably he who had made the attack upon us in the carriage  my first impulse was one of deep gratitude for my escape then i began to wonder what on earth i was to do with him he was lying like a log now perfectly quiet but i knew that i had only to relax my hold upon him and the struggle would begin againperhaps terminate differently i could not take him into the house for there was no room from which he could not easily escape the only place seemed to me to be the coachhouse it was dry and clean with no windows save at the top and with a good strong padlock the coachhouse would do i decided if only i could get him there  i drew my handkerchief from my pocket and knotting it with my teeth secured his hands as well as i could then seizing him by the collar i half dragged half helped him up the garden path till we reached the coachhouse and opening the door with one hand i thrust him in he made no resistance in fact he seemed utterly cowed and a pitiable object he looked crouched on the floor with his face turned to the wall i struck a match to obtain a better view of him  his only attire was a grey flannel shirt and a pair of dark trousers both of which were torn in places and saturated with rain of his face i could see little for it was half hidden by the hair matted with dirt and rain and by his bushy whiskers and beard ragged and unkempt his feet were bare and black with a thick coating of mud hence his soft stealthy tread altogether he was a gruesome object as he lay a huddled heap against the wall muttering to himself some unintelligible jargon  loosing his hands i left him there and softly entering the house found some food and rugs and took them out to him he eyed the former ravenously and before i could set it down he snatched a piece of bread from my hands and began eagerly to devour it i put the remainder down by his side and throwing the rugs over him stole away                                   chapter xx                      the monastery among the hills   when i awoke in the morning the sun was already high in the heavens and it was considerably past my usual hour of rising i jumped out of bed at once and began my toilet i had scarcely finished my bath when there came a loud tap at the door  hallo i cried out anything the matter  yes sir please sir john wants to know whether you locked anything up in the coachhouse last night there was  yes i did i interrupted quickly tell him not to go there till i come down  please sir its too late the girl answered in a frightened tone its got away whatever it is  i dropped the towel with which i had been rubbing myself and hurried on my clothes in a few minutes i was down in the yard where several men were standing together talking john left them at once and came to me  why did you want to go to the coachhouse so early i exclaimed glancing at the wideopen door and empty interior i had an awful job to get that man in there last night and now youve let him go  well sir it was a fearful row he was amaking explained john soon as i came this morning about five oclock i was passing through the stackyard when i heard an awful thumping at the coachhouse door from the inside of course i knew nowt about there being anyone theer so i just goes straight up and opens the door to see what was the matter like and lor i did ave a skeer and no mistake it wur quite dark and i could see nowt but a pair o heyes aglaring at me as savage as a wild animals coom out o this ere and lets ha a look at yer i says for dye see i thought as it wur someone who had crept in unbeknown in the daytime and got locked in by mistake there warnt no answer and i wur just about to strike a match and ave a look at im when he springs at me like a wild cat i tried to hold him and im darned if he didnt nearly make his teeth meet through my hand  he touched his right hand lightly and i noticed for the first time that it was bandaged up  he got away from you then i remarked  got away from me john repeated in a tone of utter disgust he warnt such a sweetlooking object or sweettempered un either that i wur overanxious for the pleasure of his company he warnt i just got my hand out of his jaws and let him go as fast as he liked with a jolly good kick behind to help him on too you see sir i didnt know as youd anything to do with putting him in there the man added apologetically i thought hed got in quite promiscuouslike  to tell the truth although i had been alarmed at first i did not particularly regret what had happened at any rate it saved me the bother of going over to the policestation at mellborough still the thought that he might even now be lurking about in the vicinity with plenty of opportunities to provide a weapon for himself was not altogether a pleasant one  who might he have been sir john inquired curiously  just what i should like to know i answered hes a lunatic and a dangerous one thats certainescaped from some asylum i should think and i told him of my adventure on the previous night to which the whole group listened openmouthed  im thinking sir john remarked when i had finished that itd be as well for foulds and i to have a scour round and see if we cant find him or hell be doing someone a mischief  if you are not very busy i wish you would i said i dont feel quite easy at the thought of his wandering about round here if you do find him lock him up and send word to the policestation at mellborough  after breakfast that morning my mother made a request which startled me almost as much it delighted me  i am going to walk over to the monastery philip she said quietly will you come with me  of course i will mother i answered promptly nothing could give me greater pleasure when will you start  i shall be ready in half an hour she said with a faint smile as though she were pleased at my ready acquiescence then she left the room to get ready  in about the time she had mentioned she came into the garden to me and we started on our walk it was a very uneventful one but i dont think that i shall ever forget it my mother seemed after her brief relapse into comparative kindness to have become more inaccessible than ever and she walked along by my side with downcast eyes and a nervous thoughtful expression on her pale face  i too felt somewhat depressed at starting but soon the fresh pure air becoming stronger and stronger as we left the road and followed the footpath by beacon hill had its invariable effect upon my spirits all perplexing thoughts and forebodings of trouble passed away from me like magic and my heart beat and the blood flowed through my veins with all the impetuous ardour of sanguine youth  at the top of the hill we paused i to look round upon my favourite scene my mother to rest for a moment then we saw how great had been the storm of the night before  here and there were the bare trunks of trees and many a cattleshed and barn stood roofless the storm seemed to have worked havoc everywhere save where on the summit of its wooded hill ravenor castle with its great range of mighty battlements its vast towers and grey walls of invincible thickness frowned down upon the country at its feet looking across at it it seemed to me that the place had never seemed so imposing as then  my mother stood by my side and noticed my intent gaze  you admire ravenor castle very much philip she said quietly  i withdrew my eyes with an effort  i do mother i confessed very much indeed the place has a sort of fascination for meand the man who lives there  my mother had turned a little away from me and stood with face upturned to heaven and mutely moving lips out of her eyes i could see the tears slowly welling and her tall slim figure was convulsed with sobs i sprang to her side and caught hold of her hand  what is it mother i cried tell me  she shook her head sadly  not now philipnot now come let us go  side by side we began to descend the hill our path wound around several freshlyplanted spinneys and then led through a plantation of pinetrees  then we turned with regret so far as i was concerned into the muddy road again and walked for more than a mile between high straight hedges at last soon after midday we turned to the left passed through a farmyard and along a winding path which led us now by the side of turnip fields now across brackencovered open country to the summit of our last hill  here again we paused below us close up against the background of the colourless hills drearily situated in the bleakest spot of the austere landscape the straight spires and severely simple buildings of the monastery were clustered together a little above it on an artificial eminence of rock a rude cross stood out in vivid relief against the sky and on this my mothers eyes were fixed with a sort of rapt wistfulness as we stood side by side on the top of the hill looking downwards  it was a fitting spot that these menwho counted it among their virtues that in their rigid selfimmolation they had cut themselves off even from the beauties of naturehad chosen for their habitation but although the place had a peculiar impressiveness of its own which never failed to exercise a sort of fascination upon me i was glad today when my mother moved forward again  as we neared the end of our journey and turned in at the long straight avenue which led to the monastery doors the strange agitation which i had noticed in my mothers manner during the earlier part of the day visibly increased the cold inexpressiveness which had dwelt for so long in her face vanished and into it there crept a look which having once seen i cared not to look upon again it seemed as though she were endeavouring to brace herself up for some tremendous ordeal and i would have given anything to have been able to put into words the sympathy which had risen up strongly within me  unnatural cold severe and at the best of times indifferent as she had lately been to me she was still my mother and i loved her but i dared not break in with words upon the fierce anguish which was already beginning to leave its marks upon her white strained face only when we stood before the bare stone front of the monastery and with feeble fingers she had pulled the great iron bell could i speak at all and then the words were not such as i wished to speak afterwards when i thought of themand i often did think of them and of every trifling incident of that memorable walkthey seemed to me weak and illchosen  but such as they were i am glad that i spoke them  she listened as one whose thoughts were far away but when i ceased breathless she laid her hand upon my arm and with her dim sad eyes looking into mine said simply  this is for your sake philipfor your sake  then before i could ask her what she meant the great door slowly opened and the guestmaster stood before us she passed him with a silent salutation and vanished on her way to the chapel and though i watched her longingly i dared not follow then declining father bernards invitation to go to his room and rest i turned away from the door and wandered into the grounds  hour after hour of the brief winters day passed away father bernard came out in search of me and offered me refreshments but i shook my head i could not eat nor drink nor rest a strange but powerful apprehension of some coming crisis in my lifesome great evil connected with my mothers visit to this placehad laid hold of me and all my struggles against it were impotent  it was late in the afternoon before she came i had climbed up to the top of calvary and with sick heart and longing eyes was watching the door from which she must issue suddenly it was opened and she stood for a moment upon the threshold looking around for me to my dying day i shall think of her as i saw her then  her face was the face of a saintcalm passionless and happy with a gentle chastened happiness i knew when i looked upon her that she had left the burden of her great sorrow behind but she had paid a price for it pale and fragile as she had always appeared she seemed now to have been wasted by some fierce scathing ordeal which had driven out of her features everything human and left only a spiritual life as she moved slowly forward into the drive and i saw her even more distinctly she seemed to me to have gained a strange new beauty but it was a beauty which made me look upon her with a sudden shuddering fear  i hurried down to her side and she welcomed me with a smile such as i had seldom seen on her face and which was altogether in harmony with her softened expression then she took my arm and we turned towards home  you are happier now mother i ventured to ask her and she answered me by silently pressing my arm  we passed down the avenue thickly strewn with decaying leaves along the winding lane and through the gate which led up to ives head hill once or twice as we were making the ascent i fancied that she hung heavily upon my arm and i asked if she were tired but she only shook her head we had reached the summit before the terrible fear which had been gnawing at my heart took definite shape then for the first time since we had started upon our return journey i was able to look into her face which she had been keeping averted from me and when i saw the ghastly change which had crept into it my heart stood still and all my senses seemed numbed with fear  mother i cried you are ill what is the matter oh speak to medo  she had fallen into my arms and her hands which touched mine as they fell to her side were as cold as ice her face was like the face of one who has already triumphed over the shadows of death far away at our feet the cross of calvary was standing out with rugged vividness against the fast darkening sky and upon it her closing eyes were steadily fixed her lips were slightly parted in a happy confident smile and her whole being seemed absorbed in the most religious devotion once she whispered my name and faintly pressed my hand then her lips moved again and i heard the dread sound of the solemn prayer faltered out in a broken whisper in manus tuas domine  in my heart i knew that she was dying and that human help would be of no avail yet i was loth to abandon all hope and setting her gently down i looked anxiously around on the summit of the next range of hills a man was sitting on horseback looking down upon the monasterya motionless figure against the sky i cried out to him and at the sound of my voice he started round and looked towards us then suddenly digging the spurs deep into the sides of his great black horse he came thundering up the side of the hill at a pace which made the ground shake beneath my feet like the tremblings of an earthquake  what is wrong he cried hoarsely and looking into his face i recognised mr ravenor  i pointed to my mothers prostrate figure and gazing at him with dry eyes i answered mechanically  she is dying  the words had scarcely left my lips before he had leaped from his horse and passing his arm around her bent over her pallid face  oh this is horrible he murmured you must not dieyou must not die i have  his voice seemed choked with emotion and he did not finish his sentence she spoke to him but so softly that i could not hear the words  i walked a few yards away and once more looked wildly round far away on the dark hillside i could see the whiterobed figures of the lay brethren bending over their labour nearer there was no one the road below was deserted and a deep stillness seemed brooding over the bare shadowy landscape sick at heart i turned back and fell on my knees by my mothers side  we remained there fearing almost to look into her face until the twilight deepened upon the hills and slowly blotted out from our view even the dark cross standing up against the grey sky then mr ravenor leaned for a moment forward and a low groan escaped from his lips it told me what i dreadedthat my mother was dead                                   chapter xxi                         a message from the dead   the paroxysm of my grief passed slowly away and i rose to my feet and looked around with streaming eyes mr ravenor was still by my side and together we carried my mother back to the monastery the news of our approach had preceded us and long before we reached our journeys end the solemn minutebell was tolling out to the silent night awakening strange echoes in the hills and finding a reverberation of its mournfulness in my heart  austere and impressive as the great bare front of the monastery had always appeared to me it had never seemed so cold and desolate as when our melancholy little procession wound round the hill of calvary and slowly approached the entrance the gloom of a winters evening was hanging around the building which with never a ray of light from any part looked like a habitation of the deada gigantic vault  but suddenly as we drew near the front door was slowly opened and the dark figure of a monk holding above his head a lighted taper stood on the steps and in a low monotone repeated a latin prayer when he ceased there was a moments silence and then from the chapel there came the sound of deep voices chanting slowly in solemn unison the miserere  the remainder of that night seems like a dream to me now of which i can recall but little but i remember that long past midnight when i had thrown myself down upon the stone floor of the guestchamber i heard soft steps and the rustle of garments approaching me and looking up i saw the sweetest face i ever beheld in man or woman looking down into mine from the deep folds of a monks cowl  he stayed with me for a while speaking welcome words of comfort then gathering his robes about him he stood up prepared to leave but first he handed me a small packet  this was left in my charge for you philip morton he said little did i dream that so soon i should be called upon to fulfil my trust take it my son  the packet which i opened with reverent fingers was a very small one and consisted of a single letter only that i might see the more clearly to read it i pushed open the narrow diamondframed window and the moonlight filled the little room with a soft mellowed light then i read    the barnwood monastery of st clements                 november 19th 18  my dearest soni write these lines to you philip feeling happier than i have done for many years because i have a deep and sure conviction that my life is drawing fast to a close and that the end may come at any minute alas my son i feel that i have not been to you all that a mother should be it may be that my coldness has alienated from me the love which i know you have been willing to give it may be so but i choose rather to believe that you will pity me when i tell you that the coldness which has grown up between us was none of my choosing but was only part of a terrible punishment which i have had to bear for many weary years  what my sinor let me be merciful to myself and call it my errorwas i do not purpose here to tell you some day the person at whose discretion i have left it may deem it well to tell you the whole story for my sake philip for the sake of the love which i know you bear meand which god knows i have for youi beg you to wait until that time comes and not seek to hasten it  think of me as kindly as you can dear if the path which i chose to follow was not the wisest i have at least suffered terribly for it for many weary years grief and horror and remorse have been making my life one long purgatory yes i have suffered indeed but at last i have found peace  do not marvel at what i am going to tell you philip my willthe little i have to leave is yoursis drawn up and signed and i have appointed mr ravenor your guardian there are reasons for this which you cannot know but he will be only too glad to accept the charge and in all things philip even if he should desire you altogether to change your position in life follow his command and submit to his wishes  farewell my beloved sonfarewell god grant that your life may be good and happy and that your last days may be as peaceful as mine i can wish you nothing better once more farewellyour affectionate                                                             mother                                  chapter xxii                                for life   my mothers death marked an epoch in my life for immediately afterwards a great change came over my circumstances and position of the dreary days just before and after the funeral i shall here say but little their sadness is for me and me alone  until after the ceremony i remained at the monastery seeking relief from my thoughts by rambles over the hills by watches at dead of night before the spot where with many candles burning round her open coffin my mother lay and by long conversations with father alexander my comforter when the time of the funeral came mr ravenor stood by my side the only other mourner and i knew that the banks of choice white flowers which smothered the coffin and perfumed the winter air were his gift  after it was all over he came to me where i stood a little apart and put his hand upon my shoulder  philip my boy he said kindly will you come back to the castle with me i am your guardian now you know  i drew a long breath  let me go back to the farm for a week by myself i said then i will come to you be ready to go to dr randalls  let it be so then he answered perhaps it is best  i said goodbye to the monks especially to father alexander with regret for they had all been very good to me then i accompanied mr ravenor to his carriage and was driven swiftly homewards  the week that followed i spent in solitude and as the days passed by the bitterness of my grief left me not that the memory of my mother grew less dearrather the reverse but i began to recognise that what had happened was best better that she should have died thus full of thoughts of holy things and with a conscience at rest than that she should still be bearing with aching heart a burden which she had never deserved  on the last day of the week i was told that a visitor had arrived and wished to see me and before i could ask his name he had entered the room it was mr marx  the man was surely an admirable actor instinct told me that he cared not a jot for either my mother or me but his few words of sympathy were excellently chosen and gracefully spoken then he at once changed the subject and talked pleasantly of other things and as he went on i suddenly remembered that i had not seen him since the night of our drive home from torchester and that therefore he could know nothing of the adventure which had befallen me after his departure i took advantage therefore of a pause in the conversation to tell him all about it and impassive though his face was i could see that it made a great impression  do you remember what the man was like he asked knitting his brows can you describe him  i did so as well as i could and in the midst of my narration making some trivial excuse he moved his chair out of the light into the shadows of the room but if he wished to escape my scrutiny he was a little too late for i had already noticed his blanched face and trembling hands evidently there was something more in this midnight attack than i had thought who was the lunatic i wondered i felt sure looking at him closely that mr marx knew no need now for mr ravenor to warn me against the companionship of this man already my passive dislike had grown into an active aversion  instinctively i felt that he was both unscrupulous and untrustworthy i felt that he was seeking me for ends of his own and all the time i was half afraid of him  doubtless my manner showed that he was no welcome visitor but still he lingered at last my housekeeper brought me in my afternoon cup of tea and i was compelled to ask him to join me he did so drank it thoughtfully and immediately afterwards rose to go  i have been wondering what can have become of this poor lunatic he said carelessly scarcely a pleasant person to meet on a dark evening  i shrugged my shoulders as i walked out into the hall with him  it is nearly a fortnight ago i remarked he can hardly have remained in the neighbourhood and in hiding all this time  still if he had been captured we should have heard of it mr marx objected  probably and yet i dont see why i should not at any rate as i have been away at the monastery and you i dont know how you would have heard of it unless you read the local papers  a weakness of which i am not guilty he answered drily nor have i been outside the grounds we have been hard at work  did you walk here i asked  he shook his head  i came down in a trap from the castle but the man was going to mellborough and i told him not to wait for me you wont walk across the park with me i suppose just to get an appetite for dinner its a splendid evening  i looked at him furtively but closely yes mr marx was a coward in addition to his other slight demerits  no thanks i answered shortly ive had a long walk already today good evening  i turned back into the sittingroom but before i had reached my easychair i began to think that i was scarcely behaving well after all mr marx was a middleaged man and it was possible that his strength might have been sapped by the brain labour in which he was constantly engaged and his sedentary life  supposing he were to encounter this lunatic and suffer at his hands perhaps even lose his life should i not blame myself i came to a speedy decision i would let him have his fright but i would follow him at a little distance and see that he came to no harm  i took a short heavy stick from the rack and crossing the stackyard vaulted over the palings into the park purposely avoiding the gate about a hundred yards in front mr marx was walking quickly along with both hands in his ulster pockets and looking frequently around him men had been busy in the park on the previous day cutting the bracken and along the side of the road were many stacks of it waiting to be carted away i noticed that whenever mr marx drew near one of these he gave it a wide berth and i smiled to myself at this evidence of his anxiety  i was walking on the turf that he might not hear my footsteps and was able to keep him easily in sight for it was a clear frosty evening and the full moon was shining in a cloudless sky at a sudden bend in the road he came in sight of a place where stacks of bracken had been left on either side opposite to each other i saw him pause as though hesitating which he should avoid and at the same moment i distinctly saw some dark body crouched down behind one of them and swaying slightly backwards and forwards  i broke at once into a run but before the echoes of my warning shout had died away a figure sprang like a wild cat at mr marxs throat there was a flash and a sharp report but from the direction of the former i could see that the revolver had been knocked up into the air and exploded harmlessly  when at last i reached the assailant and his victim it was a fearful sight i looked upon the face of the lunatic was ghastly and his wild eyes almost started from their sockets in his rage  white and emaciated as a skeletons his face was still capable of expressionand such an expression a frenzied desire to kill seemed to be his sole aim and his long skinny fingers clutched mr marxs throat as in a vice the latters eyeballs were protruding from his head and his breath was coming in short agonised pants yet all the while mr marx was holding the madman in such a fierce grip that i could hear his ribs snapping like whalebone  my arrival saved mr marx from a speedy death by strangulation though i lifted the lunatic up in my arms and strained every muscle to pull him away his fingers never relaxed till i stopped his breath and rendered him momentarily unconscious  i waited for mr marx to come to himself my foot resting lightly upon the prostrate body of his assailant soon he rose slowly to his feet and began groping about in the road  what do you want i asked lost anything  my revolver  i pointed to where it lay gleaming in the moonlight he picked it up and set it to an undischarged barrel i watched him curiously  you wont want that again i remarked what are you going to do with it  i am going to put that beast out of his misery he answered stand out of the way  nonsense you will do nothing of the sort i cried hotly what kill an insensible man he has as much right to live as you you shall not commit murder in my presence and least of all shall you kill a poor insane creature like this put that thing up  an awful look flashed into his face and as he suddenly raised his arm i looked into the dark muzzle of his revolver  with a quick spring i wrenched the revolver from his hand and bending backwards threw it far away into the bracken  i dont know what you were going to do mr marx i said looking at him steadily but it seems to me that you are not a fit person to be trusted with firearms  he stood still speechless with rage i turned my back upon him and found to my surprise that the man whose life mr marx had so much desired was lying on his side looking at me with wideopen eyes  well have your own way mr marx said quietly i dare say you are right there was no need to be violent or to throw away my favourite revolver what do you propose to do with him  mr marx advanced but at the sight of him the lunatic who was leaning heavily upon my arm and groaning with pain shrank down upon the ground cowering at my feet like a dog he covered his face with his hands and broke into one of the most pitiful cries of distress that i have ever heard from human lips i motioned mr marx back  i can manage him alone i think and the sight of you upsets him will you follow us down  mr marx advanced a step or two his eyes flashing with anger then suddenly he turned his back upon us and without a word walked rapidly away i raised my prisoner and half carried half dragged him back to the farm  in a few hours the doctor from rothland had arrived and speedily set the broken bones he seemed much interested in the case and made a careful examination  do you think he has been a lunatic long i asked  the doctor shook his head  on the contrary he replied i should say his madness has come on quite recentlythe effect of some severe shock probably if he is treated properly there is no doubt that he will regain his reason  in a few days the lunatic was pronounced well enough in health to be moved and as all inquiries and advertisements about him proved fruitless he was consigned to the county asylum at torchester                                  chapter xxiii                               my guardian   on the third day after my adventure in the park mr ravenor called to see me he came in splashed from head to foot and had evidently ridden a long distance and fast i offered him a chair and some refreshment for he looked pale and tired but he declined both and walked slowly up and down the room his hands grasping a long ridingwhip behind his back  i can only give you a minute or two now morton he said with some slight return of his former brusque hauteur i am expecting visitors from london tonight and must get back to receive them but there is something i must say to you you will be surprised to hear that your mother has left you a considerable property  i was very much surprised  are you quite sure of this mr ravenor i ventured to ask my mother always spoke to me as though we were poor  i do not make mistakes he answered pausing in his walk and looking down upon me from his great height with knitted brows and piercing eyes least of all in matters of such importance how much the exact sum will amount to i cannot tell yet but it is more than twenty thousand pounds so you will be able to choose your own profession what will it be i wonderthe bar the army the church agriculture come you are a boy of imagination and have never been in love you must have had daydreams of some sort whither have they led you  not to any of the professions which you have mentioned i answered promptly  then where tell me i am curious to know  my ideas have always been very vague i said slowly i should like to live quite away from any town to read a good deal and to spend the rest of my time out of doors and then perhaps after a time i might try to think something out and put it into words  in short you would like to be an author mr ravenor broke in with a slight smile  yes but i should not want to write to amuse people or to become famous i went on encouraged by mr ravenors gravity i should like to make people think i should like to make them turn aside from the groove of their daily life and realise that the world is full of greater and higher things than mere material prosperity men seem to me to find their daily work and pleasure too absorbing they think of themselves and others only as individuals never as limbs of a great common humanity with a mighty destiny the world grows narrower and narrower for them as they grow older instead of broader and broader it is because they neglect the use of their imaginationat least so it seems to me  have you read hibbets little pamphlets mr ravenor asked  both of them i answered i like his ideas  have your clothes come from torchester he inquired with apparent irrelevance  yes they came last week i told him wondering  very well put on your dresssuit and come up to the castle at eight oclock tonight you shall dine with me and meet hibbet  meet sir richard hibbet dine at the same table my cheeks flushed and my heart beat fast life was opening out for me  yes he and marris and williams the publisher you know are all staying at the castle there will be some more of them down tonight dont be late i will find time if i can to have some talk with you for i want you to go to dr randalls next week  he nodded and took his departure i watched him mount his horse and gallop away across the open park then i started for a solitary walk to ponder my altered prospects                                  chapter xxiv                          my first dinner party   at a quarter to eight i stood in the great hall of ravenor castle on my first visit its vastness and gloom had somewhat chilled me now it was altogether different a small army of servants in picturesque livery and with powdered hair were moving noiselessly about soft lights were burning on many brackets dispelling the deep shades which had hung somewhat drearily about and there was a fragrant perfume of flowers and a pleasant sense of warmth in the air i began to understand at once the stories i had heard of the luxury and magnificence with which mr ravenor entertained his guests on the rare occasions when he threw open his doors  mr ravenor was in his private rooms i was told and his own groom of the chambers who had been summoned to take my name ushered me after a moments hesitation into the library i walked to the fire for i was cold probably through being unused to wearing such thin clothes and standing there with my hands behind my back looked around with a feeling almost of awe at the vast collection of books with which i was surrounded  and who are you please  i started and looked in the direction from which the voicea sweet childish treblecame seated demurely in the centre of a large armchair with tumbled hair and a book upon her lap was a very young lady her clear blue eyes were fixed calmly but inquiringly upon me as though expecting an immediate answer and there was a slight frown upon her forehead altogether for such a diminutive maiden she appeared rather formidable  i didnt know that you were there i said in explanation of my start my name is mortonphilip morton  she looked me over gravely and critically and succeeded in making me feel uncomfortable apparently however the examination ended in my favour for the frown disappeared and she closed her book  philip is pretty she said condescendingly i dont think much of morton i rather like philip though  iim glad of that i answered lamely it was very ridiculous but i could think of nothing else to say i wanted to say something brilliant but it wouldnt come so i stood still and looked at her and got rather red in the face  do you know who i am she asked  havent the least idea i admitted  she leaned her small delicate head upon her hand and began swaying her feet slowly backwards and forwards  i am lady beatrice ceciliamy mother is lady silchester she said do you think it is a pretty name  very i answered biting my lip much prettier than mine  do you know i think you are a nice boy she proceeded i rather like you  im so glad i answered feeling unreasonably delighted im sure that i like you i added fervently  its very good of you to say so when youve only just seen me she remarked but you cant be quite sure you dont know anything about me you see i might be dreadfully disagreeable  but im sure youre not i answered feeling that i was getting on  she was good enough to seem pleased at my confidence but she made no further remark for a minute or two during which i racked my brains in vain for some effective remark with my eyes fixed upon her she certainly made a very charming picture curled up in the great black oak chair with the firelight playing upon her ruddy golden hair and glistening in her bright eyes  youve been reading havent you i asked pointing to the book which lay in her lap  its not a nice book at all she said decidedly i dont like any of the books here oh  i turned round quickly for i saw that she was looking behind me standing on the threshold of his inner room was the tall dark figure of mr ravenor handsomer than ever it seemed to me in his plain evening dress  slowly he advanced out of the shadows with a faint smile upon his pale face and laid his hand upon her shoulder looking first at my little hostess and then at me  so youve been entertaining one of my guests for me trixie have you he said rather late for you to be up isnt it your nurse has been looking for you everywhere  then i suppose i must go lady beatrice cecilia remarked deliberately she rose shook her hair out and replacing the book which she had been reading upon the shelf prepared to depart but first she came up to where i was standing on the hearthrug and held out her little white hand  goodnight philip morton she said looking up at me with a grave smile i am very glad that you came in here to talk to me i was so dull  i made some reciprocative speech which if it was somewhat awkwardly expressed had at least the merit of earnestness and my eyes followed her admiringly as she walked to the door and disappeared with a backward glance and a smile then i started and coloured to find that mr ravenor was watching me  i dont know why they should have brought you here he said come this way  i followed mr ravenor across the hall into a suite of rooms hung with satin opening out one from another and seeming to my inexperience like a succession of brilliantlylit fairy chambers in the smallest and most remote room three men were standing talking together and in a low chair by their side reclined lady silchester holding a dainty screen of peacock feathers between her face and the fire and listening to the conversation with a slightly bored air she was in full evening toilette and several rows of diamonds flashed and sparkled with every rise and fall of her snowwhite throat afterwards i grew to look upon lady silchester as a good type of the wellbred society woman but then she was a revelation to methe revelation of a new species  my appearance seemed at first to surprise and then slightly to discompose her but both emotions passed away at once and she welcomed me with a charming little smile as she languidly raised her hand and placed it within mine for a moment  at our entrance the conversation ceased for a moment mr ravenor laid his hand upon my shoulder and turned towards the little group  sir richard let me introduce to you a young ward of mine and a disciple of yours sir richard hibbetmr morton professor marrismr morton mr latermr morton  they all shook hands with me and widening their circle a little continued the conversation  this was interrupted presently by the announcement of dinner the professor taking in our hostess the others following mr ravenor and i bringing up the rear  there was no lack of conversation during dinner though gradually it turned towards purely literary matters and remained there to me it was altogether fascinating although it was often beyond my comprehension  long after lady silchester had departed we sat round the small table glittering with plate and finelycut glass and loaded with choice flowers and wonderful fruits and my senses were almost dazed by the brilliancy of my material surroundings and the everflowing conversation which seemed always to be teaching me something new and opening up fresh fields of thought at times i scarcely knew which most to admirethe dry pungent wit and caustic remarks of the professor the perfectly expressed classical english of mr later the sound good sense of sir richard seasoned with an apparently inexhaustible stock of anecdotes and quotations culled from all imaginable sources or the brilliant epigrams the trenchant criticisms and the occasional flashes of genuine eloquence by means of which mr ravenor with rare art continually stimulated the talk  almost unnoticed mr marx still in his morning coat with pale face and dark rims under his eyes had entered and sank wearily into a seat but although he listened with apparent interest he took no part in the war of words which was flashing around him suddenly it all came to an end mr ravenor glanced at his watch and rose  gentlemen he said i must ask you to excuse me for an hour if you care to see the library mr marx will show it you or the smokingroom and billiardroom are at your service or if you care to remain here there is plenty more of the yellowseal claret and the cigars are upon the table philip i want you  i rose and followed him towards the door as i did so i had to pass mr marx who had left his seat on some pretext he leaned over towards me haggard and pale and pushed a slip of paper into my fingers  read it at once he muttered in a quick low tone then he moved up and took mr ravenors place at the head of the table  i felt inclined to throw it back to him but i did not passing across the hall i unfolded it and read these few words scrawled in a large shaking hand  you must not go to dr randalls mr ravenor will give you a choice go anywhere but there if you neglect this warning you will repent it all your life i swear it tear this up                                   chapter xxv                           mr marxs warning   my first impulse on glancing through mr marxs brief note was to show it to mr ravenor but after a seconds consideration i changed my mind mr marx was a complete mystery to me at times it seemed possible that the interest which he undoubtedly showed in me was genuine and kindly and i struggled against my dislike of the man then i remembered his brutal conduct to the lunatic and the other inexplicable parts of his behaviour and the darkest suspicions and doubts began to take shape in my imagination  there was something altogether mysterious about himhis connection with mr ravenor and his manner towards myself i was puzzled and more than half inclined to decide against the man whom personally i had grown to detest but on the other hand i was young and still an optimist with regard to my fellowmen  what harm had i done mr marx and why should he seek to injure me it seemed improbable almost ridiculous so in the end a certain sense of fairness induced me to respect his postscript and i said nothing to mr ravenor about his secretarys warning  my interview with him was a very short one indeed he led the way into the study in which i had first seen him and closing the door turned round and faced me upon the hearthrug the room was dimly lit but where he stood the fastdying fire cast a faint glow around his tall straight figure and showed me a face cold and resolute as marble but not unkind  philip morton he said slowly it has occurred to me that in wishing you to go to lincolnshire i may have been influenced to a certain extent by selfish considerations if you have the slightest preference for a public school  i knew instinctively whence that idea had come and i interrupted him  nothing should induce me to go anywhere else but to dr randalls i exclaimed firmly  in that case he continued i wish you to leave tomorrow you will be ready  i assented at once  i too am leaving hereit may be for a very long while he went on in two months time i hope to start for persia and between now and then my movements will be uncertain i cannot settle down here it is useless  a great weariness shone out of his dark blue eyes and he stifled a sigh some thought or memory coloured with regret had flashed across his mind but what it was i could not tell  you remember your mothers letter to you and her dying request he continued in a changed tone i cannot explain it now although i must remind you of it this packetand he passed me a large sealed envelopecontains a chequebook the address of the lawyer who will manage your affairs and a letter which you will not open unless you have certain news and proof of my death you will find that you are comparatively speaking rich how this comes about i cannot tell you now and you must remember your mothers dying injunction not to seek to find out until the time comes when you will know everything at present i can only assure you that the money is yours by right that it is not a gift and that no one else has any claim to it that is all i can say upon the subject are you satisfied  curiosity seemed a mean thing to me as i listened to my guardians words and looked into his sad stern face all the old fascination which i had felt from the first in his presence was strong upon me that night whatever he had bidden me to do i should have done it and so i answered  i am satisfied what you tell me is mine i will take and ask no questions  that is well he said quietly and now one word about your future philip for tomorrow you will take up some of the responsibilities of early manhood a great man once said that the best adviser of youth was the man whose own life had been a failure if this be anything more than a paradox then there can be no one better fitted for that post than i already the flavour of life has become like dead ashes between my teeth and the fault is my own mr marris was talking a great deal of nonsense in the drawingroom before dinner this evening i want to say just one or two words to you on the same subject and remember that i speak as an outsider impersonally  before i was twentyone years old i had studied in most of the schools of modern philosophy and had thrown off my religion like an old rag i was inflated with a sense of my own intellectual superiority over other men it was philosophy which taught men to live i declared and philosophy which taught them to die with that motto before me i carefully set myself to annihilate every vestige of faith with which i had ever been endowed i succeededtoo well it is dead and sometimes i fear that it will never reawaken and what am i as miserable a man as ever drew breath upon this earth it seems to me as though i had crushed a part of my very life and the sore will rankle for ever  there is a part of mans nature philipthat is to say of such men as i have been and you will bethe sympathetic emotional reverential part which cries out for some belief in a higher an infinite power for some sort of religion which it can cling to and entwine with every action of daily life you must satisfy that craving if you desire to know happiness for me there is no such knowledge i have deliberately committed spiritual suicide i have torn up faith by the roots and have made a void in my heart which nothing else can ever fill frankly i tell you philip that there are times when religion of any sort seems to me no better than a fairytale it need not seem so to you shape out for yourself any form of beliefthat of the christian is as good as any otherand resolutely cling to it it is my advice to youmine who believe in no god and no future state follow it and farewell  he held out his hand and clasped mine for a moment i would have spoken but before i could find words he had disappeared through a curtained door into his inner apartment so i turned away and went                                  chapter xxvi                            a lost photograph   it was about five oclock on as dreary an afternoon as i ever remember when the slow train which crawls always at a most miserable pace from peterborough across the eastern counties deposited me at little drayton besides the stationmaster there were but two people on the wet platformone a porter who made for my bags with almost wolflike alacrity after a moments amazed stare at me presumably at the rare advent of a passenger with luggage the other was a thin dark young man clad in a light mackintosh with very large checks and smoking a long cigar whilst i was collecting my things he came leisurely up and accosted me  your name morton he inquired without removing his cigar from his teeth  i assented  have you come down to meet me i asked  yes old randalls gone out to dinner so he asked cis and me to come and fetch you carts outside but we cant take all the luggage just look out what you want will you and well send for the rest tomorrow  i selected a portmanteau and followed him out of the station a light fourwheeled brown cart was waiting drawn by a pair of small cleverlooking cobs altogether a very smart turnout  pitch that bag in behind porter ordered my new acquaintance now then mr morton if youre ready well be off your trains half an hour late and cis will be wondering whats become of us  is cis mr ravenors nephew silchester i asked as i clambered up beside him  oh yes by the bye i ought to have introduced myself oughtnt i my name is de cartienneleonard de cartienne  and are you dr randalls other pupil i inquired  yes im doing a grind there beastly slow it is too youll be sorry youve come i can tell you before very long  looking around me i was inclined to think that that was not improbable it was too dark to see far but what i could see was anything but promising the country was perfectly flat dreary and barren and the view was unbroken by tree or hedge or hill by the side of the road was a small canal over the sullen waters of which and across the road brooded spectrallike clouds of mist the rain still fell rapidly and the wheels of our cart ran noiselessly in the sandy pastelike mud  ghastly night isnt it remarked my companion breaking the silence again  rather i assented vigorously what a flat ugly country too i never saw anything like it  beastly country beastly place altogether de cartienne agreed im jolly sick of it i can tell you steady brandy steady sir giving the near animal a cut with the whip  what do you call your horses i asked curiously  brandy and soda jolly neat name for a pair dont you think so  uncommon at any rate i answered ambiguously didnt you say that we were to call for silchester somewhere  mean cis oh yes weve got to pick him up at the rose and crown  a hotel  well hardly fact is de cartienne continued dropping his voice a little and glancing behind to see whether the groom was listeningfact is cis is a bit inclined to make a fool of himself theres a pretty girl at this place and he puts in an uncommon lot of time there awfully pretty girl she is really he added confidentially wont stand any nonsense either the place is only a pub after all but everyone who goes there has to behave himself she wont have a lot of fellows dangling about after her though she might have the whole town if she liked makes her all the more dangerous i think  and lord silchester  hang the lord interrupted my companion whipping his horses  well silchester then i suppose he admires her very much  admires her i should think he does hes awful spoons on her its quite sickening the way they go on sometimes theres a regular stew on there tonight though tremendous scene  what about  well it seems that millys fatherhes the landlord of the place you knowleft home about a month ago saying he was going up to london on some business he was expected back in a fortnight or three weeks but hes never turned up and he hasnt written so at last milly sent up to the place where he always stops in town and also to some friends whom he was going to see this morning a reply comes from both of them nothing has been seen or heard of him at all of course milly imagines the worst at once goes off into hysterics and when we called this evening on our way down was half out of her mind  and so silchester stopped with her to console her  exactly assented de cartienne with a queer smile shouldnt wonder if he succeeded either  we entered the street of an oldfashioned straggling town the glimmering lights of which had been in sight for some time de cartienne sitting forward a little devoted his whole attention to the horses for the stones were wet and slippery and brandy seemed to shy at everything and anything which presented itself from the little pools of water glistening in the lamplight which lay in the hollows of the road down to his own shadow i looked round curiously the oldfashioned marketplace the quaintly built houses the dimly lit shops and little knots of gaping rustics whom our rapid approach scattered right and left were at any rate more interesting and pleasanter to look upon than the damp miserable country outside suddenly we pulled up with a jerk outside a small but cleanlooking inn and the groom leaped down from behind and made his way to the horses heads  take them up the street a little john said de cartienne as he descended no need to advertise ciss folly to the whole town he added in a lower tone come on morton well go and rout him out  i stepped across the wet pavement after him and stooping low down crossed the threshold of the rose and crown we passed by a room in which several labouring men were drinking mugs of beer and entered the bar in which a rosycheeked country damsel was exchanging noisy and not too choice badinage with one or two young men who hung about her from here another door led into an inner room and at this de cartienne somewhat ostentatiously knocked there was a seconds pause then a clear pleasant voice sang out come in and we entered  it was a small cosy room not illfurnished and with a cheerful fire burning in the grate leaning against the mantelpiece with his face towards us was cis whose likeness to lady beatrice was so remarkable that i liked him heartily before we had exchanged a word standing by his side with her head suspiciously near his shoulder was a very fair girl with nice figure and complexion and large blue eyes her face was certainly pretty but it was not of a very high type of prettiness the features although regular of their sort were not in any way refined or spirituelle nor was there anything in her expression to redeem her from the mediocrity of good looks  still she was undoubtedly a nicelooking girl quite pretty enough to be the belle of a country place and on the whole i was rather relieved to find her attractions of so ordinary a kind there could scarcely be anything dangerous i thought in this goodhumoured dolls face she did not appear to have the daring or character to lead her boyish admirer over the borders of a spooning sentimentality at any rate that was not written in her face a blunt physiognomist would probably have declared that there was not enough of the devil in her to fire the blood even of an impetuous generous boy and urge him on to recklessness it seemed so to me and i was glad of it  just at present there were traces of tears in her face and a generally woebegone expression her companion too looked upset and sympathetic but he glanced up with a bright smile when we entered  youre philip morton i suppose he exclaimed holding out his hand glad to see you heard of you from my uncle you know i shook hands with him and he introduced me formally to the young woman at his side calling her miss hart then he turned to me again  i quite meant to have been at the station to meet you he said but we called here first and ii was detained  its of no consequence at all i assured him mr de cartienne was there  and mr de cartienne having had to wait half an hour in the rain at that infernal old shed they call a station requires a little refreshment chimed in the person named will the fair millicent condescend or shall i ring  she rose and crossing the room opened the door into the bar  brandyandsoda for me ordered de cartienne cis is drinking whisky i see so hell have another one and well have a large bottle of apollinaris between us morton whatll you have  i decided upon claret and hot water never having tasted spirits de cartienne made a wry face but ordered it without remark  i say morton i dont know what youll think of us shacking about in a publichouse like this and bringing you here your first night too exclaimed silchester dragging his chair up to mine bad form isnt it but it is so dull in the evenings and millys no end of a nice girl no one could help liking her besides shes in dreadful trouble just now he continued dropping his voice her father has disappeared suddenly awfully mysterious affair and no mistake we cant make head or tail of it  it is uncommonly queer admitted de cartienne who was lounging against the wall beside us i should have said that hed gone off on the spree somewhere but he couldnt have kept it up so long as this  besides hed only a few pounds with him cecil remarked  seems almost as though hed come to grief in some way i said  i darent tell milly but i dont know what else to think cecil acknowledged  a wild idea flashed for a moment into my mind only to die away again almost as rapidly it was too utterly improbable nevertheless i asked cecil a question with some curiosity  what sort of looking man was he  cecil and de cartienne both began to describe him at once and as de cartienne modified or contradicted everything cecil said i was soon in a state of complete bewilderment as to the personality of the missing man it seemed that he was short and of medium height that he was fair and inclined to be dark stout and thin pale and ruddy milly put in a word or two now and then and what with de cartienne dissenting from everything she said and cecil a little perplexed siding first with one and then with the other the description naturally failed to carry to my mind the slightest impression of mr harts appearance at last rather impatiently i stopped them  im afraid i am guilty of a somewhat unreasonable curiosity i said for i havent any real reason for asking but havent you a photograph of your father miss hart i cant follow the description at all  i happened to be looking towards de cartienne while i made my request and suddenly from no apparent cause i saw him start and a strange look came into his face at first i thought he must be ill but seeing my eyes fixed upon him he seemed to recover himself instantly though he was still deadly pale  why what the mischief are you staring at morton asked cecil  oh nothing i answered i thought that de cartienne was ill thats all  cecil glanced at him curiously  by george he does look rather white about the gills doesnt he say old chap are you ill  de cartienne shook his head  oh its nothing he said carelessly dont all stare at me as though i were some sort of natural curiosity please i feel a bit queer but its passing off i think if miss milly will allow me ill go and sit down in the other room by myself for a few minutes  ill come with you exclaimed cecil springing up poor old chap  no dont please protested de cartienne i would rather be alone i would indeed i shall be all right directly  he quitted the room by another door and we three were left alone cecil and miss milly began a conversation in a low tone and i feeling somewhat de trop took up a local newspaper and affected to be engaged in its contents after a few minutes however cecil remembered my existence  by the bye milly he said morton was asking you whether you had not a photograph of your father theres one in the sittingroom isnt there  she nodded  well well go and look at it and see how leonard is he looked uncommonly seedy didnt he come along morton  we crossed a narrow passage and entered a small parlour miss hart walked up to the mantelpiece and cecil and i remained looking round  hallo he exclaimed leonard isnt here i wonder where  he was interrupted by a cry of blank surprise from miss hart  whats the matter now how you startled me milly he exclaimed hurrying to her side what is it  why the photograph  what about it  its gone                                  chapter xxvii                          leonard de cartienne   we all three stood and looked at one another for a moment milly hart with her finger still pointing to the vacant place where the photograph had been then cecil broke into a short laugh  were looking very tragical about it he said lightly mysterious joint disappearance of leonard de cartienne and a photograph of mr hart now if it had been a photograph of a pretty girl instead of a middleaged man we might have connected the two hallo  he broke off in his speech and turned round standing in the doorway looking at us was leonard de cartienne with a slight smile on his thin lips  behold the missing linki mean man exclaimed cecil good old leonard do you know you gave us quite a fright we expected to find you here and the room was empty are you better  yes thanks im all right now he answered ive been out in the yard and had a blow whats milly looking so scared about and what was it i heard you say about a photograph  fathers likeness has gone she explained turning round with tears in her eyes it was there on the mantelpiece this afternoon and now when we came in to look at it it has gone  i should think that if it really has disappeared de cartienne remarked incredulously the servant must have moved it ask her  miss hart rang the bell and in the meantime we looked about the room it was all in vain we could find no trace of it nor could the servant who answered the summons give us any information she had seen it in its usual place early in the morning when she had been dusting since then she had not entered the room  deuced queer thing declared cecil when at last we had relinquished the search deuced queer he repeated meditatively with his hands thrust deep down in his trousers pockets and his eyes resting idly upon de cartiennes face but we cant do anything more thats certain we really must be off milly weve been here almost an hour already and brandy and soda must be getting restless and you must be famished im sure morton come along goodbye milly keep your spirits up old girl the governorll be bound to turn up again in a day or two and dont you worry about the photograph it must be somewhere  but it isnt she declared tearfully weve looked everywhere oh what shall i do  cecil assumed a most lugubrious expression and looked down sympathetically into her tearstained face she certainly was uncommonly pretty  you go on you fellows he said ill be out in a minute ill drive leonard dont think youre quite up to it  de cartienne nudged my arm and we went off together and made our way up the street to the inn under the covered archway of which the trap was drawn up in a few minutes cecil joined us  hope i havent kept you waiting he said as he lighted a cigarette and clambered up to the boxseat no you come in front morton thats right very odd about that photograph isnt it its gone and no mistake weve been having another look round  nonsense exclaimed de cartienne impatiently what a fuss about a trifle a girl has no memory at all i expect she moved it herself bet you it turns up by the morning  i think not cecil replied quietly as he gathered up the reins now then hold on behind  we rattled off down the street and out into the open country again at a pace which precluded any conversation the low hedges and stunted trees by the roadside seemed to fly past us and a sudden turn which almost jerked me from my seat brought us in sight of a wide semicircle of twinkling lights which seemed to stretch right across the horizon  what are they i asked pointing forward  those oh fishingsmacks answered cecil  is that the sea then i asked eagerly  he burst out laughing  why what else do you suppose it is he exclaimed cant you hear it  i bent my head and listened the faint night breeze was just sufficient to carry to our ears the dull monotonous roar of an incoming tide  not a very cheerful row is it observed cecil  cheerful i call it the most infernally miserable sound i ever heard growled de cartienne from the back seat enough to give a fellow the horrors any day  see that bright light close ahead said cecil pointing with his whip thats borden tower where we hang out you know we shall be there in a minute or two  perhaps growled de cartienne from behind making a nervous clutch at the side of the trap cis my dear fellow youre not driving a fireengine and theres nothing to be gained by this confounded hurry george i was nearly out that time  we had turned round a sharp corner into a winding drive devoid of trees and planted only with stunted shrubs on one side between us and the shore was a long irregular plantation of small fir trees through which the night wind was moaning with a sound not unlike the more distant roar of the sea directly in front loomed a high dark building standing out with almost startling abruptness against a void of sky and moor  here we are exclaimed cecil pulling up with a flourish before the front entrance john help down the poor nervous invalid behind and take brandy and soda round to the stable at once theyre too hot to stand still in this damp air a second  we passed across a large but somewhat dreary hall into a warm comfortable diningroom a bright fire was blazing in the grate and a table in the centre of the room was very tastefully laid for dinner  make yourself at home morton exclaimed cecil standing on the hearthrug and stretching out a numbed hand to the blaze draw an easychair up to the fire while james unpacks your traps and sees to your room leonard ring the bell theres a good fellow and let them know were ready for dinner  thanks i think ill go upstairs at once i remarked  all right heres james hell show you your room one servant between three of us now good old james i say morton no swallowtails you know  i nodded and followed the man who was waiting in the doorway to my room  after my barefloored lowceilinged attic at the farm the apartment into which i was ushered seemed a very temple of luxury there was a soft carpet upon the floor many easy chairs an oriental divan mirrors and solid handsomely carved furniture leading out of it on one side was a bathroom and on the other a small cosy sittingroom or study  is there anything more i can do for you sir inquired the man after he had poured out my hot water and set out the contents of my portmanteau  i shook my head and dismissed him after a very brief toilet i hastened downstairs  the dinner was remarkably good and i was very hungry but i found time to notice two things the first was that cecil drank a great deal more wine than at his age was good for him and the second that de cartienne who drank very little himself concealed that fact as far as he was able and passed the bottle continually to cecil this did not much surprise me for i had already formed my own opinion of de cartienne  after dinner the man who waited upon us brought in some coffee and withdrew cecil whose cheeks were a little flushed and whose eyes were sparkling with more than ordinary brightness rose and stretched himself  i say leonard he exclaimed lets adjourn to your room and have a hand at cards shall we  de cartienne shrugged his shoulders but did not offer to move  im not particularly keen on cards tonight he remarked with a yawn i believe if you had your own way youd play from morning to night  oh hang it all theres nothing else to be done cecil answered if we stay down here we cant smoke and we shall have old grumps back bothering presently  i forgot we couldnt smoke de cartienne said rising come along then  you dont mind morton do you cecil asked turning towards me its awfully cosy up in lens room  certainly not i answered finishing my coffee ill come but i cant play  oh that doesnt matter you can watch us for a bit and youll soon pick it up hi james cecil sang out as that worthy showed himself at the door for a minute bring us up some whisky and half a dozen bottles of seltzer water into mr de cartiennes room will you look sharp theres a good fellow  de cartiennes rooms especially his study were furnished far more luxuriously than mine and in excellent taste the walls and chimneypiece were covered with charming little sketches a few foreign prints photographs and dainty little trifles of bricabrac except for the photographs some of which were a little risque it was more like a ladys boudoir than a mans sittingroom  de cartienne and cecil seated themselves at a small round table and began to play almost immediately i drew an easy chair up to the fire and closed my eyes as though i intended going to sleep as a matter of fact i meant to watch the game and closely too but fate decided otherwise i was really very sleepy and though i struggled against it i was obliged to yield in the end i fell asleep and it must have been nearly two hours before i was awakened by a touch on my arm  wake up morton old chap its time we were off to our rooms  i sat up and looked at my watch it was past midnight  cecil was leaning against the table with his hands in his pockets looking pale and weary but exultant  ive been in rare luck tonight he exclaimed won a couple of ponies from poor old len and a whole hatful of i o us here they go and he swept a little pile of crumpled papers into the fire  i glanced at de cartienne to see how losing had affected him not in the ordinary way at any rate he was sitting back in his chair with his arms crossed a cigarette between his teeth and an inscrutable smile upon his thin lips somehow i did not like his expression there was something a little too closely approaching contempt in it as he watched cecils action and listened to the exultant ring in his tonesomething which seemed to express a latent power to reverse the result with ease at any time he thought proper  it was rushing to conclusions no doubt but as i glanced from cecils boyish handsome face a trifle dissipated just now but open and candid to the pale sallow countenance the large black eyes and cynical callous expression of his friend it seemed to me that i was looking from the face of the tempted to the face of the tempter the one seemed like the evil genius of the other                                 chapter xxviii                             as rome does   i awoke on the following morning with that vague peculiar sense of having entered upon an altogether new phase of life by degrees my semisomnolent faculties reasserted themselves and i remembered where i was my new life had indeed begun in earnest  i sprang out of bed and pulled up the blind it was a very strange prospect i looked out upon after the luxuriant hilly scenery of the home where i had lived all my life before me was a flat uncultivated common dotted here and there with a few stunted gorsebushes and numerous sandheaps farther away a long stretch of shingle sloped down to the foamcrested sea which under the grey sunless sky of the early winters morning had a dull forbidding appearance though it was not an inviting prospect there was something attractive in its novelty and dropping the blind i hastened into the bathroom and began dressing  it was past eight oclock when i got downstairs but i saw no one about so i let myself out by the front door and walked down the drive the grounds were small and soon explored and having exhausted them i passed through a wicketgate into a little plantation of pinetrees and thence out on to the common then for the first time in my life i felt a strong seabreeze and with my cap in my hand and my face turned seawards i stood for a few moments thoroughly enjoying it  glad to see that youre an early riser mr morton its a habit which im sorry to say my other pupils have not acquired  i turned round with a start a tall thin man somewhat past middle age with irongrey hair and thin regular features was standing by my side his eyes were the eyes of a visionary and a poet and his worn thoughtful face bore the unmistakable stamp of the student i liked his appearance careless and dishevelled though it was in point of attire and knowing that this must be dr randall i felt a keen sense of relief  for bearing in mind the evident habits and last nights occupation of silchester and de cartienne i had begun to wonder somewhat apprehensively what manner of man the master of such pupils might be now i felt sure that the idea which had first occurred to me had been the correct one and that the doings of the night before were carried on altogether under the rose the man james had all the appearance of a servant whom it would be easy to bribe this without doubt had been done  perhaps they havent lived all their lives in the country sir as i have i answered i have always been used to getting up early  so you are my new pupil he said well mr morton im very pleased to see you and i have an idea that we shall get on very well together i was going to walk down to the sea will you come with me  i followed him along the tortuous path to the shore and on the way he questioned me about my acquirements putting me through a sort of vivâvoce examination the result of which appeared to satisfy him  this is quite a pleasant surprise to me he said as we turned back to the house you are almost as advanced as de cartienne and far more so than silchester i suppose you mean to matriculate  i told him that i thought so but he scarcely seemed to hear apparently his mind had wandered to some other subject and for nearly a quarter of an hour he remained absorbed i learned afterwards that this was a habit of his  with a start he came to himself and apologising for his absentmindedness led the way back to the house and into the breakfastroom the cloth was laid for four and the urn was hissing upon the table but there was no one else down  is neither lord silchester nor mr de cartienne up yet james inquired dr randall  james believed not but would ascertain in a few moments he returned  lord silchester desires me to say that he was reading late last night sir and has overslept himself but he will be down as soon as possible james announced solemnly  remembering that james had been in attendance upon us in de cartiennes rooms last night i thought that this was rather cool but it was no concern of mine and i held my peace  dr randall frowned slightly and looked vexed  it appears to me that silchester does most of his reading at night he remarked i could wish that the results of it were a little more apparent and mr de cartienne james has he overslept himself too  mr de cartienne will be here immediately sir the man announced  we began breakfast when we were about halfway through the meal the door opened and de cartienne appeared he cast an apprehensive glance at me and then seeing that dr randall greeted him as usual looked relieved  presently the doctor left the table bidding us join him in the study in half an hour directly the door had closed de cartienne leaned back in his chair and laughed softly to himself  whatever made you get up so early he asked looking at me curiously gave me quite a turn when i heard that you were down and alone with grumps and cis was in an awful funk we were afraid that you might let out something about last nightaccidentally of course and then there would have been the deuce to pay and no mistake james take my plate and bring me a brandyandsoda take care the doctor doesnt see you  whose servant is james i asked as he disappearedyours or the doctors  the doctor imagines that hes his i suppose but he gets a lot more from cis and me than grumps pays him de cartienne explained carelessly i knew him before he came here and got him to apply for the situation by promising to double his wages  and the advantages i asked  obvious enough i should think youve seen some of them already and youll see some more before youve been here long  i daresay perhaps it would be as well for me to tell you de cartienne that what i have seen i dont like  very likely not he answered carelessly i thought directly i saw you that you were a bit of a prigi beg your pardon i should say rather straitlaced still i dont suppose youll think it worth your while to interfere you can go your way and cis and i can go ours  that would make it a little dull for me i said slowly perhaps i am not quite so straitlaced as you seem to think i suppose you would teach me how to play cards if i desired to learn  oh certainly and how to use this also he remarked drawing a latchkey from his pocket and swinging it carelessly backwards and forwards  i think i will learn then i answered after all this place would be ghastly dull if i didnt do as you fellows do  he looked at me searchingly out of his keen dark eyes but i sipped my coffee leisurely and seemed to be quite unconscious of his scrutiny apparently he was satisfied for i saw the hard lines of his mouth relax a little and he smileda disagreeable smile of contemptuous triumph  ive no doubt youll prove an apt pupil he remarked have you finished if so well go and have a cigarette in my room before we start work with grumps  does the doctor allow smoking i asked  to tell you the truth morton weve never asked him what the eye doesnt see the heart doesnt grieve over you know we go on that principle and smoke in our rooms with the doors shut and windows open come along                                  chapter xxix                         a dinnerparty sub rosa   in less than a weeks time i was master of the state of affairs at borden tower dr randall with the best possible intentions was the worst possible man that could have been chosen for the guardianship of two such pupils as lord silchester and leonard de cartienne he was a scholar and a pedant utterly unsuspicious and ignorant of the ways of the world himself so truthful and honourable that he could scarcely have imagined deceit possible in others and certainly not in his own wards of the servants james and his wife were the only ones in authority and they were the tools of de cartienne  the latter i could not quite understand the only thing about him perfectly clear was that he was just the worst companion possible for silchester for the rest he was so clever that his presence here at all as a pupil seemed unnecessary he appeared to be rich and he took a deep interest of some sort in cecil seemingly it was a friendly interest but of that i did not feel assured at any rate it was an injurious association for cecil and i determined to do everything in my power to counteract it  to strike at once to attempt to show him the folly of the courses into which he was being led i saw would be futile i must have time and opportunity any violent measures in such a case would be worse than useless my only course obnoxious though it was was to join them in their pursuits and try to gain some sort of influence over cecil while i kept him as far as possible from falling into further mischief  accordingly on the first evening after my arrival at borden tower i was initiated into the mysteries of poker and prussian bank and on subsequent occasions i either joined them or looked on the result in the main was pretty much as i had expected de cartienne won always when the stakes were very large and lord silchester when they were scarcely worth having  the earlier part of the day was by far the pleasanter to me in the morning we worked with dr randall in the afternoon we always walked or rodein either case a visit to the rose and crown was an invariable part of the programmeand in the evening after dinner we were supposed to read until ten oclock although the manner in which we really spent that portion of the day was far less profitable  i had intended paying a special visit to miss milly hart on my own account but either by accident or designat the time i was not sure whichde cartienne always seemed to frustrate my plans even to myself i would not acknowledge that i had any other motive save pure curiosity but i was still determined by some means or other to see a photograph of the missing mr hart the strange disappearance of the one in the sittingroom at the innit had never been foundpuzzled me and whenever i caught myself thinking of the incident it was always in connection with leonard de cartienne it seemed very absurd when i considered the matter calmly but nevertheless i could not escape from it it haunted me as ideas sometimes will  one afternoon about two months after my arrival at borden towers cecil and i were reading together in the studyor rather i was endeavouring to encourage one of his rare fits of industry by helping him through a stiff page of livywhen the door opened suddenly and de cartienne entered with an open telegram in his hand seeing me he stopped short and frowned  hallo len whats up cecil exclaimed what have you got there a telegram  de cartienne nodded and after a moments hesitation handed it over  its from fothergill he explained he is coming over tonight and wants us to dine with him  should like to awfully cecil said but i dont see how we can old grumps wouldnt let us go of course and i dont see how we can manage it without his knowing  dont you well i do de cartienne remarked drily grumps is going over to belscombe this evening to take the chair at the literary society there hell have to dine at six and leave at a quarter to seven i know that because i heard him give his orders that will leave us plenty of time to get down into the town by eight oclock and we shall be all right for coming back of course  thats capital declared cecil shutting up his livy with a bang we will have our revenge on old fothergill tonight just what ive been looking forward to  de cartienne shrugged his shoulders  well i dont know he said slowly i fancy fothergill is a bit too good for us i shant be very keen on cards tonight i can tell you i lost more money than i cared about last time he was here  cecil laughed carelessly  you didnt lose as much as i did he remarked but then fothergill had all the luck i never remember such a run of trumps as he held in that last deal and you played villainously you knowgave him no end of tricks  the very faintest suspicion of a smilean evil smile it wastrembled on de cartiennes lips and he turned away towards the window as though to hide it  i wasnt in very good form that night he acknowledged i must make up for it tonight if we can get fothergill to give us our revenge  cecil drummed upon the table with his fingers and raised his eyebrows slightly  he cant very well refuse if we ask for it can he  i suppose not de cartienne answered lounging across the room towards the door ill go and see james and let him know that we shall want the latchkey  all right and i say len cecil continued we must take morton with us of course  de cartienne turned round with an angry frown upon his dark face  i scarcely see how that would be possible he said stiffly i think it would be taking rather a liberty with fothergill he only asks us two  in other circumstances i should promptly have refused to be one of the party especially as the invitation appeared to come from a friend of de cartiennes but the darkening shade which i had seen flash across de cartiennes face reawakened all my suspicions with regard to him and i instantly determined that by some means or other i would go his evident reluctance to invite me only strengthened my intention so although he looked at me as if expecting to hear me express my indifference as to whether i went or not i purposely refrained from doing anything of the sort  oh thats all rot cecil protested we cant go off and leave morton boxed up here by himself  i dont suppose morton would care much about it said de cartienne sullenly  on the contrary i should enjoy it very much indeed i interposed although of course i dont wish to go if you think that your friend would object i added blandly its rather dull here by oneself  of course it is morton old chap you shall go with us never fear cecil declared vigorously tell you what len if you wont do the agreeable and make things right with fothergillas you can if you like of coursei shant go so there which is it to beboth or neither  both of course de cartienne answered with as good grace as possible i shouldnt have thought morton would have cared about it thats all be ready punctually at halfpast seven you men  all right exclaimed cecil delighted at getting his own way for a change good old len morton pitch that beastly livy into the drawer and come and change your things well have some fun tonight                                   chapter xxx                       ecartÉ with mr fothergill   at a little before eight oclock de cartienne cecil and i presented ourselves at the bar of the bull hotel and inquired for mr fothergill we were shown at once by a waiter into a small private sittingroom brilliantly illuminated and unmistakably cosy under the chandelier was a small round table glittering with plate and flowers and standing upon the hearthrug critically surveying it was a middleaged dapperlooking little man in wellcut evening clothes with a white camellia in his buttonhole  his hair was slightly tinged with grey but his moustache was still jetblack and elaborately curled and waxed his forehead was low and his full red lips and slightly hooked nose gave him something of a jewish appearance he had just missed being handsome and similarly had just missed being good form at least so it seemed to me from my first rapid survey and i did not afterwards change my opinion  directly we entered the room he moved forward to meet us with a smile which revealed a very fine set of teeth i watched him closely as he noted the addition to the party but he betrayed no surprise or annoyance on the contrary when cecil had introduced me as his friend and fellowpupil at borden tower he welcomed me with a courtesy which was a little effusive on the whole i decided that his manners were in his favour  there was some casual conversation an explanation rather more elaborate than seemed to me necessary of his flying visit to little drayton and then dinner was announced everything had evidently been carefully ordered and prepared and was of the best mr fothergill whatever his shortcomings made a capital host and his talk though a trifle slangy and coarse at times was amusing in the extreme altogether the dinner was a success in every respect save one for four men two of whom were under twenty there was a great deal too much wine drunk  i think i scarcely noticed it until the cloth was removed and dessert placed upon the table then a curious sense of exhilaration in my own spirits warned me to be careful and i looked round at once at the others  cecil sat directly opposite to me and i saw at a glance how it was with him his hair which he always kept rather long but carefully parted was disarranged and untidy his neat tie had become crumpled and had slipped up on one side his eyes were sparkling as though with some unusual excitement and there was a glow of colour in his cheeks almost hectic in its intensity  at the head of the table our host was still smiling and debonair looking as though he had been drinking nothing stronger than water and opposite to him de cartienne was leaning back in his chair with a faint tinge of colour in his olive cheeks and a peculiar glitter in his dark eyes which was anything but pleasant to look upon altogether the appearance of the trio was like a cold douche to me and brought me swiftly back to my former watchfulness i felt instinctively there was mischief brewing  i say fothergill lets have a hand at cards cecil exclaimed breaking a momentary silence you owe us a revenge you know george didnt you clean us out last time we played well clean you out tonight hanged if we wont what shall it be  mr fothergill shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly  cardscards its always cards he answered lightly cant you think of something else to do  yes hang cards muttered de cartienne  all right im agreeable but what the mischief else is there to do in this dull hole asked cecil discontentedly  oh lets have a chat and a few more glasses of wine suggested mr fothergill im so lucky that i hate to play at cards i always win  do you remarked cecil a little pettishly well look here fothergill ill play you at any game you like tonight and beat youso there i challenge you you owe me a revenge i want it  mr fothergill looked a little bored  of course if you put it in that way he said you leave me no alternative but mind i warn you beforehand silchester im bound to win i dont want to win your moneyi had enough last time i was herebut if we play i shall win whether i care about it or not im in a tremendous vein of luck just now  well see about that cecil answered doggedly lets ring for some cards  or rather dont lets play here at all interrupted de cartienne the people are awfully oldfashioned and particular and may want to turn as out at eleven oclock  by george well go round to the rose and crown exclaimed cecil i havent been there for two days its a decent little place and we can do what we like there he added turning to mr fothergill you dont mind do you  not the least in the world declared our host rising and stretching himself any place will do for me the sooner the better if we are going though i dont want to be particularly late  we all rose despatched the waiter for our overcoats and sallied out into the cool night air after the heated atmosphere of the room in which we had been dining the wintry breeze came as a sudden swift tonic at the corner of the street looking seaward cecil and i stopped simultaneously and bared our heads  by george how delicious a walk would be he exclaimed fanning himself with his cap i say phil old chap suppose we bolt and do the seashore as far as litton bay  a splendid idea i exclaimed taking him at his word and linking his arm in mine lets do it  he burst out laughing  why phil you know we cant he said i was only joking why what on earth would fothergill think of us serving him such a trick as that  oh hang fothergill i cried he only wants to win your money i wouldnt play with the fellow if i were you cecil cant you see hes a cad  he looked at me confounded  why hang it all he said how can you refuse to play with a man after youve eaten his dinner besides cant you see that it isnt he who wants to play at all it was i who proposed it and even then he wasnt keen  all beastly cunning i muttered angrily but i could say no more for de cartienne and mr fothergill had retraced their steps to look for us and cecil had started off towards them  in a few moments we reached the rose and crown and walked straight into the little parlour at the back miss milly was sitting there by herself in semidarkness with a very disconsolate face she brightened up however at our entrance  all by yourself milly exclaimed cecil letting go my arm and moving to her side in tears too i believe no news i suppose  she shook her head sadly  none i have almost lost hope she added  then she glanced questioningly at mr fothergill and cecil introduced him in an informal sort of way and explained our visit  weve come to drink up all your wine and have a quiet game at cards instead of staying all the evening at the bull you can put us in the sittingroom out of the way cant you  oh yes she answered eagerly how good of you to come here weve been dreadfully quiet the last few daysscarcely anyone in at all and i have been so dull come this way please im so glad i had the fire lit  she led us into the little sittingroom where we had gone to look for mr harts photograph on my first visit to the place i pointed to the spot where it had been  you havent found the portrait yet i remarked  she shook her head and looked distressed  please dont talk about it she said it seems as though it must have been spirited away and it makes me feel uncomfortable even to think about it  we seated ourselves around the table and mr fothergill producing two packs of cards from his pocket began to deal at the end of an hour cecil had won nearly fifty pounds i was as i had started and de cartienne and mr fothergill were about equal losers  im getting sick of this i declared leave me out of this deal will you  they assented and i crossed the room to where milly was sitting pretending to examine the fancywork upon which she was engaged i bent close over her  miss milly i want to ask you a question without letting the others hear i said softly do you understand  she nodded her large blue eyes upturned to mine were filled with innocent wonder  i glanced towards the table as i had expected de cartienne was watching us and i could see that he was straining every nerve to overhear our conversation  i think im about tired of it too he exclaimed suddenly throwing down his cards and rising but cecil laid his hand on his shoulder and forced him down  nonsense man you must play out your hand at any rate then you may leave off as soon as you like  de cartienne resumed his seat with evident reluctance i bent over milly again  has anyone else one of those photographs of your father i asked is there anyone from whom you could borrow one  she shook her head and looked towards the empty frame  that was the only one she answered  where did he have them taken  at lawrences just across the way  and when  about nine months ago i think it was why do you ask mr morton she added anxiously  i will tell you another time i answered in a low tone  i glanced towards the table as i said this and was just in time to see de cartienne bend over towards cecil and whisper something in his ear the latter looked round at us at once  you two seem to have found something interesting to talk about he remarked glancing towards milly as though requiring an explanation  we havent she answered with a sigh  mr morton was just asking me oh mr morton youre treading on my foot  i withdrew my foot and tried the effect of a warning glance but it was of no avail  mr morton was asking me she continued whether i had not another of those photographs  and have youhas anyone interrupted de cartienne fixing his piercing black eyes upon her  she shook her head  no but perhaps i can get some they were taken at lawrences and i suppose he has the negative  i glanced quickly at de cartienne he seemed profoundly uninterested and was trying to build a house of the cards he had thrown down either he must be a perfect actor or my vague suspicions were very illfounded at that moment i could not decide which  had enough cards cis he asked abruptly  not i well leave you out for a bit though fothergill and i are going to play ecarté  de cartienne shrugged his shoulders and threw himself on the sofa  i pity you then he said drily youll soon see the back of that little pile of winnings fothergills a bit too good for you  well we shall see cecil answered laughing confidently im not a bad hand at ecarté myself  they began to play presently de cartienne left the room and returned with two glasses in his hand  have a lemonsquash morton he asked carelessly theres only a drop of whisky in it  i accepted for i was thirsty and half emptied at a draught the tumbler which he handed me as i put down the glass i caught a grim smile on de cartiennes sallow face but what it meant i could not tell although it made me strangely uneasy  i watched the play for a few minutes and to my surprise cecil was still winning then gradually a powerful overmastering sleepiness crept over me i tried to stave it off by walking about by talking to milly by concentrating my thoughts upon the play it was useless i felt my eyes closing and the sounds and voices in the room grew dimmer and less distinct for a while i remained in a semiconscious statehalf awake and half asleepby sheer force of will but in the end i was conquered a mist hung before my eyes and all sound died away i fell asleep                                  chapter xxxi                          a startling discovery   when i awoke it was with the dulled senses and aching head which usually follow either a drugged sleep or an unnaturally heavy one i sat up on the sofa rubbing my eyes and staring around in blank surprise daylight was streaming in through the chinks of the drawn blinds but the gas was still burning with a dull sickly light  the table betrayed all the signs of an allnight orgie several packs of cards were lying strewn over the crumpled ashscattered cloth there were halfadozen tumblersone nearly full another broken into piecesand several empty sodawater bottles lay on the floor  but the most ghastly sight of all was cecils face he sat on a chair drawn up to the table his chin fallen upon his folded arms dark rims under his eyes and without a single vestige of colour in his ashen face there was no one else in the room  i sprang to my feet and hurried to his side  cecil cecil i cried whats the matter old chap wake up for heavens sake and tell me what has happened  he pulled himself together and struggled to his feet then he looked round the room and finally into my anxious face with an odd little laugh strained and unnatural  ive about done it this time he said by george lets clear out of this before milly comes down i shouldnt like her to know that weve been here all night poor little girl shed never forgive herself for letting us play here at all  where are the others i asked  fothergill has gone back to his hotel and leonard went with him i said id wake you and wed follow directly but i think i must have been dozing  we must go and at once i said or we shall never be back before the doctor gets down come cecil dont tell me anything yet  i linked my arm in his and drew him out of the room we crept softly down the passage and out at the back door i was afraid to ask him questions and he seemed in no hurry to disclose what had happened so we hurried along in silence cecil baring his head to the strong seabreeze which blew in our teeth when we had left the town behind us and had all the effect of a strong invigorating tonic  at every step i felt my head grow clearer and glancing at cecil i saw the colour creeping back into his cheeks with every breath he took of the salt air which came sweeping across the sandy barren country between us and the sea  when at last we reached our destination and had cautiously made our way up to the back entrance he hesitated opposite to us was the pineplantation which led down to the sea and between the thickly growing black trunks a curious light shone and glistened i had lived all my life in the country and knew well what it was but cecil turned round and watched it with amazement  look phil he whispered whats that light it seems as though the plantation were on fire  its the sunrise i answered shall we go and see it  he nodded and we stole across the lawn through the wicketgate and along the narrow winding path thickly strewn with dried leaves and fircones down towards the shore we were just in time to see the final effect a rim of the sun had already crept into sight casting brilliant scintillating reflections upon the dancing waves and the eastern sky was tinged from the arc of the heavens to the horizon with streaks of brilliantlyhued fantasticallyshaped cloudlets strewn upon a background of the lightest transparent blue  far off the sails of a few fishingsmacks glittered like gossamer wings upon a fairy ocean and farther away still where the banks of orange and azure clouds seemed to sink into a blazing sea of polished glass the white funnel of a passing steamer shone like a pillar of fire  it was a sight so new to cecil that he stood spellbound with a look of wondering awe upon his pale face and it was not until we had gazed to the full and were retracing our steps in silence through the plantation that i cared to speak of the events of the night  philip he said solemnly when i mentioned the subject theres no one to blame for this nights work but myself to do leonard and that fellow fothergill justice they both continually urged me to leave off playing but i wouldnt it seemed as though the luck must change at every deal and so i went on and on and on what a fool i was  and the result i asked anxiously  i owe fothergill between six and seven hundred pounds and i havent as many shillings  i stopped short and looked at him in horror  seven hundred pounds why cis how on earth came you to play up to that figure and with a man you know so little of  oh the mans all rightat least hes no sharper if you mean that cecil answered doggedly it was my own fault altogether hes a better player than i am and of course won  but he ought not to have gone on i protested i dont know much about such matters but i feel sure that a gentleman wouldnt sit down and win seven hundred pounds from a boy of your age youre not eighteen yet you know cis  i dont quite see what age has got to do with it he answered gloomily as regards fothergill i dont feel particularly sweet on him just now as you may imagine but it wasnt his fault at all i made him go on and you know the winner is a great deal in the hands of the loser in a case of that sort he kept on wanting to go and he went at last i should have gone on playing till now i think if he hadnt  when does he expect you to settle up i asked  ive got to see him this afternoon i say youll come down with me old chap wont you he pleaded i shall have to ask for a little time of course  yes ill go with you i promised how shall you try to raise the money  i havent the faintest idea he acknowledged gloomily ive overdrawn my allowance already several hundreds the mater is as poor as a church mouse and i simply darent ask my uncle ravenor though hes as rich as croesus he might disinherit me  we reached the house and stole softly up the back stairs to our rooms cecil threw himself dressed as he was upon the bed but i was in no humour for sleep and after a cold bath i dressed and got downstairs in time for breakfast to my surprise de cartienne was in the morningroom carefully dressed as usual and with no sign in his appearance or manner of having been out all night he was chatting lightly with dr randall about some trivial matter connected with the meeting which the latter had attended the previous evening  cecil is late again remarked the doctor with a frown as we began breakfast james go to lord silchesters room and ask him how long he will be  james retired and reappeared in a few minutes with a grave face  lord silchester desires me to beg you to excuse him this morning was the message which he brought back he has a very bad headache and has had no sleep  dr randall who was one of the kindesthearted men breathing looked compassionate  dear me he said im very sorry to hear that certainly we will excuse him will he have anything sent up  a cup of tea sir only i have ordered it in the kitchen  poor fellow its strange how he suffers from these attacks im afraid he cant be very strong remarked the doctor absently as he buttered himself a piece of toast  de cartienne and i exchanged glances but we said nothing  directly after breakfast the doctor took us into the study and we began the mornings labours it happened that in working out a series of algebraic questions de cartienne and i used a great deal of paper and when the doctor looked for a piece to explain the working of a rather stiff quadratic the rack was empty  have either of you a piece of wastepaper in your pockets he asked the back of an envelope or anything will do i see it is lunchtime so it is scarcely worth while sending for any  i felt in all my pockets but they were empty de cartienne drew an envelope from his pocket and handed it to the doctor the moment he had parted with it however i saw him give a sudden start and he seemed as though about to make an effort to regain possession of it but he was too late for the doctor was already fast covering it with figures  de cartienne quitted his seat and stood looking over his shoulder probably hoping that i should do the same but i remained where i was taking care to manifest my interest in the problem by asking frequent questions the moment the doctor had finished his rapid figuring and solved the equation i stretched out my hand for it eagerly  may i see it sir i begged i fancy youve made a mistake in the values  he handed it across the table at once with a quiet smile  i think not morton he said examine it for yourself  de cartienne moved round to my side with nervously twitching lips and an ugly light in his eyes  one moment morton he said i wont keep it longer  i laid a hand upon it and pushed him back with the other  my turn first please isnt that so dr randall  he nodded genially not noticing the suppressed excitement in de cartiennes manner  certainly im glad to find you both so interested in it let me know about this mistake at lunchtime morton he added smiling im going for a stroll round the garden now and i should advise you to do the same weve had a close mornings work  he rose and left the room de cartienne watched the door close and then turned to me  morton he said quickly i want that envelope there are some memoranda on the reverse side which concern my private affairs i need not say more i suppose  keep your hands to yourself de cartienne i answered shaking him off i shall not give you the envelope till i have examined it  you cad he hissed out his voice shaking with fury how dare you attempt to pry into my private affairs give me the envelope or ill  youll what i answered standing up putting the envelope in my pocket and facing him look here de cartienne im not going to attempt to justify my conduct to you on the face of it it may seem to be taking a mean advantage but i dont care a fig about that ive made up my mind what to do and all the blustering in the world wont make me alter it i am going to look at the reverse side of this envelope you  i ceased and with good reason for with a sudden pantherlike spring he had thrown himself upon me and his slender white fingers were grasping at my throat it was a brief struggle but a desperate one for he clung to me with a strength which seemed altogether out of proportion to his slim body and long thin arms  i was in no mood for trifling however and suddenly putting forth all my strength i seized him by the middle and sent him backwards with a crash of fallen furniture into a corner of the room before he could recover himself i drew out the envelope from my pocket and looked at it  there was nothing on the reverse side but the address and the postmark they were quite sufficient for me however the postmark was mellborough and the handwriting was the peculiar cramped handwriting of mr marx                                  chapter xxxii                               forestalled   for a full minute neither of us moved then de cartienne rose slowly to his feet and walked to the door  here take this i said holding out the envelope towards him the private memoranda upon it may be useful to you  he snatched it from my fingers and tore it into atoms then he walked quietly away with an evil look upon his face  at luncheon cecil appeared white as a ghost and looking anxious and disturbed as well he might dr randall was quite uneasy at his appearance and acquiesced at once when i asked for permission to take him for a drive during the afternoon de cartienne sat silent throughout the meal except for a few sympathising sentences to cecil and left the room at the first opportunity  at three oclock my dog cart was brought round and cecil and i drove away we scarcely spoke until we were in the streets of drayton and then rousing myself i bade him pluck his spirits up and assured him vaguely that i would see him through it somehow he thanked me but seemed very despondent  we went to the bull and inquired for mr fothergill he was in the coffeeroom we were told and there we found him lunching  so good of you fellows to come and look me up he exclaimed welcoming us cordially waiter a bottle of pommery dont shake your head now lord silchester itll do you good i can see youre a bit seedy this morning  cecil smiled feebly  im not quite up to the mark he admitted just a bit of a headachethats all i say mr fothergill he went on plunging at once in medias res im awfully sorry but i shant be able to settle up with you today  settle up with me repeated mr fothergill putting down his glass untasted and looking surprised i dont understand you settle what up  why the money i lost last night cecil explained  mr fothergill leaned back in his chair and looked into cecils white anxious face with an astonishment which if simulated was certainly admirably done then he broke into a little laugh  my dear lord silchester he said energetically you cant for one moment suppose that i expected anything of the sort why i scarcely took our play seriously at all and i should very much prefer that we said no more about it pray dont be offended he added hastily for the sensitive colour had flushed into cecils cheeks ill tell you how well arrange it you shall give me your i o us and pay them just as it is convenient any time within the next five or six years will do but as to taking a sum like that from a ba man who is not of agewhy its absurd i feel rather ashamed of myself for having been so fortunate  a look of intense relief had stolen into cecils face but the reaction was a little too sudden he left us abruptly and stood looking out of the window for a minute or two then he returned smiling and held out his hand to mr fothergill  mr fothergill youre a brick he declared emphatically  not another word please mr fothergill answered smiling now look here lord silchester he added drink this glass of wine  cecil obeyed him promptly  and now youll be so good as to have some luncheon with me mr fothergill continued i dont care what you say i dont believe youve eaten anything today waiter bring me those other cutlets i ordered and the gamepie andyes i think we might venture on another bottle of wine  mr morton you must join us clever animal of yoursthat one outside he rattled on lightly but id have her taken out for an hour if i were you its too cold for her to be standing about shall i ring the ostlers bell and tell him and then if you will you might drive me down to the station when youre ready to go my train leaves a little before five  whatever my former opinion of mr fothergill had been i felt bound to change it now he was showing tact goodnature and a decidedly gentlemanly spirit i had in truth eaten very little lunch at borden tower and cecil none at all and we proceeded to make good the omission  when an hour or two later we left mr fothergill at the station we were both of one mind concerning him and we had both promised to accept his cordial invitation to run up to town and see him before long  on our way home cecil stopped at the rose and crown and went in to make his peace with milly i promised to call for him and went on to the photographers up the street mr lawrence appeared at once from a backroom which i presume was the studio wiping his hands upon a not particularly cleanlooking towel  i paid him in advance for a dozen photographs promising to come in and have them taken next time i was in the town then i explained what was really the purport of my visit had he preserved the negative of the photograph which he had taken of mr hart  certainly he had he assured me i told him about the date and his head and shoulders disappeared into a cupboard in a few minutes he withdrew them and called out sharply for his assistant  fenton he exclaimed angrily youve been at this cupboard  fenton who was a tall ungainly lad of most unprepossessing appearance shook his head  i havent been near it sir he declared  mr lawrence looked incredulous  there is a negative missing he said sharply no one else could have meddled with it  i dont know anything about it the boy answered doggedly perhaps its upstairs  mr lawrence abandoned his search  if youll excuse me a moment sir he said ill have a look among the old ones  i nodded and he closed the door and disappeared fenton would have gone too but i stopped him  look here i said quickly see this  i held out a fivepound note  he opened his eyes wide and looked at it longingly  well its yours if youll tell me what youve done with the negative of mr harts photograph quick  he hesitated  should you split to the governor he asked  no  well then i sold it for a sovereign to a young gentleman what inquired for it a few minutes ago a thin dark chap he is i dont know his name but ive seen him driving with you  i threw him the note and left the place i had now no doubt about the matter at all de cartienne had stolen the photograph of mr hart from the rose and crown and had bought the negative why                                 chapter xxxiii                            a gleam of light   after leaving the photographers shop i walked slowly across the little marketplace and down the narrow street towards the rose and crown my recent discovery had given me a good deal to think about or rather had afforded me matter for a variety of wild conjectures but i could follow none of them to a very satisfactory conclusion i was like a man groping in the dark i had stumbled upon several very extraordinary and inexplicable facts but what connection if any they had with one another or how to link them together i could not tell  i have always been somewhat absentminded and with my brain in such a whirl it was not a very remarkable thing that i took a wrong turning the moment i had discovered it i stopped short and looked round i was in a little street that led past the back entrance of the rose and crown it was scarcely a public thoroughfare  i had already turned on my heel to retrace my steps when i saw two figures standing talking at the back door of the inn one i knew at a glance to be milly hart her companion was standing with his back to me a muffler round his neck and his cap slouched over his eyes in the gloom of the fastfalling twilight i did not at first recognise him but when he turned round with a start at the sound of my approaching footsteps and withdrew his arm with a sudden movement from around his companions waist something in the motion and figure seemed familiar to me  my approach seemed to discompose them not a little milly stepped back at once into the doorway and disappeared her companion without waiting to make any adieu turned round and walked swiftly away as he crossed the street to make use of the only exit from ita narrow passage leading through a courti had a better view of him he kept his back to me as much as possible and seemed to be using every endeavour to escape recognition but although i could not be quite certain i was pretty sure that it was leonard de cartiennede cartienne who never missed an opportunity of sneering at millys innocent blue eyes and baby face  i turned back and hurried round to the front entrance of the rose and crown in the parlour i found cecil and milly sitting very close together upon a sofa  hallo old chap you havent been long remarked cecil rising reluctantly  i should have been here before i answered looking steadily at milly but i took a wrong turning and got round the back of this place somehow saw you didnt i miss milly i remarked  she raised her eyebrows and looked at me wonderingly out of her placid blue eyes  me oh no i have only just come downstairs have i not cecil it must have been one of the maids  milly and i exchanged a steady gaze her eyes meeting mine without drooping and her manner betraying only a mild surprise it was a revelation to me a lesson which i did not easily forget  oh i beg your pardon im sure i said turning away it was rather dark and no doubt i was mistaken strange too i thought it was de cartienne with whom you were talking  cecil laughed carelessly  my dear fellow you must have been dreaming he said de cartienne has not been here at all  ready cecil i asked abandoning the subject i think weve kept bess waiting about long enough  ill come he replied drawing on his gloves ive scarcely had a moment with you milly though have i no news  she shook her head sadly and the big tears stood in her eyes there was no mistaking her earnestness now  none about my father my uncle and aunt are coming to stay here i expect them tonight  horrid nuisance that is remarked cecil sotto voce never mind you wont be so lonely little woman will you and you wont have so much to look after i must take you for a drive as soon as we get a fine clear day thatll bring some colour into your cheeks goodbye  she came to the door and watched us drive off cecil took the reins and i climbed to his side and folding my arms sat for a while in gloomy silence then suddenly a gleam of light or what i hoped might prove so broke in upon me and i laid my hand upon cecils arm  pull up old chapquick i exclaimed  he did so and looked at me wonderingly  turn round and drive back again as fast as you can i said my voice trembling a little with excitement i want to ask milly hart a question                                  chapter xxxiv                         dr schofields opinion   in ten minutes we were in the streets of little drayton again and cecil had brought the dog cart to a standstill outside the rose and crown he would have gone in with me but i begged him not to i jumped down and walked straight into the little parlour milly was sitting there alone gazing absently into the fire she looked up in surprise at my sudden entrance and half rose  milly i want to ask you a question i said going up to her side its about your fathers disappearance  yes she exclaimed eagerly what is it oh do tell me quickly  its only an idea did mr hart ever suffer from any brain disorder at any time thats all i want to know has his mind always been quite strong  she did not answer for a moment and my heart beat fast looking at her closely i could see that the colour had flushed into her cheeks and there was a troubled light in her eyes  he has had one or two severe illnesses she admitted slowly brain fever once and im afraid he used to drink too much now and then the doctor told him that he must be very careful not to excite himself  who was the doctor and where does he live i asked quickly  dr schofield he lives on the lincoln road about a mile away why have you asked me this she added anxiously  i evaded a direct reply  never mind now i said if anything comes of it i will let you know  she tried to detain me with further questions but i hurried away and she did not follow me out of the door  cis i said as i scrambled up to his side i want you to go home by the lincoln road and call at dr schofields it isnt far out of the way  he nodded  all right you havent found out anything about old hart have you what was the question you went back to ask milly  only about her fathers health no i havent found out anything its only an idea of mine i want to clear up  cecil looked as though he thought i might have told him what the idea was but he said nothing in a few minutes he pulled up outside a neat redbrick house which as a shining brass plate indicated was dr schofields abode  the doctor was in and disengaged he came at once into the waitingroom where i had been showna respectable family practitioner with intelligent face and courteous manner  i explained my position as an acquaintance of miss harts interested in the mysterious disappearance of her father it had occurred to me to make inquiries as to the state of his health or rather his constitution i added perhaps his prolonged absence might be accounted for by sudden and dangerous illness could dr schofield give me any information  his manner was encouraging he bade me take a seat and went into the matter gravely  to tell you the truth he said i am rather surprised that i have not been appealed to before in an ordinary case i should feel bound to maintain a strict secrecy with regard to the ailments of my patients but this is different as you have asked me this question i feel bound to tell you what i would not otherwise divulge mr hart was my patient on two several occasions during the last two years for delirium tremens and once within my recollection he had a distinct touch of brain fever  his mind would not be very strong then i remarked  dr schofield hesitated  he had a wonderful constitution he said slowlya constitution of iron in ordinary circumstances i cannot bring myself to think that he could suddenly and completely have lost his reason but supposing he had received some severe shock such as a railway accident or something of that sort why then it would be possible even probable he might become a raving lunatic in a moment  and would his madness be incurable  if properly treated with a knowledge of his past ailmentno answered dr schofield but if he were treated just like an ordinary madman in a pauper lunatic asylum he would probably never recover he would become worse and worse and finally be incurable i see two objections to accepting any theory of this sort as accounting for his disappearance the doctor continued after a short pause in the first place the shock would have to be violent and unexpected and this seems improbable in the next place he would surely have had some letter or something about him which would have led to his identification  if the shock were the result of foul play these would be destroyed i suggested  undoubtedly but whence the foul play hart is known to have had only a few pounds with him when he left  perhaps he had something in his keeping more valuable than money i remarked  what  a secret  have you any grounds for such a belief the doctor asked curiously  i hesitated in my own mind i believed that i had but for the present at any rate this was best kept to myself i answered quite truthfully however  i have made a few inquiries here and there i said and i have heard it hinted that he had some secret means of replenishing his purse he has been known more than once to leave here with only a few sovereigns in his pocket and to come back with his sovereigns turned into banknotes  i remember hearing some such tale the doctor remarked im afraid it is all rather vague though  im very much obliged to you dr schofield i assured him rising to take my leave  he followed me to the door and then returned to his interrupted dinner i mounted into the dog cart and we were soon bowling through the darkness towards borden tower  get anything out of the old chap cecil asked  not much im just a little wiser than i was before thats all beastly sorry to keep you waiting so long  oh thats all right but i say phil he added what is this idea of yours you can tell me cant you  if it comes to anything i will i assured him but at present it is altogether too vague and you would only laugh at it dont ask me anything more about it yet theres a good fellow  youre very close all of a sudden he grumbled why cant you tell me  because im afraid of your letting it out to someone whom i dont want to know anything about it i answered  he laughed  ah well perhaps youre right he said i couldnt keep anything back from milly  i echoed his laugh but held my peace it was not milly alone from whom i wished my present idea to be kept a secret in fact i had not thought of milly at all i was only anxious that de cartienne should remain altogether in the dark as to my clue and for a remarkably good reason                                  chapter xxxv                              an invitation   we drove straight into the courtyard having no groom with us and entered the house from the back as we passed the little room on the ground floor given up for our sole use as a repository for cricketnets fishingtackle guns spare harness and such like appliances i opened the door intending to hang my whip up to my surprise de cartienne was there in an old coat with his sleeves turned up cleaning a gun he looked up and greeted us as we entered  what a time you men have been what have you been up to in little drayton  oh we had lunch with your friend fothergill and shacked about cecil answered tell you what len hes a very decent fellow  de cartienne was examining the lock of his gun with great attention and in the dusk i could not catch his expression  oh fothergills all right he answered you didnt find him very hungry for his winnings did you  i should think not cecil replied enthusiastically why i believe he was actually annoyed with himself for having won at all ive given him my i o us  hell most likely tear them up de cartienne remarked hes beastly rich and he cant want the money  where did you drop across him len asked cecil seating himself upon a chest and lighting a cigarette  hes a friend of my governors ive known him ever since i was a kid de cartienne answered slowly there i think thatll do critically looking at the gleaming muzzle which he held in his hand  why this sudden fit of industry inquired cecil yawning going to do any shooting  de cartienne nodded and began deliberately pulling the gun to pieces  yes ive had a long day indoors today and i mean to make up for it by potting some wild duck tomorrow hilliers told me that hed heard of some very fair sport round by rushey ponds last week youd better come with me  thanks ill see cecil answered im not very keen on wild duck potting  havent you been out all day then de cartienne i askednot even to drayton  not outside the house he answered do i look like it  he pointed to his slippered feet his old clothes and held up his hands black with oil and grease i took in the details of his appearance feeling a little bewildered it seemed barely possible that he could have been in little drayton an hour ago  the dressingbell rang out and we hurried off to our rooms for dr randall easygoing enough in some things was strictness itself with regard to our punctuality at dinnertime but no sooner had i seen de cartienne safely in his room than i softly made my way downstairs again and crossed the yard to the stables  it was as i had expected the stall in which de cartienne kept his mare was carefully closed but through the chinks i could see that a lamp was burning inside  i tried the door softly but it was locked then i knocked there was no answer turning away i entered the next stall and mounting a stepladder looked over the partition  i saw very much what i had expected to seede cartiennes thoroughbred mare splashed all over with mud and still trembling with nervous fatigue and by her side dick the stableboy holding a wet sponge in his hand and looking up at me with a scared disconsolate expression  oh it be you be it muster morton he exclaimed rather sullenly  i looked down at diana  how came she in that exhausted condition i asked and why have you locked the door  dick hesitated and i tossed him a halfcrown  the truth now dick i said and i wont let mr de cartienne know that ive seen her  he brightened up at once and pocketed the halfcrown  thats kind o yer sir he exclaimed evidently much relieved all i know sir is that muster de cartienne he come in riding like mad along the drayton road bout arf an hour ago and he says to me dick take diana lock her up in the stable and dont let no one know as shes been out just attend to her yourself and rub her down carefully for ive been obliged to ride fast and with that he guv me summut and hoff he went into the ouse  thank you dick i said getting down from the ladder thats all i wanted to know and i crossed the yard to the house again and hurried upstairs to change my things  we had two deliveries of letters at borden tower and just as we were leaving the dinnertable that evening the late post arrived there was a letter for me a somewhat unusual occurrence and a single glance at the arms and the bold characteristic handwriting set me longing to open it for it was from mr ravenor as soon as the cloth was cleared i did so    my dear philip it commenced i am thinking of travelling for   several years perhaps for longer and should like to see you before i   go come and stay here for a few days i am writing dr randall and   also cecil who will accompany you you will leave borden tower   tomorrow and i will send to mellborough to meet the 518 bring some   clothes as there will be some people stopping hereyours                                                    bernard ravenor  i looked up from the letter with a great sense of relief and met cecils delighted gaze  hurrah old chap he exclaimed only half under his breath wont we have a rare old time  cave i whispered for the doctor was looking our way  more vacation he remarked in a grumbling tone which was made up for however by a goodnatured smile upon my word i dont know how mr ravenor imagines youre ever going to learn anything however i suppose you must go  de cartienne looked up inquiringly  were going to stay at ravenor castle for a week cecil explained were off tomorrow  i leaned forward and watched de cartiennes face intently there was an expression in it which i could not analyse it might have been pleasure or apprehension or indifference though i watched him narrowly i could not make up my mind whether he was more dismayed or gratified at the prospect of our visit                                  chapter xxxvi                             a metamorphosis   it seemed almost as though some magical metamorphosis had taken place within the walls of ravenor castle directly we came in sight of it we had the first intimation of its altered aspect instead of the one or two solitary lights shining above the dark woods it seemed a very blaze of illumination and when we drew up at the great front door the change was still mere apparent liveried servants with powdered hair were moving about the hall from open doors there came the sound of laughing voices and even mr ravenors manner as he came out to meet us seemed altered  come in and have some tea here he said leading the way to one of the smaller rooms your mother is here cecil  we followed him into lady silchesters favourite apartment several ladies and one or two men were lounging on divans and in easy chairs around a brightlyblazing fire lady silchester who was presiding at a greenandgold sèvres teaservice welcomed us both with a languid smile  my dear cis how you have grown she said leaning back in her chair and leisurely sipping her tea i declare i had no idea that i had a son your height sir had you lord penraven  lord penraven who was lounging by her side with his elbow upon the mantelpiece stroked a long fair moustache vigorously and answered with emphasis  pon my word i hadnt the slightest idea seems almost impossible  let me give you boys some tea lady silchester said in her sweetest tone  none for me thanks mother replied cecil why agmiss hamilton is that really you over in the corner he exclaimed rising and crossing the room how awfully jolly  lady silchester shrugged her shoulders and turned to me  mr morton  i took the cup which she had filled and the conversation which our entrance had interrupted flowed on again presently mr ravenor who had been standing on the hearthrug talking to a stately greyhaired lady who occupied the seat of honoura black oak armchair drawn up to the firemoved over to my side and dropped into a vacant seat between lady silchester and myself  well philip he said softly you seem lost in thought are you wondering whether a magicians wand has touched ravenor castle  it all seems very different i answered  of course nothing like change you know it is only by comparison that we can appreciate stagnation sharpens ones appetite for gaiety and one must go through a course of overwork before one can taste the full sweetness of an idle country life  then mr ravenor was silent for a minute leaning back in his chair and looking steadily into the fire and by the dancing fitful light of the flames i could see that the old weariness and deep indefinable sadness had stolen into his pale face and dark eyes it was only a passing change the sound of the laughing voices around seemed suddenly to galvanise him into consciousness of the rôle which he was playing and the expression faded away someone asked him a question and he answered it with a light jest once more he was the courteous smiling host whose sole thought appeared to be the entertainment of his guests but i knew that there was a background  the dressingbell rang and the gossiping assembly broke up mr ravenor standing with the opened door in his hand exchanged little happy speeches with most of the ladies as they swept out when they were all gone he turned to cecil and me and looked at us critically with a faint smile upon his lips  well are you ready for your matric cecil he asked  cecil made a wry face  shall be soon uncle he declared hopefully im getting on now first rate morton here makes me work like a trojan  thats right and you philip i hope my lazy nephew doesnt keep you back  oh mortons all right for his matric whenever he likes to go in for it broke in cecil  mr ravenor nodded  good youd better go and dress now both of you richards is waiting to show you your rooms  we passed up the great oak staircase and on the first corridor we came face to face with a slim little figure in a white frock walking demurely by the side of her maid with her ruddy golden hair tumbled about her oval face and an expectant light in her dancing blue eyes  directly she saw us she flew into cecils arms  oh cis cis cis how delightful how glad i am that you have come they only just told me and how do you do mr morton  she held out a very diminutive palm and looked up at me with a beaming smile  im quite well thank you lady beatrice i answered looking down with keen pleasure into her sweet childish face and repressing a strong desire to take her up in my arms as cecil had done and give her a kiss  you remember me then  oh yes she answered i remember you quite well your name is philip isnt it you told me that i might call you by it  well we must go now dear cecil said stroking her hair weve got to dress for dinner you know  oh the exclamation was drawn out and the little face fell suddenly it brightened  cecil what do you think ive got a pony a real pony of my own will you come for a ride with me tomorrow please please do  all right he promised carelessly  she clapped her hands and looked up at me  will you come too philip she asked  i should like to very much indeed i answered unhesitatingly  oh thats delightful she exclaimed gleefully we will have such a nice ride you shall see queenie canter she does go so fast goodbye now  she tripped away by the side of her maid turning round more than once to wave her hand to us then we hurried along to our rooms which were at the end of the wide marblepillared corridor and opened one into the other our portmanteaux had been placed in readiness so dressing was not a tedious business i had finished first and lounged in an easy chair watching cecil struggle with a refractory white tie  how pretty your sister is cis i remarked  think so shes rather an odd little thing declared her brother absently surveying himself at last with satisfaction in the long pierglass didnt know youd ever seen her before i saywith sudden emphasisisnt aggie hamilton a jolly goodlooking girl  ive scarcely seen her yet i reminded him rather a chatterbox isnt she  chatterbox not she cecil protested indignantly why  the rumble of a gong reached us from below cecil stopped short in his speech and hurried me out of the room  come along sharp he exclaimed that means dinner in ten minutes and i promised to get down into the drawingroom first and introduce you to aggie come on  we descended into the hall and a tall footman threw open the door of the long suite of drawing and anterooms in which the guests at the castle were rapidly assembling to me who had seen nothing of the sort before it was a brilliant sight four rooms all of stately dimensions and all draped with amber satin of the same shade were thrown into one by the upraising of heavy clinging curtains and each one seemed filled with groups of charminglydressed women and little knots of men a low incessant buzz of conversation floated about in the air which was laden with the scent of exotics and dainty perfumes the light was brilliant but soft for the marble figures around the walls held out silver lamps covered with gauzy rosecoloured shades  we passed through two of the rooms before we found the young lady of whom cecil was in search then we came upon her suddenly sitting quite alone and idly turning over the pages of a book of engravings cecil jogged me excitedly with his elbow in a manner which elsewhere would have brought down anathemas and possibly retribution upon his head as it was however i had to bear the pain like a spartan  i say isnt she stunning he whispered  i answered in the affirmative carefully removing myself from the range of his elbow then we approached her and she closed the book of engravings with a comical air of relief and made room for us beside her  she was even prettier than i had expected with dark hair and eyes dazzling complexion a perfect figure of the petite order and faultless teeth which she was by no means averse from showing she wore a black lace gown with a good deal of scarlet about it and a deep red rose in her bosom altogether i was scarcely surprised at cecils captivation  if not actually a chatterbox she was certainly possessed of the art of talking nonsense very volubly and making others talk it before dinner was announced by a dignifiedlooking functionary we had got through quite an amazing amount of conversation it fell to cecils lot to take in his inamorata whilst i was far away behind with the middleaged wife of a country clergyman she was very pleasant though and i was quite content to do but little talking throughout the long banquet for it was all new to me and interesting  the vast dininghallit was really the picturegallerythe many servants in rich liveries the emblazoned plate the glittering glasses and the brilliant snatches of conversation which floated around me all were a revelation very soon the effect of it passed away and i was able to choose my wines and select my dishes and was free to take part if i chose in the talk but for that first evening i was content to remain silent and as far as possible unnoticed  dinner which had seemed to me to be growing interminable came to an end at last lady silchester at the head of a long file of stately women swept down the polished floor and the procession departed with much rustling of robes some of the vacant chairs were taken possession of by men and already delicate blue clouds of smoke were curling upwards to the vaulted ceiling it was the short period dearer to the heart of man than any during the day every one stretched out his stiff limbs filled his glass and assumed his favourite attitude voices were raised and a sudden change of tone crept in upon the conversation only mr ravenor and a few of the older guests appeared to be still engrossed in the discussion of some abstruse scientific controversy then raging in the reviews everyone else seemed to be talking lightly of the days sport the arrangements for the morrow and his own and other mens horses  it was getting a little slow for me cecil had found some friends and the sound of his hearty boyish laugh came to me often from the other end of the table my immediate neighbours were a bishop who was deep in discussion with a minor canon concerning the doings of some recent diocesan conference at which things seemed to have been more lively than harmonious and on my other side lord penraven was quarrelling with the lord lieutenant of the county about the pedigree of a racehorse both disputes were utterly without interest to me and it was no small relief when as i caught mr ravenors eye he beckoned me to a vacant chair by his side  the conversation which had been for a moment interrupted was soon renewed i sat silent listening with everincreasing admiration to the play of words the subtle arguments and the epigrammatic brilliancy of expression which flashed from one to another of the four disputants had i known anything of the social or literary life of london i might have been less astonished for mr ravenor and two of his antagonists mr justice haselton and professor clumbers were reckoned among the finest talkers of their day  at last mr ravenor very much to my regret brought the conversation to an abrupt close by proposing an exodus to the drawingrooms a few of the younger men looked eager to depart but the majority rose and stretched themselves with the sad faces of martyrs before forming themselves into little groups and quitting the room mr ravenor remained until the last and motioned me to stay with him  well philip he said when everyone had gone how are you getting on at dr randalls do you like being there  very much for some things i answered  he looked at me closely  there is something you have to tell me he said what is it  i glanced around at the little army of servants moving noiselessly about on all sides  there is something i acknowledged but i would rather tell it you when we are quite alone besides it is rather a long story it has mostly to do with mr marx  the calm stately serenity of mr ravenors face underwent a sudden change his dark brows almost met into his eyes which i could not read the change strengthened the impression which had lately been growing upon me there was some deep mystery connected with the personality of mr marx in which mr ravenor was somehow concerned  what about mr marx what can you have to say to me about him he asked coldly  more than i should care to say here i answered glancing around it is rather a long  come into the library to me the last thing tonight he said quickly i must know what this story is that you have got hold of we will go into the drawingroom now  in a few moments the cloud had vanished from his face and he was again the polished host and i under protest was inveigled into a corner by miss agnes hamilton and given my first lesson in the fashionable art of flirting                                 chapter xxxvii                           mr marx is wanted   it was long past midnight before the last little knots of guests had wished one another good night and even then lord penraven and a few chosen companions only adjourned to a smaller smokingroom in the back regions of the castle i knew that mr ravenor was not with them however for i had seen him after having outstayed all save this handful of his guests cross the hall and enter the library in about half an hour i followed him  i had expected to find him resting after the great strain which the multitude and importance of his guests must have imposed upon him during the day but i found him very differently employed he was bending low over his writingtable with a cup of tea by his side and already several sheets of closelywritten foolscap were scattered about the table at the sound of my entrance he looked up at once and laid down his pen  sit there he said pointing to an easychair opposite to him i want to see your face while you are talking now what is this tale which you have to tell me  his manner was far from encouraging and his face wore a severe expression altogether i felt a little nervous but it had to be done so i began  first i told him all about leonard de cartienne his bad influence over cecil and his correspondence with mr marx he listened without remark then i paused to take breath  i dont know what youll say about the rest of my story i went on i scarcely know what to think of it myself but here it is there is an inn in little drayton kept by a man named hart and cecil and de cartienne go theresometimes about a month before i went to borden tower the man hart disappeared he left home on a journey the nature of which he kept secret even from his daughter and has never returned or been heard of all the information which his daughter can give is that he has left home before on a similar errand and invariably returned with money after three or four days  i paused and glanced at mr ravenor he was looking a little puzzled but not particularly interested  about a month before i left here for borden tower i went on i met mr marx in torchester and drove home with him late at night on the moor we were furiously attacked by a man who seemed to be mad and mr marx was slightly injured two days afterwards mr marx was assaulted by the same man in the park and if i had not turned up he would probably have been killed the man was a lunatic in every respect save one he recognized mr marx as his enemy and made deliberate attempts upon his life  mr ravenor softly pulled down the green lampshade on the side nearest to him and in the subdued light i could scarcely see his face but i felt that his interest in my story was growing  well of course when cecil began talking about this man harts disappearance i continued and i heard a good deal about it at little drayton i began to think about this lunatic whom no one knew anything about i put down the exact dates and i found that hart must have left little drayton about a week before the first attack on mr marx by the unknown madman of course this by itself was scarcely worth thinking about but the strangest part of it is to come more out of curiosity than anything i asked to see a photograph of mr hart his daughter took us into the sittingroom to look at one and to her amazement found it gone all search was unavailing someone had taken it away well i found out where it had been taken and went to order a copy it was no use the negative had been sold to the same person who alone could have entered miss harts sittingroom and abstracted the photograph that person was leonard de cartienne and he has been in communication with mr marx the man whom the lunatic tried to murder can you make anything of that sir  apparently mr ravenor had made something of it he was leaning a little forward in his chair and at the sight of his face a great fear came upon me  a ghastly change had crept into it his eyes were burning with a dry fierce fire and the pallor extended even to his lips  he sat forward with his long wasted fingers stretched out convulsively before his face like a man who sees a hideous vision pass before his sight and yet remains spellbound powerless to speak or move or break away from the loathsome spectacle  sickly beads of perspiration stood out upon his clammy forehead and his dry lips were moving although no sound came from them  i gazed at him in a speechless horror and as i looked the room and all its contents seemed to swim around me what could mr ravenor have found so awful in the story which i had told and how could it concern him  suddenly he rose from his seat and stood over me i was more than ever alarmed at his strange expression  there is a third connection he said hoarsely do you remember that a man called to see me whom i declined to admit on the night of your first visit here when i changed my mind he had disappeared  i gave a little cry and felt my blood run cold  mr marx had something to do with that i faltered out i met him under the trees in the avenue and he was horribly frightened to see me i had heard a cry i was listening  mr ravenor stretched out his hand to the bell and rang it violently we sat in silence dreading almost to look at one another until it was answered  go to mr marxs room and bid him come here at once mr ravenor commanded  the man bowed and withdrew when he reappeared he carried in his hand a letter  mr marx left this on his desk for you sir he said  left it where is he is he not in the castle questioned mr ravenor sharply  no sir he had a dog cart about halfpast four to catch the london express at mellborough  mr ravenor tore open the note and then threw it across to me there were only a few words  dear mr ravenorkindly excuse me for a day or two important business of a private nature calls me hurriedly to london if you are writing me my address will be at the hotel metropole m  there was a silence between us then i looked into mr ravenors colourless face  we must find that lunatic i whispered  mr ravenor turned from me with a shudder  we must do nothing of the sort                                 chapter xxxviii                           i accept a mission   there was a silence which threatened to last for ever  at length mr ravenor turned his head slightly and looked towards me the eagerness which he saw in my face seemed to strike some grim vein of humour in him for his lips parted a dreary fleeting smile  are you expecting to hear a confession he asked as it passed away  a confession from him god forbid from him who had ever seemed to me so far above other men that none other were worthy to be classed with him all the old fire of my boyish heroworship blazed up at the very thought a confession from him the bare idea was sacrilegious  he read his answer in the mute amazed protest of my looks and did not wait for the words which were trembling upon my lips  it would do you little good to tell you all that your story has suggested to me he said quietly some day you will know everything but not yetnot yet  he paused and walked slowly up and down the room with his hands behind him and his eyes fixed upon the floor suddenly he stopped and looked up  marx must come back at once he said with something of his old firmness i shall send him a telegram tomorrow to return immediately  and if he doesnt come  i must go to him this matter must be cleared up as far as it can be and at once  your guests i reminded him how can you leave them  i forgot them he exclaimed impatiently philip will you go he asked suddenly  yes i answered quietly although my heart was beating fast yes i will go perhaps it would be best  he let his hand rest for a moment upon my shoulder and though he did not say so i knew that he was pleased then he glanced at the clock  two oclock he exclaimed philip you must leave me now  i looked towards his writingtable at which he was already seating himself and hesitated  you are not going to write now i ventured to protest  why not  i pointed to the clock but he only smiled  i am no slave to regular hours he said quietly an hour or twos sleep is enough for me at a time  so i left him                                  chapter xxxix                                 my ride   it was a few minutes past nine when i descended into the long oaken gallery where breakfast was served and at the head of the principal table sat mr ravenor in hunting costume everyone who was down was evidently bound for the meet the men were nearly all in scarlet coats and the women in ridinghabits and trim little hats with their veils pushed back there was a great clatter of knives and forks and a good deal of carving going on at the long polished sideboard and above it all a loud hum of cheerful talk altogether it was a very pleasant meal that was in progress  i was making my way towards a gap in the table at the lower end when i heard my name called and looked down into miss hamiltons piquant upturned face  come and sit by me she exclaimed moving her skirts to make room see ive hidden a chair herefor somebody  i took it with a laugh  well as somebody is so very lazy this morning i said he doesnt deserve to have it so i will can i get you anything  she shook her head  no thanks look after yourself do for we shall have to start presently and now tell me how did you know for whom i was saving that chair  well i supposed it was for cis i remarked making a vigorous attack upon an adjacent ham  indeed and supposing i were to say that it wasntthat it was for someone else  poor cis i said with a sigh dont tell me who the someone else was miss hamilton please  why not  because i shall hate him  for lord silchesters sake  no for my own  mr morton youre talking nonsense  well didnt you undertake to teach me how last evening  teach you oha little ironicallyyoure a very apt pupil mr morton  i looked at her in mute remonstrance  with such a tutor miss hamilton  she stopped me laughing  oh youre a dreadful boy let me give you some tea to keep you quiet  i drew a long sigh and attacked my breakfast vigorously presently she began again  do you know nanpantan mr morton where the meet is this morning  very well i answered cutting myself some more ham do you mind giving me another cup of tea miss hamilton it was so good  she nodded and drew off her thick dogskin glove again  you thirsty mortal she remarked im afraid you must have been smoking too much last night  one cigarette i assured her no more upon my honour  really then you wont get any more tea from me to unsteady your nerves now tell me mr morton do you know this country  every inch of it no one better  oh how nice and youll give me a lead today wont you i do so want to do well  i should be delighted i answered but unfortunately im not going to hunt  not going to hunt then what are you going to do pray  going for a ride with a young lady i answered  oh indeedwith a toss of the head  there was a short silence then curiosity conquered the fit of indignation which miss hamilton had thought well to assume  may i ask the name of the fortunate young lady  you may i answered calmly helping myself to toast it is little lady beatrice  she burst into a peal of laughter but stopped suddenly  what nonsense are you going to take the grooms place then and hold the leadingrein  if she rides with one very likely i answered  there was a short silence then miss hamilton returned to the charge  how old is your inamorata she inquired seven or eight  twelve next birthday i answered promptly  its quite too ridiculous she declared tossing her head i really wanted you to come with me this morning because you know the country she added with a sidelong glance from her dark eyes  nothing would have given me greater pleasure i declared but a promise is a promise you know and we made this one before we knew any thing about the meet  we who are we she asked quickly  cis and i  cecil wont go if i ask him to come with me she said confidently  i shrugged my shoulders  perhaps not the more reason why i should  she turned away from me half amused half vexed just then cecil appeared and she beckoned him eagerly to her side  cecil mr morton tells me that you have promised to ride with beatrice this morning she said  so we did he exclaimed awfully sorry to disappoint her but of course i didnt know anything about the meet  oh i am glad that you are not going to desert me then she said laughing mr morton declares that he is going to keep his engagement  very good of him if he is remarked cecil stirring his tea with great cheerfulness  dont pity me i said rising im sure i shall enjoy it au revoir miss hamilton  and i did enjoy it many a time afterwards i thought of that slim little figure in the long ridinghabit her golden hair streaming in the breeze and her dainty flushed face aglow with excitement and delight and of the pleasant prattle which her little ladyship poured into my willing ears i remembered too her quaint naïve ways and the grave way in which she thanked me for taking care of herlittle mannerisms which soon yielded to familiarity and vanished altogether and strange though it may seem i found always more satisfaction in recalling these things than the winged look and merry speeches of miss agnes hamilton                                   chapter xl                               my mission   for the first time in my life i was in londonand alone there had been no reply from mr marx to the telegrams commanding his instant return and so on the third morning after my arrival at ravenor castle i quitted it again to go in search of him accustomed though he was to conceal his feelings and admirably though he succeeded in doing so in the presence of his guests i could see that mr ravenor was deeply anxious to have the suspicions which my story had awakened either dispelled or confirmed nor indeed although their purport was scarcely so clear to me was i less so  i suppose that no one especially if he had never before been in a great city could pass across london for the first time without some emotion of wonder to me it was like entering an unknown world the vast throng of people the ceaseless din of traffic and the huge buildings all filled me with amazement which as we drove through the strand to northumberland avenue grew into bewilderment only the recollection of my mission and its grave import recalled me to myself as the cab drew up before the hotel metropole  my bag was taken possession of at once by one of the hallporters and i engaged a room then i made inquiries about mr marx  the clerk turned over two or three pages of the ledger and shook his head there was no one of that name stopping in the hotel he informed me  can you tell me whether anyone of that name has been staying here during the last week i asked  he made a further search and shook his head  we have not had the name of marx upon our books at all sir during my recollection he declared quite an uncommon name too i should certainly have remembered it  there have been letters addressed to him here by that name i said can you tell me what has become of them  he shook his head  that would not be in my department sir you will ascertain by inquiring at the headporters bureau round the corner  i thanked him and made my way thither across the reception hall the answer to my question was given at once  there are letters for a mr marx nearly every morning sir and telegrams said the official but i dont think that mr marx himself is stopping at the hotel another gentleman always applies for them and sends them on  and is the other gentleman staying here i asked  yes sir no 110  has he any authority to receive them from mr marx i inquired  i believe so he showed us a note from mr marx asking him to receive and forward them and he has to sign too for every one he receives it is a rule with us that anyone receiving letters not addressed to himself should do so whether he has authority or not  can you tell me his name i asked i am sorry to give you so much trouble but i particularly wish to ascertain mr marxs whereabouts and this gentleman knows it  certainly sir john what is no 110s name he asked an assistant  count de cartienne was the prompt reply                                   chapter xli                         the count de cartienne   my surprise at this last piece of information could not pass unnoticed both the hallporter and his assistant were evidently welltrained servants but they looked curiously at me and then exchanged rapid glances with one another i recovered myself however in an instant  this count de cartienne i asked is he young i think i know him rather dark and thin and short is that he  the man shook his head  no sir count de cartienne is a tall aristocraticlooking gentleman middleaged you are certain to see him about the hotel he is in and out a great deal  i thanked him and moved away for the people were beginning to flock in inquiring for their keys as it was nearly dinnertime i followed their example and went to my room to change my travelling clothes for more conventional attire  the lift was almost full when i entered it but as we were on the point of starting a lady followed by an elderly gentleman stepped in i rose at once being nearest the gate to offer my seat but the words which i had intended to speak died away upon my lips  something in the graceful figure the soft sweet eyes and the delicatelycut features seemed to remind me of my mother it was a faint resemblance perhapsscarcely more than a suggestionbut it was still enough to make my heart beat fast and to arrest for a moment my recollection of where i was then suddenly i remembered that i was behaving to say the least of it strangely and i turned abruptly away  at the third floor i stepped out and walked across the corridor to my room without glancing once behind but it was some time before i unpacked my portmanteau or even thought of dressing then i remembered that if they were dining at the hotel i should see them again and turning out my clothes at once i dressed with feverish haste for the moment i had forgotten all about count de cartienne forgotten even the very purpose of my visit to london only one face linked with a memory dwelt in my mind and usurped all my thoughts i felt a strange excitability stealing through my frame and the fingers which sought to fasten my tie shook so that they failed in their duty i seemed to have stepped into another state of being  when i descended into the diningroom it was already almost full and there were very few empty tables for a minute or two i stood behind the entrance screen looking around nowhere could i see any sign of the lady whose face had so interested me either she was dining away from the hotel or had not yet put in an appearance hoping devoutly that the latter was the case i took possession of a small table laid for three facing the door and ordered my dinner  i had scarcely finished my soup before an instinctive consciousness that i was being watched made me look quickly up standing just inside the room calmly surveying the assembled guests and myself in particular was a tall distinguishedlooking man perfectly cleanshaven rather fair than otherwise with a single eyeglass stuck in his eye through which he was coolly examining me he carried an inverness cape and an operahat and his evening clothes which fitted him perfectly were in the best possible taste even down to the plain gold stud in his shirt front his age might have been anything from thirty to fifty for his carriage was perfectly upright and his hair only slightly streaked with grey altogether his appearance was that of a wellturnedout wellbred man and as i glanced away i felt a little mild curiosity to know who he was  he came a few steps farther into the room and after a moments hesitation passed by a larger table laid for six and took the vacant seat at mine he wished me goodevening in a clear pleasant voice with a slight foreign accent resigned his coat and hat to a more than ordinarily attentive waiter and drawing a card from his pocket began deliberately to write out his dishes from the menu then he shut up his pencil and leaning back in his chair once more glanced round at the roomful of people having apparently satisfied his curiosity he yawned and turning towards me began to talk  soon i began to feel myself quite at home with him and to enjoy my dinner with a greatlyadded zest indeed in listening to some of his quaint recitals of adventures at foreign hotels i almost forgot to watch for the advent of the lady and gentleman for whom i had been looking out so eagerly only a few minutes before  as it happened however i saw them enter and my attention immediately wandered from the story which my companion was telling  something in the fragility of her appearance and the weight with which she leaned upon her husbands arm seemed to mark her as an invalid and this expression was in a measure heightened by her black lace dress which combined with the too perfect complexion and slight figure gave to her face an almost ethereal expression as i looked into the deep blue eyes i seemed again to be able to trace that vague likeness to my mother and i felt my heart beat fast as the impression grew upon me it was only when my new friend stopped abruptly in his anecdote and looked at me questioningly that i could withdraw my eyes from her  are they friends of yours who have just come in he asked without turning round  no i never saw them before this afternoon in my life i wonder if you could tell me who they are  he moved his chair a little so as to be able to do so without rudeness and looked round i happened to be watching him and i saw at once that he recognised them  strange to say the recognition seemed to afford him anything but pleasure a change passed over his face like a flash of lightning and although i only just caught it it made me feel for the moment decidedly uncomfortable while it lasted the face had not been a pleasant one to look upon but it was not that alone which troubled me during the moment that his expression had been transformed it had given me an odd disagreeable sense of familiarity  he was himself again almost immediatelyso soon that i could scarcely credit the changeand more than once afterwards i felt inclined to put that evil look and lowering brow down to a trick of my imagination even when i had decided to do so however i caught myself wondering more than once of whom they had reminded me  he moved his chair again and went on with his dinner in silence  you recognised them i ventured to remark  yes he answered curtly  would you mind telling me who they are then i persisted i feel interested in them  he looked up curiously and kept his eyes fixed on me while he answered my question  the man is lord langerdale an irish peer and the lady with him is his wife  thank you the ladys face reminded me of someone i knew once  he removed his eyes and his tone grew lighter  indeed rather an uncommon type of face too shes a lovely woman still though she looks delicate  i assented silently somehow i did not care to discuss her with this stranger  perhaps you noticed he went on after a short pause that it was rather a shock to me to see them here  yes i did notice that i admitted  he sighed and looked grave for a moment then he poured himself out a glass of champagne and drank it deliberately off  it was purely a matter of association he said in a low tone a somewhat painful incident in my life was connected with that family although with no present member of it pass the bottle and let us change the subject  we talked of other things and for a time all my former interest in his piquant anecdotes and trenchant remarks was renewed but while he was gravely considering with a waiter the relative merits of two brands of claret i found my eyes wandering to the table at our right in search of the woman whose face had so attracted me this time my eyes met hers  then a strange thing happened instead of looking away at once she kept her eyes steadily fixed upon me and suddenly gave a distinct start i saw the colour rush into her face and leave it again almost as swiftly her thin lips were slightly parted and her whole expression was one of great agitation i tried to look away but i could not i felt somehow forced to return her steady gaze but when she turned to her husband and touched him on the arm evidently to direct his attention to me the spell was broken and i moved my chair slightly making some casual remark to my companion which was sufficient to set the ball of conversation rolling again but one stolen glance a few moments later showed me that both husband and wife were regarding me attentively and several times afterwards when i looked over towards their table i met lady langerdales eyes full of a sad wistful and withal puzzled expression which i could not read  as dinner drew towards a close it occurred to me that my visàvis had studiously avoided turning once towards our neighbours if he desired to escape recognition however he was unsuccessful for just as we were beginning to think of quitting our places lord langerdale left his seat to speak to some acquaintances at the other end of the room and on his way back he looked straight into my companions face he started slightly hesitated and then came slowly up to our table  eugène he exclaimed by all thats wonderful is it really you why we heard that you had become an oriental and forsworn the ways and haunts of civilisation  he spoke lightly but it was easy to see that the meeting was a very embarrassing one for both of them  i have not been in england long was the quiet reply lady langerdale i am glad to see is well  she is fairly well how strange that we should meet here why it must be twenty years since i have seen you  i have spent but little time in england  i suppose not lord langerdale answered slowly we have heard of you occasionally will you come and speak to my wife  i think not was the calm reply it could only be very painful for both of us if lady langerdale desires itnot unlessi will call upon you at your rooms but frankly i would rather not  lord langerdale appeared by no means offended rather a little relieved and answered sadly  it is for you to choose if you can tell her that the past has lost some of its bitterness for you andand  he hesitated and seemed at a loss how to express himself my visàvis smileda smile of peculiar bitterness it wasand interrupted cynically  and that i am a reformed character i suppose you would say and have become a respectable member of society no no lord langerdale i am no hypocrite and i shall never tell her that a wanderer upon the face of the earth i have been during the best years of my life and a wanderer i shall always beadventurer some people have said well well let it be so what matter  lord langerdale shook his head doubtfully  i am sorry to hear you talk so eugène but of one thing you may always be sureelsie and i will never be your judges if you feel that it will reopen old wounds stop away but if not why come and see us you have a young friend with you he added turning slightly towards me and speaking a little more earnestly than the occasion seemed to require  the man whom he called eugène shook his head  i am not so fortunate he said stiffly i can claim no more than what on the continent we call a table acquaintance with this young gentleman  it might have been my fancy but it seemed to me that lord langerdale looked distinctly disappointed he bowed courteously to me however shook hands with his friend and rejoined his wife my new acquaintance resumed his former position and with it his old nonchalant manner  your pardon he said lightly for this long digression and now tell me mon ami shall we spend the evening together you are a stranger in london you say i am not he added drily come shall i be your cicerone  i really had nothing else to do so i assented at once  good let us finish the bottle to a pleasant evening but ah i forgot we must be introduced the english custom demands it even though we introduce ourselves your name is  morton i answeredphilip morton i havent a card  good then mr philip morton permit me the honour of introducing to youmyself i am called de cartiennethe count eugène de cartiennebut i do not use the title in this country                                  chapter xlii                            news of mr marx   for a moment or two i remained quite silent for the simple reason that i was far too astonished to make any remark my new acquaintance sat looking at me with slightlyraised eyebrows and carelessly toying with his eyeglass yet notwithstanding his apparent nonchalance i felt somehow aware that he was watching me keenly  my name appears to be a surprise to you he remarked keeping his eyes fixed steadily upon my face have you heard it before may i ask  yes i assented one of the fellows down at borden tower  what you know leonard he interrupted egad how strange then you are one of dr randalls pupils i suppose  yes i have only been there a very short time though and leonard is  my son  i looked at him intently now that the fact itself had been suggested to me i could certainly trace come faint likeness but what puzzled me most was that he seemed also to remind me although more vaguely of someone else whom i could not call to mind at all neither did he seem particularly anxious for me to assist him for as though somewhat annoyed at my close scrutiny he rose abruptly to his feet  come what do you say to cigarettes and coffee we are outstaying everybody here  i followed him downstairs into the smokeroom we seated ourselves upon a luxurious divan and the count immediately began to talk about his son  and so you know leonard how strange do you see much of one another  naturally considering that there are only three of us at dr randalls i reminded him  ah just so and your other fellow pupil is young lord silchester is he not rather an awkward number three do you all chum together pretty well  what was i to say i could not tell him that my relations with his son were decidedly inimical so after a moments hesitation i answered a little evasively  im afraid were not a very sociable trio you see cis and i are very keen on outofdoor amusements and your son rather prefers reading  he nodded  yes i quite understand you and lord silchester are thoroughly english and essentially so in your tastes and love of sport leonard now is more than half a foreigner his mother was an austrian lady and i myself am of french extraction by the by mr morton may i ask you a questionin confidence he added slowly  certainly  it is about leonard i dont think that you need have any scruples about telling me for i am his father you know and have a certain right to know everything about him  he looked at me gravely as though for confirmation of his words and i silently expressed my assent leonard de cartienne was nothing to me and if his father was going to ask me the question which i hoped he was he should have a straightforward answer  i sent my son to dr randalls he began sinking his voice to a confidential whisper not because he was backward in his studiesfor such is not i believe the casebut because he has unfortunately inherited a very deplorable taste i found it out only by accident and it was a very great shock to me leonard is fondtoo fondof playing cards for money i thought that at borden tower he would have no opportunity for indulging this lamentable weakness but from what i have recently heard about dr randall it has occurred to me that he is perhaps a little too much of the student and too little of the schoolmaster you understand me i mean that he is perhaps so closely wrapped up in his private work that after the hours which he gives to his pupils for instruction they may secure almost as much liberty as though they were at college  thats just it i answered and m de cartienne now that you have spoken to me of it i will tell you something your son does play a good deal with lord silchester i know that this is so for i have played myself occasionally  and lord silchester wins i presume  something in the counts tone as he asked the question and something in his face as i glanced up did not please me both seemed to tell the same tale both somehow seemed to imply that his question to me was altogether sarcastic and that he knew the contrary to be the case  it was the first gleam of mistrust which i had felt towards my new acquaintance and it did not last for the expression of deep concern and annoyance with which he heard my answer seemed too natural to be assumed  on the contrary your son always wins i told him drily  his finelypencilled dark eyebrows almost met in a heavy frown and he threw his cigarette away impatiently  im very much obliged to you mr morton for answering my question he said but i neednt tell you that im very sorry to hear what you say something must be done with mr leonard at once  he lit another cigarette and threw himself back in a corner of the divan then i made up my mind to speak to him on the subject which was uppermost in my mind  you know a mr marx i believe i was inquiring for him at the hotel office this afternoon and they told me that you were forwarding his letters could you give me his address  m de cartienne removed his cigarette from his teeth and looked dubious  yes i know marx know him well he admitted but your request puts me in rather an awkward position you see this is how the matter lies he added leaning forward confidentially marx and i are old friends and hes been of great service to me more than once and never asked for any return well i met himi wont say when but it wasnt long agoin pall mall and he hailed me as the very man he was most anxious to meet we lunched together and then he told me what he wanted he was in london for a short while he said and wished to remain perfectly incognito there would be letters for him he said at the metropole would i fetch them and forward them to him at an address which he would give me on condition that i gave him my word of honour to keep it secret i asked naturally what reason he had for going into hiding for virtually that is what it seemed to me to be but he would give me no definite answer would i do him this favour or not he asked and remembering the many services which he had rendered me i found it quite impossible to refuse that is my position im really extremely sorry not to be able to help you but you see for yourself that i cannot  his tone was perfectly serious and his manner earnest i had not the faintest shadow of doubt as to his sincerity  you cant help me at all then i said no doubt with some of the disappointment which i felt in my tone  he looked doubtful  well i dont quite know about that he said slowly as though weighing something over in his mind look here mr morton he added frankly enough what do you want with the man is it anything unpleasant  not at all i answered i do not wish any harm to mr marx unless he deserves it i want to ask him a few questions thats all unless the mans a perfect scoundrel he will be able to answer them satisfactorily and my having discovered his whereabouts will not harm him if on the other hand he cannot answer those questions why then you may take my word for it m de cartienne that hes an unmitigated blackguard perfectly unworthy of your friendship and undeserving of the slightest consideration from you  m de cartienne nodded and leaned forward with his arm across the divan  you put the matter very plainly he said and what you say is fair enough ill tell you how far i am prepared to help you i wont tell you mr marxs address because i have pledged my word not to divulge it but if you like ill take you where there will be a very fair chance of your seeing him  he is in london then  the count shrugged his shoulders and smiled slightly  permit me to keep my word in the letter if not in the spirit he answered i am going to spend my evening in this way i am going first of all to a theatre for an hour or so then i am going to call at a couple of clubs and afterwards i am going to a club of a somewhat different sort if you like to be my companion for the evening i shall be charmed and if it should happen that we run up against any friend of yourswell the world is not so very large after all  thanks ill come with you with pleasure i answered without hesitation  he stood up underneath the soft glare of the electric light and as i turned towards him something in his face puzzled me it was gone directly my eyes met hisgone but not before it had left a curious impression it seemed almost as though a triumphant light had flashed for an instant in his bright steelcoloured eyes                                  chapter xliii                               about town   we passed up the heavilycarpeted steps into the central hall of the hotel the count stopped for a moment to inquire for letters at the chief porters bureau and as we turned away we came face to face with lord langerdale  he hesitated when he saw us together but only for a moment then he advanced with a genial smile upon his wellcut handsome face  youre the very man i wanted to see de cartienne he said i suppose you know your young friends name by this time will you introduce us  the count looked distinctly annoyed but he complied at once  lord langerdale he said coldly this is mr morton mr mortonlord langerdale  lord langerdale held out his hand frankly and drew me a little on one side although not out of the counts hearing  mr morton he said pleasantly i am going to make a somewhat extraordinary request my only excuse for it is a ladys will and when you reach my age you will know that it is a thing by no means to be lightly regarded my wife has been very much impressed by what she terms a marvellous likeness between you andand a very near relative of hers whom she had lost sight of for a long while she is most anxious to make your acquaintance may i have the honour of presenting you to her  for a moment my head swam the likeness of lady langerdale to my mother and then this strange fancy on her part what if they should be something more than coincidences the very thought was bewildering but how could it be no the thing was impossible still the request was couched in such terms that there could be but one answer  i shall be extremely pleased i declared readily  then come into the drawingroom for a few minutes will you lord langerdale said goodnight eugène no use asking you to join us i know  count de cartienne turned on his heel with brow as black as thunder  goodnight lord langerdale he said stiffly goodnight mr morton  but i am coming with you you know i exclaimed surprised at his manner couldnt you wait for me five minutes  it is impossible he answered shortly we are late already my carriage must have been waiting half an hour i had no idea of the time  it was rather an embarrassing moment for me the count evidently expected me to keep my engagement with him and would be offended if i did not do so on the other hand lord langerdale was waiting to take me to his wife and from the slight frown with which he was regarding de cartienne i judged that he did not approve of his interference  inclination prompted me strongly to throw my engagement with the count to the winds and to place myself under lord langerdales guidance but after all the sole purpose of my journey to london was to discover mr marx and if i neglected this opportunity i might lose sight of the only man who could help me in my search clearly therefore my duty was to fulfil my prior engagement  if m de cartienne cannot wait i said regretfully i am afraid lord langerdale that the pleasure you offer me must be deferred would lady langerdale allow me to call at your rooms tomorrow  evidently he was displeased for his manner changed at once  i will leave a note for you with the hall porter he said goodnight  i turned away with the count who preserved a perfectly unmoved countenance before we had taken half a dozen steps however he was accosted by a gentleman entering the hotel and turning round he begged me to excuse him for a moment  i strolled away by myself waiting suddenly i felt a light touch on my arm and looking round i found lord langerdale by my side  i just want to ask you a question mr morton if youll allow me he said kindly remember that im an old manold enough to be your fatherand a man of the world and you are a very young one you wont mind a word of advice  most certainly not i assured him heartily  well then count de cartienne is quite a new acquaintance of yours is he not  i never saw him before this evening i admitted  and youpardon me but you look very young and a great deal too fresh and healthy for a town manyou dont know much of london life do you  nothing at all i answered this is my first visit to london and i only arrived this afternoon  lord langerdale looked very serious  look here mr morton he said earnestly i feel sure from your face that i can trust you and that what i am going to say you will consider in confidence i should be the last one to say anything against eugène de cartienne for he received a terrible injury from one of my family or rather my wifes family and i fear that has exercised an evil influence over his life but all the same i cannot see you a youngster perfectly inexperienced starting out to spend your first night in town with him without feeling it my duty to tell you that i consider him one of the most unfortunate and most dangerous companions whom you could have chosen there i hope youre not offended  how could i be i answered gratefully but i am not going out with him from choice or for the sake of amusement we are together simply because as far as i know he is the only man who can solve a mystery which i have come up to london to try to clear up  lord langerdale started and his manner became almost agitated  this is most extraordinary he declared mr morton you mustah here comes de cartienne he broke off in a tone of deep annoyance breakfast with me tomorrow morning at tenno nine oclock he added in a lower key i have something most important to say to you  i nodded assent and the count joined us  there was a faint flush on his pale cheeks and his eyes were flashing brightly as he looked at us standing close together it might have been the result of his recent conversation of course but coupled with his frowning brow and quick suspicious glance it looked a great deal more like a sudden fit of anger at seeing us engaged in what appeared like a confidential talk but there was no trace of it in his tone when he addressed us  really you two might be conspirators he said lightly well mr morton have you changed your mind or am i to have the honour of your company this evening  i am ready to start when you are i answered goodnight once more lord langerdale  he shook my hand warmly nodded to the count who returned the salute with a stiff bow and left us we descended into the street and a very small neat brougham drawn by a pair of dark handsome bays drew up at the entrance the coachmans livery was perfectly plain save that he wore a cockade in his hat and there was neither coatofarms nor crest upon the panel of the door we stepped inside and the count held a speakingtube for a moment to his mouth while he consulted his watch there was no footman  frivolity theatre he directed and we drove off at a smart pace into the strand  we reached our destination in a few moments and had no difficulty in obtaining seats it was all new to me and i felt a little bewildered as i endeavoured to follow the performance i soon had enough of that the piece was a screaming farce vulgar and stupid  i dont think mr marx is here i whispered to de cartienne  i dont think he is was the rejoinder i had a good look round for him when we came in have you had enough of this performance if so well go i think i know where we shall find marx  then let us go at once i urged  we passed out of the theatre into the street the brougham was there waiting for us  jump in said the count opening the door im going to tell the fellow where to drive to  i obeyed him and waited for nearly a minute before he had given his directions and joined me then he took his seat by my side and we drove quickly off  why did you not use the speakingtube i asked idly  he answered without looking at me  it is rather an outoftheway place he said slowly and i did not wish the man to make a mistake                                  chapter xliv                   a midnight excursion to the suburbs   during the earlier part of the evening since we had left the hotel my companion had shown no disposition to talk on the contrary his silence amounted almost to moroseness and he had not always answered my questions but immediately we had started on this new expedition his manner underwent a complete change he seemed to lay himself out with feverish eagerness to entertain me and to absorb my attention  i hope youre not tired he said suddenly at the end of one of his anecdotes we have rather a long drive before us  not in the least i assured him what is the place we are going to  a sort of private club in confidence ill tell you why it is so far out of the way some of the members are fond of playing a little high and have started a roulette board that sort of thing is best kept quiet you know  the place is a gamblingclub then  something of that sort he acknowledged i shouldnt dream of taking you there if it wasnt for the sake of meeting marx you understand  perfectly thanks save for that reason i shouldnt think of going  what an infernal night he exclaimed looking out of the carriage for a moment almost enough to give one the miserables come well shut it out he struck a match and turning round lit a lamp which was fixed at the back of the carriage then he quietly pulled down the blinds and began to tell me a story of which i heard not a word my thoughts were engrossed by another matter m de cartiennes action coupled with the strangeness of his manner could bear but one interpretation  he had some reason for keeping me as much as possible in the dark as to the route we were taking  for a few moments i felt to put it mildly uneasy then several possible explanations of such conduct occurred to me and my apprehensions grew weaker what more natural after all than that m de cartienne should desire to keep secret from me the exact whereabouts of an establishment which by his own admission was maintained contrary to the law the more i considered it the more reasonable such an explanation appeared to me i began to wonder even that he had not asked me for some pledge of secrecy but there was time enough for that  by degrees the rattling of vehicles around us grew less and less until at last all traffic seemed to have died away once during a pause in the conversation i raised the blind a little way and looked out we had left even the region of suburban semidetached villas and blurred though the prospect was by the mud which the fastrolling wheels drew incessantly into the air and on to the windowpanes i could just distinguish the dim outline of hedges and fields beyond  i looked at the carriageclock and found that we had been already an hour and a quarter on our journey from the furious pace at which we were travelling we must have come nearly fifteen miles  this place is a long way out i remarked  the count laughed and lit a cigarette oh theres a good reason for that but the men dont drive here from townat least not in the winter theres a railwaystation only a mile away  were almost there now then i suppose  he let the blind up with a spring and looked out  nearer than i imagined he remarked we shall be there in three minutes  he was just drawing in his head when he gave a visible start and leaned right out of the window with his face upturned to the beating rain listening intently  suddenly he withdrew it and snatching at the checkstring pulled it violently i looked at him in amazement his face was ghastly pale but his thin lips were set firmly together and his features rigid with determination it was the face of a brave desperate man preparing to meet some terrible danger  the carriage pulled up with a jerk and he leaped down into the road he did not speak to me so after a seconds hesitation i followed him and stood by his side there was no mistaking the sound which had alarmed him behind at no very great distance was the sound of galloping horses and the rumble of smoothlyturning wheels  round the corner it came a small brougham drawn by a pair of great thoroughbred horses whose heavy gallop even at fifty yards distance seemed to shake the ground beneath us m de cartienne snatched one of the carriagelamps from the bracket and stepping into the middle of the road waved it backwards and forwards over his head his action had the desired effect  quivering and plunging with fear the horses bathed in foam and mud came to a standstill before us and a tall fair man with a long fur coat thrown hurriedly over his eveningclothes leaped out into the road the count was by his side in a moment  i remained a little apart of course out of earshot but with my eyes fixed upon the two men  they could scarcely have spoken a hundred words before their colloquy was at an end the newcomer returned to his carriage and m de cartienne followed his example i looked at him as he stepped in anxious to see what effect the others news had had upon him apparently it was not so bad as he had feared for although he still looked anxious and pale his face had lost its ghastly hue  we drove on in the same direction as before when we had started he turned to me  do you know what a police raid is he asked  i shook my head  well i cant stop to explain he went on rapidly sir fredmy friend there has just brought down word of some strange rumours about the clubs tonight it seems the police have got to hear of this place and are going to pay it an uninvited visit they wont be here for an hour though so if you like just to come inside and see whether marx is there or not you will have time  we had turned off the road into a bare grassgrown avenue leading up to a redbrick house unilluminated by a single light  we were barely a minute driving up this uninviting approach and pulling up at the grim closed door the carriage had scarcely come to a standstill before the count was on the doorstep fitting a curiouslyshaped key into the lock it yielded at once and we both stepped inside followed by the man in the fur overcoat whose carriage had pulled up close behind ours  we were in perfect darkness and no one seemed to be stirring in the house although the mat under our feet in some way connected with an electric alarm bell was giving shrill notice of our arrival then we heard swift feet approaching and a tall hardfeatured woman in a plain black gown and holding a lamp high over her head appeared before us  m de cartienne took her by the arm and led her on one side the other man who was making vain attempts to appear at his ease and composed sank into a chair palpably trembling of the real nature of the danger which was imminent i could form only the slightest idea but that it was something very much to be feared i could easily gather from his agitation and de cartiennes manner  suddenly the latter turned round  ackland he said quickly to the man in the chair eyeing him keenly and with a shade of contempt in his tone you are not fit for any of the serious work i can see listen light up the clubroom and the smokeroom stir up the fires bring out the cards and wineglasses empty some tobaccoash about make the place look habitable for us when we come ferdinand is on the watch outside and will give you notice of our visitors ring all three alarmbells at once if he gives the signal morton i want you to wait for me ill send you away all right before anything happens but dont go unless you see me againunless youre frightened  he turned on his heel and without waiting for any answer from either of us hurried away down the passage the man whom he had called ackland rose from his seat and striking a match lighted the gasbrackets all around the hall and the burners of a candelabra which hung from the roof  my companion then threw open a door and i followed him into a luxuriouslyappointed room furnished with a suite of lounges and easychairs corresponding with those in the hall  whilst i was looking round he hastily began moving the chairs about as though they had been recently used poking the fire and generally making the place look inhabited having done this he crossed the hall and entered the opposite room it was a little smaller but similarly appointed and decorated save that a long table covered with a white cloth and laid for dinner stood in the centre and a smaller one with a green baize covering at the further end my companion threw a pack of cards and some counters upon the latter and drew it closer up to the fire then having placed some chairs around it he went back into the hall again and i followed  all the while we had been moving about strange noises had been going on under our feet now and then the sound of hurrying footsteps and of hoarse voices reached us and more often still the steady rumbling of heavy articles being moved about i looked at my companion for an explanation but he did not seem inclined to offer one  whats going on underneath i asked at last  bowls he answered curtly dont talk please i want to listen                                   chapter xlv                         a mysterious commission   the underground noises continued for about a quarter of an hour during which time my companion busied himself by removing from the clubroom various articlesthe false top of a table marked out in a curious fashion several mahogany boxes and other contrivances strange to me but presumably gambling appliances with all of which he disappeared through the door by which de cartienne had made his exit returning again directly  at last everything was quiet ominously quiet then the door from the hall was thrown suddenly open and the count entered followed by four or five other men they were all apparently gentlemen and in evening clothes but terribly soiled and disordered some were splashed with mud from head to foot some had their shirtfronts blackened and crumpled and the hands of all of them were black with grease and dirt all looked more or less pale and nervousin fact m de cartienne was the only one who thoroughly retained his composure  there was a lavatory on the other side of the staircase towards which the whole of the little party trooped m de cartienne being the last as he disappeared he looked round and beckoned me to follow him i did so and stood by his side while he plunged his head into some cold water and then began to wash his hands  im sorry this should have happened tonight morton he said marx was here but has bolted in a fright  couldnt i catch him up i asked  de cartienne shook his head  no hes in the train by this time he comes here every night though ill bring you down tomorrow perhaps  are you coming back now i asked  no i must see this thing through you can go and at once though my carriage will take you back i shall return by train by the by theres a small favour i want to ask you  certainly  i have kept a few private papers here which i should not care to have examined should the search really take place i want you to take them back to the hotel for me the box is a little too heavy for me to carry so i have told them to put it in the carriage as a footstool for you you wont mind that  not in the least i replied when shall i see you again  at the hotel some time tomorrow come along now he added putting on his coat  he strolled with me to the front door and throwing it open listened intently  there was no sound save the moaning of the wind in the bare trees which stood by the side of the house and the patter of the fastfalling rain i stepped into the carriage and the count came to the window to me  dont forget he said pointing to a long oblong box secured by a strong lock draw the rug a little more over your kneesso  i obeyed him and let it hang down to hide the box which i began to see was his object  and if you should meet anyone and they should be impertinent enough to ask you where you are going dont tell them give them your card and tell them to go to the devil if they are very pressing indeed you must tell a lie say that youve been to dine with sir sedgwick bromley at hatherly hall dont forget the name  very well are you coming back to the metropole tonight i asked  i think so but if you dont mind i should be glad if you would have the box taken up into your room and keep it for me i shouldnt like anything to happen to it  i promised but without much alacrity we shook hands and the carriage drove off                                  chapter xlvi                         a brush with the police   we could scarcely have accomplished more than a mile of our homeward journey when with a sudden jerk which almost threw me forward the carriage was brought to a standstill  on the opposite side of the road were two carriages or rather flys from one of which a tall slim man was in the act of descending several other men on horseback were just riding up from behind they were all in plain clothes but something about their physique and general appearance had an unmistakable suggestion of police  the man who had been descending from the nearer of the two carriages crossed the road and approached me  sorry to detain you sir he said saluting in military fashion but i must ask you your name and address and where you have been this evening  i dont know whether it has occurred to you that your behaviour is rather strange i remarked looking at him steadily not to say impertinent what the mischief do you mean by stopping my carriage in this way on the high road and asking me questions like that who are you  he hesitated and then answered with a little more respect in his manner  i am deputy chief sergeant at scotland yard sir and these are my men we have a little business at a house not far from here and our orders are to detain and procure the names and addresses of all persons whom we might encounter of whom we had reasonable suspicion that they had recently left the house in question you will not object to give me your name sir  certainly not my name is philip morton and my general address is ravenor castle leicestershire at present i am staying at the metropole hotel are you satisfied  perfectly sir he answered after one more rapid glance around the carriage i see that you are not concerned in this affair i wish you goodnight  we drove rapidly off and i began to feel not a little dissatisfied with myself the count had no right to have mixed me up in this affair  in my illtemper i gave the box which lay concealed under my feet a savage kick sufficient to have sent it flying to the other end of the carriage but there was a little surprise in store for me to my amazement the box remained perfectly immovable just as though it had been screwed into the bottom of the carriage  forgetting the counts earnest injunctions i threw aside the rug and stooping down tried to lift it by the handles in those days i was proud of my muscles and not altogether without reason but it needed all my strength to lift that small box from the ground and hold it for a moment in my arms what could it contain papers cards gambling appliances surely it could be none of these the very idea was ridiculous the count de cartienne had deceived me i had been made the catspaw of those pale anxious men who had watched me start so eagerly and scanned me over with many furtive glances what it was of which i was in charge i could not tell but in that box lay their secret and my first indignant impulse was to open the carriage door and kick it out into the road  but are not second thoughts always better might not this affair shape itself to my advantage there need be no more obligations to the count de cartienne he was possessed of information which was valuable to me i was possessed of this box which without doubt was invaluable to him i would propose an exchangehe should bring me face to face with mr marx and receive his precious box or if he refused to do so its destination should be scotland yard a very equitable arrangement                                  chapter xlvii                              light at last   we were in london again bowling smoothly along wide stretches of silent gaslit streets empty and almost deserted now for it was past two oclock  soon we turned sharply into northumberland avenue and pulled up at the hotel the man on the boxfootman i suppose he was although he was not in liveryopened the carriagedoor for me and then took possession of the small trunk  if you will allow me sir i will take this up to your room he said  you neednt trouble i answered i can manage  he retained possession of it  the counts orders were sir that i should not allow the hotel servants to meddle with it and that if possible i should myself see it deposited in your room you have no objection sir i hope  not at all i answered turning away in fact the less i have to do with it the better  we entered the hotel and crossing the hall rang for the lift  the lift came to a standstill at the third floor and we stepped out on to the corridor the counts servant followed me to my room deposited the box on a chair at the foot of the bed and wished me goodnight  i then got into bed and full of excitement though the day had been for me slept soundly till morning  it was five minutes past nine when i entered the great salon of the hotel and looked round for lord langerdale  my search was not a long one he was sitting alone at a table laid for three in one of the deep recesses with a little pile of letters and a newspaper before him directly he saw me he pushed them away and held out his hand  goodmorning he said pleasantly im glad to see youre so punctual youre not in a hurry for breakfast for a few minutes are you  not at all i answered taking the chair which he pushed towards me  thats right my wife will be down in a quarter of an hour and well wait for her if you dont mind  i bowed my assent murmuring that i should be delighted which was perfectly true  lord langerdale turned a little round in his chair so as to face me and began at once  i am rather a blunt sort of man mr mortonwe irish generally are you knowand i like to go straight at a thing will you tell me your mothers maiden name  i would with pleasure if i knew it i answered readily but i dont  is she alive  i shook my head  she died about nine months ago  and morton is your name may i ask who your father was  certainly he was a farmer in leicestershire  a farmer lord langerdale looked surprised and i fancied a little disappointed was he your mothers first husband  i was about to answer in the affirmative but remembered that i had no certain knowledge so i corrected myself  you may think it strange lord langerdale i said but i know nothing of my mothers antecedents nor of her family from my earliest recollection she never mentioned her past nor permitted others to do so there was some mystery connected with it i am sure but what it was i have no clue  i could not help observing as everyone else did that she was far above my father from a social point of view for she was an educated lady and he was only a small tenant farmer throughout all her life she was reticent and her last act before she died was a paradox she left me to the guardianship of the man whom she had always before seemed to dread and fear  what is his name  mr ravenor of ravenor castle we were tenants of his  my god  lord langerdales whole appearance was that of a man strongly agitated he turned his head away for a moment and the long white fingers which supported it were shaking visibly  i too was moved for it seemed as though the time were come at last when something of my mothers history would be made known to me but he seemed in no hurry to speak again it was i who had to remind him of my presence  lord langerdale i cried my voice despite all my efforts trembling with eagerness you know who my mother was you can tell me her history  he turned round slowly  one more question he said are you sure that you were born at ravenor  i have never heard otherwise i told him but when i asked my mother once at which church i was christened she could not tell me and forbade me to ask again  lord langerdale looked puzzled for a moment and then asked me my age which i told him  do you remember the time when news came of mr ravenor after he had been supposed to have been dead for so long  yes it is about my earliest distinct recollection i answered  do you remember how your mother received the news  yes i remembered even at that moment a vision rose up before me i saw her standing beneath the ivycovered porch of our farmhouse her beautiful face ghastly with sudden pallor and her wild eyes riveted upon my fathers burly figure as he shouted out the tidings i described the scene to lord langerdale  and afterwards did she ever mention mr ravenors name to you did she see anything of him he asked when i had finished  briefly i told him of her warnings of my meeting with mr ravenor of his proposal to adopt me and of my mothers death and how at the end she suddenly turned round and left me to his guardianship when i had finished he laid his hand upon my arm  let us go upstairs to my rooms he said kindly if my wife were to come in now and learn the truthand im a bad hand at keeping anything back from herim afraid the shock would be too much for her come with me and i will tell you your mothers history  so i rose and followed him with beating heart                                 chapter xlviii                            a page of history   lord langerdales suite of apartments was on the second floor and when we reached them it was no small relief to me to find the room into which we turned empty i sank mechanically into the chair to which he pointed whilst he himself remained standing a few feet away from me  from what you have told me he said gravely i have not the least doubt but that my wife and your mother were sisters  i gave a little gasp and began to wonder whether this was not all a wild dream lord langerdale remained silent whilst i recovered myself in some measure  will you tell me about it i asked slowly i dont understand  i will tell you everything lord langerdale said kindly this is a great surprise to you of course and quite as great a one to me here is the storyor rather as much as i know of it  he cleared his throat and took a chair by my side everything else in the room except his face was blurred and indistinct and his voice seemed to come to me from a long distance but every word he uttered sank into my heart  your grandfather was a very poor and very proud english baronetsir arthur montavon my wife elsie and your mother were his only children and they were twins they were presented at court together created an equal sensation and were at once allowed to be the beauties of the season this was the time when i first knew them so it is here that i begin my tale  six months after their appearance in society elsie was engaged to be married to me but your mother seemed to be more difficult to please she refused several very good offers and at the end of her first season she was still free  i dont know exactly how or where she first met him lord langerdale continued slowly but before the following spring your mother was betrothed to the count de cartienne at that time he was one of the richest the bestlooking and most popular men about town there seemed to be nothing which he could not do no art in which he was not proficient and he was passionately in love with your mother whether she ever really cared for him i cannot tell but if she did it could only have been a very transitory feeling  the marriageday was fixed and was a general topic of conversation i even believe that your mother had begun to prepare her trousseau when something happened count de cartienne was deposed from his post of chief favourite in society which he at one time held by a younger and more extraordinary man that man was  mr ravenor i exclaimed  lord langerdale nodded  i dont think he went on that you can possibly imagine from the mr ravenor of today what he was when he became the rage of london society he had just returned from his first journey in the east after some perilous adventures which had filled the columns of the newspapers for weeks and had already created a strong curiosity about him i met him i think on the first evening he entered a london drawingroom and i will never forget it  he was as handsome as a greek god with limbs magnificently developed by his hardy vigorous life and rigid asceticism with the head of a byron the manners of a grandison and the fire and eloquence of a burke when he chose to open his mouth  men and women alike were fascinated which was all the more remarkable as he sought no intimate amongst the former and studiously avoided compromising himself with any of the latter although heaven knows he had no lack of opportunity the only man with whom he seemed to be on at all friendly terms was de cartienne and the only woman to whom he paid any save the most ordinary attention was your mother  lord langerdale paused for several moments and seemed wrapped in a brown study from which my impatience aroused him he continued at once  things went on smoothly for a time and then rumours began to get about at first there were only faint whispers but presently people began to talk openly count de cartienne had better beware they said or he would lose his bride at first he treated all such suggestions with contempt but the time came when he was forced to consider them seriously  mr ravenor published a small volume of poems anonymously amongst which were some passionate lovesonnets addressed to a m everyone was talking of the book and wondering who the new poet was when through some treachery in the publishers office the secret leaked out and everyone then knew that those thrilling lovesongs were addressed to alice montavon  de cartienne went straight to mr ravenor and demanded an explanation mr ravenor acknowledged the authorship of the poems and did not deny that the verses in question were addressed to your mother further than that he would not say a word and simply referred de cartienne to her  he went straight to her poor fellow and was met with a piteous entreaty that he would release her from her engagement she loved mr ravenor and could marry no one else what followed remains to some extent a secret but this much we know  there was a furious scene between de cartienne and your mother which ended in his refusing to give her up and threatening to shoot his rival if ever he saw them together again sir arthur montavon who was deeply in de cartiennes debt swore that the marriage should take place and apparently they gained their end for mr ravenor suddenly disappeared and it was reported that he had left the country on the very day before the wedding however society was furnished with a still more sensational piece of scandal your mother left her home secretly and the companion of her flight was mr ravenor  i could sit still no longer but rose and walked up and down the room with quick unsteady strides lord langerdale watched me with a great and growing pity in his honest face there was silence between us for several minutes during which after one keen restless look of inquiry i kept my face turned away from his then he continued his story in a somewhat lower key  for two days de cartienne was virtually a maniac then he seemed suddenly to come to his senses and i think we allelsie and i especiallydreaded his terrible set calmness more even than his previous fury he made no wild threats nor did he talk to anyone of his intentions but we all knew what they were and when he left london secretly and alone we trembled for we knew that he was going in search of your mother he needed no help for he was himself a born detective and possessed in a marvellous degree the art of disguising himself  every day we searched the newspapers anxiously dreading lest we should read of the tragedy which we feared was inevitable but we heard nothing the weeks crept on into months and the months to years and still we heard nothingnot even from your mother  we advertised made every possible form of inquiry but in vain then came the news of mr ravenors shipwreck and supposed death and we concluded that your mother had perished with him i accepted a foreign appointment and only returned to england after ten years absence last week i heard at once of mr ravenors marvellous return to life and i wrote to him the only reply i received was a single sentence  you can tell your wife that her sister is dead i have no more to say  only yesterday to my amazement i met de cartienne again and with him you who i felt sure from the beginning must be alices son it may seem strange to you that i should know so much and yet know no more but it is so  i turned round and faced him slowly  do you mean to say then that after her elopement my mother never once communicated with her father or sister  only in this way she left a private message for my wife telling her through whom to forward a letter but not disclosing her whereabouts sir arthur montavon intercepted the message and took advantage of it to write a cruel stern letter forbidding her ever to appear in his presence again or to address him or her sister and i am sorry to say that at his command my wife too wrote in a censorious vein hoping to make up for it by sending another letter a few days afterwards the first letter your mother received the second missed her she inherited a good deal of her fathers firmness almost severity of disposition and i have no doubt that the receipt of those letters would lead her to cut herself off altogether from her family  then you do not even know where she and mr ravenor were married i asked huskily  lord langerdale shook his head and i noticed that he failed to look me in the face i braced myself up with a great effort  lord langerdale i said quietly this is a matter of life or death to me you seem to avoid my question answer me this have you any reason to suppose thatthat there was no marriage  none at all he answered quickly but my dear boy he went on coming over to my side and resting his hand upon my shoulder it is always as well to be prepared for the worst i will tell you how it has seemed to me sometimes mr ravenor had very peculiar views with regard to marriage something similar to those shelley held in his youth and we never heard of any ceremony which seems strange then too their separation and your mothers marriage to a farmer her stern lonely life afterwards and the fact that your birth has been kept concealed from you  he hesitated and seemed to gather encouragement from my face i could not i would not for a moment share his fear when i thought steadfastly about it i thought of my mother dying with a saintlike peace upon her face in mr ravenors arms i thought of the calm sorrowful dignity of her life and the idea refused for a moment to linger in my mind some other great cause for estrangement there must have been between them but not thatnot that  i will go down and see ravenor today lord langerdale declared with sudden energy i will wrest the truth from him  i shook my head  this matter lies between him and me only i said in a low tone i will go to him  the handle of the door was softly turned and lady langerdale stood upon the threshold her husband went over to her at once  elsie he said you were right there are many things which yet remain in darkness but this is alices boyyour sisters son  she came up to me with outstretched hands and a wistful look in her sweet womanly face  my heart stood still for a moment and then gave a great throb as i felt the warm clasp of her hands and the tremulous touch of her lips upon my forehead  i knew that i had reached a crisis in my life and though it had brought with it a great fear it had also brought a great joy for it seemed as though the days of my loneliness were over  could i doubt it when i looked into lady langerdales face and felt my uncles warm handclasp there was a sweetness about such a thought hard for another to realise and for a moment i gave myself up to it whilst lord langerdale briefly told his wife the few particulars which i had been able to give him of my mother and myself i stood between the two keenly conscious of and enjoying the change which seemed hovering over my life  but afterwards i remembered the ordeal which i had yet to face and the mission which had brought me to london and they saw the gladness die slowly out of my face  lord langerdale questioned me concerning it and then i told them everythingtold them of our suspicions in connection with mr marx and of my determination to find him out and discover whether he had been guilty of foul play towards the man hart  when i came to my last nights adventure with count de cartienne lord langerdale looked very grave  it seems to me he declared that this is more a matter for the police than for you to mix yourself up in  i shook my head of one thing i did feel confident although as regards the whole of the rest of the affair i was in a complete maze  however anxious mr ravenor might be for the truth concerning the missing man to be discovered he had strong reasons for not wishing the police to take part in the search i felt sure of that and was determined to act accordingly  lord langerdale was not easily reassured  i dont like the idea of your having anything whatever to do with de cartienne in all the circumstances he said with a shudder he can have but one feeling for you and a more dangerous man does not breathe it is an evil chance that has brought you together                                  chapter xlix                             i will go alone   we all sat down to breakfast together lord langerdale divided his attention between his breakfast and the times  are you going shopping today elsie he asked looking up from his paper  she glanced at him inquiringly  i think so why  be very careful about your change then there has never been so much bad money about as just now the papers are full of the most startling rumours coining must be going on in london somewhere upon an enormous scale and the police are why philip whats the matter with you  i recovered myself promptly and set down the cup which i had been within an ace of spilling  the coffee was a little hot i said slowly it was very stupid of me  he went on reading and lady langerdale began to talk to me but my attention was wandering it was a strange idea which had occurred to me perhaps a ridiculous one yet it was possessed of a certain fascination  in the middle of breakfast a waiter brought me a note lady langerdales permission was given unasked and i tore it open it was from de cartienne and the contents though brief were to the point    my dear mortoni have seen the man whom you are seeking and i know   for certain where he will be tomorrow night my carriage shall call   for you at ten oclock in the eveningtomorrow mind not this   eveningand if you care to come i will bring you to him by the by   you might as well bring with you the box which you were good enough to   take care ofyours                                                            e de c  i handed it to lord langerdale who adjusted his glasses and read it through carefully  i dont like it he remarked when he had finished dont like it at all take my advice philip send him his box or whatever it is and dont go  i shook my head  i must find out about mr marx i answered and i know of no other means that will be tomorrow night you know today  yes what are we going to do today lord langerdale interrupted  i answered him without hesitation  i am going down to ravenor castle  he looked surprised a little agitated  i shall go with you lord langerdale suddenly declared alice was my sisterinlaw and if ravenor deserted or illused her i have the right to call him to account for it  and i a better one i reminded him quietly grant me this favour please i must go alone and see himalone  he looked at his wife and she inclined her head towards me  the boy is right she said softly it is his affair not ours it will be better for him to go alone                                    chapter l                            i meet my father   after a wearying journey i stood at last before the great gates of the castle the bell at my feet giving shrill notice of my presence the lodgekeeper hurried out and welcomed me  i walked swiftly up the winding ascent straight across the flagged courtyard and entered the castle by a sidedoor then heedless of the surprised looks of the servants i made my way to the library and knocking softly at the door of the inner room entered  at first it seemed to me that he was not there for the chamber was in semidarkness the heavilyshaded lamp which stood upon the writingtable was turned down so low as to afford no light at all and the fitful glow of the firelight left the greater part of the room in shadow but as i stood upon the threshold a burning coal dropped upon the hearth and by its flame i saw him leaning back in a high oak chair a few feet away  softly i moved across the room towards him and then i saw that he was asleep  i made no movement but somehow he seemed to become conscious of my presence and opened his eyes they fell upon me standing on the hearthrug before him and he sat up with a start  philip he cried you here you back you have found him then  at the sound of his voice i trembled yet i answered him at once  not yet tomorrow night i shall see him till then i could do nothingand i came here he looked at my mudbespattered boots and windtossed hair  you have walked from mellborough he asked then something in my face seemed to strike him and leaning forward he placed his hands upon my shoulders and turned towards the glow of the fire  you have come with a purpose he said slowly tell meyou have heard something in london  i bowed my head silently  some story of the pastmy past  yes  my god  then there was silence between us i bore it till i could bear it no longer  can you wonder that i have come i cried my voice shaking with a passion which i knew no longer how to restrain oh speak to me tell me whether this thing is true  it is true  he had drawn back a little he had hesitated i caught hold of his hands and drew him towards me  my father i cried passionately speak to me why do you draw away is it becausebecauseoh only speak to me call me your son and if there be anything to forgive i will forgive it  he seemed suddenly to abandon an unnatural struggle and caught me by the hands and clasped them for a moment his face was radiant  philip my son my dear son he cried thank god it is not that thank god that my name is yours you are indeed my son  after a considerable silence my father told me how he had met marx abroad he had done him some service and they had become friendly he latterly engaged him as secretary  then he went on to tell me how marx had met him on his return after his long absence and had taken him to see his wife who believed him dead  he then told me how he had found her married again to farmer morton and implored her to come back to him she refused and he in a blind fury rushed back to where he had left marx  he was attacked by morton a struggle ensued on the brink of the slatepit after a time my father managed to fling morton from him and fled  that night marx came to him and told him he had thrown morton into the quarry and that a man named hart alias francis had witnessed the deed my father wanted to confess but marx persuaded him to keep silent and paid francis to bear the crime  now you know why i shrank from calling you my son knowing that when the time came for you to be told of your parentage i must also tell you that your father was a murderer  it is false i cried springing up and seizing both his hands it was an accident no one could call it a murder oh my father my father that you should have suffered like this for so slight a cause  a light leaped into his face and for a moment his wasted features and sunken eyes glowed and shone with a great unexpected happiness he drew me gently to him and laid his hands upon my shoulders  thank god for this philip he said with trembling voice it is greater consolation than i ever dared hope for in this world                                   chapter li                                  dawn   on the morrow as we walked out together my father and i making our way as though by common consent up towards the bare brown hills i remembered that there were many things which i wished to say to him  i want to ask you about mr marx father i began everything concerning him is so utterly mysterious especially his going away so suddenly apart from the fear of his having used some sort of foul play towards hartor francisi cant help thinking that there is something else wrong with him you trust him thoroughly i suppose i added hesitatingly  i have always done so my father answered quietly  do you like the man himself i asked  my father shrugged his shoulders indifferently  i cannot say that he has ever aroused my feelings in any way he answered he has had work to do for me and has done it well and silently i have looked upon him somewhat as an automaton although a valuable one and yet he added musingly  yet what i interrupted  well sometimes i have half fancied that he was playing a part that his interest in our work was a little strained he gave me the idea of a man working steadily forward towards a set purpose and i have never seemed able to reconcile that purpose with the completion of our task his sudden absences toofor this is not the first of themare strange  i should think so i assented has he taken anything away with him this time i asked bluntly  a very grave look came into my fathers face and he did not answer me at once when he did so his tone was low and anxious  yes he has about a fortnight ago we came to the end virtually of our long task there was only a little revision wanted which he was to have left for me the night that he disappeared the manuscript disappeared also evidently he took it away with him  perhaps he has taken it to the publishers i suggested my father shook his head doubtfully  only this morning i have heard from them begging me to forward it without delay he said  i was silent even if he had taken the manuscript what use could he make of it how could it profit him  suddenly i stood still in the path my heart gave a great leap and a cry broke from my lips for the first time an idea the vague phantom of an idea swept in upon me carrying all before it and casting a brilliant lurid light upon all that seemed so dark and mysterious  this man marx i cried seizing my fathers arm tell me quickly has he ever reminded you of anyone  my father looked at me wonderingly  it is strange that you should ask that he said sometimes especially when i have come upon him alone or have seen him excited his tone and little mannerisms have seemed somehow vaguely familiar and yet he added thoughtfully i have never been able to recall of whom they have reminded me  i opened my trembling lips to speak but a wave of cold doubt swept in upon me surely this thing could not be i must be mad to let the idea linger for a moment in my mind and yet  at that moment of my hesitation my fathers hand fell heavily upon my arm he pointed forward along the dark avenue with a shaking finger in the dim twilight we could see the tall gaunt figure of a man in ragged clothes making his way up to the castle  that is not one of my men philip he said hoarsely who is it  i shook my head  it is a stranger  my father turned abruptly from the avenue into a sidewalk  follow me he said we will go in by the private way  we walked across the turf through a little iron gate which my father unlocked and entered the shrubbery walk  once i looked round through an opening in the laurel leaves the stranger was leaning wearily against the railings round the lodge waiting for admittance                                   chapter lii                            where is mr marx   not until we had reached the castle and were in the library did my father speak to me then his words were grave enough  we have done mr marx an injury philip he said slowly  how i asked  listen and you will know  he went to the telephone and signalled the answer came at once  someone has been asking for me at the gate he said who is it  a stranger sir to see you  what name  hart sir  is he waiting  yes sir i told him that it would be useless but he refuses to go away  you can pass him send him here at once  my father turned away and looked at me with all the old weariness in his face but with little agitation of the two i was the more nervous i crossed the room and laid my hand gently upon his shoulder  thank god that i am here with you what shall you say to him father what does he want think you money  my father shook his head sadly  he would send if that were all he has what he wants and that is not much i fear that he wants something else  what  his good name cleared  he took the guilt willingly i cried he must bear it now he cannot escape from it  he can my father answered he can tell the truth  no one would believe him it would be his word against yours what chance would he have  my father turned a stern dark face upon me  so you think that i would swear to a lie philip no there was always this risk i have felt that if ever he should demand to be set right with the world it must be done  it shall be done  we started for the words came from the other side of the room standing in the deep shadows just inside the door was a tall gaunt man with long dishevelled beard and pale ghastly face his clothes were ragged and weatherstained and his boots were thick with mud i looked towards him fascinated it was the face of the lunatic who had twice attempted mr marxs life it was hart alias francis the man who held in his hands a life dearer to me than my own  is it really you francis my father asked in a shocked tone you are altered you have been ill sit down  he took no notice whilst my father had been speaking his eyes had been wandering restlessly round the room  where ishe he asked hoarsely  do you mean mr marx i said  yes  he is in london  ah  there was an expression in his face partly of disappointment partly of relief he drew a long breath and remained silent as though waiting to be questioned  do you want money my father asked  no  do you want to give up your secret to let the world know the truth  yes  a cry burst from my lips but my father checked me  it is well he said sit down you need not fear i will confess  you have nothing to confess it is i who must do that  what do you mean my father asked peering forward into the darkness for there was no lamp lit in the room come nearer i cannot see your face  with trembling fingers i drew up the blind from the high window the moon which had just emerged from a bank of black flying clouds cast a long stream of light across the room  francis moved forward with slow reluctant steps then with a sudden wild cry he threw himself upon his knees before my father  as god in heaven forgives swear that you will forgive me he cried passionately  forgive i have nothing to forgive my father answered gently you wish to lay down your burden good i am ready to take it up  he stooped forward in his chair and stretched out his hand to the man to help him rise in his altered position the moonlight seemed to cast a sort of halo round his face and it seemed to me like the face of an angel  dont touch me cried the man dont i cant bear it let me tell you the truth or i shall die you think that you killed farmer morton its false mr marx killed him  what  my father had sprung to his feet somehow i found myself by his side francis still grovelled on the floor  up man and tell me all the truth my father cried out in a voice of thunder up on your feet and speak like a man  he obeyed at once trembling in every limb then he faltered out his story  i was in the wood that night it was dark i lost my way suddenly i heard voicesyours and mortons you were struggling within a few feet of me before i could interfere you had thrown him down and rushed away i heard him breathing hard and i saw mr marx steal out from behind a tree and creep up to him morton heard too and sprang up they struggled together perhaps in the darkness morton mistook him for you i remembered the quarry and rushed out i was too late  there was a fearful flash of lightning and i saw marx put forth all his strength and throw the other into the slatepit he turned round and saw me  he would have hurled me over too if he had dared but i was strong and he was exhausted so he offered me money to go away i accepted never thinking that they would fix the crime upon me marx had thought it all out with a devilish cunning he provided me with disguises and told me where to go to and how to get there when i was safe away and read the papers i saw at once how i had been trapped i had pleaded guilty to the murder  time went on and i grew more miserable every day marx sent me plenty of moneytoo much i began to drink i was ill when i recovered i wrote to tell him that i could bear it no longer and that i was coming to see him i told him that i meant to go to a magistrate after i had given him time to get out of the country he dared me to come to the castle still i came it was dusk when i got here he met me in the avenue he offered me large sums of money to go away but i was determined and refused everything it was then from something he let fall in his anger that i knew how he had been deceiving you then i would not listen to him any more and bade him stand out of the way he let me pass him and then struck me on the back of the head with some heavy weapon  my god i cried i was close to you i heard you cry and i met mr marx directly afterwards he must have thrown you down the gravelpit  it was there i found myself when i came to my senses francis continued directly i sat up and tried to think over what had happened i began to feel my head swim after that everything is blurred and dim in my mind i fled the second time you mr morton saved his life from me as my fingers were closing upon his throat  they put me in an asylum afterwards mr marx passed himself off as my brother and had me moved into a private one the commissioners came and i appeared before them i was sane they let me go where is mr marx where is mr marx  there was a deep silence then i held out my hand to my father and he clasped it  thank god i cried my voice quivering with a great sobthank god  amen my father repeated softly  again that question in the same dry hard tone  where is mr marx  we looked at himat his nervously twitching hands and burning eyes the madness was upon him again we must not let him go my father drew me on one side  i shall go to london with you tonight he said what shall we do with this man  he must stay here i answered leave it to me  i went up to him and laid my hand upon his shoulder  listen francis i said there are two places where mr marx is likely to be this week one is in london the other here do you understand  yes he answered i understand  now mr ravenor and i know best where to find him in london but we cant leave unless we know that there is someone on the lookout here as well if we go to london will you remain here and watch for him  the mans eyes sparkled  yes he answered quickly this is the room where he writes isnt it he will come here yes i will wait i will watch here in this room  my father rang a bell and ordered a carriage to take us to the station then he gave special orders about francis he was to be allowed to remain in the library to use mr ravenors own sleeping apartment and to have meals brought to him regularly  an hour later we left the castle for torchester as we drove across the courtyard we could see a pale gaunt figure standing at the library window silent and rigid it was francis waiting                                  chapter liii                        messrs higgenson and co   at ten oclock we reached st pancras travelling by fast train from torchester and half an hour later a hansom put us down at the hotel metropole immediately in front of the entrance count de cartiennes small brougham was waiting and as we descended from the cab his servant stepped forward and handed me a note i tore it open and read it under the gaslamp  come to me at once and you will find mr m bring the box with youc  i passed the note on to my father and drew him a little on one side at the sight of the handwriting he started  philip whose writing is this he asked quickly  the writing of the man who alone knows where marx is i answered it is he who calls for his letters and forwards them  his name i insist upon knowing his name  de cartienne  my fathers face turned a shade paler and his eyebrows contracted  you have been keeping this from me philip you shall not go near that man i forbid it my god marx and de cartienne friends  he stopped short on the pavement and looked at me with a new light in his face he began to understand  marx and de cartienne he repeated slowly philip cannot you see what this means marx has been de cartiennes tool and i have been their victim where is de cartienne philip you shall tell me do you hear  my father seized my arm and held it fast i turned and faced him  father you must leave this to me i said firmly i have thought it all over in the train and my plans are made you will trust me  tell me what they are he said  i have in my possession a box belonging to de cartienne which contains a secret until i yield that box up to him i am safe since he can only get it from me you see that he tells me in this note to bring it with me  yes go on  well i am going without the box and if he is really ignorant of who i am and willing to give me the information about marx why then i can easily come back for it and whatever it contains he must have unopened  if on the other hand i fall into any sort of trap and he makes me send for it then immediately on receipt of my message no matter how it is couched you must force the box open and if it contains anything in the least suspicious come straight to my aid with the police the messenger who comes for the box must be bribed or frightened into bringing you  i do not like it philip it is all too roundabout if de cartienne has any idea who you are you are running a risk  i dont think so i answered until he gets possession of that box he will feel himself to a certain extent in my hands and will not be likely to do me an injury  what do you suppose the box contains  i hesitated and looked around de cartiennes servant was some distance off and there was no one within hearing  have you read the newspapers just lately i asked  my father shook his head  only the literary newspapers  i bought a special edition which a newsboy was brandishing in our faces and turning down the leading article passed it on to my father he glanced down at it and then looked up at me in blank amazement  philip you cannot mean this he exclaimed  why not i answered i do indeed but whether there is anything in it or not we shall soon know i must go now you understand what to do if i send for the box  i dont like your expedition at all he said doubtfully have you any idea where you are going  i shook my head  none but i shall come to no harm my star is in the ascendant now if it leads me into danger it will bring me safely out of it au revoir  then i sprang into the carriage and was driven swiftly away  our journey came to a sudden end and if i was surprised at the locality into which it had brought me i was still more so at its termination the carriage had stopped outside a gloomylooking warehouse the back of which ornamented with several cranes overlooked the river the whole of the front appeared to be in darkness but from a gaslamp on the other side of the narrow way i could read the brass signplate by the side of the door                             higgenson and co                         merchants and exporters  the door of the carriage was thrown open and i was evidently expected to descend i did so after a moments hesitation  are you sure that you have brought me to the right place i asked the man who held the door open this seems to be a warehouse i think there must be some mistake  the man silently closed the carriage door and stepped up to his seat beside the driver  there is no mistake he said curtly you will find the count de cartiennethere  he pointed to the warehouse door and i saw that it was now open and that a man was standing upon the threshold i turned towards him doubtfully  will you come this way mr morton he said count de cartienne is sorry to have to bring you here but we are busyvery busy and he had no time to get back to the hotel the carriage will wait to take you back  the mans manner and tone were certainly not those of a servant but from the position in which he stood i could see nothing save the bare outline of his figure i crossed the pavement towards him  we left the room and he conducted me down a passage and into a small chamber here my companion paused and lit a lamp which stood on a table in the middle of the room  count de cartienne will be with you in a moment he said walking to the door kindly excuse me  i turned the lamp a little higher and looked around the room was quite a small one and plainly furnished as a waitingroom  for the first time i began to realise fully what i had done in coming to this place at such an hour some wild thoughts of a tardy retreat flashed into my mind and i tried the handle of the door by which we had entered it turned but the door remained closed i stooped down and examined it the result was as i had feareda spring lock had fastened it i tried the other door by which my guide had issued the result was the same i was a prisoner  i had scarcely time to realise my position before it became necessary to act the door was suddenly opened and count de cartienne stood before me his eyes flashing with anger and his tall lithe frame quivering with rage  why have you not brought that box he exclaimed in a low fierce tone  i stood up facing him with my back to the table striving to keep calm for the situation was critical the complete change in his appearance and manner towards me was sufficient warning  the box is safe enough i answered you can have it in an hours time but  but what he interrupted savagely why have you not brought it as i bade you in my note why is it not here we want it at once  you forget that there is a quid pro quo which i expect from you it seems to me count de cartienne that you are making a tool of me and  what is it you wantto see this man marx  yes  well he is not here  i checked the rejoinder which had i spoken it would probably have cost me my life  where is he then i asked  i will tell you when you have written for that box he said opening a drawer and placing pen and paper upon the table  i shook my head there is no need for me to write it is of no use my remaining if mr marx is not here send your servant back with me and i will give it him  no i shall hold you as a hostage for the box besides i have a few words to say to you boy he added grimly write  i hesitated but only for a moment  do i understand that you detain me here against my will i said slowly  understand anything you please but write  i took up the pen without another word when i had finished the note he took it from me and read it through then he glanced at the address and started  mr ravenor oh mr ravenor is in london is he he remarked slowly  yes  he looked away with the ghost of an evil smile upon his lips  ravenor in london how strange he and i are old acquaintances i must call on him he added mockingly  he stood still for a moment and then left the room abruptly with the note in his hand i tried to follow him but the door closed too quickly if i could have seen any means of escape i should have made use of them for i had gained the knowledge which i had come to seek and i knew that i was in danger there was only that solitary window looking out upon the river and the closed door if this man meant mischief i was securely in his power                                   chapter liv                                 a raid   in a few minutes count de cartienne returned  he flashed a sudden keen glance at me  i wonder if you have any idea as to the contents of that box he said keeping his eyes fixed curiously upon me  looking back now i see clearly that i was guilty of the grossest folly in answering as i did but i was young impetuous conscious of great physical strength and with all that contempt of danger which such consciousness brings so without hesitation i drew from my pocket the evening paper which i had bought in northumberland avenue and laid my finger upon the column which i had shown my father  this may have something to do with it i remarked  his face grew a shade paler as he glanced it through then he folded it up and handed it back to me with a polite gesture  so that is your idea is it he remarked why didnt you go to scotland yard and tell them of your suspicions  i felt that he was watching me keenly and made a great effort to remain composed although my pulses were beating fast and i felt my colour rising  it was no business of mine i answered besides if i had done so i should have lost my chance of finding out anything about mr marx from you  your reasoning does you infinite credit he answered with a slight sneer you are quite a machiavelli come i want to show you over mywarehouse  i followed him reluctantly for i liked his manner less and less but i had scarcely an alternative  we passed along a narrow passage and through several rooms piled up to the ceiling with huge bales then we descended a winding flight of iron steps and as we reached the bottom i began to hear a faint hum of voices and strange muffled sounds  he unlocked a small hidden door before us and we stood on the threshold of a large dimlylit cellar  one swift glance around showed me the truth of my vague suspicions and warned me too of my peril it was a weird sight at the far end of the place a small furnace was burning casting a vivid glow upon the white startled faces of the men who were grouped around it one held in his hand a great ladlefull of hissing liquid and another on his knees was holding steady the mould which was to receive it but though they kept their positions unchanged they thought no more of their tasks the attention of one and all was bent upon me in horrorstruck amazement  the man who first recovered himself sufficiently to be able to frame an articulate sentence was the man holding the ladle  are you mad de cartienne he hissed out what have you brought that young cub down here for  i have brought him here he answered with a shade of contempt in his tone at the alarm which they were all showing because he is safer here than anywhere elsefor the present  somehow or otherprobably by looking inside that unfortunate boxthis young cub as you call him knows our secret to let him go would of course be absurd so ive brought him here to be tried for his unpardonable curiosity what shall we do with him i propose that we throw him into the river  i moved a little farther back towards the door listening with strained ears and bated breath for i fancied that i heard a faint sound of voices and footsteps above apparently the others had heard it too for there was a deathlike silence for a few moments then spoke the count  that must be drummond with the box will you go and see ferrier  there was the trampling of many feet outside and then a sudden swift torrent of blows upon the closed door  in an instant all was wild confusion count de cartienne was the only one who was not panicstricken  the game is up he cried fiercely and here is the traitor  like lightning he stooped down and i saw something in his hand flash before my eyes there was a strange burning pain and then everything faded away before my sight i heard the door beaten down and the sound of my rescuers streaming in then all sound became concentrated in a confused roar which throbbed for a moment in my ears and then died away unconsciousness crept in upon me  when i opened my eyes again i found myself lying upon a bed in a strange room by my side was my father leaning back in a low easy chair  where am i i asked how long have i been here tell me all about it  my father stood up with a little exclamation of relief  better philip that is well you are at the nearest decent hotel we could find last night or rather this morning  tell me all about it i cried  everyone was taken except de cartienne he fought like a tiger and got off but it is only for a while he will be caught his description  his description will be of no use at all i interrupted breathlessly has anything been heard of mr marx  my father picked up an open telegram from the table by his side  mr marx has gone back to ravenor this telegram is from the stationmaster at mellborough  i leapt from the bed and plunged my still aching head into a basin of water  what is the matter philip you will be ill again if you excite yourself my father said wondering  im all right i answered what is the time  four oclock  quick then and we shall catch the five oclock train to mellborough i urged  to mellborough but how about de cartienne  de cartienne he exists no longer it is marx we want  then the truth broke in upon my father and he sprang to his feet with a low cry  philip why did you not tell me before  i only knew last night for certain thank god i kept it to myself he thinks himself safe as mr marxsafer than flying the country as the count de cartiennethe villain  suddenly my father stopped short on his way to the door  philip he said hoarsely do you remember whom we left at ravenor waiting for mr marx  for the moment i had forgotten it we looked at one another and there crept into my mind the vision of a gaunt desperate man his white face and burning eyes filled with an unutterable fiendish longing the same thought filled us both if mr marx made use of his private keys and went straight to the library at the castle what would come of it  i laid my hand upon my fathers arm  there is justice in the world after all i said hoarsely that man will kill him  then we went out together without another word                                   chapter lv                         the mystery of mr marx   it was twenty minutes to eight when we arrived at mellborough and as we had not sent word on there was no carriage to meet us nor as it happened any spare vehicle after a brief word or two with the stationmaster we decided to walk down into the town and order a fly  when we reached the house the butler stepped forward his ruddy face blanched and his voice shaking  thank god you are come sir the man you left here hes gone a raving lunatic and hes shut himself up there and got your revolvers out and swears that no one shall enter the room till you come  theres someone with him my father said quickly  the mans face seemed literally shrunken up with horror  its awful sir ive been near once and ill never get over it as long as i live hes got some poor wretch there killing him by inches torturing him like a cat does a mouse hes been shrieking for help for hours and we can do nothing the poor creature must be nearly dead now ah there it is again sir four of our men have been shot trying to get to him listen oh why does he not die  a low faint cry full of a most heartstirring anguish floated out from the library window it was the most awful sound i have ever heard in my life following close upon it drowning its faint echo came the loud mocking laugh of the torturer ringing out harsh and mirthless in hideous contrast  a deep audible shudder passed through the little group of bystanders then my father without a word started forward across the lawn towards the window and i followed close behind it seemed to me that everyone must be holding their breath the silence was so intense the wind had dropped for a moment and the moon shone faintly down through a cloud of mist upon the white eager faces filled now with a new anxiety  a few swift steps brought us to the window a lamp was burning upon the writingtable and the interior of the room was clearly visible on the floor a little distance from the window was a dark shape which as we drew nearer we could see to be the prostrate figure of a man walking up and down in front of it with short uneven steps was francis his hair and dress in wild disorder and his whole appearance betokening that he had recently been engaged in a desperate struggle  suddenly he turned round and saw us with a wild cry of rage he rushed to the window the glass of which was completely wrecked and glared at us threateningly through the framework  away away he shrieked or there will be more trouble i must stay here i must wait till he comes let me be i tell you  the revolver which he clenched in his right hand was raised and levelled it was a dreadful moment  it is i mr ravenor my father answered calmly dont you know me francis  again the moon broke through the clouds and shone with a faint light upon my fathers pale stern face francis recognised him at once he threw his hands high over his head in a wild gesture of welcome and flung open the window my father walked steadily forward into the room and i followed him francis trembling with eagerness stood between us  see he cried pointing downwards is it not well done see let me tell you about it quick quick he came it was twilight he was at the cabinet there i stole out of the darkness i flung my arms around him he struggled ah how he struggled but it was all no use ha ha ha i was too strong for him i held him tighter and tighter till i nearly strangled him and he gasped and gurgled and moaned oh it was fine to see him then i found a cord in the drawer there and i bound him and while i fastened the knots i laughed and i talked to him i talked about that night in the storm when he threw his fatherhe pointed a long quivering finger at methrew him into the slate quarry and about that day when he came to the castle gate and brought me to the plantation and suddenly caught me by the throat till he thought he had strangled me and beat me on the head ah how my head has burned ever since ever since ever since ah milly come to me milly i am on fire my head is on fire ah ah  the foam burst out from between his pallid quivering lips and his eyes red and burning suddenly closed a ghastly change crept over his bloodstained pallid face he sank backwards and fell heavily upon the floor  we scarcely noticed him for our eyes were bent elsewhere the horror of that sight lived with me afterwards for many years a haunting shadow over my lifedisturbing even its sweetest moments a hideous maddening memory i am not going to attempt to describe it no words could express the horror of it such things are not to be written about  even my fathers iron nerve seemed to give way for a moment and he stood by my side trembling with his head buried in his hands then he sank on his knees and loosened the cords  thank god he is dead he murmured fervently as he felt the cold body and lifeless pulse and cleared away the last fragments of disguise from the head and face you had better call mr carrol in philip  even as he spoke a little awed group was silently filling the room carrol and his sergeant amongst them but after all they were cheated of their task for out in the moonlight john francis lay stark the madness gone from his white still face and the calm of death reigning there instead                                   chapter lvi                              the end of it   we were together my father and i under the shade of a little cluster of olive trees high up among the mountains far away below us the campagna stretched to the foot of the dim hills steeped in blue which surround the eternal city towards which we had been gazing in a silence which had been for long unbroken it was i at last who spoke pointing downwards to where the bare grey stone walls of a small monastic building rose with almost startling abruptness from a narrow ledge of sward overhanging the precipice  is this to be the end then father i cried bitterly this prisonhouse  he turned towards me with a look upon his face which i had grown to hatea look calm and gentle enough but full of resolution as unchanging as the mountains which towered above us  it must be so philip he said quietly is it well think you that i should return again into the life which i am weary of when all that i desire lies here ready to my hand peace and resti want nothing more  and why cannot you find them in englandat ravenor with me i cried eagerly and your work tooit could be done again we would live alone there and bury ourselves from the world and everyone in it i could help you i could be your amanuensis i should like that better than anything remember how all the papers lamented the cruel destruction of your manuscripts and how everyone hoped that you would rewrite them oh you must not do this thing fatheryou must not you have no right to cut yourself off from the worldno right i reechoed passionately  he shook his head slowly but alas with no sign of yielding  philip he said quietly it troubles me to hear you plead like this in vain for so it must ever be i am happy now happy in the recollection of the time we have spent together happy too in the thought that i can end my days in peace with no disturbing ghosts of the past to rise up and haunt me  i was silent and kept my face turned away towards the mountains for i would not have had him see my weakness soon he spoke again and this time there was a vein of sadness in his tone  the time has come for us to part for awhile philip there is one thing more which i would say to you it concerns cecil  cecil i echoed vaguely  yes  all his life he has been brought up to consider himself my heir now of course things will be very different with him he is weak and easily led i should like to think that you were friends and if you have an opportunity of helping him in any way you will not neglect it  i will not i promised cecil and i will always be friends  we descended the steep hillside path and stood together almost on the threshold of the little monastery then my father held out his hand to me and a soft sweet light shone for a moment in his dark blue eyes  farewell philip he saidfarewell god bless you and while i was returning the grasp of his closed fingers and struggling to keep down a rising lump in my throat he passed away from me silently like a figure in a dream and the thick nailstudded door opened and was closed behind him  then i set my face towards rome with blurred eyesight and a bitter sense of loss at my heart i was going back to england to take possession of a great inheritance but there was no joy in the thought only an unutterable intolerable loneliness which weighed down my heart and spirits and filled me with deep depression  cecil met me in london and we went to ravenor together it was a strange sensation to me to enter the castle as its virtual owner to wander from room to room from gallery to gallery and know that it was all mine and that the long line of ravenors who frowned and smiled upon me from their dark wormeaten frames were my ancestors at first it seemed pleasantpleasant at least in a measurebut when i stood in the library and passed on into that little chamber the memories connected with them swept in upon me with such irresistible force that i was glad to send cecil away for a while  for some time i lived quite alone save for cecils frequent visits keeping aloof from the people who lived near and making but few acquaintances the days i spent either on horseback or with my gun or often tramping many miles over the open country with a book in my pocket after the fashion of the days of my boyhood the nights i had no difficulty about whatever with such a library as my fathers to help me my love of reading became almost a part of myself  there was one person who viewed this change with profound dissatisfaction and who at last broke into open protest  i say phil you know it wont do cecil declared one night when i had tried to steal away into the library on some pretext a young fellow of your age with eighty thousand a year has no business to shut himself up with a lot of musty books and dream away his time like an old hermit people are asking about you everywhere and im getting tired of explaining what a rum sort of chap you are it wont do really  well i answered what do you want me to do  i want you to come back to town with me and put up with my people a bit the mater is very keen about it in fact she says that she shall come down here in the autumn if you dont come  i leaned back in my chair and a daydream rose up before me  what is your sister like now cis i asked suddenly  trixie oh shes turned out pretty well i think he answered complacently what friends you two used to be by the by  we said no more about the matter then but on the following morning i received two letters one from lady silchester and the other from lord langerdale both urging me to pay at least a short visit to london and perform social duties which naturally seemed of more importance to them than to me i read them through carefully and made up my mind at once but lord langerdales letter had stirred up some old memories and i did not tell cecil my decision immediately  you are about town a good deal cecil do you ever see anything of leonard de cartienne i asked  cecil shook his head  no nor am i ever likely to he answered i have heard of him though by a strange fluke  what is he doing  got a commission in the turkish army queer thing i heard the other day from a man i used to know very well once hes secretary at the embassy now at constantinople and he asked me whether i ever came across him seems he isnt particularly popular out there  hes a bad lot i remarked  jolly sure of it cecil assented no one but a blackguard would have behaved as he did to poor little milly but about london phil  i will go i said if you like we will leave here tomorrow  lady silchester received us very kindly and beatrice though full of the distractions of her first season seemed even better pleased to see us it was strange how much i found in the tall slim girl whom everyone was quoting as the beauty of the season to remind me of the quaint oldfashioned child whose imperious manner and naïve talk had so charmed me a few years ago there were the same wealth of ruddy golden hair the same delicate features and the same dainty little mannerisms everyone admired lady beatrice and so did i  my stay in london lasted till the end of the season i made my orthodox début into society under the wing of lord langerdale and divided my time pretty well between my aunt and uncle and the house in cadogan square when at last it was all over lord and lady langerdale lady silchester cecil and beatrice returned to ravenor as my guests  i am not writing a love story i cannot trace the growth of my love for beatrice for it seemed to come upon me with a rush and yet when i wondered how it came it seemed to me that it must have been always so those long summer days at ravenor were the sweetest i had ever known i lost all count of time hours and days and weeks seemed all blended in an exquisite dream from which unlike all others the awakening was at once the culmination and the happiest part for one night we came back hand in hand from wandering about on the terraces under a starlit sky and a great joy was gliding through my veins and throbbing in my heart  need i say what had happened beatrice was mine my own and i was very happy  come to me when you are marriedboth of you was my fathers message and we went alas for the cloud which so soon dimmed our newborn happiness we arrived in timeonly just in timeto stand by his deathbed  how the scene comes back to me the door and windows of his little chamber were thrown wide open and the soft languorous breeze heavy with the odour of wild flowers stole in and played upon his wasted face  what a countenance it was passionscarred yet chastened and softened by keen physical pain the burning blue eyes fixed steadily yet with a sweet steadfast light upon the dim horizonbeautiful after the highest type of spiritual beauty twilight stole down from the hills and then we gently folded his arms upon his breast and the watchers outside knowing well what such an action meant wiped the tears from their eyes and slowly wended their way homewards  then later the solemn chant of the monks in pious procession broke the stillness of the mountain night but such a death was scarcely death at least it was death robbed of all its terrors unutterably sad yet unutterably sweet there was truth beyond expression in the simple words rudely carved upon the wooden cross which amid a score or two of others in a sheltered nook down in the valley stands at the foot of his narrow grave                      he sought peace and found it  so may it be with us
