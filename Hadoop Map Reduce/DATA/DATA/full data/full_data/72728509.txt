72728509	ships company  by ww jacobs    dual control   never say die bert said mr culpepper kindly i like you and so do most other people who know whats good for em and if florrie dont like you she can keep single till she does  mr albert sharp thanked him  come in more oftener said mr culpepper  if she dont know a steady young man when she sees him its her mistake  nobody could be steadier than what i am sighed mr sharp  mr culpepper nodded  the worst of it is girls dont like steady young men he said rumpling his thin grey hair thats the silly part of it  but you was always steady and mrs culpepper married you said the young man  mr culpepper nodded again  she thought i was and that came to the same thing he said composedly  and it aint for me to say but she had an idea that i was very goodlooking in them days  i had chestnutty hair  she burnt a piece of it only the other day shed kept for thirty years  illustration a very faint squeeze in return decided him  burnt it  what for  inquired mr sharp  words said the other lowering his voice  when i want one thing nowadays she generally wants another and the things she wants aint the things i want  mr sharp shook his head and sighed again  you aint talkative enough for florrie you know said mr culpepper regarding him  i can talk all right as a rule retorted mr sharp  you ought to hear me at the debating society but you cant talk to a girl who doesnt talk back  youre far too humble continued the other  you should cheek her a bit now and then  let er see youve got some spirit  chaff er  thats no good said the young man restlessly  ive tried it  only the other day i called her a saucy little kipper and the way she went on anybody would have thought id insulted her  cant see a joke i spose  where is she now  upstairs was the reply  thats because im here said mr sharp  if it had been jack butler shed have been down fast enough  it couldnt be him said mr culpepper because i wont have im in the house  ive told him so ive told her so and ive told er aunt so  and if she marries without my leave afore shes thirty she loses the seven hundred pounds er father left her  youve got plenty of timeten years  mr sharp sitting with his hands between his knees gazed despondently at the floor  theres a lot o girls would jump at me he remarked ive only got to hold up my little finger and theyd jump  thats because theyve got sense said mr culpepper  theyve got the sense to prefer steadiness and humdrumness to good looks and dash  a young fellow like you earning thirtytwoandsix a week can do without good looks and if ive told florrie so once i have told her fifty times  looks are a matter of taste said mr sharp morosely  some of them girls i was speaking about just now  yes yes said mr culpepper hastily  now look here you go on a different tack  take a glass of ale like a man or a couple o glasses smoke a cigarette or a pipe  be like other young men  cut a dash and dont be a nambypamby  after youre married you can be as miserable as you like  mr sharp after a somewhat lengthy interval thanked him  its my birthday next wednesday continued mr culpepper regarding him benevolently come round about seven and ill ask you to stay to supper  thatll give you a chance  anybodys allowed to step a bit over the mark on birthdays and you might take a glass or two and make a speech and be so happy and bright that theyd ardly know you  if you want an excuse for calling you could bring me a box of cigars for my birthday  or come in to wish you many happy returns of the day said the thrifty mr sharp  and dont forget to get above yourself said mr culpepper regarding him sternly in a gentlemanly way of course  have as many glasses as you liketheres no stint about me  if it ever comes off said mr sharp risingif i get her through you you shant have reason to repent it  ill look after that  mr culpepper whose feelings were a trifle ruffled said that he would look after it too  he had a faint idea that even from his own point of view he might have made a better selection for his nieces hand  mr sharp smoked his first cigarette the following morning and encouraged by the entire absence of any aftereffects purchased a pipe which was taken up by a policeman the same evening for obstructing the public footpath in company with a metal tobaccobox three parts full  in the matter of ale he found less difficulty  certainly the taste was unpleasant but treated as medicine and gulped down quickly it was endurable  after a day or two he even began to be critical and on monday evening went so far as to complain of its flatness to the wide eyed landlord of the royal george  too much cellarwork he said as he finished his glass and made for the door  too much  ere come ere said the landlord thickly  i want to speak to you  the expert shook his head and passing out into the street changed colour as he saw miss garland approaching  in a blundering fashion he clutched at his hat and stammered out a good evening  miss garland returned the greeting and instead of passing on stopped and with a friendly smile held out her hand  mr sharp shook it convulsively  you are just the man i want to see she exclaimed  aunt and i have been talking about you all the afternoon  mr sharp said really  but i dont want uncle to see us pursued miss garland in the low tones of confidence  which way shall we go  mr sharps brain reeled  all ways were alike to him in such company he walked beside her like a man in a dream  we want to give him a lesson said the girl presently  a lesson that he will remember  him  said the young man  uncle explained the girl  its a shocking thing a wicked thing to try and upset a steady young man like you  aunt is quite put out about it and i feel the same as she does  but gasped the astonished mr sharp how did you  aunt heard him said miss garland  she was just going into the room when she caught a word or two and she stayed outside and listened  you dont know what a lot she thinks of you  mr sharps eyes opened wider than ever  i thought she didnt like me he said slowly  good gracious  said miss garland  whatever could have put such an idea as that into your head  of course aunt isnt always going to let uncle see that she agrees with him  still as if anybody could help she murmured to herself  eh  said the young man in a trembling voice  nothing  miss garland walked along with averted face mr sharp his pulses bounding trod on air beside her  i thought he said at last i thought that jack butler was a favourite of hers  jack butler  said the girl in tones of scornful surprise  the idea how blind men are youre all alike i think  you cant see two inches in front of you  shes as pleased as possible that you are coming on wednesday and so am  mr sharp caught his breath  yes  he murmured  lets go down here said miss garland quickly down by the river  and ill tell you what we want you to do  she placed her hand lightly on his arm and mr sharp with a tremulous smile obeyed  the smile faded gradually as he listened and an expression of anxious astonishment took its place  he shook his head as she proceeded and twice ventured a faint suggestion that she was only speaking in jest  convinced at last against his will he walked on in silent consternation  but he said at last as miss garland paused for breath your uncle would never forgive me  hed never let me come near the house again  aunt will see to that said the girl confidently  but of course if you dont wish to please me  she turned away and mr sharp plucking up spirit ventured to take her hand and squeeze it  a faint a very faint squeeze in return decided him  it will come all right afterwards said miss garland especially with the hold it will give aunt over him  i hope so said the young man  if not i shall be farfarther off than ever  miss garland blushed and turning her head gazed steadily at the river  trust me she said at last  me and auntie  mr sharp said that so long as he pleased her nothing else mattered and in the seventh heaven of delight paced slowly along the towpath by her side  and you mustnt mind what auntie and i say to you said the girl continuing her instructions  we must keep up appearances you know and if we seem to be angry you must remember we are only pretending  mr sharp with a tender smile said that he understood perfectly  and now i had better go said florrie returning the smile  uncle might see us together or somebody else might see us and tell him goodbye  she shook hands and went off stopping three times to turn and wave her hand  in a state of bewildered delight mr sharp continued his stroll rehearsing as he went the somewhat complicated and voluminous instructions she had given him  by wednesday evening he was partperfect and in a state of mind divided between nervousness and exaltation set out for mr culpeppers  he found that gentleman dressed in his best sitting in an easychair with his hands folded over a fancy waistcoat of startling design and placing a small box of small cigars on his knees wished him the usual happy returns  the entrance of the ladies who seemed as though they had just come off the ice interrupted mr culpeppers thanks  getting spoiled thats what i am he remarked playfully  see this waistcoat  my old aunt elizabeth sent it this morning  he leaned back in his chair and glanced down in warm approval  the missis gave me a pipe and florrie gave me half a pound of tobacco  and i bought a bottle of port wine myself for all of us  he pointed to a bottle that stood on the suppertable and the ladies retiring to the kitchen to bring in the supper rose and placed chairs a piece of roast beef was placed before him and motioning mr sharp to a seat opposite florrie he began to carve  just a nice comfortable party he said genially as he finished help yourself to the ale bert  mr sharp ignoring the surprise on the faces of the ladies complied and passed the bottle to mr culpepper  they drank to each other and again a flicker of surprise appeared on the faces of mrs culpepper and her niece  mr culpepper noticing it shook his head waggishly at mr sharp  he drinks it as if he likes it he remarked  i do asserted mr sharp and raising his glass emptied it and resumed the attack on his plate  mr culpepper unscrewed the top of another bottle and the reckless mr sharp after helping himself made a short and feeling speech in which he wished mr culpepper long life and happiness  if you aint happy with mrs culpepper he concluded gallantly you ought to be  mr culpepper nodded and went on eating in silence until the keen edge of his appetite having been taken off he put down his knife and fork and waxed sentimental  been married over thirty years he said slowly with a glance at his wife and never regretted it  who hasnt  inquired mr sharp  why me returned the surprised mr culpepper  mr sharp who had just raised his glass put it down again and smiled it was a faint smile but it seemed to affect his host unfavourably  what are you smiling at  he demanded  thoughts said mr sharp exchanging a covert glance with florrie something you told me the other day  mr culpepper looked bewildered  ill give you a penny for them thoughts he said with an air of jocosity  mr sharp shook his head  money couldnt buy em he said with owlish solemnity especespecially after the good supper youre giving me  bert said mr culpepper uneasily as his wife sat somewhat erect bert its my birthday and i dont grudge nothing to nobody but go easy with the beer  you aint used to it you know  whats the matter with the beer  inquired mr sharp  it tastes all rightwhat there is of it  it aint the beer its you explained mr culpepper  mr sharp stared at him  have i said anything i oughtnt to  he inquired  mr culpepper shook his head and taking up a fork and spoon began to serve a plumpudding that miss garland had just placed on the table  what was it you said i was to be sure and not tell mrs culpepper inquired mr sharp dreamily  i havent said that have i  no  snapped the harassed mr culpepper laying down the fork and spoon and regarding him ferociously  i mean there wasnt anything  i mean i didnt say so  youre raving  if i did say it im sorry persisted mr sharp  i cant say fairer than that can i  youre all right said mr culpepper trying but in vain to exchange a waggish glance with his wife  i didnt say it  inquired mr sharp  no said mr culpepper still smiling in a wooden fashion  i mean the other thing  said mr sharp in a thrilling whisper  look here exclaimed the overwrought mr culpepper why not eat your pudding and leave off talking nonsense  nobodys listening to you  speak for yourself said his wife tartly  i like to hear mr sharp talk  what was it he told you not to tell me  mr sharp eyed her mistily  ii cant tell you he said slowly  why not  asked mrs culpepper coaxingly  because itit would make your hair stand on end said the industrious mr sharp  nonsense said mrs culpepper sharply  he said it would said mr sharp indicating his host with his spoon and he oughtto know whos that kicking me under the table  mr culpepper shivering with wrath and dread struggled for speech youd better get home bert he said at last  youre not yourself theres nobody kicking you under the table  you dont know what you are saying  youve been dreaming things  i never said anything of the kind  memorys gone said mr sharp shaking his head at him  clean gone dont you remember  no  roared mr culpepper  mr sharp sat blinking at him but his misgivings vanished before the glances of admiring devotion which miss garland was sending in his direction  he construed them rightly not only as a reward but as an incentive to further efforts  in the midst of an impressive silence mrs culpepper collected the plates and producing a dish of fruit from the sideboard placed it upon the table  help yourself mr sharp she said pushing the bottle of port towards him  mr sharp complied having first after several refusals put a little into the ladies glasses and a lot on the tablecloth near mr culpepper then after a satisfying sip or two he rose with a bland smile and announced his intention of making a speech  but youve made one said his host in tones of fierce expostulation  thatthat was las night said mr sharp  this is tonightyour birthday  well we dont want any more said mr culpepper  mr sharp hesitated  its only his fun he said looking round and raising his glass  hes afraid im going to praise him uppraise him up  heres to my old friend mr culpepper one of the best  we all have ourfaults and he has hishas his  where was i  sit down growled mr culpepper  talking about my husbands faults said his wife  so i was said mr sharp putting his hand to his brow  dont be alarm he continued turning to his host nothing to be alarm about im not going to talk about em  not so silly as that i hope  i dont want spoil your life  sit down repeated mr culpepper  youre very anxious he should sit down said his wife sharply  no im not said mr culpepper only hes talking nonsense  mr sharp still on his legs took another sip of port and avoiding the eye of mr culpepper which was showing signs of incipient inflammation looked for encouragement to miss garland  hes a man we all look up to and respect he continued  if he does go off to london every now and then on business thats his lookout  my idea is he always ought to take mrs culpepper with him  hed have pleasure of her company and same time hed be money in pocket by it  and why shouldnt she go to musichalls sometimes  why shouldnt she  you get off home said the purple mr culpepper rising and hammering the table with his fist  get off home and if you so much as show your face inside this ouse again therell be trouble  go on  out you go  home  repeated mr sharp sitting down suddenly  wont go home till morning  oh well soon see about that said mr culpepper taking him by the shoulders  come on now  mr sharp subsided lumpishly into his chair and mr culpepper despite his utmost efforts failed to move him  the two ladies exchanged a glance and then with their heads in the air sailed out of the room the younger pausing at the door to bestow a mirthful glance upon mr sharp ere she disappeared  comeout said mr culpepper panting  you trying to tickle me  inquired mr sharp  you get off home said the other  youve been doing nothing but make mischief ever since you came in  what put such things into your silly head i dont know  i shall never hear the end of em as long as i live  silly head  repeated mr sharp with an alarming change of manner say it again  mr culpepper repeated it with gusto  very good said mr sharp  he seized him suddenly and pushing him backwards into his easychair stood over him with such hideous contortions of visage that mr culpepper was horrified  now you sit there and keep quite still he said with smouldering ferocity  where did you put carvingknife  eh  wheres carvingknife  no no bert said mr culpepper clutching at his sleeve  ii was only joking  youyou aint quite yourself bert  what  demanded the other rolling his eyes and clenching his fists  ii mean youve improved said mr culpepper hurriedly  wonderful you have  mr sharps countenance cleared a little  lets make a night of it he said  dont move whatever you do  illustration he felt the large and clumsy hand of mr butler take him by the collar  he closed the door and putting the wine and a couple of glasses on the mantelpiece took a chair by mr culpepper and prepared to spend the evening  his instructions were too specific to be disregarded and three times he placed his arm about the waist of the frenzied mr culpepper and took him for a lumbering dance up and down the room  in the intervals between dances he regaled him with interminable extracts from speeches made at the debating society and recitations learned at school suggestions relating to bed thrown out by mr culpepper from time to time were repelled with scorn  and twice in deference to mr sharps desires he had to join in the chorus of a song  ten oclock passed and the hands of the clock crawled round to eleven the hour struck and as though in answer the door opened and the agreeable face of florrie garland appeared  behind her to the intense surprise of both gentlemen loomed the stalwart figure of mr jack butler  i thought he might be useful uncle said miss garland coming into the room  auntie wouldnt let me come down before  mr sharp rose in a dazed fashion and saw mr culpepper grasp mr butler by the hand  more dazed still he felt the large and clumsy hand of mr butler take him by the collar and propel him with some violence along the small passage while another hand which he dimly recognized as belonging to mr culpepper was inserted in the small of his back  then the front door opened and he was thrust out into the night  the door closed and a low feminine laugh sounded from a window above
