dark form                                          53  somewhere not very far ahead of him was a house          96  on broad wings it sailed over to that hollow stump      199     chapter i  old man coyote leads bowser away      though great or small the matter prove       be faithful in whateer you do     tis thus and only thus you may       to others and yourself be true      bowser the hound   old man coyote is full of tricks people with such clever wits as his usually are full of tricks on the other hand bowser the hound isnt tricky at all he just goes straight ahead with the thing he has to do and does it in the most earnest way not being tricky himself he sometimes forgets to watch out for tricks in others  one day he found the fresh trail of old man coyote and made up his mind that he would run down old man coyote if he had to run his legs off to do it he always makes up his mind like that whenever he starts out to hunt you know there is nothing in the world bowser enjoys quite so much as to hunt some one who will give him a long hard run any time he will go without eating for the pleasure of chasing reddy or granny fox or old man coyote  now old man coyote was annoyed he was and he wasnt afraid of bowser the hound that is to say he was afraid to fight bowser but he wasnt afraid to be hunted by bowser because he was so sure that he was smart enough to get away from bowser if bowser had appeared at almost any other time old man coyote wouldnt have been so annoyed but to have bowser appear just then made him angry clear through you see he had just started out to get his dinner  what business has that goodfornothing dog over here anyway id like to know he muttered as he ran swiftly through the green forest what right has he to meddle in other folks business ill just teach that fellow a lesson thats what ill do ill teach him that he cant interfere with me not be sorry for it  so old man coyote ran and ran and ran and never once did he try to break his trail in fact he took pains to leave a trail that bowser could follow easily after him bowser ran and ran and ran and all the time his great voice rang out joyously this was the kind of a hunt he loved out of the green forest into the old pasture old man coyote led bowser the hound across the old pasture and out on the other side they raced farther and farther away from home old man coyote led bowser the hound instead of circling back as usual he kept on bowser kept on after him by and by he was in strange country country he had never visited before he didnt notice this he didnt notice anything but the splendid trail old man coyote was making he didnt even realize that he was getting tired always in his nose was the tantalizing scent of old man coyote bowser was sure that this time he would catch this fellow who had fooled him so often before     chapter ii  old man coyote plays a trick      of people who play tricks beware     lest they may get you in a snare     you cannot trust them so watch out     whenever one may be about      bowser the hound   there is such a thing as being too much interested in the thing you are doing that is the way accidents very often happen a person will get so interested in something that he will be blind and deaf to everything else and so will walk straight into danger or trouble of some kind  now just take the case of bowser the hound bowser was so interested in the chase of old man coyote that he paid no attention whatever to anything but the warm scent of old man coyote which the latter was taking pains to leave bowser ran with his nose in old man coyotes tracks and never looked either to left or right he would lift his head only to look straight ahead in the hope of seeing old man coyote then down would go his nose again to follow that scent  so bowser didnt notice that old man coyote was leading him far far away from home into country with which he was quite unacquainted bowser has a great deep wonderful voice which can be heard a very long distance when he bays on the tracks of some one he is hunting it can be heard a very long distance indeed but far as it can be heard bowser was far far beyond hearing distance from farmer browns house before old man coyote began to even think of playing one of his clever tricks in order to make bowser lose his scent you see old man coyote intended to lead bowser into strange country and there lose him hoping that he would not be able to find the way home  old man coyote is himself a tireless runner he is not so heavy as is bowser so does not tire as easily then too he had not wasted his breath as had bowser with his steady baying old man coyote could tell by the sound of bowsers voice when the latter was beginning to grow tired and he could tell by the fact that he often had a moment or two to sit down and rest before bowser got dangerously near  so at last old man coyote decided that the time had come to play a trick by and by he came to a river at that point there was a high overhanging bank on the very edge of this bank old man coyote made a long leap to one side then he made another long leap to the big trunk of a fallen tree he ran along this and from the end of it made still another long leap as long a leap as he could then he hid in a little thicket to see what would happen     chapter iii  what happened to bowser      when a coyote seems most honest watch him closest      bowser the hound   bowser was very very tired he wouldnt admit it even to himself for when he is hunting he will keep on until he drops if his wonderful nose can still catch the scent of the one he is following bowser is wonderfully persistent so though he was very very tired he kept his nose to the ground and tried to run even faster for the scent of old man coyote was so strong that bowser felt sure he would soon catch him   bowser didnt look to see where he was going he didnt care it was enough for him to know that old man coyote had gone that way and where old man coyote could go bowser felt sure he could follow so still baying with all his might and making the hills ring with the sound of his great voice bowser kept on  hidden in a little thicket stretched out so that he might rest better old man coyote listened to that great voice drawing nearer and nearer there was a wicked grin on old man coyotes face and in his yellow eyes a look of great eagerness in a few minutes bowser came in sight his nose in the trail old man coyote had left into bowsers voice crept a new note of eagerness as his nose picked up the scent stronger than ever straight on he raced and it seemed as if he had gained new strength his whole thought was on just one thingcatching old man coyote and old man coyote knew it  bowser didnt see that he was coming to a steep bank he didnt see it at all until he reached the edge of it and then he was going so fast that he couldnt stop over he went with a frightened yelp down down he fell and landed with a thump on the ice below he landed so hard that he broke the ice and went through into the cold black water  old man coyote crept to the edge of the bank and peeped over poor bowser was having a terrible time you see the cold water had taken what little breath his fall had not knocked out of him he doesnt like to go in water anyway you know the hair of his coat is short and doesnt protect him as it would if it were long old man coyote grinned wickedly as he watched bowser struggling feebly to climb out on the ice each time he tried he slipped back and all the time he was whimpering  old man coyote grinned more wickedly than ever i suspect that he hoped that bowser would not be able to get out but after a little bowser did manage to crawl out and stood on the ice shivering shaking once more old man coyote grinned then turning he trotted back towards farmer browns     chapter iv  poor bowser      follow a crooked trail and you will find a scamp at the end      bowser the hound   poor bowser he stood shivering and shaking on the ice of the strange river to which old man coyote had led him and he knew not which way to turn not only was he shivering and shaking from his cold bath but he was bruised by his fall from the top of the steep bank and he was so tired by his long run after old man coyote that he could hardly stand  old man coyote had stayed only long enough to see that bowser had managed to get out of the water then had turned back towards the old pasture the green meadows and the green forest near farmer browns you see old man coyote knew the way back he would take his time about getting there for it really made no particular difference to him when he reached home he felt sure he would be able to find something to eat on the way  but with bowser it was very different poor bowser didnt know where he was it would have been bad enough under any circumstances to have been lost but to be lost and at the same time tired almost to death bruised and lame wet and chilled through was almost too much to bear he hadnt the least idea which way to turn he couldnt climb up the bank to find his own trail and follow it back home if he wanted to you see that bank was very steep for some distance in each direction and so it was impossible for bowser to climb it  for a few minutes he stood shivering shaking and whimpering not knowing which way to turn then he started down the river on the ice for he knew he would freeze if he continued to stand still he limped badly because one leg had been hurt in his fall after a while he came to a place where he could get up on the bank it was in the midst of deep woods and a very very lonely place hard crusted snow covered the ground but it was better than walking on the ice and for this bowser was thankful  which way should he turn where should he go night was coming on he was wet cold and hungry and as utterly lost as ever a dog was poor bowser for a minute or two he sat down and howled from sheer lonesomeness and discouragement how he did wish he had left old man coyote alone how he did long for his snug warm little house in farmer browns dooryard and for the good meal he knew was awaiting him there now that the excitement of the hunt was over he realized how very very hungry he was and he began to wonder where he would be able to get anything to eat do you wonder that he howled  old man coyote trotting along on his way home heard that howl and understood it again he grinned that wicked grin of his and stopped to listen i dont think hell hunt me again in a hurry he muttered then trotted on poor bowser hunting for anything but his home was farthest from his thoughts     chapter v  bowser spends a bad night      theres nothing like just sticking to     the thing you undertake to do     therell be no cause then though you fail     to hang your head or drop your tail      bowser the hound   bowser was lost utterly lost he hadnt the least idea in which direction farmer browns house was in fact he hadnt the least idea which way to turn to find any house it was the most lonely kind of a lonely place to which old man coyote had led him and there played the trick on him which had caused him to tumble into the strange river  but bowser couldnt stand still for long already jolly round red mr sun was going to bed behind the purple hills and bowser knew that cold as had been the day the night would be still colder he must keep moving until he found a shelter if he didnt he would freeze so whimpering and whining bowser limped along  bowser was not afraid to be out at night as some folks are goodness no in fact on many a moonlight night bowser had hunted reddy fox or granny fox all night long never once had he felt lonesome then but now it was very very different you see on those nights when he had hunted he always had known where he was he had known that at any time he could go straight home if he wanted to that made all the difference in the world  it would have been bad enough being lost this way had he been feeling at his best being lost always makes one feel terribly lonesome lonesomeness is one of the worst parts of the feeling of being lost but added to this was the fact that bowser was really not in fit condition to be out at all he was wet tired lame and hungry do you wonder that he whimpered and whined as he limped along over the hard snow and hadnt the least idea whether he was headed towards home or deeper into the great woods  for a long time he kept on until it seemed to him he couldnt drag one foot after another then quite suddenly something big and dark loomed up in front of him it really wasnt as big as it seemed it was a little house a sugar camp just such a one as farmer brown has near his home bowser crept to the door it was closed bowser sniffed and sniffed and his heart sank for there was no scent of human beings then he knew that that little house was deserted and empty still he whined and scratched at the door by and by the door opened ever so little for it had not been locked  bowser crept in in one corner he found some hay and in this he curled up it was cold very cold but not nearly as cold as outside that little house so bowser curled up in the hay and shivered and shook and slept a little and wished with all his might that he never had found the tracks of old man coyote     chapter vi  the surprise of blacky the crow      the harder it is to follow a trail     the greater the reason you should not fail      bowser the hound   at all seasons of the year blacky the crow is something of a traveler but in winter he is much more of a traveler than in summer you see in winter it is not nearly so easy to pick up a living food is quite as scarce for blacky the crow in winter as for any of the other little people who neither sleep the winter away nor go south all of the feathered folks have to work and work hard to find food enough to keep them warm you know it is food that makes heat in the body  so in the winter blacky is in the habit of flying long distances in search of food he often goes some miles from the thick hemlocktree in the green forest where he spends his nights you may see him starting out early in the morning and returning late in the afternoon  now blacky knew all about that river into which bowser the hound had fallen there was a certain place on that river where jack frost never did succeed in making ice sometimes things good to eat would be washed up along the edge of this open place blacky visited it regularly he was on the way there now flying low over the treetops  presently he came to a little opening among the trees in the middle of it was a little house a rough little house blacky knew all about it it was a sugar camp he knew that only in the spring of the year was he likely to find anybody about there all the rest of the year it was shut up every time he passed that way blacky flew over it blackys eyes are very sharp indeed as everybody knows now as he drew near he noticed right away that the door was partly open it hadnt been that way the last time he passed  ho exclaimed blacky i wonder if the wind blew that open or if there is some one inside i think ill watch a while  so blacky flew to the top of a tall tree from which he could look all over the little clearing and could watch the door of the little house  for a long time he sat there as silent as the trees themselves nothing happened he began to grow tired rather he began to grow so hungry that he became impatient if there is anybody in there he must be asleep muttered blacky to himself ill see if i can wake him up caw caw caaw caw caw  blacky waited a few minutes then repeated his cry he did this three times and had just made up his mind that there was nobody inside that little house when a head appeared in the doorway blacky was so surprised that he nearly fell from his perch  as i live he muttered that is bowser the hound it certainly is now what is he doing way over here ive never known him to go so far from home before     chapter vii  blacky the crow takes pity on bowser      beneath a coat of ebon hue     may beat a heart thats kind and true     the worst of scamps in time of need     will often do a kindly deed      bowser the hound   caw caaw exclaimed blacky the crow bowser looked up to the top of the tall tree where blacky sat and in his great soft eyes was such a look of friendliness that it gave blacky a funny feeling you know blacky is not used to friendly looks he is used to quite the other kind bowser came out of the old sugar house where he had spent the night and whined softly as he looked up at blacky and as he whined he wagged his tail ever so slightly blacky didnt know what to make of it he had never been more surprised in his life he didnt know which surprised him most finding bowser way over here where he had no business to be or bowsers friendliness  as for bowser he had spent such a forlorn miserable night and he was so terribly lonesome that the very sound of blackys voice had given him a queer thrill never had he thought of blacky the crow as a friend in fact he never thought much about blacky at all sometimes he had chased blacky out of farmer browns cornfield early in the spring but that is all he ever had had to do with him now however lonesome and lost as he was the sound of a familiar voice made him tingle all over with a friendly feeling so he whined softly and wagged his tail feebly as he looked up at blacky sitting in the top of a tall tree presently bowser limped out to the middle of the little clearing and turned first this way and then that way then he sat down and howled dismally in an instant blacky the crow understood bowser was lost  so thats the trouble muttered blacky to himself that silly dog has got himself lost i never will be able to understand how anybody can get lost i never in my life was lost and never expect to be but it is easy enough to see that bowser is lost and badly lost my goodness how lame he is i wonder whats happened to him serves him right for hunting other people but im sorry for him just the same what a helpless creature a lost dog is anyway i suppose if he doesnt find a house pretty soon he will starve to death old man coyote wouldnt reddy fox wouldnt they would catch something to eat no matter where they were i suppose they wouldnt thank me for doing it but just the same i think ill take pity on bowser and help him out of his trouble      chapter viii  how blacky the crow helped bowser      the blackest coat may cover the kindest heart      bowser the hound   when blacky the crow said to himself that he guessed he would take pity on bowser and help him out of his trouble he knew that he could do it without very much trouble to himself perhaps if there had been very much trouble in it blacky would not have been quite so ready and willing then again perhaps it isnt fair to blacky to think that he might not have been willing even the most selfish people are sometimes kindly and unselfish  blacky knew just where the nearest house was you can always trust blacky to know not only where every house is within sight of the places he frequents but all about the people who live in each house blacky makes it his business to know these things he could if he would tell you which houses have terrible guns in them and which have not it is by knowing such things that blacky manages to avoid danger  if that dog knows enough to follow me ill take him where he can at least get something to eat muttered blacky it wont be far out of my way anyway because if he has any sense at all i wont have to go all the way over there  so blacky spread his black wings and disappeared over the treetops in the direction of the nearest farmhouse  bowser watched him disappear and whined sadly for somehow it made him feel more lonesome than before but for one thing he would have gone back to his bed of hay in the corner of that sugar camp that one thing was hunger it seemed to bowser that his stomach was so empty that the very sides of it had fallen in he just must get something to eat  so after waiting a moment or two bowser turned and limped away through the trees and he limped in the direction which blacky the crow had taken you see he could still hear blackys voice calling caw caw caw and somehow it made him feel better less lonesome you know to be within hearing of a voice he knew  bowser had to go on three legs for one leg had been so hurt in the fall over the bank that he could not put his foot to the ground then too he was very very stiff from the cold and the wetting he had received the night before so poor bowser made slow work of it and blacky the crow almost lost patience waiting for him to appear  as soon as bowser came in sight blacky gave what was intended for a cheery caw and then headed straight for the place he had started for that morning giving no more thought to bowser the hound you see he knew that bowser would shortly come to a road if he doesnt know enough to follow that road he deserves to starve thought blacky  bowser did know enough to follow that road the instant he saw that road he knew that if he kept on following it it would lead him somewhere so with new hope in his heart bowser limped along     chapter ix  old man coyote gives out dark hints      a little hint dropped there or here     is like a seed in spring of year     it sprouts and grows and none may say     how big twill be some future day      bowser the hound   after leading bowser the hound far far away and getting him lost in strange country old man coyote trotted back to the old pasture the green forest and the green meadows near farmer browns he didnt have any trouble at all in finding his way back you see all the time he was leading bowser away he himself was using his eyes and taking note of where he was going you cant lose old man coyote no sir you cant lose old man coyote and it is of no use to try  so stopping two or three times to hunt a little by the way old man coyote trotted back he managed to pick up a good meal on the way and when at last he reached his home in the old pasture he was feeling very well satisfied with the great world in general and himself in particular  he grinned as only old man coyote can grin i dont think any of us will be bothered by that meddlesome bowser very soon again said he as he crept into his house for a nap if he had drowned in that river i shouldnt have cried over it but even as it is i dont think he will get back here in a hurry i must pass the word along  so a day or so later when sammy jay happened along old man coyote asked him in quite a matteroffact way if he had seen anything of bowser the hound for a day or two  why do you ask said sammy sharply  old man coyote grinned slyly for no reason at all sammy for no reason at all he replied it just popped into my head that i hadnt heard bowsers voice for two or three days it set me to wondering if he is sick or if anything has happened to him  that was enough to start sammy jay straight for farmer browns dooryard of course bowser wasnt to be seen sammy hung around and watched twice he saw farmer browns boy come to the door with a worried look on his face and heard him whistle and call for bowser then there wasnt the slightest doubt in sammys mind that something had happened to bowser  old man coyote knows something about it too muttered sammy as he turned his head on one side and scratched his pointed cap thoughtfully he cant fool me that old rascal knows where bowser is or what has happened to him and i wouldnt be a bit surprised if he had something to do with it i almost know he did from the way he grinned  the day was not half over before all through the green forest and over the green meadows had spread the report that bowser the hound was no more     chapter x  how reddy fox investigated      investigate if you would know     that something is or isnt so      bowser the hound   to investigate something means to try to find out about it reddy fox had heard from so many different ones about the disappearance of bowser that he finally made up his mind that he would investigate and find out for himself if it were true that bowser was no longer at home in farmer browns dooryard if it were truewell reddy had certain plans of his own in regard to farmer browns henhouse  reddy had begun by doubting that story because it seemed to have come first from old man coyote reddy would doubt anything with which old man coyote was concerned but reddy had finally come to believe that something certainly had happened because half a dozen times during the day he had heard farmer browns boy whistle and whistle and call and call  just as soon as the black shadows came creeping out from the purple hills reddy started up towards farmer browns he didnt go directly there because he never goes directly anywhere if there is the least chance in the world that any one may be watching him but as he slipped along in the blackest of the black shadows he was all the time working nearer and nearer to farmer browns dooryard although he was inclined to think it was true that bowser was not there he was far too wise to take any unnecessary risk he approached farmer browns dooryard just as carefully as if he knew bowser to be in his little house as usual he kept in the black shadows he crouched so low that he seemed hardly more than a black shadow himself every two or three steps he stopped to look listen and test the air with his keen nose  as he drew near bowsers own little house reddy circled out around it until he could see the doorway then he sat down where he could peek around from behind a tree and watch he had been there only a few moments when the back door of farmer browns house opened and farmer browns boy stepped out reddy didnt run he knew that farmer browns boy would never dream that he would dare come so near besides it was very clear that farmer browns boy was thinking of no one but bowser he whistled and called just as he had done several times during the day but no bowser came so after a while farmer browns boy went back into the house there was a worried look on his face  as soon as he heard the door close reddy trotted right out in the open and sat down only a few feet from the black doorway of bowsers little house reddy barked softly then he barked a little louder he knew that if bowser were at home that bark would bring him out if nothing else did bowser didnt appear reddy grinned he was sure now that bowser was nowhere about chuckling to himself he turned and trotted towards farmer browns henhouse     chapter xi  a little unpleasantness       watch a coyote most closely when it appears that he least needs     watching      bowser the hound  never in his life had reddy fox visited farmer browns henhouse with quite such a comfortable feeling as he now had he knew for a certainty that bowser the hound was not at home he knew because he had finally crept up and peeped in the door of bowsers little house what had become of bowser he didnt know and he didnt care it was enough to know that he wasnt about  i hope farmer browns boy has forgotten to close that little doorway where the hens run in and out muttered reddy as he trotted across farmer browns dooryard once he stopped and looking up at the lighted windows of the house grinned you see with bowser gone reddy wasnt the least bit afraid  if i can get into that henhouse thought reddy i certainly will have one good feast tonight that is i will if those stupid hens are not roosting so high that i cant get them ill eat one right there reddys mouth watered at the very thought then ill take one home to mrs reddy if there is time we both will come back for a couple more  so reddy made pleasant plans as he approached farmer browns henhouse when he reached it he paused to listen to certain sounds within certain fretful little cluckings reddy sat down for a minute with his tongue hanging out and the water actually dripping from it he could shut his eyes and see those roosts with the hens crowded together so that every once in a while one would be wakened and fretfully protest against being crowded so  but reddy sat there only for a minute he was too eager to find out if it would prove to be possible to get inside that henhouse running swiftly but cautiously past the henhouse and along one side of the henyard he peeped around the corner to see if by any chance the yard gate had been left open his heart gave a leap of joy as he saw that the gate was not quite closed all he would have to do would be to push it and enter  reddy turned the corner quickly just as he put up one paw to push the gate open a low but decidedly ugly growl made him jump back with every hair of his coat standing on end his first thought was of bowser it must be that bowser had returned believing in safety first reddy did not stop to see who had growled but ran swiftly a short distance then he looked behind him over at the gate of farmer browns henyard he could see a dark form at once reddy knew that it wasnt bowser the hound for it had a bushy tail while bowsers was smooth reddy knew who it was it was old man coyote  illustration over at the gate of farmer browns henyard he could see a dark form     chapter xii  the cleverness of old man coyote      who thinks the quickest and the best     is bound to win in every test      bowser the hound   the meeting of reddy fox and old man coyote just outside the gate to farmer browns henyard had been wholly unexpected to both reddy had been so eager to get inside that gate that when he turned the corner at the henyard he hadnt looked beyond the gate if he had looked beyond he would have seen old man coyote just coming around the other corner as for old man coyote he had been so surprised at sight of reddy fox that he had growled before he had had time to think he was sorry the very instant he did it  that certainly was a stupid thing to do muttered old man coyote to himself as he watched reddy fox run away in a panic i should have kept out of sight and let him open that gate and go inside first there may be traps in there for all i know when theres likely to be danger always let some one else find it out for you if you can old man coyote grinned as he said this  reddy fox sat down at a safe distance to watch what old man coyote would do inside reddy was fairly boiling with disappointment and anger he felt that he hated old man coyote more than he hated anybody else he knew of he hated him yet there wasnt a thing he could do about it he didnt dare fight old man coyote all he could do was to sit there at a safe distance and watch  the gate of the henyard was open two or three inches for a long time old man coyote stood looking through that little opening once or twice he thrust his nose out and sniffed cautiously around the gate but he took the greatest care not to touch it finally he turned and trotted away towards the green forest  reddy sat right where he was so surprised that he couldnt even think he waited a long time to see if old man coyote would return but old man coyote didnt return and at last reddy cautiously crept towards that unlocked gate i do believe that fellow didnt know enough to push that gate open muttered reddy to himself i always supposed old man coyote was smart but if this is an example of his smartness ill match my wits against his any day  all this time old man coyote was not so far away as reddy thought he had gone only fat enough to make sure that reddy couldnt see him then creeping along in the blackest of the black shadows he had returned to a place where he could watch reddy  its queer that gate should have been left unlocked thought old man coyote it may have been an accident and again it may have been done purposely there may not be any danger inside then again there may im not going to push that gate open or step inside when there is some one to do it for me ill just leave it for reddy fox to do     chapter xiii  the mischievous little night breeze      a little act of mischief can     upset the deepest best laid plan      bowser the hound   reddy fox was very pleased with himself as he thought how much smarter he was than old man coyote he didnt waste any time in pushing open the henyard gate it didnt enter his head that there might be a trap inside he was so eager to find out if the little door where in daytime the hens ran in and out of the henhouse was open that he jumped inside the henyard just as soon as the gate was pushed open wide enough for him to enter  old man coyote watching from his hiding place saw reddy push the gate open and enter the henyard so far so good muttered old man coyote to himself there isnt any trap just inside that gate so it will be safe enough for me to follow reddy in there i think ill wait a bit however and see what luck he has in getting into the henhouse if he catches a chicken he wont stop to eat it there he wont dare to all i need do is to wait right here around the corner and if he brings a chicken out ill simply tell him to drop it then i will have the chicken and will have run no risk you see old man coyote is a very very clever old sinner  so old man coyote peeked through the wires and watched reddy fox who thought himself so much smarter steal swiftly across to the henhouse and try that little door it was closed but it wasnt fastened as reddy could tell by poking at it  it is just a matter of time and patience muttered reddy to himself if i keep at it long enough i can work it open you see reddy had done that very thing once before a great while ago  so he set himself to work with such patience as he could and all the time old man coyote watched and wondered what reddy was doing he guessed that reddy was having some trouble but also he knew from reddys actions that reddy hoped to get inside that henhouse  now reddy had left the henyard gate ajar if he had pushed it wide open things might have been different but he didnt push it wide open he left it only halfway open by and by there happened along a mischievous little night breeze there is nothing that a mischievous little night breeze enjoys more than making things move this mischievous little night breeze found that that gate would swing so it blew against that gate and blew and blew until suddenly with a sharp little click the gate closed and the spring latch snapped into place reddy fox was a prisoner     chapter xiv  the difference between being inside and outside      youll find twill often come about     that he whos in fain would be out      bowser the hound   it certainly is queer what a difference there is between being inside and outside sometimes happiness is inside and sometimes it is outside sometimes the one who is inside wishes with all his might that he were outside and sometimes the one who is outside would give anything in the world to be inside  just take the case of reddy fox he had stolen inside of farmer browns henyard leaving the gate halfway open he had set himself to work to open the little sliding door through which in the daytime the hens passed in and out of the henhouse as he worked he had been filled with great contentment and joy he knew that bowser the hound had disappeared he felt sure that there was nothing to fear and he fully expected to dine that night on chicken then along came a mischievous little night breeze and swung that gate shut  at the click of the latch reddy turned his head and in a flash he saw what had happened all in an instant everything had changed for reddy fox fear and despair took the place of contentment and happy anticipations he was a prisoner inside that henyard  frantically reddy rushed over to the gate there wasnt even a crack through which he could thrust his sharp little nose then beside himself with fear he raced around that henyard seeking a hole through which he might escape there wasnt any hole that fence had been built to keep out such people as reddy fox and of course a fence that would keep reddy out would also keep him in if he happened to be caught inside as he now was he couldnt dig down under it because you know the ground was frozen hard and covered with snow and an icy crust he was caught and that was all there was to it  suddenly reddy became aware of some one just outside the wire fence looking in and grinning wickedly it was old man coyote between them was nothing but that wire but oh what a difference reddy was inside and a prisoner old man coyote was outside and free  good evening reddy said old man coyote i hope youll enjoy your chicken dinner when you are eating it just think over this bit of advice never take a risk when you can get some one else to take it for you i would like a chicken dinner myself but as it is i think i will enjoy a mouse or two better pay my respects to farmer browns boy when he comes in the morning  with this old man coyote once more grinned that wicked grin of his and trotted away towards the green forest reddy watched him disappear and would have given anything in the world to have been outside the fence in his place instead of inside where he then was     chapter xv  reddys forlorn chance      this saying is both true and terse     theres nothing bad but might be worse      bowser the hound   if any one had said this to reddy fox during the first half hour after he discovered that he was a prisoner in farmer browns henyard he wouldnt have believed it he wouldnt have believed a word of it he would have said that he couldnt possibly have been worse off than he was  he was a prisoner and he couldnt possibly get out he knew that in the morning farmer browns boy would certainly discover him it couldnt be otherwise that is it couldnt be otherwise as long as he remained in that henyard there wasnt a thing not one solitary thing under or behind which he could hide so to reddys way of thinking things couldnt possibly have been worse  but after a while having nothing else to do reddy began to think now it is surprising how thinking will change matters one of the first thoughts that came to reddy was that he might have been caught in a trapone of those cruel traps that close like a pair of jaws and sometimes break the bones of the foot or leg and from which there is no escape right away reddy realized that to have been so caught would have been much worse than being a prisoner in farmer browns henyard this made him feel just a wee wee bit better and he began to do some more thinking  for a long time his thinking didnt help him in the least at last however he remembered the chicken dinner he had felt so sure he was going to enjoy the thought of the chicken dinner reminded him that inside the henhouse it was dark he had been inside that henhouse before and he knew that there were boxes in there if he were inside the henhouse it might be it just might possibly be that he could hide when farmer browns boy came in the morning  so once more reddy went to work at that little sliding door where the hens ran in and out during the day he already had found out that it wasnt fastened and he felt sure that with patience he could open it so he worked away and worked away until at last there was a little crack he got his claws in the little crack and pulled and pulled the little crack became a little wider by and by it was wide enough for him to get his whole paw in then it became wide enough for him to get his head half in after this all he had to do was to force himself through for as he pushed and shoved the little door opened he was inside at last there was a chance just a forlorn chance that he might be able to escape the notice of farmer browns boy in the morning     chapter xvi  why reddy went without a chicken dinner      a dinner is far better lost     than eaten at too great a cost      bowser the hound   can you imagine reddy fox with a chicken dinner right before him and not touching it well that is just what happened in farmer browns henhouse it wasnt because reddy had no appetite he was hungry very hungry he always is in winter then it doesnt often happen that he gets enough to eat at one meal to really fill his stomach yet here he was with a chicken dinner right before him and he didnt touch it  you see it was this way reddys wits were working very fast there in farmer browns henhouse he knew that he had only a forlorn chance of escaping when farmer browns boy should come to open the henhouse in the morning he knew that he must make the most of that forlorn chance he knew that freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach  on one of the lower roosts sat a fat hen she was within easy jumping distance reddy knew that with one quick spring she would be his if the henyard gate had been open he would have wasted no time in making that one quick spring but the henyard gate as you know was closed fast  im awfully hungry muttered reddy to himself but if i should catch and eat that fat hen farmer browns boy would be sure to notice the feathers on the floor the very minute he opened the door it wont do reddy it wont do you cant afford to have the least little thing seem wrong in this henhouse what you have got to do is to swallow your appetite and keep quiet in the darkest corner you can find  so reddy fox spent the rest of the night curled up in the darkest corner partly behind a box all the time his nose was filled with the smell of fat hens every little while a hen who was being crowded too much on the roost would stir uneasily and protest in a sleepy voice just think of what reddy suffered just think how you would feel to be very very hungry and have right within reach the one thing you like best in all the world to eat and then not dare touch it some foolish folks in reddys place would have eaten that dinner and trusted to luck to get out of trouble later but reddy was far too wise to do anything of that kind  doing as reddy did that night is called exercising selfrestraint everybody should be able to do it but it sometimes seems as if very many people cannot do it anyway they dont do it and because they dont do it they are forever getting into trouble  reddy knew when morning came although the henhouse was still dark somehow or other hens always know just when jolly round red mr sun kicks his blankets off and begins his daily climb up in the blue blue sky the big rooster on the topmost perch stretched his long neck flapped his wings and crowed at the top of his voice reddy shivered it wont be long now before farmer browns boy comes thought he     chapter xvii  farmer browns boy drops a pan of corn      who when surprised keeps calm and cool     is one most difficult to fool      bowser the hound   in his lifetime reddy fox has spent many anxious moments but none more anxious than those in which he waited for farmer browns boy to open the henhouse and feed the biddies on this particular morning  from the moment when the big rooster on the topmost perch stretched forth his neck flapped his wings and crowed as only he can crow reddy was on pins and needles as the saying is hiding behind a box in the darkest corner of the henhouse he hardly dared to breathe you see he didnt want those hens to discover him he knew that if they did they would make such a racket that they would bring farmer browns boy hurrying out to find out what the trouble was  reddy had had experience with hens before he knew that if farmer browns boy heard them making a great racket he would know that something was wrong and he would come all prepared this was the one thing that reddy did not want his one chance to escape would be to take farmer browns boy entirely by surprise  never had time dragged more slowly the hens were awake and several of them flew down to the floor of the henhouse they passed so close to where reddy was hiding that merely by reaching out a black paw he could have touched them because he took particular pains not to move not even to twitch a black ear they did not see him anyway if they did see him they took no notice of him how the moments did drag all the time he lay there listening wishing that farmer browns boy would come yet dreading to have him come it seemed ages before he heard sounds which told him that people were awake in farmer browns house  finally he heard a distant door slam then he heard a whistle a merry whistle it drew nearer and nearer farmer browns boy was coming to feed the hens reddy tried to hold his breath he heard the click of the henyard gate as farmer browns boy opened it then he heard the crunch crunch crunch of farmer browns boys feet on the snow  suddenly the henhouse door was thrown open and farmer browns boy stepped inside in his hand he held a pan filled with the breakfast he had brought for the hens suddenly a box in the darkest corner of the henhouse moved farmer browns boy turned to look and as he did so a slim form dashed fairly between his legs it startled him so that he dropped the pan and spilled the corn all over the henhouse floor great scott he exclaimed what under the sun was that and rushed to the door to see he was just in time to get a glimpse of a red coat and a bushy tail disappearing around a corner of the barn     chapter xviii  mutual relief      the wise fox knows that with every chicken he steals he puts an     increased price on his own skin      bowser the hound   when reddy fox dashed between the legs of farmer browns boy and out of the open door of the henhouse it was with his heart in his mouth at least it seemed that way would he find the henyard gate open supposing farmer browns boy had closed it after he entered reddy would then be a prisoner just as he had been all night and all hope would end  just imagine with what terrible anxiety and eagerness reddy looked towards that gate as he dashed out of the open door just imagine the relief that was his when he saw that the gate was open in that very instant the snowy outside world became more beautiful and wonderful than ever it had been in all his life before he was free free free  if ever there was a surprised boy that boy was farmer browns as he watched reddy twist around a corner of the barn and disappear  reddy fox he exclaimed now how under the sun did that rascal get in here then as he realized that reddy had actually been inside the henhouse anxiety for the biddies swept over him hastily he turned fully expecting to see either the bodies of two or three hens on the floor or scattered feathers to show that reddy had enjoyed a midnight feast there were no feathers and so far as he could see all the hens were standing or walking about  at once farmer browns boy began to count them of course he knew exactly how many there should be when he got through counting not one was missing farmer browns boy was puzzled he counted them again then he counted them a third time he began to think there must be something wrong with his counting after the fourth count however he was forced to believe that not a single one was missing  if reddy fox had been relieved when he discovered that henyard gate open farmer browns boy was equally relieved when he found that not a single biddie had been taken when two people are relieved at the same time it is called mutual relief but there was this difference between reddy fox and farmer browns boy reddy knew all about what had happened and farmer browns boy couldnt even guess he went all around that henhouse trying to find a way by which reddy fox had managed to get in of course he discovered that the little sliding door where the biddies go in and out of the henhouse was open he guessed that this was the way by which reddy had entered  but this didnt explain matters at all he knew that the gate had been latched when he entered the henyard that morning how had reddy managed to get into that henyard with that gate closed to this day farmer browns boy is still wondering     chapter xix  where was bowser the hound      a good hound never barks on a cold trail      bowser the hound   where was bowser the hound that was the question which was puzzling all the little people who knew him also it was puzzling farmer browns boy and farmer brown and mrs brown i have said that it was puzzling all the little people who knew him this is not quite true because there were two who could at least guess what had become of bowser one was old man coyote who had as you remember led bowser far away and got him lost the other was blacky the crow who had discovered bowser in his trouble and had helped him  old man coyote didnt know exactly where bowser was and he wasnt interested enough to think much about it he hoped that bowser had been so badly lost that he never would return blacky the crow knew exactly where bowser was but he kept it to himself it pleases blacky to have a secret which other people would give much to know blacky is one of those people who can keep a secret he isnt at all like peter rabbit  reddy fox was one who was very much interested in the fate of bowser the hound as day after day went by and bowser did not appear reddy had a growing hope that he never would appear  i cant imagine what old man coyote could have done to bowser said reddy to himself he certainly couldnt have killed bowser in a fight for that old rascal would never in the world dare face bowser the hound in a fight but he certainly has caused something to happen to bowser if that bothersome dog never returns it certainly will make things a lot easier for granny fox and myself  as for farmer browns boy he was as much puzzled as any of the little people and a whole lot more worried he drove all about the neighborhood asking at every house if anything had been seen of bowser nowhere did he get any trace of him no one had seen him it was very mysterious farmer browns boy had begun to suspect that bowser had met with an accident somewhere off in the woods and had been unable to get help it made farmer browns boy very sad indeed his cheery whistle was no longer heard for he did not feel like whistling at last he quite gave up hope of ever again seeing bowser     chapter xx  where bowser was      when things are at their very worst     as bad you think as they can be     just lay aside your feelings sad     the road ahead may turn you see      bowser the hound   you remember that blacky the crow led poor bowser to an old road and there left him blacky reasoned that if bowser had any sense at all he would know that that road must lead somewhere and would follow it if he didnt have sense enough to do this he deserved to starve or freeze was the way blacky reasoned it out of course blacky knew exactly where the road would lead  now bowser did have sense of course he did the minute he found that road a great load was taken from his mind he no longer felt wholly lost he was certain that all he had to do was to keep in that road and sooner or later he would come to a house the thing that worried him most was whether or not he would have strength enough to keep going until he reached that house you remember that he was weak from lack of food lame and half frozen  poor old bowser he certainly was the picture of misery as he limped along that road his tail hung down as if he hadnt strength enough to hold it up his head also hung low he walked on three legs and limped with one of these in his eyes was such a look of pain and suffering as would have touched the hardest heart he whined and whimpered as he limped along  it seemed to him that he had gone a terribly long distance though really it was not far at all when something tickled his nose that wonderful nose which can smell the tracks of others long after they have passed but this time it wasnt the smell of a track that tickled his nose it was something in the air bowser lifted his head and sniffed long and hard what he smelled was smoke he knew what that meant somewhere not very far ahead of him was a house  illustration somewhere not very far ahead of him was a house page 96  with new hope and courage bowser tried to hurry on presently around a turn of the road he saw a farmyard the smell of the smoke from the chimney of the farmhouse was stronger now and with it was mingled an appetizing smell of things cooking into bowsers whimper there now crept a little note of eagerness as he dragged himself across the farmyard and up to the back door there his strength quite left him he didnt have enough left to even bark all he could do was whine after what seemed a long long time the door opened and a motherly woman stood looking down at him two minutes later bowser lay on a mat close by the kitchen stove      chapter xxi  bowser becomes a prisoner      there is no one in all the great world more faithful than a     faithful dog      bowser the hound   bowser the hound was a prisoner yes sir bowser was a sureenough prisoner but there is a great difference in prisons bowser was a prisoner of kindness it seems funny that kindness should ever make any one a prisoner but it is so sometimes  you see it was this way when bowser had been taken in to that strange farmhouse he had been so used up that he had had only strength enough to very feebly wag his tail right away the people in that farmhouse knew what had happened to bowser that is they knew part of what had happened to him they knew that he had been lost and had somehow hurt one leg they were very very good to him they fed him and made a comfortable bed for him and rubbed something on the leg which he had hurt and which had swollen almost right away after eating bowser went to sleep and slept and slept and slept it was the very best thing he could have done  the next day he felt a whole lot better but he was so stiff and lame that he could hardly move he didnt try very much he was petted and cared for quite as tenderly as he would have been at his own home so several days passed and bowser was beginning to feel more like himself the more he felt like himself the more he wanted to go home it wasnt that there he would receive any greater kindness than he was now receiving but home is home and there is no place like it so bowser began to be uneasy  this dog doesnt belong anywhere around here said the man of the house i know every hound for miles around and i never have seen this one before he has come a long distance it will not do to let him go for he will try to find his way home and the chances are that he will again get lost we must keep him in the house or chained up perhaps some day we may be able to find his owner if not we will keep him i am sure he will soon become contented here  now that man knew dogs had bowser had the chance he would have done exactly what that man had said he would have tried to find his way home and he hadnt the least idea in the world in which direction home lay but he didnt get the chance to try when he was allowed to run out of doors it was always with some one to watch him he was petted and babied and made a great deal of but he knew all the time that he was a prisoner he knew that if he was to get away at all he would have to sneak away and somehow there never seemed a chance to do this he was grateful to these kindly people but down in his heart was a great longing for farmer browns boy and home he always felt this longing just a wee bit stronger when blacky the crow passed over and cawed     chapter xxii  farmer browns boy looks in vain      loyalty is priceless and       is neither sold nor bought     alas how few who seem to know       its value as they ought      bowser the hound   as i have told you farmer browns boy had been all about the neighborhood asking at each farmhouse if anything had been seen of bowser of course nothing had been seen of him and so at last farmer browns boy felt sure that something dreadful had happened to bowser in the woods  for several days he tramped through the green forest and up through the old pasture looking for signs of bowser his heart was heavy for you know bowser was quite one of the family he visited every place he could think of where he and bowser had hunted together he knew that by this time bowser couldnt possibly be alive if he had been caught by a foot in a trap or had met with an accident in the woods he had quite given up all hope of ever seeing bowser alive again but he did want to know just what had happened to him and so he kept searching and searching  one day farmer browns boy heard that a strange dog had been found over in the next township that afternoon he drove over there his heart filled with great hope but he had his long ride for nothing for when he got there he found that the strange dog was not bowser at all  meanwhile old man coyote and reddy fox and old granny fox had become very bold they even came up around the henyard in broad daylight  i believe you know something about what has become of bowser farmer browns boy said as he chased old man coyote away one day you certainly know that he isnt home and i more than suspect that you know why he isnt home i certainly shall have to get another dog to teach you not to be so bold  but somehow farmer browns boy couldnt bring himself quite to taking such a step as getting a new dog he felt that no other dog ever could take bowsers place and in spite of the fact that he thought he had given up all hope of ever seeing bowser again way down deep inside was something which if it were not hope was something enough like it to keep him from getting another dog in bowsers place  whenever he went about away from home he kept an eye out for dogs in the farmyards he passed he did it without really thinking anything about it he had given up hope of finding bowser yet he was always looking for him     chapter xxiii  bowsers great voice      to long for home when far away     will rob of joy the brightest day      bowser the hound   there is as much difference in the voices of dogs as in the voices of human beings for that matter this is true of many of the little people who wear fur bowser the hound had a wonderful deep clear voice a voice that could be heard a great distance no one who knew it would ever mistake it for the voice of any other hound  as a rule bowser seldom used that great voice of his save when he was hunting some one then when the scent was strong he gave tongue so fast that you wondered how he had breath enough left to run but now that he was a prisoner of kindness in the home of the people who had taken him in when he had crept to their doorstep bowser sometimes bayed from sheer homesickness when he was tied out in the yard he would sometimes get to thinking of his home and long to see farmer brown and mrs brown and especially his master farmer browns boy then when he could stand it no longer he would open his mouth and send his great voice rolling across to the woods with a tone of mournfulness which never had been there before  but great as was bowsers voice and far as it would carry there was none who knew him to hear it save blacky the crow you remember that blacky knew just where bowser was and often flew over that farmyard to make sure that bowser was still there so more than once blacky heard bowsers great voice with its mournful note and understood it  it troubled blacky yes sir it actually troubled blacky he knew just what was the matter with bowser but for the life of him he couldnt think of any way of helping bowser that dog is homesick croaked blacky as he sat in the top of a tall tree scratching his head as if he thought he might scratch an idea out of it of course he doesnt know how to get home and if he tried he probably would get as badly lost as he was before anyway they dont give him a chance to try i cant lead farmer browns boy over here because he doesnt understand my talk and i dont understand his there isnt a thing i can do but keep watch i wish bowser would stop barking it makes me feel uncomfortable yes sir it makes me feel uncomfortable old man coyote got bowser into this trouble and he ought to get him out again but i dont suppose it is the least bit of use to ask him it wont do any harm to try anyway  so blacky started back for the green forest and the old pasture near farmer browns to look for old man coyote and for a long time as he flew he could hear bowsers voice with its note of homesickness and longing     chapter xxiv  blacky tries to get help      youll find that nothing more worth while can be     than helping others whose distress you see      bowser the hound   on his way back to the green forest near farmer browns home blacky the crow kept a sharp watch for old man coyote but old man coyote was nowhere to be seen and it was too late to go look for him because jolly round red mr sun had already gone to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows were hurrying towards the green forest  blacky never is out after dark you might think that one with so black a coat would be fond of the black shadows but it isnt so at all the fact is bold and impudent as blacky the crow is in daylight he is afraid of the dark he is quite as timid as anybody i know of in the dark so blacky always contrives to go to bed early and is securely hidden away in his secret roostingplace by the time the black shadows reach the edge of the green forest  perhaps it isnt quite fair to say that blacky is afraid of the dark it isnt the dark itself that blacky fears but it is one who is abroad in the dark it is hooty the owl hooty would just as soon dine on blacky the crow as he would on any one else and blacky knows it  the next morning bright and early blacky flew over to the old pasture to the home of old man coyote just as he got there he saw old man coyote coming home from an allnight hunt i hope you have had good hunting said blacky politely  old man coyote looked up at blacky sharply blacky is polite only when he wants to get something there was plenty of hunting but little enough reward for it replied old man coyote what brings you over here so early i should suppose you would be looking for a breakfast  now blacky the crow is a very wise fellow he knows when it is to be sly and crafty and when it is best to be frank and outspoken this was a time for the latter i know where bowser the hound is said blacky i saw him yesterday  old man coyote pricked up his ears and grinned i thought he was dead said he its a long time since weve heard from bowser is he well  quite well replied blacky but unhappy he is homesick i suspect that the trouble with bowser is that he hasnt the least idea in which direction home lies you enjoy running so why not go with me to pay bowser a visit and then lead him back home  old man coyote threw back his head and laughed in that crazy fashion of his till the very hills rang with the sound of his voice     chapter xxv  blacky calls on reddy fox      saying what you mean and meaning what you say     are matters quite as different as night is from the day      bowser the hound   blacky the crow wasted no time with old man coyote after he heard old man coyote laugh there was a note in that crazy laugh of old man coyotes that told blacky he might just as well talk to the rocks or the trees about helping bowser the hound old man coyote had led bowser into his trouble and it was quite clear that not only did he have no regrets but he was actually glad that bowser was not likely to return  youre a hardhearted old sinner declared blacky as he prepared to fly in search of reddy fox  old man coyote grinned it is every one for himself you know said he bowser would do his best to catch me if he had the chance so if he is in trouble he can stay there for all of me  it didnt take blacky long to find reddy fox you see it was so early in the morning that reddy had not retired for his daily nap like old man coyote he was just returning from a nights hunt when blacky arrived  hello reddy exclaimed blacky you certainly are looking in mighty fine condition that red coat of yours is the handsomest coat ive ever seen if i had a coat like that i know i should be so swelled up with pride that i just wouldnt be able to see common folks im glad youre not that way reddy one of the things i like about you is the fact that you never allow your fine coat to make you proud that is more than i can say for some folks i know  reddy fox sat down with his big bushy tail curled around to keep his toes warm cocked his head on one side and looked up at blacky the crow as if he were trying to see right inside that black head to find out what was going on there  now what has that black scamp got in his mind thought reddy he never pays compliments unless he wants something in return that old black rascal has the smoothest tongue in the green forest he hasnt come way over here just to tell me that i have a handsome coat he wouldnt fly over a fence to tell anybody that unless it was for a purpose  aloud he said good morning blacky i suppose i must admit i have a fine coat perhaps i do look very fine but if you could see under this red coat of mine you would find mighty little meat on my ribs to be quite honest i am not feeling half as fine as i look you lucky fellows who can fly and dont have to think about distances may be able to live well these days but as for me ive forgotten when last i had a good meal     chapter xxvi  red wits and black wits      this fact youll find is always so     hes quick of wit who fools a crow      bowser the hound   there is no greater flatterer in the green forest or on the green meadows than blacky the crow when he hopes to gain something thereby his tongue is so smooth that it is a wonder it does not drip oil he is crafty is blacky but these same things are true of reddy fox no one ever yet had a chance to accuse reddy fox of lacking in sharp wits mistakes he makes as everybody does but reddys wits are always keen and active  now reddy knew perfectly well that blacky wanted something of him and this was why he was saying such pleasant things blacky the crow knew that reddy knew this thing and that if he would make use of reddy as he hoped to he must contrive to keep reddy wholly in the dark as to what he wanted done  so as they sat there reddy fox on the snow with his tail curled around his feet to keep them warm and blacky the crow in the top of a little tree above reddys head they were playing a sort of game it was red wits against black wits reddy was trying to outguess blacky and blacky was trying to outguess reddy and both were enjoying it people with sharp wits always enjoy matching their wits against other sharp wits  when reddy fox said that in spite of his fine appearance he had forgotten when last he had had a good meal blacky pretended to think he was joking you surprise me said he whatever is the matter with my good friend reddy that he goes hungry when he no longer has anything to fear from bowser the hound by the way i saw bowser the other day  at this just for an instant reddys eyes flew wide open then they half closed again until they were just two yellow slits but quickly as he closed them blacky had seen that startled surprise yes said blacky i saw bowser the other day or at least some one who looked just like him wouldnt you like to have him back here reddy  most decidedly no replied reddy with great promptness a dog is a nuisance he isnt of any use in the wide wide world  not even to drive off old man coyote asked blacky slyly for he knew that more than once bowser the hound had helped reddy out of trouble with old man coyote  reddy pretended not to hear this i dont believe you saw bowser said he i dont believe anybody will ever see bowser again i hope not anyway and blacky knew by the way reddy said this that it would be quite useless to ask reddy to help get bowser home     chapter xxvii  the artfulness of blacky      who runs in circles never gets far      bowser the hound   to be artful is to be very clever it is to do things in a way so clever that people will not see what you are really doing no one can be more artful than blacky the crow when he sets out to be  blacky was smart enough not to let reddy know that he was seeking reddys help for bowser he soon found out that reddy would not knowingly help the least little bit so he decided at once that the only thing for him to do was to get reddy to help unsuspectingly he changed the subject very abruptly  how are the chickens at farmer browns inquired he  reddy looked up and grinned they seem to be in just as good health as ever said he so far as i can judge farmer browns boy seems to be terribly suspicious he locks them up at night so tight that not even shadow the weasel could get his nose inside that henhouse  blackys eyes twinkled but he took care that reddy should not see them farmer browns boy is different from some folks i know said he  hows that demanded reddy fox  why replied blacky there is a certain farmyard i know of where the hens are not kept shut up at all in the daytime but run around where they please i see them every day when i am flying over they certainly are finelooking hens i dont think ive ever seen fatter ones some of them are so fat they can hardly run  as reddy fox listened a look of eagerness crept into his eyes and his mouth began to water he just couldnt help it where did you say those hens are he asked trying to speak carelessly  i didnt say replied blacky turning his head aside to hide a grin it is a long way from here reddy so i dont believe you would really be interested  that all depends replied reddy i would go a long way if it were worth while i dont suppose you noticed if there were any dogs about where those hens are  blacky pretended not to hear this ive often thought said he of you and mrs reddy as i have looked down at those fat hens it is too bad that they are so far away     chapter xxviii  reddy fox dreams of chickens      its a poor watchdog who sleeps with both eyes closed      bowser the hound   reddy fox watched blacky the crow grow smaller and smaller until he was just a black speck in the distance finally he disappeared reddy looked very thoughtful he looked that way because he was thoughtful in fact reddy was doing a lot of hard thinking he was thinking about those chickens blacky had told him of the more he thought of them the hungrier he grew you see reddy had been having rather a hard time to get enough to eat  yes sir said reddy to himself i would go a long long distance to get a good plump hen i wish i knew just where that farm is that that black rascal talked about i wonder if he has gone that way now if i were sure that he has i would make a little journey in that direction myself but im not sure that black rascal flies all over the country that farm may lie in the direction he has gone now and it may be in quite the opposite direction somehow ive got to find out in just which direction it is  reddy yawned for he had been out all night and he was sleepy he decided that the best thing he could do would be to get a good rest one must always be fit if one is to get on in this life the harder one must work the more fit one should keep and a proper amount of sleep is one of the most necessary things in keeping fit so reddy curled up to sleep  hardly had his eyes closed when he began to dream you see he had been thinking so hard about those fat hens and he was so hungry for one of them that right away he began to dream of fat hens it was a beautiful dream at least it was a beautiful dream to reddy fat hens were all about him they were so fat that they could hardly walk not only were they fat but they seemed to think that their one object in life was to fill the stomachs of hungry foxes for they just stood about waiting to be caught  never in all his life had reddy fox known anything so wonderful as was that dream there were no dogs to worry him there were no hunters with dreadful guns all he had to do was to reach out and help himself to as many fat hens as he wanted he ate and ate and ate all in his dream you know and when he could eat no more he started for home when he started for home the fat hens that were left started along with him he led a procession of fat hens straight over to his home in the old pasture  just imagine how reddy felt when at last he awoke and there was not so much as a feather from a fat hen anywhere about while his stomach fairly ached with emptiness     chapter xxix  reddy tries to arouse blackys pity      trust a fox only as far as you can see him and lock the     chickens up before you do that      bowser the hound   all the next night as reddy fox hunted and hunted for something to eat he kept thinking of that dream of fat hens and he kept wondering how he could get blacky the crow to tell him just where that farm with fat hens was blacky on his part had spent a whole day wondering how he could induce reddy fox to make that long journey over to where bowser the hound was a prisoner of kindness blacky was smart enough to know that if he seemed too anxious for reddy to make that long journey reddy would at once suspect something he knew well enough that if reddy had any idea that bowser the hound was over there nothing would tempt him to make the trip  early the next morning just as on the morning before blacky stopped over by reddys house this time reddy was already home actually he was waiting for blacky though he wouldnt have had blacky know it for the world as soon as he saw blacky coming he lay down on his doorstep and pretended not to see blacky at all  good morning reddy said blacky as he alighted in the top of a little tree close by  reddy raised his head as if it were all he could do to lift it good morning blacky said he in a feeble voice  blacky looked at him sharply whats the matter reddy he demanded you seem to be feeling badly  reddy sighed it was a long doleful sigh i am feeling badly blacky said he i never felt worse in my life the truth is iii reddy paused  you what demanded blacky looking at reddy more sharply than ever  i am starving said reddy very feebly i certainly shall starve to death unless i can find some way of getting at least one good meal soon you have no idea blacky how dreadful it is to be hungry all the time again reddy sighed and followed this with a second sigh and then a third sigh  blacky looked behind him so that reddy might not see the twinkle in his eyes for blacky understood perfectly what reddy was trying to do reddy wasnt fooling him a bit when he looked back at reddy he was very grave he was doing his best to look very sympathetic  im right sorry to hear this reddy said he i certainly am ive been hungry myself more than once it seems a pity that you should be starving here when over on that farm i told you about yesterday are fat hens to be had for the taking if you were not so weak i would be tempted to show you where they are     chapter xxx  blacky the crow is all pity      people who think that they are fooling others very often     discover that they have been fooling themselves      bowser the hound   to have seen and heard blacky the crow as he talked to reddy fox you would have thought that there was nothing under the sun in his heart or mind but pity yes sir said he i certainly would be tempted to show you where those fat hens are if you were not too weak i just cant bear to see an old friend starve it is too bad that those fat hens are so far away i feel sure that one of them would make you quite yourself again  dontdont talk about them said reddy feebly if i could have just one fat hen that is all i would ask are they so very far from here  blacky nodded his head vigorously yes said he they are a long way from here they are such a long way that im afraid you are too weak to make the journey if you were quite yourself you could do it nicely but for one in your condition it is i fear altogether too long a journey  it wouldnt do any harm to try it perhaps suggested reddy in a hesitating way it is no worse to starve to death in one place than another and i never was one to give up without trying if you dont mind showing me the way brother blacky i would at least like to try to reach that place where the fat hens are of course i cannot keep up with you in fact i couldnt if i were feeling well and strong perhaps you can tell me just how to find that place and then i neednt bother you at all  blacky pretended to be lost in thought while reddy watched him anxiously finally blacky spoke it certainly makes my heart ache to see you in such a condition brother reddy said he i tell you what ill do you know crows are famous for flying in a straight line when we want to get to any place in particular i will fly straight towards that farm where the fat hens are you follow along as best you can in your feeble condition it will take you a long time to get anywhere near there this will give me time to go hunt for my own dinner and then i will come back until i meet you after that i will show you the way now i will start along and you follow  reddy got to his feet as if it were hard work then blacky spread his wings and started off cawing encouragement all the time inside he was laughing to think that reddy fox should think he had fooled him he forgot to ask again if there is a dog there chuckled blacky to himself  as for reddy no sooner was blacky well on his way than he started off at his swiftest pace there was nothing weak or feeble in the way reddy ran then he was in a hurry to get to those fat hens     chapter xxxi  blacky is much pleased with himself      you cannot tell from a single feather what a bird looks like     nor from a lone hair how big a dog is      bowser the hound   straight away towards the farm where bowser the hound was flew blacky the crow every few minutes he would caw encouragement to reddy fox who as you know was following but who of course could not travel as fast as did blacky in between times blacky would chuckle to himself he was mightily pleased with himself was blacky  in the first place his plan was working beautifully you know what he was after was to get reddy fox over to that farm where bowser was he hoped that if reddy should catch one of those fat hens the farmer would put bowser on reddys trail he knew that reddy would probably return straight home and bowser following reddys trail would thus find his way back home to farmer browns of course it all depended on whether reddy would catch one of those fat hens and whether bowser would be allowed to hunt him blacky had a plan for making sure that if reddy did get one of those hens the folks in the farmhouse would know it  but what tickled blacky most the knowledge that reddy fox thought he was fooling blacky you remember that reddy had pretended to be very weak blacky knew that reddy was nothing of the kind at the very first opportunity blacky stopped in the top of a tall tree as if to rest his real reason for stopping was to have a chance to look back you see while he was flying he couldnt look behind him  presently just as he expected he saw in the distance a little red speck and that little red speck was moving very fast indeed there was nothing weak or feeble in the way that red speck was coming across the snowcovered fields blacky chuckled hoarsely  nearer and nearer came the red speck and of course the nearer it came the larger it grew presently it stopped moving fast it began to move slowly and stop every once in a while as if to rest blacky laughed right out he knew then that reddy fox had discovered him sitting in the top of that tall tree and was once more pretending it was a sort of a game a game that blacky thoroughly enjoyed  as soon as he knew that reddy had discovered him he once more spread his black wings and started on the same thing happened over again in fact blacky did not fly far this time before once more waiting it was great fun to see reddy suddenly pretend that he was too weak to run it was such fun that blacky quite forgot that he had had no breakfast  yes blacky the crow was very much pleased with himself it looked very much as if he would succeed in helping bowser the hound this pleased him but it pleased him still more to know that he was fooling clever reddy fox while reddy thought he was the one who was doing the fooling      chapter xxxii  blacky waits for reddy      be wise my friends and do not fail     to trust a dog who wags his tail      bowser the hound   just before reaching the farm where the fat hens and bowser the hound were blacky waited for reddy fox to catch up it was some time before reddy appeared for he wasnt traveling as fast now as when he had started out you see that farm really was a very long way from the old pasture where reddy lives and reddy had run very hard because you know he was so anxious to get one of those fat hens  as soon as blacky saw him he hid in the thick branches of a tall pinetree reddy didnt see him in fact blacky had been so far ahead that reddy had lost sight of him some time before out of the bushes trotted reddy his tongue was hanging out just a little and he was panting blacky was just about to speak when reddy stopped he stood as still as if he had suddenly been frozen stiff his sharp black ears were cocked forward and his head was turned just a little to one side reddy was listening he was listening for the voice of blacky you see he thought blacky was still far ahead of him  for several minutes reddy stood listening with all his might and blackys sharp eyes twinkled as he looked down watching reddy suddenly reddy sat down there was an expression on his sharp face which blacky understood perfectly it was quite plain that reddy was becoming suspicious he had begun to suspect that he had been tricked by blacky and led so far away from home for nothing  down inside blacky chuckled it was a noiseless chuckle for blacky did not intend to give himself away until he had to but when at last he saw that reddy was beginning to get uneasy blacky spoke you seem to be feeling better brother reddy said he you must excuse me for keeping you waiting but i did not suppose that any one so weak and feeble as you appeared to be early this morning could possibly get here so soon  at the sound of blackys voice reddy was so startled that he jumped quite as if he had sat down on a prickly briar he was sharp enough to know that it was no longer of any use to pretend im feeling better said he the thought of those fat hens has quite restored my strength did you say that they are near here  i didnt say but blacky didnt finish he didnt need to from the other side of a little swamp in front of them a rooster crowed that was answer enough reddys yellow eyes gleamed in an instant he was on his feet the picture of alertness  are you satisfied that i told the truth asked blacky reddy nodded     chapter xxxiii  reddy watches the fat hens      sooner or later the crookedest trail will straighten      bowser the hound   at the sound of that roosters voice on the other side of the little swamp reddy became a changed fox could you have been sitting where you could have seen him as did blacky the crow you never never would have guessed that reddy had run a very long distance and was tired he did not even glance up at blacky he did not even say thank you to blacky for having shown him the way he looked neither to the right nor to the left but with eyes fixed eagerly ahead began to steal forward swiftly  making no sound for reddy can step very lightly when he chooses to he trotted quickly through the little swamp until he drew near the other side then he crouched close to the snowcovered ground and began to steal from bush to bush until he reached the trunk of a fallen tree on the very edge of the swamp to this he crawled on his stomach and peeped around the end of it  everything was as blacky the crow had said not far away was a farmyard and walking about in it was a big rooster lording it over a large flock of fat hens they were not shut in by a wire fence as were farmer browns hens some were taking a sun bath just in front of the barn door others were scattered about picking up bits of food which had been thrown out for them a few were scratching in some straw in the cowyard in the barn a horse stamped from the farmhouse sounded the voice of a woman singing once the door of the farmhouse opened and an appetizing odor floated out to tickle the nose of reddy  reddy looked sharply for signs of a dog not one could he see if there was a dog he must be either in the barn or in the house it was quite clear to reddy that no fox had bothered this flock of fat hens he was sorely tempted to rush out and grab one of them at once but he didnt he was far too clever to do anything like that until he was absolutely sure that it would be safe  so reddy lay flat behind the old tree trunk with just his nose and his eyes showing around the end of it and studied what would be best to do he was sure that he could get one of those fat hens but he wanted more early that morning reddy would have been quite contented with one but now that he was sure that he could get one he wanted more if he were too bold and frightened those hens while catching one they would make such a racket that they would be sure to bring some one from the farmhouse the thing to do was to be patient until he could catch one without alarming the others then perhaps he would be able to catch another reddy decided to be patient and wait     chapter xxxiv  patience and impatience      patience is a virtue       in a cause thats right     in a cause that isnt       its a cause for fright      bowser the hound   one of the first things that the little people of the green forest and the green meadows who hunt other little people learn is patience sometimes it takes a long time to learn this but it is a necessary lesson reddy fox had learned it reddy knew that often even his cleverness would not succeed without patience when he was young he had lost many a good meal through impatience  reddy could not remember when he had been more hungry than he was now lying there behind the fallen tree watching the fat hens walking about unsuspectingly just a little way from him it seemed to him that he simply must rush out and catch one of them but reddy was smart enough to know that if he did this there would at once be such a screaming and squawking that some one would be sure to rush out from the farmhouse to find out what was going on if he were discovered there would be small chance for him to get another fat hen reddy is keen enough to make the most of an opportunity he knew that if he could get one of these hens without frightening the others he would have a chance to get another he might have a chance to get several in this way  so though he was so eager and so hungry he made himself keep perfectly still while he studied out a plan by and by he stole ever so carefully around back of the barn to the cowyard some of those fat hens were scratching in the straw of the cowyard just outside the cowyard was a pile of old boards reddy crawled behind this pile of old boards and then crouched and settled himself to be patient he knew that sooner or later one of those fat hens would be likely to come out of the cowyard in this way he might be able to catch one without the others knowing a thing about it  blacky the crow sat in the top of a tall tree where he could see all that was going on blacky was as impatient as reddy was patient why doesnt the red rascal rush in and get one of those fat hens muttered blacky what is the matter with him anyway i wonder if he is afraid he could catch one of them without half trying and there he lies as if he expected them to run right into his mouth i dont want to sit here all day yet i cant do a thing until he catches one of those hens  so reddy waited patiently and blacky waited impatiently and the fat hens wandered about unsuspectingly and for a long long time nothing happened     chapter xxxv  things happen all at once      the cleverest fox is almost certain to visit the chicken yard     once too often      bowser the hound   jolly round bright mr sun high in the blue blue sky looked down on as peaceful a scene as ever was in the cowyard back of the barn of this particular farm stood several cows contentedly chewing their cuds as they took their daily airing half a dozen fat hens were walking about among them and scratching in the straw out in the farmyard in front of the barn were many more fat hens behind a pile of old boards just outside the cowyard was a spot of red in the top of a tall tree not far distant was a spot of black the smoke from the chimney of the farmhouse floated skyward in a lazy way looking down on the great world jolly round bright mr sun saw no more peaceful scene anywhere  by and by a fat hen walked over to the bars of the cowyard and hopped up on the lower bar there she sat for some time then making up her mind that she would see what was outside she hopped down and walked over to the pile of old boards right then things happened all at once that red spot behind the pile of old boards suddenly came to life there was a quick spring and that fat hen was seized by the neck so suddenly that she didnt have time to make a sound at the same instant the black spot in the top of the tall tree came to life and blacky the crow flew over to the roof of the barn screaming at the top of his lungs now those who know blacky well know when he is screaming fox fox fox although it sounds as if he were saying caw caw caw  in a moment the door of the farmhouse flew open and a man stepped out with a dog at his heels the man looked up at blacky and he knew by blackys actions that something was going on back of the barn right away he guessed that there must be a fox there and calling the dog to follow he ran around to see what was happening of course reddy heard him coming and with a little snarl of anger at blacky the crow he seized the fat hen by the neck threw her body over his shoulder and started for the nearby swamp as fast as his legs could take him  just as reddy reached the edge of the swamp he heard the roar of a great voice behind him he knew that voice it was the voice of bowser the hound it could be no one else but bowser who was behind him for there was no other voice quite like his dismay awoke in reddys heart he knew that bowser was wise to the tricks of foxes and that he would have to use all his cunning to get rid of bowser to do it he would have to drop that fat hen he had come so far to get do you wonder that reddy was dismayed     chapter xxxvi  reddy hides the fat hen      dishonesty will run away     where honesty will boldly stay      bowser the hound   reddy fox was in a fix he certainly was in a fix here he was with the fat hen which he had come such a long long way to get and no chance to eat it for bowser the hound was on his trail ordinarily reddy fox can run faster than can bowser but it is one thing to run with nothing to carry and another thing altogether to with a burden as heavy as a fat hen reddys wits were working quite as fast as his legs  i cant carry this fat hen far thought reddy for bowser will surely catch me i dont want to drop it because i have come such a long way to get it and goodness knows when i will be able to catch another the thing for me to do is to hide it where i can come back and get it after i get rid of that pesky dog goodness what a noise he makes  as he ran reddy watched sharply this way and that way for a place to hide the fat hen he knew he must find a place soon because already that fat hen was growing very heavy presently he spied the hollow stump of a tree he didnt know it was hollow when he first saw it but from its looks he thought it might be the top of it was only about two feet above the ground reddy stopped and stood up on his hind legs so as to see if the top of that stump was hollow it was with a quick look this way and that way to make sure he wasnt seen he tossed the fat hen over into the hollow and then with a sigh of relief darted away  with the weight of that fat hen off his shoulders and the worry about it off his mind reddy could give all his attention to getting rid of bowser the hound he had no intention of running any farther than he must in the first place he had traveled so far that he did not feel like running in the second place he wanted to get back to that hollow stump and the fat hen just as soon as possible  it wasnt long before reddy realized that it was not going to be so easy to fool bowser the hound bowser was too wise to be fooled by common tricks such as breaking the trail by jumping far to one side after running back on his own tracks a little way or by running along a fallen tree and jumping from the end of it as far as he could of course he tried these tricks but each time bowser simply made a big circle with his nose to the ground and picked up reddys new trail  reddy didnt know that country about there at all and little by little he began to realize how much this meant at home he knew every foot of the ground for a long distance in every direction this made all the difference in the world because he knew just how to play all kinds of tricks but here it was different it seemed to him that all he could do was to run and run     chapter xxxvii  farmer browns boy has a glad surprise      the sweetest sound in the world is the voice of one you love      bowser the hound   farmer browns boy had an errand which took him far from home he harnessed the horse to a sleigh and started off right after dinner now it happened that his errand took him in the direction of the farm where bowser the hound had been taken such good care of and where reddy fox had that very day caught the fat hen farmer browns boy was not thinking of bowser you see he had already visited most of the farms in that direction in his search for bowser and had found no trace of him  it was a beautiful day to be sleighing and farmer browns boy was whistling merrily for there is nothing he enjoys more than a sleigh ride he had almost reached the place he had started for when way off across the fields to his right he heard a dog now farmer browns boy enjoys listening to the sound of a hound chasing a fox there is something about it which stirs the blood he stopped whistling and stopped the horse in order that he might listen better  at first that sound was very very faint but as farmer browns boy listened it grew louder and clearer suddenly farmer browns boy leaped up excitedly thats bowser he cried as sure as i live thats good old bowser i would know that voice among a million  he leaped from the sleigh and tied the horse then he climbed over the fence and began to run across the snowcovered fields he could tell from the sound in what direction bowser was running he could tell from the appearance of the country about where reddy fox would be likely to lead bowser and he ran for a place which he felt sure reddy would be likely to pass  louder and louder sounded the great voice of bowser and faster and faster ran farmer browns boy to reach that place before bowser should pass the louder that great voice sounded the more absolutely certain farmer browns boy became that it was the voice of bowser and a great joy filled his heart at last he reached an old road he felt certain that reddy would follow that road so he hid behind an old stone wall on the edge of it  he did not have long to wait a red form appeared around a turn in the old road running swiftly then it stopped and stood perfectly still of course it was reddy fox he was listening to make sure just how far behind him bowser was he listened for only a moment and then started on as swiftly as before right down the road past farmer browns boy reddy ran and never once suspected he was being watched  a few minutes later another form appeared around the turn in the road it was bowser yes sir it was bowser with a glad cry farmer browns boy jumped over the stone wall and waited     chapter xxxviii  reddy goes back for his fat hen      joy will make a puppy of an old dog      bowser the hound   when bowser the hound is following the trail of reddy fox it takes a great deal to make him leave that trail his love of the hunt is so great that as a rule nothing short of losing the trail will make him stop he will follow it until he cannot follow it any longer  but for once bowser actually forgot that he was following reddy fox yes sir he did as he came down that old road with his nose in reddys tracks he was so intent on what he was doing that he didnt see farmer browns boy waiting for him he didnt see him until he almost ran into him  for just a second bowser stared in utter surprise then with a little yelp of pure joy he leaped up and did his best to lick his masters face could you have seen bowser you might have thought that he was just a foolish young puppy he cut up such wild antics to express his joy he yelped and whined and barked he nearly knocked farmer browns boy down by leaping up on him he raced around in circles when at last he was still long enough farmer browns boy just threw his arms around him and hugged him he hugged him so hard he made bowser squeal then two of the happiest folks in all the great world started back across the snowcovered fields to the sleigh  bowser and farmer browns boy were not the only ones who rejoiced reddy fox had been badly worried although he had tried every trick he could think of he had not been able to get rid of bowser and he had just about made up his mind that there was nothing for it but to start back to the old pasture which was so far away that would mean giving up the fat hen which he had hidden in the hollow stump  of course reddy knew the instant that bowser began to yelp and bark that something had happened what it was he couldnt imagine he sat down to wait and listen then he heard the voice of farmer browns boy reddy knew that voice and he grinned for he felt sure that bowser would give up the hunt he grinned because now he would have a chance to go back for that fat hen at the same time that grin was not wholly a happy grin because reddy knew that now bowser would return to his home  presently reddy very carefully crept back to a place where he could see what was going on he watched farmer browns boy start back for the road and the sleigh with bowser jumping up on him and racing around him like a foolish young puppy he waited only long enough to make sure that bowser would not come back then he turned and trotted swiftly along his own back trail towards that hollow stump into which he had tossed that fat hen reddys thoughts were very pleasant thoughts for they were all of the fine dinner of which he now felt sure     chapter xxxix  a vanished dinner      this fact youll find whereer you go      is true of fox or dog or man     dishonesty has never paid      and what is more it never can      bowser the hound   very pleasant were the thoughts of reddy fox as he trotted back to the swamp where was the hollow stump in which he had hidden the fat hen he had stolen yes sir very pleasant were the thoughts of reddy fox he felt sure that no dinner he had ever eaten had tasted anywhere near as good as would the dinner he was about to enjoy  in the first place his stomach had not been really filled for a long time food had been scarce and while reddy had always obtained enough to keep from starving it was a long time since he had had a really good meal he had you remember traveled a very long distance to catch that fat hen and it had been many hours since he had had a bite of anything there is nothing like a good appetite to make things taste good reddy certainly had the appetite to make that fat hen the finest dinner a fox ever ate  so with pleasant thoughts of the feast to come reddy trotted along swiftly presently he reached the little swamp in which was the hollow stump as he drew near it he moved very carefully you see he was not quite sure that all was safe he knew that the farmer from whom he had stolen that fat hen had seen him run away with it and he feared that that farmer might be hiding somewhere about with a terrible gun so reddy used his eyes and his ears and his nose as only he can use them all seemed safe it was as still in that little swamp as if no living creature had ever visited it stopping every few steps to look listen and sniff reddy approached that hollow stump  quite certain in his own mind that there was no danger reddy lightly leaped up on the old stump and peeped into the hollow in the top then he blinked his eyes very fast indeed if ever there has been a surprised fox in all the great world that one was reddy there was no fat hen in that hollow reddy couldnt believe it he wouldnt believe it that fat hen just had to be there he blinked his eyes some more and looked again all he saw in that hollow stump was a feather the fat hen had vanished all reddys dreams of a good dinner vanished too a great rage took their place somebody had stolen his fat hen  reddy looked about him hurriedly and anxiously there wasnt a sign of anybody about or that anybody had been there reddys anger began to give place to wonder and then to something very like fear how could anybody have taken that fat hen and left no trace and how could a fat hen with a broken neck disappear of its own accord it gave reddy a creepy feeling     chapter xl  where was reddys dinner      often it is better to look for a new trail than to waste time     hunting for an old one      bowser the hound   reddy fox is used to all sorts of queer happenings yes sir he is used to all sorts of queer happenings and as a rule reddy is seldom puzzled for long you see he is such a clever fellow himself that any one clever enough to fool him for long must be very clever indeed this time however all the cleverness of his sharp wits did him no good the fat hen he had hidden in a hollow stump had disappeared without leaving trace  reddys first thought was that probably the farmer from whom he had stolen the fat hen had found it and taken it away at once he began to use that wonderful nose of his searching for the scent of that farmer very carefully he sniffed all about the top of that old stump and inside the hollow there wasnt the faintest scent of anybody there then he jumped down and with his nose to the ground ran all around the stump sniffing sniffing sniffing the only thing he discovered was the scent of bowser the hound and he knew that bowser had not taken that fat hen because as you remember bowser had kept right on chasing him  reddy began to feel afraid of that old stump people usually are afraid of mysterious things and it certainly was very mysterious that a fat hen with a broken neck should disappear without leaving any trace at all reddy sat down at a little distance and did a lot of hard thinking he looked every which way even up in the tree tops but all his looking was in vain it was so mysterious that if he hadnt known positively that he was awake he would have thought it was all a dream  but reddy is something of a philosopher that fat hen was gone and there was no use in wasting time puzzling over it there were other fat hens where that one came from and he would just have to catch another  so reddy trotted through the swamp till he came to the edge of it there his keen nose found the scent of the farmer it didnt take him two minutes to discover that the farmer had followed bowser the hound to the edge of the swamp and then gone back eagerly reddy looked over to the farmyard for those fat hens they too had disappeared not one was to be seen but there was no mystery about the disappearance of these other fat hens he heard the muffled crow of the big rooster it came from the henhouse all those fat hens had been shut up it was perfectly plain to reddy that the farmer suspected reddy might return and he didnt intend to lose another fat hen with a little yelp of disappointment reddy turned his back on the farm and trotted off into the woods     chapter xli  what blacky the crow saw      the greatest puzzle is simple enough when you know the answer      bowser the hound   there were just two people to whom the disappearance of that fat hen reddy fox had hidden in the hollow stump was not a mystery one of them was blacky the crow when the farmer and bowser the hound had rushed out at the sound of blackys excited cawing blacky had flown to the top of a tall tree from which he could see all that went on everything had happened just as blacky had hoped it would bowser had taken the trail of reddy fox and blacky felt sure that sooner or later reddy would lead him back home to farmer browns  blacky was doubly pleased with himself he was pleased to think that he had found a way of getting bowser back home and he was quite as much pleased because he had been smart enough to outwit reddy fox he didnt wish reddy any harm and he felt sure that no harm would come to him he didnt even wish him to lose that dinner reddy had come so far to get but he didnt care if reddy did lose it if only his plan worked out as he hoped it would  i wonder what hell do with that fat hen muttered blacky as he watched reddy race away with it thrown over his shoulders he cant carry that hen far and keep out of the way of bowser i think ill follow and see what he does with it  so blacky followed and his eyes twinkled when he saw reddy hide the fat hen in the hollow stump he knew that no matter how far bowser might chase reddy reddy would come back for that fat hen and he was rather glad to think that reddy would have that good dinner after all  no one will ever think to look in that hollow stump thought blacky and i certainly will not tell any one reddy has earned that dinner now i think ill go get something to eat myself  at that very instant blackys sharp eyes caught a glimpse of a gray form with broad wings and in a perfect panic of fear blacky began to fly as fast as he knew how for a thick sprucetree not far away he plunged in among the branches and hid in the thickest part he could find with little shivers of fear running all over him he peeked out and watched that big gray form on broad wings it sailed over to that hollow stump two long legs with great curving claws reached down in and a moment later that fat hen was disappearing over the tree tops blacky sighed with relief  illustration on broad wings it sailed over to that hollow stump page 199  its a lucky thing for me that robber mr goshawk saw reddy hide that fat hen muttered blacky if he hadnt he might have caught me for i didnt see him at all     chapter xlii  all is well that ends well      when things go wrong just patient be     until the end you plainly see     for often things that seem all bad     will end by making all hands glad      bowser the hound   reddy fox trotting homeward had nothing but bitterness in his heart and nothing at all in his stomach he was tired and hungry and bitterly disappointed he was in a country with which he was not familiar and so he did not know where to hunt and he felt that he just must get something to eat do what he would he couldnt help thinking about that fat hen he had hidden and which had so mysteriously disappeared the more he thought of it the worse he felt it was bad enough to be hungry and have no idea where the next meal was coming from but it was many times worse to have had that meal and then lose it to reddy everything was all wrong  now on his way home ready had to pass several farms hunger made him bold and at each farm he stole softly as near as possible to the farmyard hoping that he might find more fat hens unguarded now it happened that that afternoon a farmer at one of these farms was preparing some chickens to be taken to market early the next morning he was picking these chickens in a shed attached to the barn he had several all picked when he was called to the house on an errand  it happened that just after he had disappeared reddy fox came stealing around from behind the barn and at once he smelled those chickens just imagine how reddy felt when he peeped in that shed and saw those fine chickens just waiting for him two minutes later reddy was racing back to the woods with one of them this time there was no dog behind him and in a little hollow reddy ate the finest dinner he ever had had you see there were no feathers to bother him on that chicken for it had been picked when the last bit had disappeared reddy once more started for home and this time he was happy for his stomach was full  long before reddy got back to the old pasture farmer browns boy and bowser the hound had reached home such a fuss as everybody did make over bowser it seemed as if each one at farmer browns was trying to spoil bowser as for bowser himself he was the happiest dog in all the great world  blacky the crow got back to the green forest near farmer browns just before jolly round mr sun went to bed blacky had found plenty to eat and he had seen no more of fierce mr goshawk as blacky settled himself on his roost he heard from the direction of farmer browns house a great voice it was the voice of bowser the hound trying to express his joy in being home blacky chuckled contentedly he too was happy for it always makes one happy to have ones plans succeed  alls well that ends well he chuckled and closed his eyes sleepily  blacky never could have fooled old granny fox as he did reddy she is far too smart to be fooled even by so clever a scamp as blacky she is so smart that she deserves a book all her own and so the next volume in this series will be old granny fox   the end
