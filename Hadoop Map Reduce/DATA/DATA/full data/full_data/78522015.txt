allusions to and quotations from her contributions to periodical literature and a leading newspaper gives expression to a general wish when it says that “this series of striking essays ought to be collected and reprinted both because of substantive worth and because of the light they throw on the author’s literary canons and predilections”  in fact the articles which were published anonymously in the westminster review have been so pointedly designated by the editor and the biographical sketch in the “famous women” series is so emphatic in its praise of them and so copious in its extracts from one and the least important one of them that the publication of all the review and magazine articles of the renowned novelist without abridgment or alteration would seem but an act of fair play to her fame while at the same time a compliance with a reasonable public demand  nor are these first steps in her wonderful intellectual progress any the less but are all the more noteworthy for being first steps  “to ignore this stage” says the author of the valuable little volume to which we have just referred—“to ignore this stage in george eliot’s mental development would be to lose one of the connecting links in her history” furthermore “nothing in her fictions excels the style of these papers” here is all her “epigrammatic felicity” and an irony not surpassed by heine himself while her paper on the poet young is one of her wittiest bits of critical analysis  her translation of status’s “life of jesus” was published in 1840 and her translation of feuerbach’s “essence of christianity” in 1854  her translation of spinoza’s “ethics” was finished the same year but remains unpublished  she was associate editor of the westminster review from 1851 to 1853  she was about twentyseven years of age when her first translation appeared thirtythree when the first of these magazine articles appeared thirtyeight at the publication of her first story and fiftynine when she finished “theophrastus such”  two years after she died at the age of sixtyone  so that george eliot’s literary life covered a period of about thirtytwo years  the introductory chapter on her “analysis of motives” first appeared as a magazine article and appears here at the request of the publishers after having been carefully revised indeed almost entirely rewritten by its author     “george eliot’s” analysis of motives   george eliot is the greatest of the novelists in the delineation of feeling and the analysis of motives  in “uncovering certain human lots and seeing how they are woven and interwoven” some marvellous work has been done by this master in the two arts of rhetoric and fiction  if you say the telling of a story is her forte you put her below wilkie collins or mrs oliphant if you say her object is to give a picture of english society she is surpassed by bulwer and trollope if she be called a satirist of society thackeray is her superior if she intends to illustrate the absurdity of behavior she is eclipsed by dickens but if the analysis of human motives be her forte and art she stands first and it is very doubtful whether any artist in fiction is entitled to stand second  she reaches clear in and touches the most secret and the most delicate spring of human action  she has done this so well so apart from the doing of everything else and so in spite of doing some other things indifferently that she works on a line quite her own and quite alone as a creative artist in fiction  others have done this incidentally and occasionally as charlotte brontë and walter scott but george eliot does it elaborately with laborious painstaking with purpose aforethought  scott said of richardson “in his survey of the heart he left neither head bay nor inlet behind him until he had traced its soundings and laid it down in his chart with all its minute sinuosities its depths and its shallows”  this is too much to say of richardson but it is not too much to say of george eliot  she has sounded depths and explored sinuosities of the human heart which were utterly unknown to the author of “clarissa harlowe”  it is like looking into the translucent brook—you see the wriggling tad the darting minnow the leisurely trout the motionless pike while in the bays and inlets you see the infusoria and animalculæ as well  george eliot belongs to and is the greatest of the school of artists in fiction who write fiction as a means to an end instead of as an end and while she certainly is not a storyteller of the first order considered simply as a storyteller her novels are a striking illustration of the power of fiction as a means to an end  they remind us as few other stories do of the fact that however inferior the story may be considered simply as a story it is indispensable to the delineation of character  no other form of composition no discourse or essay or series of independent sketches however successful could succeed in bringing out character equal to the novel  herein is at once the justification of the power of fiction  “he spake a parable” with an “end” in view which could not be so expeditiously attained by any other form of address  a story of the firstclass with the story as end in itself and a story of the first class told as a means to an end has never been and it is not likely ever will be found together  the novel with a purpose is fatal to the novel written simply to excite by a plot or divert by pictures of scenery or entertain as a mere panorama of social life  so intense is george eliot’s desire to dissect the human heart and discover its motives that plot diction situations and even consistency in the vocabulary of the characters are all made subservient to it  with her it is not so much that the characters do thus and so but why they do thus and so  dickens portrays the behavior george eliot dissects the motive of the behavior  here comes the human creature says dickens now let us see how he will behave  here comes the human creature says george eliot now let us see why he behaves  “suppose” she says “suppose we turn from outside estimates of a man to wonder with keener interest what is the report of his own consciousness about his doings with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors and with what spirit he wrestles against universal pressure which may one day be too heavy for him and bring his heart to a final pause”  the outside estimate is the work of dickens and thackeray the inside estimate is the work of george eliot  observe in the opening pages of the great novel of “middlemarch” how soon we pass from the outside dress to the inside reasons for it from the costume to the motives which control it and color it  it was “only to close observers that celia’s dress differed from her sister’s” and had “a shade of coquetry in its arrangements”  dorothea’s “plain dressing was due to mixed conditions in most of which her sister shared”  they were both influenced by “the pride of being ladies” of belonging to a stock not exactly aristocratic but unquestionably “good”  the very quotation of the word good is significant and suggestive  there were “no parceltying forefathers” in the brooke pedigree  a puritan forefather “who served under cromwell but afterward conformed and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family estate” had a hand in dorothea’s “plain” wardrobe  “she could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery” but celia “had that commonsense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation”  both were examples of “reversion”  then as an instance of heredity working itself out in character “in mr brooke the hereditary strain of puritan energy was clearly in abeyance but in his niece dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues”  could anything be more natural than for a woman with this passion for and skill in “unravelling certain human lots” to lay herself out upon the human lot of woman with all her “passionate patience of genius” one would say this was inevitable  and for a delineation of what that lot of woman really is as made for her there is nothing in all literature equal to what we find in “middlemarch” “romola” “daniel deronda” and “janet’s repentance”  “she was a woman and could not make her own lot”  never before indeed was so much got out of the word “lot”  never was that little word so hard worked or well worked  “we women” says gwendolen harleth “must stay where we grow or where the gardeners like to transplant us  we are brought up like the flowers to look as pretty as we can and be dull without complaining  that is my notion about the plants and that is the reason why some of them have got poisonous”  to appreciate the work that george eliot has done you must read her with the determination of finding out the reason why gwendolen harleth “became poisonous” and dorothea with all her brains and “plans” a failure why “the many theresas find for themselves no epic life only a life of mistakes the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with the meanness of opportunity”  you must search these marvellous studies in motives for the key to the blunders of “the blundering lives” of woman which “some have felt are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness with which the supreme power has fashioned the natures of women”  but as there is not “one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more the social lot of woman cannot be treated with scientific certitude”  it is treated with a dissective delineation in the women of george eliot unequalled in the pages of fiction  and then woman’s lot as respects her “social promotion” in matrimony so much sought and so necessary for her to seek even in spite of her conscience and at the expense of her happiness—the unravelling of that lot would also come very natural to this expert unraveller  and never have we had the causes of woman’s “blunders” in matchmaking and man’s blunders in lovemaking told with such analytic acumen or with such pathetic and sarcastic eloquence  it is not far from the question of woman’s social lot to the question of questions of human life the question which has so tremendous an influence upon the fortunes of mankind and womankind the question which it is so easy for one party to “pop” and so difficult for the other party to answer intelligently or sagaciously  why does the young man fall in love with the young woman who is most unfit for him of all the young women of his acquaintance and why does the young woman accept the young man or the old man who is better adapted to making her life unendurable than any other man of her circle of acquaintances  why does the stalwart adam bede fall in love with hetty sorrel “who had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her” the delineator of his motives “respects him none the less”  she thinks that “the deep love he had for that sweet rounded darkeyed hetty of whose inward self he was really very ignorant came out of the very strength of his nature and not out of any inconsistent weakness  is it any weakness pray to be wrought upon by exquisite music  to feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your soul the delicate fibres of life which no memory can penetrate and binding together your whole being past and present in one unspeakable vibration  if not then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by the exquisite curves of a woman’s cheek and neck and arms by the liquid depth of her beseeching eyes or the sweet girlish pout of her lips  for the beauty of a lovely woman is like music—what can one say more”  and so “the noblest nature is often blinded to the character of the woman’s soul that beauty clothes”  hence “the tragedy of human life is likely to continue for a long time to come in spite of mental philosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all mistakes of the kind”  how simple the motive of the rev edward casaubon in popping the question to dorothea brooke bow complex her motives in answering the question he wanted an amanuensis to “love honor and obey” him  she wanted a husband who would be “a sort of father and could teach you even hebrew if you wished it”  the matrimonial motives are worked to draw out the character of dorothea and nowhere does the method of george eliot show to greater advantage than in probing the motives of this fine strong conscientious blundering young woman whose voice “was like the voice of a soul that once lived in an Æolian harp”  she had a theoretic cast of mind  she was “enamored of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing what seemed to her to have those aspects”  the awful divine had those aspects and she embraced him  “certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot and hinder it from being decided according to custom by good looks vanity and merely canine affection”  that’s a george eliot stroke  if the reader does not see from that what she is driving at he may as well abandon all hope of ever appreciating her great forte and art dorothea’s goodness and sincerity did not save her from the worst blunder that a woman can make while her conscientiousness only made it inevitable  “with all her eagerness to know the truths of life she retained very childlike ideas about marriage”  a little of the goose as well as the child in her conscientious simplicity perhaps  she “felt sure she would have accepted the judicious hooker if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony or john milton when his blindness had come on or any other great man whose odd habits it would be glorious piety to endure”  true to life our author furnishes the “great man” and the “odd habits” and the miserable years of “glorious” endurance  “dorothea looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of mr casaubon’s mind seeing reflected there every quality she herself brought”  they exchanged experiences—he his desire to have an amanuensis and she hers to be one  he told her in the billycooing of their courtship that “his notes made a formidable range of volumes but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous still accumulating results and bring them like the earlier vintage of hippocratic books to fit a little shelf”  dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception  here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school literature  here was a modern augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint  dorothea said to herself “his feeling his experience what a lake compared to my little pool”  the little pool runs into the great reservoir  will you take this reservoir to be your husband and will you promise to be unto him a fetcher of slippers a dotter of i’s and crosser of t’s and a copier and condenser of manuscripts until death doth you part  i will  they spend their honeymoon in rome and on page 211 of vol i we find poor dorothea “alone in her apartments sobbing bitterly with such an abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone”  what was she crying about  “she thought her feeling of desolation was the fault of her own spiritual poverty”  a characteristic george eliot probe  why does not dorothea give the real reason for her desolateness  because she does not know what the real reason is—conscience makes blunderers of us all  “how was it that in the weeks since their marriage dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling depression that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead no whither  i suppose it was because in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal  but the doorsill of marriage once crossed expectation is concentrated on the present  having once embarked on your marital voyage you may become aware that you make no way and that the sea is not within sight—that in fact you are exploring an inclosed basin”  so the ungauged reservoir turns out to be an inclosed basin but dorothea was prevented by her social lot and perverse goodness and puritanical “reversion” from foreseeing that  she might have been saved from her gloomy marital voyage “if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love”  then perhaps ladislaw would have been her first husband instead of her second as he certainly was her first and only love  such are the chances and mischances in the lottery of matrimony  equally admirable is the diagnosis of gwendolen harleth’s motives in “drifting toward the tremendous decision” and finally landing in it “we became poor and i was tempted”  marriage came to her as it comes to many as a temptation and like the deadening drug or the maddening bowl to keep off the demon of remorse or the cloud of sorrow like the forgery or the robbery to save from want  “the brilliant position she had longed for the imagined freedom she would create for herself in marriage”—these “had come to her hunger like food with the taint of sacrilege upon it” which she “snatched with terror”  grandcourt “fulfilled his side of the bargain by giving her the rank and luxuries she coveted”  matrimony as a bargain never had and never will have but one result  “she had a root of conscience in her and the process of purgatory had begun for her on earth”  without the root of conscience it would have been purgatory all the same  so much for resorting to marriage for deliverance from poverty or old maidhood  better be an old maid than an old fool  but how are we to be guaranteed against “one of those convulsive motiveless actions by which wretched men and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery”  rosamond lydgate says “marriage stays with us like a murder” yes if she could only have found that out before instead of after her own marriage  but “what greater thing” exclaims our novelist “is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined for life to strengthen each other in all labor to minister to each other in all pain to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the last parting”  while a large proportion of her work in the analysis of motives is confined to woman she has done nothing more skilful or memorable than the “unravelling” of bulstrode’s mental processes by which he “explained the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with his beliefs”  if there were no dorothea in “middlemarch” the character of bulstrode would give that novel a place by itself among the masterpieces of fiction  the bulstrode wound was never probed in fiction with more scientific precision  the pious villain finally finds himself so near discovery that he becomes conscientious  “his equivocation now turns venomously upon him with the fullgrown fang of a discovered lie”  the past came back to make the present unendurable  “the terror of being judged sharpens the memory”  once more “he saw himself the banker’s clerk as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech and fond of theological definition  he had striking experience in conviction and sense of pardon spoke in prayermeeting and on religious platforms that was the time he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest of dream  he remembered his first moments of shrinking  they were private and were filled with arguments—some of these taking the form of prayer”  private prayer—but “is private prayer necessarily candid  does it necessarily go to the roots of action  private prayer is inaudible speech and speech is representative  who can represent himself just as he is even in his own reflections”  bulstrode’s course up to the time of his being suspected “had he thought been sanctioned by remarkable providences appearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best use of a large property”  providence would have him use for the glory of god the money he had stolen  “could it be for god’s service that this fortune should go to” its rightful owners when its rightful owners were “a young woman and her husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits and might scatter it abroad in triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable providences”  bulstrode felt at times “that his action was unrighteous but how could he go back  he had mental exercises calling himself naught laid hold on redemption and went on in his course of instrumentality”  he was “carrying on two distinct lives”—a religious one and a wicked one  “his religious activity could not be incompatible with his wicked business as soon as he had argued himself into not feeling it incompatible”  “the spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him  there may be coarse hypocrites who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world but bulstrode was not one of them  he was simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs and who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs”  and now providence seemed to be taking sides against him  “a threatening providence—in other words a public exposure—urged him to a kind of propitiation which was not a doctrinal transaction  the divine tribunal had changed its aspect to him  selfprostration was no longer enough he must bring restitution in his hand  by what sacrifice could he stay the rod  he believed that if he did something right god would stay the rod and save him from the consequences of his wrongdoing”  his religion was “the religion of personal fear” which “remains nearly at the level of the savage”  the exposure comes and the explosion society shudders with hypocritical horror especially in the presence of poor mrs bulstrode who “should have some hint given her that if she knew the truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet”  society when it is very candid and very conscientious and very scrupulous cannot “allow a wife to remain ignorant long that the town holds a bad opinion of her husband”  the photograph of the middlemarch gossips sitting upon the case of mrs bulstrode is taken accurately  equally accurate and far more impressive is the narrative of circumstantial evidence gathering against the innocent lydgate and the guilty bulstrode—circumstances that will sometimes weave into one tableau of public odium the purest and the blackest characters  from this tableau you may turn to that one in “adam bede” and see how circumstances are made to crush the weak woman and clear the wicked man  and then you can go to “romola” or indeed to almost any of these novels and see how wrongdoing may come of an indulged infirmity of purpose that unconscious weakness and conscious wickedness may bring about the same disastrous results and that repentance has no more effect in averting or altering the consequences in one case than the other  tito’s ruin comes of a feeble felix holt’s victory of an unconquerable will  nothing is more characteristic of george eliot than her tracking of tito through all the motives and counter motives from which he acted  “because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant and cared for nothing so much as his own safety he came at last to commit such deeds as make a man infamous”  so poor romola tells her son as a warning and adds “if you make it the rule of your life to escape from what is disagreeable calamity may come just the same and it would be calamity falling on a base mind which is the one form of sorrow that has no balm in it”  out of this passion for the analysis of motives comes the strong character slightly gnarled and knotted by natural circumstances as trees that are twisted and misshapen by storms and floods—or characters gnarled by some interior force working in conjunction with or in opposition to outward circumstances  she draws no monstrosities or monsters thus avoiding on the one side romance and on the other burlesque  she keeps to life—the life that fails from “the meanness of opportunity” or is “dispersed among hindrances” or “wrestles” unavailingly “with universal pressure”  why had mr gilfil in those late years of his beneficent life “more of the knots and ruggedness of poor human nature than there lay any clear hint of it in the openeyed loving” young maynard  because “it is with men as with trees if you lop off their finest branches into which they were pouring their young lifejuice the wounds will be healed over with some rough boss some odd excrescence and what might have been a grand tree expanding into liberal shade is but a whimsical misshapen trunk many an irritating fault many an unlovely oddity has come of a hard sorrow which has crushed and maimed the nature just when it was expanding into plenteous beauty and the trivial erring life which we visit with our harsh blame may be but as the unsteady motion of a man whose best limb is withered  the dear old vicar had been sketched out by nature as a noble tree  the heart of him was sound the grain was of the finest and in the grayhaired man with his slipshod talk and caustic tongue there was the main trunk of the same brave faithful tender nature that had poured out the finest freshest forces of its lifecurrent in a first and only love”  her style is influenced by her purpose—may be said indeed to be created by it  the excellences and the blemishes of the diction come of the end sought to be attained by it  its subtleties and obscurities were equally inevitable  analytical thinking takes on an analytical phraseology  it is a striking instance of a mental habit creating a vocabulary  the method of thought produces the form of rhetoric  some of the sentences are mental landscapes  the meaning seems to be in motion on the page it is elusive from its very subtlety  it is more our analyst than her character of rufus lyon who “would fain find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the soul’s pathways”  mrs transome’s “lancetedged epigrams” are dull in comparison with her own  she uses them with startling success in dissecting motive and analyzing feeling they deserve as great renown as “nélaton’s probe”  for example “examine your words well and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth especially about your own feelings—much harder than to say something fine about them which is not the exact truth”  that ought to make such a revelation of the religious diarykeeper to himself as to make him ashamed of himself  and this will fit in here “our consciences are not of the same pattern an inner deliverance of fixed laws—they are the voice of sensibilities as various as our memories” and this “every strong feeling makes to itself a conscience of its own—has its own piety”  who can say that the joints of his armor are not open to this thrust “the lapse of time during which a given event has not happened is in the logic of habit constantly alleged as a reason why the event should never happen even when the lapse of time is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent  a man will tell you that he worked in a mine for forty years unhurt by an accident as a reason why he should apprehend no danger though the roof is beginning to sink”  silas marner lost his money through his “sense of security” which “more frequently springs from habit than conviction”  he went unrobbed for fifteen years which supplied the only needed condition for his being robbed now  a compensation for stupidity “if we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat and we should die of that roar that lies on the other side of silence  as it is the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity”  who does not at once recognize “that mixture of pushing forward and being pushed forward” as “the brief history of most human beings”  who has not seen “advancement hindered by impetuous candor” or “private grudges christened by the name of public zeal” or “a church built with an exuberance of faith and a deficiency of funds” or a man “who would march determinedly along the road he thought best but who was easily convinced which was best” or a preacher “whose oratory was like a belgian railway horn which shows praiseworthy intentions inadequately fulfilled”  there is something chemical about such an analysis as this of rosamond “every nerve and muscle was adjusted to the consciousness that she was being looked at  she was by nature an actress of parts that entered into her physique  she even acted her own character and so well that she did not know it to be precisely her own”  nor is the exactness of this any less cruel “we may handle extreme opinions with impunity while our furniture and our dinnergiving link us to the established order”  why not own that “the emptiness of all things is never so striking to us as when we fail in them”  is it not better to avoid “following great reformers beyond the threshold of their own homes”  does not “our moral sense learn the manners of good society”  the lancet works impartially because the hand that holds it is the hand of a conscientious artist  she will endure the severest test you can apply to an artist in fiction  she does not betray any religious bias in her novels which is all the more remarkable now that we find it in these essays  nor is it at all remarkable that this bias is so very easily discovered in the novels by those who have found it in her essays whatever opinions she may have expressed in her critical reviews she is not the evangelical or the puritan or the jew or the methodist or the dissenting minister or the churchman any more than she is the radical the liberal or the tory who talks in the pages of her fiction  every side has its say every prejudice its voice and every prejudice and side and vagary even has the philosophical reason given for it and the charitable explanation applied to it  she analyzes the religious motives without obtrusive criticism or acrid cynicism or nauseous cant—whether of the orthodox or heretical form  the art of fiction has nothing more elevated or more touching or fairer to every variety of religious experience than the delineation of the motives that actuated dinah morris the methodist preacher deronda the jew dorothea the puritan adam and seth bede and janet dempster  who can object to this  “religious ideas have the fate of melodies which once set afloat in the world are taken up by all sorts of instruments some of them woefully coarse feeble or out of tune until people are in danger of crying out that the melody itself is detestable” is it not one of the “mixed results of revivals” that “some gain a religious vocabulary rather than a religious experience”  is there a descendant of the puritans who will not relish the fair play of this “they might give the name of piety to much that was only puritanic egoism they might call many things sin that were not sin but they had at least the feeling that sin was to be avoided and resisted and colorblindness which may mistake drab for scarlet is better than total blindness which sees no distinction of color at all”  is not adam bede justified in saying that “to hear some preachers you’d think a man must be doing nothing all his life but shutting his eyes and looking at what’s going on in the inside of him” or that “the doctrines are like finding names for your feelings so that you can talk of them when you’ve never known them”  read all she has said before you object to anything she has said  then see whether you will find fault with her for delineating the motives of those with whom “great illusions” are mistaken for “great faith” of those “whose celestial intimacies do not improve their domestic manners” however “holy” they may claim to be of those who “contrive to conciliate the consciousness of filthy rags with the best damask” of those “whose imitative piety and native worldliness is equally sincere” of those who “think the invisible powers will be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there coming from a man of property”—parenthetical recognition of the almighty  may not “religious scruples be like spilled needles making one afraid of treading or sitting down or even eating”  but if this is a great mind fascinated with the insoluble enigma of human motives it is a mind profoundly in sympathy with those who are puzzling hopelessly over the riddle or are struggling hopelessly in its toils she is “on a level and in the press with them as they struggle their way along the stony road through the crowd of unloving fellowmen”  she says “the only true knowledge of our fellows is that which enables us to feel with them which gives us a finer ear for the heartpulses that are beating under the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion”  no artist in fiction ever had a finer ear or a more human sympathy for the straggler who “pushes manfully on” and “falls at last” leaving “the crowd to close over the space he has left”  her extraordinary skill in disclosing “the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts which constitute a man’s critical actions” only makes her the more charitable in judging them  “until we know what this combination has been or will be it will be better not to think ourselves wise about” the character that results  “there is a terrible coercion in our deeds which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then reconcile him to the change  and for this reason the second wrong presents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right”  there is nothing of the spirit of “served him right” or “just what she deserved” or “they ought to have known better” in george eliot  that is not in her line  the opposite of that is exactly in her line  this is characteristic of her “in this world there are so many of these common coarse people who have no picturesque or sentimental wretchedness  and it is so needful we should remember their existence else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes”  she does not leave them out  her books are full of them and of a christly charity and plea for them  who can ever forget little tiny “hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in the breast of the bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the longsought food and has found the nest torn and empty”  there is nothing in fiction to surpass in pathos the picture of the death of mrs amos barton  george eliot’s fellowfeeling comes of the habit she ascribes to daniel deronda “the habit of thinking herself imaginatively into the experience of others”  that is the reason why her novels come home so pitilessly to those who have had a deep experience of human life these are the men and women whom she fascinates and alienates  i know strong men and brave women who are afraid of her books and say so  it is because of her realness her unrelenting fidelity to human nature and human life  it is because the analysis is so delicate subtle and farin  hence the atmosphere of sadness that pervades her pages  it was unavoidable  to see only the behavior as dickens did amuses us to study only the motive at the root of the behavior as george eliot does saddens us  the humor of mrs poyser and the wit of mrs transome only deepen the pathos by relieving it  there is hardly a sarcasm in these books but has its pensive undertone  it is all in the key of “ye banks and braes o’ bonnie doon” and that would be an appropriate key for a requiem over the grave of george eliot  all her writings are now before the world and are accessible to all they have taken their place and will keep their place high among the writings of those of our age who have made that age illustrious in the history of the english tongue     the essays of “george eliot”   i  carlyle’s life of sterling   as soon as the closing of the great exhibition afforded a reasonable hope that there would once more be a reading public “the life of sterling” appeared  a new work by carlyle must always be among the literary births eagerly chronicled by the journals and greeted by the public  in a book of such parentage we care less about the subject than about its treatment just as we think the “portrait of a lord” worth studying if it come from the pencil of a vandyck  the life of john sterling however has intrinsic interest even if it be viewed simply as the struggle of a restless aspiring soul yearning to leave a distinct impress of itself on the spiritual development of humanity with that fell disease which with a refinement of torture heightens the susceptibility and activity of the faculties while it undermines their creative force  sterling moreover was a man thoroughly in earnest to whom poetry and philosophy were not merely another form of paper currency or a ladder to fame but an end in themselves—one of those finer spirits with whom amid the jar and hubbub of our daily life            “the melodies abide     of the everlasting chime”  but his intellect was active and rapid rather than powerful and in all his writings we feel the want of a stronger electric current to give that vigor of conception and felicity of expression by which we distinguish the undefinable something called genius while his moral nature though refined and elevated seems to have been subordinate to his intellectual tendencies and social qualities and to have had itself little determining influence on his life  his career was less exceptional than his character a youth marked by delicate health and studious tastes a shortlived and not very successful share in the management of the athenæum a fever of sympathy with spanish patriots arrested before it reached a dangerous crisis by an early love affair ending in marriage a fifteen months’ residence in the west indies eight months of curate’s duty at herstmonceux relinquished on the ground of failing health and through his remaining years a succession of migrations to the south in search of a friendly climate with the occasional publication of an “article” a tale or a poem in blackwood or elsewhere—this on the prosaic background of an easy competence was what made up the outer tissue of sterling’s existence  the impression of his intellectual power on his personal friends seems to have been produced chiefly by the eloquence and brilliancy of his conversation but the mere reader of his works and letters would augur from them neither the wit nor the curiosa felicitas of epithet and imagery which would rank him with the men whose sayings are thought worthy of perpetuation in books of tabletalk and “ana”  the public then since it is content to do without biographies of much more remarkable men cannot be supposed to have felt any pressing demand even for a single life of sterling still less it might be thought when so distinguished a writer as archdeacon hare had furnished this could there be any need for another  but in opposition to the majority of mr carlyle’s critics we agree with him that the first life is properly the justification of the second  even among the readers personally unacquainted with sterling those who sympathized with his ultimate alienation from the church rather than with his transient conformity were likely to be dissatisfied with the entirely apologetic tone of hare’s life which indeed is confessedly an incomplete presentation of sterling’s mental course after his opinions diverged from those of his clerical biographer while those attached friends and sterling possessed the happy magic that secures many such who knew him best during this latter part of his career would naturally be pained to have it represented though only by implication as a sort of deepening declension ending in a virtual retraction  of such friends carlyle was the most eminent and perhaps the most highly valued and as cotrustee with archdeacon hare of sterling’s literary character and writings he felt a kind of responsibility that no mistaken idea of his departed friend should remain before the world without correction  evidently however his “life of sterling” was not so much the conscientious discharge of a trust as a labor of love and to this is owing its strong charm  carlyle here shows us his “sunny side”  we no longer see him breathing out threatenings and slaughter as in the latterday pamphlets but moving among the charities and amenities of life loving and beloved—a teufelsdröckh still but humanized by a blumine worthy of him we have often wished that genius would incline itself more frequently to the task of the biographer—that when some great or good personage dies instead of the dreary three or five volumed compilations of letter and diary and detail little to the purpose which two thirds of the reading public have not the chance nor the other third the inclination to read we could have a real “life” setting forth briefly and vividly the man’s inward and outward struggles aims and achievements so as to make clear the meaning which his experience has for his fellows  a few such lives chiefly indeed autobiographies the world possesses and they have perhaps been more influential on the formation of character than any other kind of reading  but the conditions required for the perfection of life writing—personal intimacy a loving and poetic nature which sees the beauty and the depth of familiar things and the artistic power which seizes characteristic points and renders them with lifelike effect—are seldom found in combination  “the life of sterling” is an instance of this rare conjunction  its comparatively tame scenes and incidents gather picturesqueness and interest under the rich lights of carlyle’s mind  we are told neither too little nor too much the facts noted the letters selected are all such as serve to give the liveliest conception of what sterling was and what he did and though the book speaks much of other persons this collateral matter is all a kind of scenepainting and is accessory to the main purpose  the portrait of coleridge for example is precisely adapted to bring before us the intellectual region in which sterling lived for some time before entering the church  almost every review has extracted this admirable description in which genial veneration and compassion struggle with irresistible satire but the emphasis of quotation cannot be too often given to the following pregnant paragraph      “the truth is i now see coleridge’s talk and speculation was the     emblem of himself  in it as in him a ray of heavenly inspiration     struggled in a tragically ineffectual degree with the weakness of     flesh and blood  he says once he ‘had skirted the howling deserts     of infidelity’  this was evident enough but he had not had the     courage in defiance of pain and terror to press resolutely across     said deserts to the new firm lands of faith beyond he preferred to     create logical fatamorganas for himself on this hither side and     laboriously solace himself with these”  the above mentioned step of sterling—his entering the church—is the point on which carlyle is most decidedly at issue with archdeacon hare  the latter holds that had sterling’s health permitted him to remain in the church he would have escaped those aberrations from orthodoxy which in the clerical view are to be regarded as the failure and shipwreck of his career apparently thinking like that friend of arnold’s who recommended a curacy as the best means of clearing up trinitarian difficulties that “orders” are a sort of spiritual backboard which by dint of obliging a man to look as if he were strait end by making him so  according to carlyle on the contrary the real “aberration” of sterling was his choice of the clerical profession which was simply a mistake as to his true vocation      “sterling” he says “was not intrinsically nor had ever been in the     highest or chief degree a devotional mind  of course all excellence     in man and worship as the supreme excellence was part of the     inheritance of this gifted man but if called to define him i should     say artist not saint was the real bent of his being”  again      “no man of sterling’s veracity had he clearly consulted his own     heart or had his own heart been capable of clearly responding and     not been bewildered by transient fantasies and theosophic moonshine     could have undertaken this function  his heart would have answered     ‘no thou canst not  what is incredible to thee thou shalt not at     thy soul’s peril attempt to believe  elsewhither for a refuge or     die here  go to perdition if thou must but not with a lie in thy     mouth by the eternal maker no’”  from the period when carlyle’s own acquaintance with sterling commenced the life has a double interest from the glimpses it gives us of the writer as well as of his hero  we are made present at their first introduction to each other we get a lively idea of their colloquies and walks together and in this easy way without any heavy disquisition or narrative we obtain a clear insight into sterling’s character and mental progress  above all we are gladdened with a perception of the affinity that exists between noble souls in spite of diversity in ideas—in what carlyle calls “the logical outcome” of the faculties  this “life of sterling” is a touching monument of the capability human nature possesses of the highest love the love of the good and beautiful in character which is after all the essence of piety  the style of the work too is for the most part at once pure and rich there are passages of deep pathos which come upon the reader like a strain of solemn music and others which show that aptness of epithet that masterly power of close delineation in which perhaps no writer has excelled carlyle  we have said that we think this second “life of sterling” justified by the first but were it not so the book would justify itself    ii  woman in france madame de sablÉ 31   in 1847 a certain count leopold ferri died at padua leaving a library entirely composed of works written by women in various languages and this library amounted to nearly 32000 volumes  we will not hazard any conjecture as to the proportion of these volumes which a severe judge like the priest in don quixote would deliver to the flames but for our own part most of these we should care to rescue would be the works of french women  with a few remarkable exceptions our own feminine literature is made up of books which could have been better written by men—books which have the same relation to literature is general as academic prize poems have to poetry when not a feeble imitation they are usually an absurd exaggeration of the masculine style like the swaggering gait of a bad actress in male attire  few english women have written so much like a woman as richardson’s lady g  now we think it an immense mistake to maintain that there is no sex in literature  science has no sex the mere knowing and reasoning faculties if they act correctly must go through the same process and arrive at the same result  but in art and literature which imply the action of the entire being in which every fibre of the nature is engaged in which every peculiar modification of the individual makes itself felt woman has something specific to contribute  under every imaginable social condition she will necessarily have a class of sensations and emotions—the maternal ones—which must remain unknown to man and the fact of her comparative physical weakness which however it may have been exaggerated by a vicious civilization can never be cancelled introduces a distinctively feminine condition into the wondrous chemistry of the affections and sentiments which inevitably gives rise to distinctive forms and combinations  a certain amount of psychological difference between man and woman necessarily arises out of the difference of sex and instead of being destined to vanish before a complete development of woman’s intellectual and moral nature will be a permanent source of variety and beauty as long as the tender light and dewy freshness of morning affect us differently from the strength and brilliancy of the midday sun  and those delightful women of france who from the beginning of the seventeenth to the close of the eighteenth century formed some of the brightest threads in the web of political and literary history wrote under circumstances which left the feminine character of their minds uncramped by timidity and unstrained by mistaken effort  they were not trying to make a career for themselves they thought little in many cases not at all of the public they wrote letters to their lovers and friends memoirs of their everyday lives romances in which they gave portraits of their familiar acquaintances and described the tragedy or comedy which was going on before their eyes  always refined and graceful often witty sometimes judicious they wrote what they saw thought and felt in their habitual language without proposing any model to themselves without any intention to prove that women could write as well as men without affecting manly views or suppressing womanly ones one may say at least with regard to the women of the seventeenth century that their writings were but a charming accident of their more charming lives like the petals which the wind shakes from the rose in its bloom  and it is but a twin fact with this that in france alone woman has had a vital influence on the development of literature in france alone the mind of woman has passed like an electric current through the language making crisp and definite what is elsewhere heavy and blurred in france alone if the writings of women were swept away a serious gap would be made in the national history  patriotic gallantry may perhaps contend that english women could if they had liked have written as well as their neighbors but we will leave the consideration of that question to the reviewers of the literature that might have been  in the literature that actually is we must turn to france for the highest examples of womanly achievement in almost every department  we confess ourselves unacquainted with the productions of those awful women of italy who held professorial chairs and were great in civil and canon law we have made no researches into the catacombs of female literature but we think we may safely conclude that they would yield no rivals to that which is still unburied and here we suppose the question of preeminence can only lie between england and france and to this day madame de sévigné remains the single instance of a woman who is supreme in a class of literature which has engaged the ambition of men madame dacier still reigns the queen of blue stockings though women have long studied greek without shame 33 madame de staël’s name still rises first to the lips when we are asked to mention a woman of great intellectual power madame roland is still the unrivalled type of the sagacious and sternly heroic yet lovable woman george sand is the unapproached artist who to jean jacques’ eloquence and deep sense of external nature unites the clear delineation of character and the tragic depth of passion  these great names which mark different epochs soar like tall pines amidst a forest of less conspicuous but not less fascinating female writers and beneath these again are spread like a thicket of hawthorns eglantines and honeysuckles the women who are known rather by what they stimulated men to write than by what they wrote themselves—the women whose tact wit and personal radiance created the atmosphere of the salon where literature philosophy and science emancipated from the trammels of pedantry and technicality entered on a brighter stage of existence  what were the causes of this earlier development and more abundant manifestation of womanly intellect in france  the primary one perhaps lies in the physiological characteristics of the gallic race—the small brain and vivacious temperament which permit the fragile system of woman to sustain the superlative activity requisite for intellectual creativeness while on the other hand the larger brain and slower temperament of the english and germans are in the womanly organization generally dreamy and passive  the type of humanity in the latter may be grander but it requires a larger sum of conditions to produce a perfect specimen  throughout the animal world the higher the organization the more frequent is the departure from the normal form we do not often see imperfectly developed or illmade insects but we rarely see a perfectly developed wellmade man  and thus the physique of a woman may suffice as the substratum for a superior gallic mind but is too thin a soil for a superior teutonic one  our theory is borne out by the fact that among our own countrywomen those who distinguish themselves by literary production more frequently approach the gallic than the teutonic type they are intense and rapid rather than comprehensive  the woman of large capacity can seldom rise beyond the absorption of ideas her physical conditions refuse to support the energy required for spontaneous activity the voltaicpile is not strong enough to produce crystallizations phantasms of great ideas float through her mind but she has not the spell which will arrest them and give them fixity this more than unfavorable external circumstances is we think the reason why woman has not yet contributed any new form to art any discovery in science any deepsearching inquiry in philosophy  the necessary physiological conditions are not present in her  that under more favorable circumstances in the future these conditions may prove compatible with the feminine organization it would be rash to deny  for the present we are only concerned with our theory so far as it presents a physiological basis for the intellectual effectiveness of french women  a secondary cause was probably the laxity of opinion and practice with regard to the marriagetie  heaven forbid that we should enter on a defence of french morals most of all in relation to marriage  but it is undeniable that unions formed in the maturity of thought and feeling and grounded only on inherent fitness and mutual attraction tended to bring women into more intelligent sympathy with men and to heighten and complicate their share in the political drama  the quiescence and security of the conjugal relation are doubtless favorable to the manifestation of the highest qualities by persons who have already attained a high standard of culture but rarely foster a passion sufficient to rouse all the faculties to aid in winning or retaining its beloved object—to convert indolence into activity indifference into ardent partisanship dulness into perspicuity  gallantry and intrigue are sorry enough things in themselves but they certainly serve better to arouse the dormant faculties of woman than embroidery and domestic drudgery especially when as in the high society of france in the seventeenth century they are refined by the influence of spanish chivalry and controlled by the spirit of italian causticity  the dreamy and fantastic girl was awakened to reality by the experience of wifehood and maternity and became capable of loving not a mere phantom of her own imagination but a living man struggling with the hatreds and rivalries of the political arena she espoused his quarrels she made herself her fortune and her influence the steppingstones of his ambition and the languid beauty who had formerly seemed ready to “die of a rose” was seen to become the heroine of an insurrection  the vivid interest in affairs which was thus excited in woman must obviously have tended to quicken her intellect and give it a practical application and the very sorrows—the heartpangs and regrets which are inseparable from a life of passion—deepened her nature by the questioning of self and destiny which they occasioned and by the energy demanded to surmount them and live on  no wise person we imagine wishes to restore the social condition of france in the seventeenth century or considers the ideal programme of woman’s life to be a marriage de convenance at fifteen a career of gallantry from twenty to eightandthirty and penitence and piety for the rest of her days  nevertheless that social condition has its good results as much as the madly superstitious crusades had theirs  but the most indisputable source of feminine culture and development in france was the influence of the salons which as all the world knows were réunions of both sexes where conversation ran along the whole gamut of subjects from the frothiest vers de société to the philosophy of descartes  richelieu had set the fashion of uniting a taste for letters with the habits of polite society and the pursuits of ambition and in the first quarter of the seventeenth century there were already several hôtels in paris varying in social position from the closest proximity of the court to the debatable ground of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie which served as a rendezvous for different circles of people bent on entertaining themselves either by showing talent or admiring it  the most celebrated of these rendezvous was the hôtel de rambouillet which was at the culmination of its glory in 1630 and did not become quite extinct until 1648 when the troubles of the fronde commencing its habitués were dispersed or absorbed by political interests  the presiding genius of this salon the marquise de rambouillet was the very model of the woman who can act as anamalgam to the most incongruous elements beautiful but not preoccupied by coquetry or passion an enthusiastic admirer of talent but with no pretensions to talent on her own part exquisitely refined in language and manners but warm and generous withal not given to entertain her guests with her own compositions or to paralyze them by her universal knowledge  she had once meant to learn latin but had been prevented by an illness perhaps she was all the better acquainted with italian and spanish productions which in default of a national literature were then the intellectual pabulum of all cultivated persons in france who are unable to read the classics  in her mild agreeable presence was accomplished that blending of the hightoned chivalry of spain with the caustic wit and refined irony of italy which issued in the creation of a new standard of taste—the combination of the utmost exaltation in sentiment with the utmost simplicity of language  women are peculiarly fitted to further such a combination—first from their greater tendency to mingle affection and imagination with passion and thus subtilize it into sentiment and next from that dread of what overtaxes their intellectual energies either by difficulty or monotony which gives them an instinctive fondness for lightness of treatment and airiness of expression thus making them cut short all prolixity and reject all heaviness  when these womanly characteristics were brought into conversational contact with the materials furnished by such minds as those of richelieu corneille the great condé balzac and bossuet it is no wonder that the result was something piquant and charming  those famous habitués of the hôtel de rambouillet did not apparently first lay themselves out to entertain the ladies with grimacing “smalltalk” and then take each other by the swordknot to discuss matters of real interest in a corner they rather sought to present their best ideas in the guise most acceptable to intelligent and accomplished women  and the conversation was not of literature only war politics religion the lightest details of daily news—everything was admissible if only it were treated with refinement and intelligence  the hôtel de rambouillet was no mere literary réunion it included hommes d’affaires and soldiers as well as authors and in such a circle women would not become bas bleus or dreamy moralizers ignorant of the world and of human nature but intelligent observers of character and events  it is easy to understand however that with the herd of imitators who in paris and the provinces aped the style of this famous salon simplicity degenerated into affectation and nobility of sentiment was replaced by an inflated effort to outstrip nature so that the genre précieux drew down the satire which reached its climax in the précieuses ridicules and les femmes savantes the former of which appeared in 1660 and the latter in 1673  but madelon and caltros are the lineal descendants of mademoiselle scudery and her satellites quite as much as of the hôtel de rambouillet  the society which assembled every saturday in her salon was exclusively literary and although occasionally visited by a few persons of high birth bourgeois in its tone and enamored of madrigals sonnets stanzas and bouts rimés  the affectation that decks trivial things in fine language belongs essentially to a class which sees another above it and is uneasy in the sense of its inferiority and this affectation is precisely the opposite of the original genre précieux  another centre from which feminine influence radiated into the national literature was the palais du luxembourg where mademoiselle d’orleans in disgrace at court on account of her share in the fronde held a little court of her own and for want of anything else to employ her active spirit busied herself with literature  one fine morning it occurred to this princess to ask all the persons who frequented her court among whom were madame de sévigné madame de la fayette and la rochefoucauld to write their own portraits and she at once set the example  it was understood that defects and virtues were to be spoken of with like candor  the idea was carried out those who were not clever or bold enough to write for themselves employing the pen of a friend      “such” says m cousin “was the pastime of mademoiselle and her     friends during the years 1657 and 1658 from this pastime proceeded a     complete literature  in 1659 ségrais revised these portraits added     a considerable number in prose and even in verse and published the     whole in a handsome quarto volume admirably printed and now become     very rare under the title ‘divers portraits’  only thirty copies     were printed not for sale but to be given as presents by     mademoiselle  the work had a prodigious success  that which had     made the fortune of mademoiselle de scudéry’s romances—the pleasure     of seeing one’s portrait a little flattered curiosity to see that of     others the passion which the middle class always have had and will     have for knowing what goes on in the aristocratic world at that time     not very easy of access the names of the illustrious persons who     were here for the first time described physically and morally with     the utmost detail great ladies transformed all at once into writers     and unconsciously inventing a new manner of writing of which no book     gave the slightest idea and which was the ordinary manner of     speaking of the aristocracy this undefinable mixture of the natural     the easy and at the same time of the agreeable and supremely     distinguished—all this charmed the court and the town and very early     in the year 1659 permission was asked of mademoiselle to give a new     edition of the privileged book for the use of the public in general”  the fashion thus set portraits multiplied throughout france until in 1688 la bruyère adopted the form in his “characters” and ennobled it by divesting it of personality  we shall presently see that a still greater work than la bruyère’s also owed its suggestion to a woman whose salon was hardly a less fascinating resort than the hôtel de rambouillet itself  in proportion as the literature of a country is enriched and culture becomes more generally diffused personal influence is less effective in the formation of taste and in the furtherance of social advancement  it is no longer the coterie which acts on literature but literature which acts on the coterie the circle represented by the word public is ever widening and ambition poising itself in order to hit a more distant mark neglects the successes of the salon  what was once lavished prodigally in conversation is reserved for the volume or the “article” and the effort is not to betray originality rather than to communicate it  as the old coachroads have sunk into disuse through the creation of railways so journalism tends more and more to divert information from the channel of conversation into the channel of the press no one is satisfied with a more circumscribed audience than that very indeterminate abstraction “the public” and men find a vent for their opinions not in talk but in “copy”  we read the athenæum askance at the teatable and take notes from the philosophical journal at a soirée we invite our friends that we may thrust a book into their hands and presuppose an exclusive desire in the “ladies” to discuss their own matters “that we may crackle the times” at our ease  in fact the evident tendency of things to contract personal communication within the narrowest limits makes us tremble lest some further development of the electric telegraph should reduce us to a society of mutes or to a sort of insects communicating by ingenious antenna of our own invention  things were far from having reached this pass in the last century but even then literature and society had outgrown the nursing of coteries and although many salons of that period were worthy successors of the hôtel de rambouillet they were simply a recreation not an influence  enviable evenings no doubt were passed in them and if we could be carried back to any of them at will we should hardly know whether to choose the wednesday dinner at madame geoffrin’s with d’alembert mademoiselle de l’espinasse grimm and the rest or the graver society which thirty years later gathered round condorcet and his lovely young wife  the salon retained its attractions but its power was gone the stream of life had become too broad and deep for such small rills to affect it  a fair comparison between the french women of the seventeenth century and those of the eighteenth would perhaps have a balanced result though it is common to be a partisan on this subject  the former have more exaltation perhaps more nobility of sentiment and less consciousness in their intellectual activity—less of the femme auteur which was rousseau’s horror in madame d’epinay but the latter have a richer fund of ideas—not more ingenuity but the materials of an additional century for their ingenuity to work upon  the women of the seventeenth century when love was on the wane took to devotion at first mildly and by halves as english women take to caps and finally without compromise with the women of the eighteenth century bossuet and massillon had given way to voltaire and rousseau and when youth and beauty failed then they were thrown on their own moral strength  m cousin is especially enamored of the women of the seventeenth century and relieves himself from his labors in philosophy by making researches into the original documents which throw light upon their lives  last year he gave us some results of these researches in a volume on the youth of the duchess de longueville and he has just followed it up with a second volume in which he further illustrates her career by tracing it in connection with that of her friend madame de sablé  the materials to which he has had recourse for this purpose are chiefly two celebrated collections of manuscript that of conrart the first secretary to the french academy one of those universally curious people who seem made for the annoyance of contemporaries and the benefit of posterity and that of valant who was at once the physician the secretary and general steward of madame de sablé and who with or without her permission possessed himself of the letters addressed to her by her numerous correspondents during the latter part of her life and of various papers having some personal or literary interest attached to them  from these stores m cousin has selected many documents previously unedited and though he often leaves us something to desire in the arrangement of his materials this volume of his on madame de sablé is very acceptable to us for she interests us quite enough to carry us through more than three hundred pages of rather scattered narrative and through an appendix of correspondence in small type  m cousin justly appreciates her character as “un heureux mélange de raison d’esprit d’agrément et de bonté” and perhaps there are few better specimens of the woman who is extreme in nothing but sympathetic in all things who affects us by no special quality but by her entire being whose nature has no tons criards but is like those textures which from their harmonious blending of all colors give repose to the eye and do not weary us though we see them every day  madame de sablé is also a striking example of the one order of influence which woman has exercised over literature in france and on this ground as well as intrinsically she is worth studying  if the reader agrees with us he will perhaps be inclined as we are to dwell a little on the chief points in her life and character  madeline de souvré daughter of the marquis of courtenvaux a nobleman distinguished enough to be chosen as governor of louis xiii was born in 1599 on the threshold of that seventeenth century the brilliant genius of which is mildly reflected in her mind and history  thus when in 1635 her more celebrated friend mademoiselle de bourbon afterward the duchess de longueville made her appearance at the hôtel de rambouillet madame de sablé had nearly crossed that tableland of maturity which precedes a woman’s descent toward old age  she had been married in 1614 to philippe emanuel de lavalmontmorency seigneur de boisdauphin and marquis de sablé of whom nothing further is known than that he died in 1640 leaving her the richer by four children but with a fortune considerably embarrassed  with beauty and high rank added to the mental attractions of which we have abundant evidence we may well believe that madame de sablé’s youth was brilliant  for her beauty we have the testimony of sober madame de motteville who also speaks of her as having “beaucoup de lumière et de sincérité” and in the following passage very graphically indicates one phase of madame de sablé’s character      “the marquise de sablé was one of those whose beauty made the most     noise when the queen came into france  but if she was amiable she     was still more desirous of appearing so this lady’s selflove     rendered her too sensitive to the regard which men exhibited toward     her  there yet existed in france some remains of the politeness     which catherine de medici had introduced from italy and the new     dramas with all the other works in prose and verse which came from     madrid were thought to have such great delicacy that she madame de     sablé had conceived a high idea of the gallantry which the spaniards     had learned from the moors      “she was persuaded that men can without crime have tender     sentiments for women—that the desire of pleasing them led men to the     greatest and finest actions—roused their intelligence and inspired     them with liberality and all sorts of virtues but on the other     hand women who were the ornament of the world and made to be     served and adored ought not to admit anything from them but their     respectful attentions  as this lady supported her views with much     talent and great beauty she had given them authority in her time     and the number and consideration of those who continued to associate     with her have caused to subsist in our day what the spaniards call     finezas”  here is the grand element of the original femme précieuse and it appears farther in a detail also reported by madame de motteville that madame de sablé had a passionate admirer in the accomplished duc de montmorency and apparently reciprocated his regard but discovering at what period of their attachment is unknown that he was raising a lover’s eyes toward the queen she broke with him at once  “i have heard her say” tells madame de motteville “that her pride was such with regard to the duc de montmorency that at the first demonstrations which he gave of his change she refused to see him any more being unable to receive with satisfaction attentions which she had to share with the greatest princess in the world”  there is no evidence except the untrustworthy assertion of tallement de réaux that madame de sablé had any other liaison than this and the probability of the negative is increased by the ardor of her friendships  the strongest of these was formed early in life with mademoiselle dona d’attichy afterward comtesse de maure it survived the effervescence of youth and the closest intimacy of middle age and was only terminated by the death of the latter in 1663  a little incident in this friendship is so characteristic in the transcendentalism which was then carried into all the affections that it is worth relating at length  mademoiselle d’attichy in her grief and indignation at richelieu’s treatment of her relative quitted paris and was about to join her friend at sablé when she suddenly discovered that madame de sablé in a letter to madame de rambouillet had said that her greatest happiness would be to pass her life with julie de rambouillet afterward madame de montausier  to anne d’attichy this appears nothing less than the crime of lèseamitié  no explanations will appease her she refuses to accept the assurance that the offensive expression was used simply out of unreflecting conformity to the style of the hôtel de rambouillet—that it was mere “galimatias”  she gives up her journey and writes a letter which is the only one madame de sablé chose to preserve when in her period of devotion she sacrificed the records of her youth  here it is      “i have seen this letter in which you tell me there is so much     galimatias and i assure you that i have not found any at all  on     the contrary i find everything very plainly expressed and among     others one which is too explicit for my satisfaction—namely what     you have said to madame de rambouillet that if you tried to imagine     a perfectly happy life for yourself it would be to pass it all alone     with mademoiselle de rambouillet  you know whether any one can be     more persuaded than i am of her merit but i confess to you that that     has not prevented me from being surprised that you could entertain a     thought which did so great an injury to our friendship  as to     believing that you said this to one and wrote it to the other     simply for the sake of paying them an agreeable compliment i have     too high an esteem for your courage to be able to imagine that     complaisance would cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your     heart especially on a subject in which as they were unfavorable to     me i think you would have the more reason for concealing them the     affection which i have for you being so well known to every one and     especially to mademoiselle de rambouillet so that i doubt whether     she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you have done me     than of the advantage you have given her  the circumstance of this     letter falling into my hands has forcibly reminded me of these lines     of bertaut      “‘malheureuse est l’ignorance     et plus malheureux le savoir”      “having through this lost a confidence which alone rendered life     supportable to me it is impossible for me to take the journey so     much thought of  for would there be any propriety in travelling     sixty miles in this season in order to burden you with a person so     little suited to you that after years of a passion without parallel     you cannot help thinking that the greatest pleasure of your life     would be to pass it without her  i return then into my solitude     to examine the defects which cause me so much unhappiness and unless     i can correct them i should have less joy than confusion in seeing     you”  it speaks strongly for the charm of madame de sablé’s nature that she was able to retain so susceptible a friend as mademoiselle d’attichy in spite of numerous other friendships some of which especially that with madame de longueville were far from lukewarm—in spite too of a tendency in herself to distrust the affection of others toward her and to wait for advances rather than to make them  we find many traces of this tendency in the affectionate remonstrances addressed to her by madame de longueville now for shutting herself up from her friends now for doubting that her letters are acceptable  here is a little passage from one of these remonstrances which indicates a trait of madame de sablé and is in itself a bit of excellent sense worthy the consideration of lovers and friends in general “i am very much afraid that if i leave to you the care of letting me know when i can see you i shall be a long time without having that pleasure and that nothing will incline you to procure it me for i have always observed a certain lukewarmness in your friendship after our explanations from which i have never seen you thoroughly recover and that is why i dread explanations for however good they may be in themselves since they serve to reconcile people it must always be admitted to their shame that they are at least the effect of a bad cause and that if they remove it for a time they sometimes leave a certain facility in getting angry again which without diminishing friendship renders its intercourse less agreeable it seems to me that i find all this in your behavior to me so i am not wrong in sending to know if you wish to have me today”  it is clear that madame de sablé was far from having what saintebeuve calls the one fault of madame necker—absolute perfection  a certain exquisiteness in her physical and moral nature was as we shall see the source of more than one weakness but the perception of these weaknesses which is indicated in madame de longueville’s letters heightens our idea of the attractive qualities which notwithstanding drew from her at the sober age of forty such expressions as these “i assure you that you are the person in all the world whom it would be most agreeable to me to see and there is no one whose intercourse is a ground of truer satisfaction to me  it is admirable that at all times and amidst all changes the taste for your society remains in me and if one ought to thank god for the joys which do not tend to salvation i should thank him with all my heart for having preserved that to me at a time in which he has taken away from me all others”  since we have entered on the chapter of madame de sablé’s weaknesses this is the place to mention what was the subject of endless raillery from her friends—her elaborate precaution about her health and her dread of infection even from diseases the least communicable  perhaps this anxiety was founded as much on æsthetic as on physical grounds on disgust at the details of illness as much as on dread of suffering with a cold in the head or a bilious complaint the exquisite précieuse must have been considerably less conscious of being “the ornament of the world” and “made to be adored”  even her friendship strong as it was was not strong enough to overcome her horror of contagion for when mademoiselle de bourbon recently become madame de longueville was attacked by smallpox madame de sablé for some time had not courage to visit her or even to see mademoiselle de rambouillet who was assiduous in her attendance on the patient  a little correspondence à propos of these circumstances so well exhibits the graceful badinage in which the great ladies of that day were adepts that we are attempted to quote one short letter                “mlle de rambouillet to the marquise de sablé”      “mlle de chalais dame de compagnie to the marquise will please     to read this letter to mme la marquise out of a draught      “madame i do not think it possible to begin my treaty with you too     early for i am convinced that between the first proposition made to     me that i should see you and the conclusion you will have so many     reflections to make so many physicians to consult and so many fears     to surmount that i shall have full leisure to air myself  the     conditions which i offer to fulfil for this purpose are not to visit     you until i have been three days absent from the hôtel de condé     where mme de longueville was ill to choose a frosty day not to     approach you within four paces not to sit down on more than one     seat  you may also have a great fire in your room burn juniper in     the four corners surround yourself with imperial vinegar with rue     and wormwood  if you can feel yourself safe under these conditions     without my cutting off my hair i swear to you to execute them     religiously and if you want examples to fortify you i can tell you     that the queen consented to see m chaudebonne when he had come     directly from mme de bourbon’s room and that mme d’aiguillon who     has good taste in such matters and is free from reproach on these     points has just sent me word that if i did not go to see her she     would come to me”  madame de sablé betrays in her reply that she winces under this raillery and thus provokes a rather severe though polite rejoinder which added to the fact that madame de longueville is convalescent rouses her courage to the pitch of paying the formidable visit  mademoiselle de rambouillet made aware through their mutual friend voiture that her sarcasm has cut rather too deep winds up the matter by writing that very difficult production a perfectly conciliatory yet dignified apology peculiarities like this always deepen with age and accordingly fifteen years later we find madame d’orleans in her “princesse de paphlagonia”—a romance in which she describes her court with the little quarrels and other affairs that agitated it—giving the following amusing picture or rather caricature of the extent to which madame de sablé carried her pathological mania which seems to have been shared by her friend the countess de maure mademoiselle d’attichy  in the romance these two ladies appear under the names of princesse parthénie and the reine de mionie      “there was not an hour in the day in which they did not confer     together on the means of avoiding death and on the art of rendering     themselves immortal  their conferences did not take place like those     of other people the fear of breathing an air which was too cold or     top warm the dread lest the wind should be too dry or too moist—in     short the imagination that the weather might not be as temperate as     they thought necessary for the preservation of their health caused     them to write letters from one room to the other  it would be     extremely fortunate if these notes could be found and formed into a     collection  i am convinced that they would contain rules for the     regimen of life precautions even as to the proper time for applying     remedies and also remedies which hippocrates and galen with all     their science never heard of  such a collection would be very     useful to the public and would be highly profitable to the faculties     of paris and montpellier  if these letters were discovered great     advantages of all kinds might be derived from them for they were     princesses who had nothing mortal about them but the knowledge that     they were mortal  in their writings might be learned all politeness     in style and the most delicate manner of speaking on all subjects     there is nothing with which they were not acquainted they knew the     affairs of all the states in the world through the share they had in     all the intrigues of its private members either in matters of     gallantry as in other things on which their advice was necessary     either to adjust embroilments and quarrels or to excite them for     the sake of the advantages which their friends could derive from     them—in a word they were persons through whose hands the secrets of     the whole world had to pass  the princess parthénie mme de sablé     had a palate as delicate as her mind nothing could equal the     magnificence of the entertainments she gave all the dishes were     exquisite and her cleanliness was beyond all that could be imagined     it was in their time that writing came into use previously nothing     was written but marriage contracts and letters were never heard of     thus it is to them that we owe a practice so convenient in     intercourse”  still later in 1669 when the most uncompromising of the port royalists seemed to tax madame de sablé with lukewarmness that she did not join them at portroyaldeschamps we find her writing to the stern m de sévigny “en vérité je crois que je ne pourrois mieux faire que de tout quitter et de m’en aller là  mais que deviendroient ces frayeurs de n’avoir pas de médicines à choisir ni de chirurgien pour me saigner”  mademoiselle as we have seen hints at the love of delicate eating which many of madame de sablé’s friends numbered among her foibles especially after her religious career had commenced  she had a genius in friandise and knew how to gratify the palate without offending the highest sense of refinement  her sympathetic nature showed itself in this as in other things she was always sending bonnes bouches to her friends and trying to communicate to them her science and taste in the affairs of the table  madame de longueville who had not the luxurious tendencies of her friend writes “je vous demande au nom de dieu que vous ne me prépariez aucun ragoût  surtout ne me donnez point de festin au nom de dieu qu’il n’y ait rien que ce qu’on peut manger car vous savez que c’est inutile pour moi de plus j’en ai scrupule”  but other friends had more appreciation of her niceties  voiture thanks her for her melons and assures her that they are better than those of yesterday madame de choisy hopes that her ridicule of jansenism will not provoke madame de sablé to refuse her the receipt for salad and la rochefoucauld writes “you cannot do me a greater charity than to permit the bearer of this letter to enter into the mysteries of your marmalade and your genuine preserves and i humbly entreat you to do everything you can in his favor  if i could hope for two dishes of those preserves which i did not deserve to eat before i should be indebted to you all my life” for our own part being as far as possible from fraternizing with those spiritual people who convert a deficiency into a principle and pique themselves on an obtuse palate as a point of superiority we are not inclined to number madame de sablé’s friandise among her defects  m cousin too is apologetic on this point  he says      “it was only the excess of a delicacy which can be really understood     and a sort of fidelity to the character of précieuse  as the     précieuse did nothing according to common usage she could not dine     like another  we have cited a passage from mme de motteville where     mme de sablé is represented in her first youth at the hôtel de     rambouillet maintaining that woman is born to be an ornament to the     world and to receive the adoration of men  the woman worthy of the     name ought always to appear above material wants and retain even in     the most vulgar details of life something distinguished and     purified  eating is a very necessary operation but one which is not     agreeable to the eye  mme de sablé insisted on its being conducted     with a peculiar cleanliness  according to her it was not every woman     who could with impunity be at table in the presence of a lover the     first distortion of the face she said would be enough to spoil all     gross meals made for the body merely ought to be abandoned to     bourgeoises and the refined woman should appear to take a little     nourishment merely to sustain her and even to divert her as one     takes refreshments and ices  wealth did not suffice for this a     particular talent was required  mme de sablé was a mistress in this     art  she had transported the aristocratic spirit and the genre     précieux good breeding and good taste even into cookery  her     dinners without any opulence were celebrated and sought after”  it is quite in accordance with all this that madame de sablé should delight in fine scents and we find that she did for being threatened in her port royal days when she was at an advanced age with the loss of smell and writing for sympathy and information to mère agnès who had lost that sense early in life she receives this admonition from the stern saint “you would gain by this loss my very dear sister if you made use of it as a satisfaction to god for having had too much pleasure in delicious scents”  scarron describes her as      “la non pareille boisdauphine     entre dames perle très fine”  and the superlative delicacy implied by this epithet seems to have belonged equally to her personal habits her affections and her intellect  madame de sablé’s life for anything we know flowed on evenly enough until 1640 when the death of her husband threw upon her the care of an embarrassed fortune  she found a friend in réné de longueil seigneur de maisons of whom we are content to know no more than that he helped madame de sablé to arrange her affairs though only by means of alienating from her family the estate of sablé that his house was her refuge during the blockade of paris in 1649 and that she was not unmindful of her obligations to him when subsequently her credit could be serviceable to him at court  in the midst of these pecuniary troubles came a more terrible trial—the loss of her favorite son the brave and handsome guy de laval who after a brilliant career in the campaigns of condé was killed at the siege of dunkirk in 1646 when scarcely fourandtwenty  the fine qualities of this young man had endeared him to the whole army and especially to condé had won him the hand of the chancellor séguire’s daughter and had thus opened to him the prospect of the highest honors  his loss seems to have been the most real sorrow of madame de sablé’s life  soon after followed the commotions of the fronde which put a stop to social intercourse and threw the closest friends into opposite ranks  according to lenet who relies on the authority of gourville madame de sablé was under strong obligations to the court being in the receipt of a pension of 2000 crowns at all events she adhered throughout to the queen and mazarin but being as far as possible from a fierce partisan and given both by disposition and judgment to hear both sides of the question she acted as a conciliator and retained her friends of both parties  the countess de maure whose husband was the most obstinate of frondeurs remained throughout her most cherished friend and she kept up a constant correspondence with the lovely and intrepid heroine of the fronde madame de longueville  her activity was directed to the extinction of animosities by bringing about marriages between the montagues and capulets of the fronde—between the prince de condé or his brother and the niece of mazarin or between the three nieces of mazarin and the sons of three noblemen who were distinguished leaders of the fronde  though her projects were not realized her conciliatory position enabled her to preserve all her friendships intact and when the political tempest was over she could assemble around her in her residence in the place royal the same society as before  madame de sablé was now approaching her twelfth lustrum and though the charms of her mind and character made her more sought after than most younger women it is not surprising that sharing as she did in the religious ideas of her time the concerns of “salvation” seemed to become pressing  a religious retirement which did not exclude the reception of literary friends or the care for personal comforts made the most becoming frame for age and diminished fortune jansenism was then to ordinary catholicism what puseyism is to ordinary church of englandism in these days—it was a récherché form of piety unshared by the vulgar and one sees at once that it must have special attractions for the précieuse  madame de sablé then probably about 1655 or ’56 determined to retire to port royal not because she was already devout but because she hoped to become so as however she wished to retain the pleasure of intercourse with friends who were still worldly she built for herself a set of apartments at once distinct from the monastery and attached to it  here with a comfortable establishment consisting of her secretary dr valant mademoiselle de chalais formerly her dame de compagnie and now become her friend an excellent cook a few other servants and for a considerable time a carriage and coachman with her best friends within a moderate distance she could as m cousin says be out of the noise of the world without altogether forsaking it preserve her dearest friendships and have before her eyes edifying examples—“vaquer enfin à son aise aux soins de son salut et à ceux de sa santé”  we have hitherto looked only at one phase of madame de sablé’s character and influence—that of the précieuse  but she was much more than this she was the valuable trusted friend of noble women and distinguished men she was the animating spirit of a society whence issued a new form of french literature she was the woman of large capacity and large heart whom pascal sought to please to whom arnauld submitted the discourse prefixed to his “logic” and to whom la rochefoucauld writes “vous savez que je ne crois que vous êtes sur de certains chapitres et surtout sur les replis da cœur”  the papers preserved by her secretary valant show that she maintained an extensive correspondence with persons of various rank and character that her pen was untiring in the interest of others that men made her the depositary of their thoughts women of their sorrows that her friends were as impatient when she secluded herself as if they had been rival lovers and she a youthful beauty  it is into her ear that madame de longueville pours her troubles and difficulties and that madame de la fayette communicates her little alarms lest young count de st paul should have detected her intimacy with la rochefoucauld 53  the few of madame de sablé’s letters which survive show that she excelled in that epistolary style which was the specialty of the hôtel de rambouillet one to madame de montausier in favor of m périer the brotherinlaw of pascal is a happy mixture of good taste and good sense but among them all we prefer quoting one to the duchess de la tremouille  it is light and pretty and made out of almost nothing like soap bubbles      “je croix qu’il n’y a que moi qui face si bien tout le contraire de     ce que je veux faire car il est vrai qu’il n’y a personne que     j’honore plus que vous et j’ai si bien fait qu’il est quasi     impossible que vous le puissiez croire  ce n’estoit pas assez pour     vous persuader que je suis indigne de vos bonnes grâces et de votre     souvenir que d’avoir manqué fort longtemps à vous écrire il falloit     encore retarder quinze jours à me donner l’honneur de répondre à     votre lettre  en vérité madame cela me fait parôitre si coupable     que vers tout autre que vous j’aimeroix mieux l’être en effet que     d’entreprendre une chose si difficile qu’ est celle de me justifier     mais je me sens si innocente dans mon âme et j’ai tant d’estime de     respect et d’affection pour vous qu’il me semble que vous devez le     connôitre à cent lieues de distance d’ici encore que je ne vous dise     pas un mot  c’est ce que me donne le courage de vous écrire à cette     heure mais non pas ce qui m’en a empêché si longtemps  j’ai     commencé a faillir par force ayant eu beaucoup de maux et depuis     je l’ai faite par honte et je vous avoue que si je n’avois à cette     heure la confiance que vous m’avez donnée en me rassurant et celle     que je tire de mes propres sentimens pour vous je n’oserois jamais     entreprendre de vous faire souvenir de moi mais je m’assure que vous     oublierez tout sur la protestation que je vous fais de ne me laisser     plus endurcir en mes fautes et de demeurer inviolablement madame     votre etc”  was not the woman who could unite the ease and grace indicated by this letter with an intellect that men thought worth consulting on matters of reasoning and philosophy with warm affections untiring activity for others no ambition as an authoress and an insight into confitures and ragoûts a rare combination  no wonder that her salon at port royal was the favorite resort of such women as madame de la fayette madame de montausier madame de longueville and madame de hautefort and of such men as pascal la rochefoucauld nicole and domat  the collections of valant contain papers which show what were the habitual subjects of conversation in this salon  theology of course was a chief topic but physics and metaphysics had their turn and still more frequently morals taken in their widest sense  there were “conferences on calvinism” of which an abstract is preserved  when rohault invented his glass tubes to serve for the barometrical experiments in which pascal had roused a strong interest the marquis de sourdis entertained the society with a paper entitled “why water mounts in a glass tube”  cartesianism was an exciting topic here as well as everywhere else in france it had its partisans and opponents and papers were read containing “thoughts on the opinions of m descartes”  these lofty matters were varied by discussions on love and friendship on the drama and on most of the things in heaven and earth which the philosophy of that day dreamt of morals—generalizations on human affections sentiments and conduct—seem to have been the favorite theme and the aim was to reduce these generalizations to their briefest form of expression to give them the epigrammatic turn which made them portable in the memory  this was the specialty of madame de sablé’s circle and was probably due to her own tendency  as the hôtel de rambouillet was the nursery of graceful letterwriting and the luxembourg of “portraits” and “characters” so madame de sablé’s salon fostered that taste for the sententious style to which we owe probably some of the best pensées of pascal and certainly the “maxims” of la rochefoucauld  madame de sablé herself wrote maxims which were circulated among her friends and after her death were published by the abbé d’ailly  they have the excellent sense and nobility of feeling which we should expect in everything of hers but they have no stamp of genius or individual character they are to the “maxims” of la rochefoucauld what the vase moulded in dull heavy clay is to the vase which the action of fire has made light brittle and transparent  she also wrote a treatise on education which is much praised by la rochefoucauld and m d’andilly but which seems no longer to be found probably it was not much more elaborate than her socalled “treatise on friendship” which is but a short string of maxims  madame de sablé’s forte was evidently not to write herself but to stimulate others to write to show that sympathy and appreciation which are as genial and encouraging as the morning sunbeams  she seconded a man’s wit with understanding—one of the best offices which womanly intellect has rendered to the advancement of culture and the absence of originality made her all the more receptive toward the originality of others  the manuscripts of pascal show that many of the pensées which are commonly supposed to be raw materials for a great work on religion were remodelled again and again in order to bring them to the highest degree of terseness and finish which would hardly have been the case if they had only been part of a quarry for a greater production  thoughts which are merely collected as materials as stones out of which a building is to be erected are not cut into facets and polished like amethysts or emeralds  since pascal was from the first in the habit of visiting madame de sablé at port royal with his sister madame périer who was one of madame de sablé’s dearest friends we may well suppose that he would throw some of his jewels among the large and small coin of maxims which were a sort of subscription money there  many of them have an epigrammatical piquancy which was just the thing to charm a circle of vivacious and intelligent women they seem to come from a la rochefoucauld who has been dipped over again in philosophy and wit and received a new layer  but whether or not madame de sablé’s influence served to enrich the pensées of pascal it is clear that but for her influence the “maxims” of la rochefoucauld would never have existed just as in some circles the effort is who shall make the best puns horibile dictu or the best charades in the salon of port royal the amusement was to fabricate maxims  la rochefoucauld said “l’envie de faire des maximes se gagne comme la rhume”  so far from claiming for himself the initiation of this form of writing he accuses jacques esprit another habitué of madame de sablé’s salon of having excited in him the taste for maxims in order to trouble his repose  the said esprit was an academician and had been a frequenter of the hôtel de rambouillet  he had already published “maxims in verse” and he subsequently produced a book called “la faussete des vertus humaines” which seems to consist of rochefoucauldism become flat with an infusion of sour calvinism  nevertheless la rochefoucauld seems to have prized him to have appealed to his judgment and to have concocted maxims with him which he afterward begs him to submit to madame sablé  he sends a little batch of maxims to her himself and asks for an equivalent in the shape of good eatables “voilà tout ce que j’ai de maximes mais comme je ne donne rien pour rien je vous demande un potage aux carottes un ragoût de mouton” etc  the taste and the talent enhanced each other until at last la rochefoucauld began to be conscious of his preeminence in the circle of maximmongers and thought of a wider audience  thus grew up the famous “maxims” about which little need be said  every at once is now convinced or professes to be convinced that as to form they are perfect and that as to matter they are at once undeniably true and miserably false true as applied to that condition of human nature in which the selfish instincts are still dominant false if taken as a representation of all the elements and possibilities of human nature  we think la rochefoucauld himself wavered as to their universality and that this wavering is indicated in the qualified form of some of the maxims it occasionally struck him that the shadow of virtue must have a substance but he had never grasped that substance—it had never been present to his consciousness  it is curious to see la rochefoucauld’s nervous anxiety about presenting himself before the public as an author far from rushing into print he stole into it and felt his way by asking private opinions  through madame de sablé he sent manuscript copies to various persons of taste and talent both men and women and many of the written opinions which he received in reply are still in existence  the women generally find the maxims distasteful but the men write approvingly  these men however are for the most part ecclesiastics who decry human nature that they may exalt divine grace  the coincidence between augustinianism or calvinism with its doctrine of human corruption and the hard cynicism of the maxims presents itself in quite a piquant form in some of the laudatory opinions on la rochefoucauld  one writer says “on ne pourroit faire une instruction plus propre à un catechumène pour convertir à dieu son esprit et sa volonté    quand il n’y auroit que cet escrit au monde et l’evangile je voudrois etre chretien  l’un m’apprendroit à connoistre mes misères et l’autre à implorer mon libérateur”  madame de maintenon tends word to la rochefoucauld after the publication of his work that the “book of job” and the “maxims” are her only reading  that madame de sablé herself had a tolerably just idea of la rochefoucauld’s character as well as of his maxims may be gathered not only from the fact that her own maxims are as full of the confidence in human goodness which la rochefoucauld wants as they are empty of the style which he possesses but also from a letter in which she replies to the criticisms of madame de schomberg  “the author” she says “derived the maxim on indolence from his own disposition for never was there so great an indolence as his and i think that his heart inert as it is owes this defect as much to his idleness as his will  it has never permitted him to do the least action for others and i think that amid all his great desires and great hopes he is sometimes indolent even on his own behalf”  still she must have felt a hearty interest in the “maxims” as in some degree her fosterchild and she must also have had considerable affection for the author who was lovable enough to those who observed the rule of helvetius and expected nothing from him  she not only assisted him as we have seen in getting criticisms and carrying out the improvements suggested by them but when the book was actually published she prepared a notice of it for the only journal then existing—the journal des savants  this notice was originally a brief statement of the nature of the work and the opinions which had been formed for and against it with a moderate eulogy in conclusion on its good sense wit and insight into human nature  but when she submitted it to la rochefoucauld he objected to the paragraph which stated the adverse opinion and requested her to alter it  she however was either unable or unwilling to modify her notice and returned it with the following note      “je vous envoie ce que j’ai pu tirer de ma teste pour mettre dans le     journal des savants  j’y ai mis cet endroit qui vous est le plus     sensible afin que cela vous fasse surmonter la mauvaise honte qui     vous fit mettre la préface sans y rien retrancher et je n’ai pas     craint dele mettre parce que je suis assurée que vous ne le ferez     pas imprimer quand même le reste vous plairoit  je vous assure     aussi que je vous serai pins obligée si vous en usez comme d’une     chose qui servit à vous pour le corriger on pour le jeter au feu     nous autres grands auteurs nous sommes trop riches pour craindre de     rien perdre de nos productions  mandezmoi ce qu’il vous semble de     ce dictum”  la rochefoucauld availed himself of this permission and “edited” the notice touching up the style and leaving out the blame  in this revised form it appeared in the journal des savants  in some points we see the youth of journalism was not without promise of its future  while madame de sablé was thus playing the literary confidante to la rochefoucauld and was the soul of a society whose chief interest was the belleslettres she was equally active in graver matters  she was in constant intercourse or correspondence with the devout women of port royal and of the neighboring convent of the carmelites many of whom had once been the ornaments of the court and there is a proof that she was conscious of being highly valued by them in the fact that when the princess mariemadeline of the carmelites was dangerously ill not being able or not daring to visit her she sent her youthful portrait to be hung up in the sickroom and received from the same mère agnès whose grave admonition we have quoted above a charming note describing the pleasure which the picture had given in the infirmary of “notre bonne mère”  she was interesting herself deeply in the translation of the new testament which was the work of sacy arnauld nicole le maître and the duc de luynes conjointly sacy having the principal share  we have mentioned that arnauld asked her opinion on the “discourse” prefixed to his “logic” and we may conclude from this that he had found her judgment valuable in many other cases  moreover the persecution of the port royalists had commenced and she was uniting with madame de longueville in aiding and protecting her pious friends  moderate in her jansenism as in everything else she held that the famous formulary denouncing the augustinian doctrine and declaring it to have been originated by jansenius should be signed without reserve and as usual she had faith in conciliatory measures but her moderation was no excuse for inaction she was at one time herself threatened with the necessity of abandoning her residence at port royal and had thought of retiring to a religions house at auteuil a village near paris  she did in fact pass some summers there and she sometimes took refuge with her brother the commandeur de souvré with madame de montausier or madame de longueville  the last was much bolder in her partisanship than her friend and her superior wealth and position enabled her to give the port royalists more efficient aid  arnauld and nicole resided five years in her house it was under her protection that the translation of the new testament was carried on and completed and it was chiefly through her efforts that in 1669 the persecution was brought to an end  madame de sablé cooperated with all her talent and interest in the same direction but here as elsewhere her influence was chiefly valuable in what she stimulated others to do rather than in what she did herself  it was by her that madame de longueville was first won to the cause of port royal and we find this ardent brave woman constantly seeking the advice and sympathy of her more timid and selfindulgent but sincere and judicious friend  in 1669 when madame de sablé had at length rest from these anxieties she was at the good old age of seventy but she lived nine years longer—years we may suppose chiefly dedicated to her spiritual concerns  this gradual calm decay allayed the fear of death which had tormented her more vigorous days and she died with tranquillity and trust  it is a beautiful trait of these last moments that she desired not to be buried with her family or even at port royal among her saintly and noble companions—but in the cemetery of her parish like one of the people without pomp or ceremony  it is worth while to notice that with madame de sablé as with some other remarkable french women the part of her life which is richest in interest and results is that which is looked forward to by most of her sex with melancholy as the period of decline  when between fifty and sixty she had philosophers wits beauties and saints clustering around her and one naturally cares to know what was the elixir which gave her this enduring and general attraction  we think it was in a great degree that wellbalanced development of mental powers which gave her a comprehension of varied intellectual processes and a tolerance for varied forms of character which is still rarer in women than in men here was one point of distinction between her and madame de longueville and an amusing passage which saintebeuve has disinterred from the writings of the abbé st pierre so well serves to indicate by contrast what we regard as the great charm of madame de sablé’s mind that we shall not be wandering from our subject in quoting it      “i one day asked m nicole what was the character of mme de     longueville’s intellect he told me it was very subtle and delicate     in the penetration of character but very small very feeble and     that her comprehension was extremely narrow in matters of science and     reasoning and on all speculations that did not concern matters of     sentiment  for example he added i one day said to her that i could     wager and demonstrate that there were in paris at least two     inhabitants who had the same number of hairs although i could not     point out who these two men were  she told me i could never be sure     of it until i had counted the hairs of these two men  here is my     demonstration i said i take it for granted that the head which is     most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200000 and the     head which is least so has but one hair  now if you suppose that     200000 heads have each a different number of hairs it necessarily     follows that they have each one of the numbers of hairs which form     the series from one to 200000 for if it were supposed that there     were two among these 200000 who had the same number of hairs i     should have gained my wager  supposing then that these 200000     inhabitants have all a different number of hairs if i add a single     inhabitant who has hairs and who has not more than 200000 it     necessarily follows that this number of hairs whatever it may be     will be contained in the series from one to 200000 and consequently     will be equal to the number of hairs on one of the previous 200000     inhabitants  now as instead of one inhabitant more than 200000     there an nearly 800000 inhabitants in paris you see clearly that     there must be many heads which have an equal number of hairs though     i have not counted them  still mme de longueville could never     comprehend that this equality of hairs could be demonstrated and     always maintained that the only way of proving it was to count them”  surely the meet ardent admirer of feminine shallowness must have felt some irritation when he found himself arrested by this dead wall of stupidity and have turned with relief to the larger intelligence of madame de sablé who was not the less graceful delicate and feminine because she could follow a train of reasoning or interest herself in a question of science  in this combination consisted her preeminent charm she was not a genius not a heroine but a woman whom men could more than love—whom they could make their friend confidante and counsellor the sharer not of their joys and sorrows only but of their ideas and aims  such was madame de sablé whose name is perhaps new to some of our readers so far does it lie from the surface of literature and history we have seen too that she was only one among a crowd—one in a firmament of feminine stars which when once the biographical telescope is turned upon them appear scarcely less remarkable and interesting  now if the reader recollects what was the position and average intellectual character of women in the high society of england during the reigns of james the first and the two charleses—the period through which madame de sablé’s career extends—we think he will admit our position as to the early superiority of womanly development in france and this fact with its causes has not merely an historical interest it has an important bearing on the culture of women in the present day  women become superior in france by being admitted to a common fund of ideas to common objects of interest with men and this must ever be the essential condition at once of true womanly culture and of true social wellbeing we have no faith in feminine conversazioni where ladies are eloquent on apollo and mars though we sympathize with the yearning activity of faculties which deprived of their proper material waste themselves in weaving fabrics out of cobwebs  let the whole field of reality be laid open to woman as well as to man and then that which is peculiar in her mental modification instead of being as it is now a source of discord and repulsion between the sexes will be found to be a necessary complement to the truth and beauty of life  then we shall have that marriage of minds which alone can blend all the hues of thought and feeling in one lovely rainbow of promise for the harvest of human happiness    iii  evangelical teaching dr cumming 64   given a man with moderate intellect a moral standard not higher than the average some rhetorical affluence and great glibness of speech what is the career in which without the aid of birth or money he may most easily attain power and reputation in english society  where is that goshen of mediocrity in which a smattering of science and learning will pass for profound instruction where platitudes will be accepted as wisdom bigoted narrowness as holy zeal unctuous egoism as godgiven piety  let such a man become an evangelical preacher he will then find it possible to reconcile small ability with great ambition superficial knowledge with the prestige of erudition a middling morale with a high reputation for sanctity  let him shun practical extremes and be ultra only in what is purely theoretic let him be stringent on predestination but latitudinarian on fasting unflinching in insisting on the eternity of punishment but diffident of curtailing the substantial comforts of time ardent and imaginative on the promillennial advent of christ but cold and cautious toward every other infringement of the status quo let him fish for souls not with the bait of inconvenient singularity but with the dragnet of comfortable conformity  let him be hard and literal in his interpretation only when he wants to hurl texts at the heads of unbelievers and adversaries but when the letter of the scriptures presses too closely on the genteel christianity of the nineteenth century let him use his spiritualizing alembic and disperse it into impalpable ether  let him preach less of christ than of antichrist let him be less definite in showing what sin is than in showing who is the man of sin less expansive on the blessedness of faith than on the accursedness of infidelity  above all let him set up as an interpreter of prophecy and rival moore’s almanack in the prediction of political events tickling the interest of hearers who are but moderately spiritual by showing how the holy spirit has dictated problems and charades for their benefit and how if they are ingenious enough to solve these they may have their christian graces nourished by learning precisely to whom they may point as the “horn that had eyes” “the lying prophet” and the “unclean spirits”  in this way he will draw men to him by the strong cords of their passions made reasonproof by being baptized with the name of piety  in this way he may gain a metropolitan pulpit the avenues to his church will be as crowded as the passages to the opera he has but to print his prophetic sermons and bind them in lilac and gold and they will adorn the drawingroom table of all evangelical ladies who will regard as a sort of pious “light reading” the demonstration that the prophecy of the locusts whose sting is in their tail is fulfilled in the fact of the turkish commander’s having taken a horse’s tail for his standard and that the french are the very frogs predicted in the revelations  pleasant to the clerical flesh under such circumstances is the arrival of sunday  somewhat at a disadvantage during the week in the presence of workingday interests and lay splendors on sunday the preacher becomes the cynosure of a thousand eyes and predominates at once over the amphitryon with whom he dines and the most captious member of his church or vestry  he has an immense advantage over all other public speakers the platform orator is subject to the criticism of hisses and groans counsel for the plaintiff expects the retort of counsel for the defendant  the honorable gentleman on one side of the house is liable to have his facts and figures shown up by his honorable friend on the opposite side  even the scientific or literary lecturer if he is dull or incompetent may see the best part of his audience quietly slip out one by one  but the preacher is completely master of the situation no one may hiss no one may depart  like the writer of imaginary conversations he may put what imbecilities he pleases into the mouths of his antagonists and swell with triumph when he has refuted them  he may riot in gratuitous assertions confident that no man will contradict him he may exercise perfect freewill in logic and invent illustrative experience he may give an evangelical edition of history with the inconvenient facts omitted—all this he may do with impunity certain that those of his hearers who are not sympathizing are not listening for the press has no band of critics who go the round of the churches and chapels and are on the watch for a slip or defect in the preacher to make a “feature” in their article the clergy are practically the most irresponsible of all talkers  for this reason at least it is well that they do not always allow their discourses to be merely fugitive but are often induced to fix them in that black and white in which they are open to the criticism of any man who has the courage and patience to treat them with thorough freedom of speech and pen  it is because we think this criticism of clerical teaching desirable for the public good that we devote some pages to dr cumming  he is as every one knows a preacher of immense popularity and of the numerous publications in which he perpetuates his pulpit labors all circulate widely and some according to their titlepage have reached the sixteenth thousand  now our opinion of these publications is the very opposite of that given by a newspaper eulogist we do not “believe that the repeated issues of dr cumming’s thoughts are having a beneficial effect on society” but the reverse and hence little inclined as we are to dwell on his pages we think it worth while to do so for the sake of pointing out in them what we believe to be profoundly mistaken and pernicious  of dr cumming personally we know absolutely nothing our acquaintance with him is confined to a perusal of his works our judgment of him is founded solely on the manner in which he has written himself down on his pages  we know neither how he looks nor how he lives  we are ignorant whether like st paul he has a bodily presence that is weak and contemptible or whether his person is as florid and as prone to amplification as his style  for aught we know he may not only have the gift of prophecy but may bestow the profits of all his works to feed the poor and be ready to give his own body to be burned with as much alacrity as he infers the everlasting burning of roman catholics and puseyites  out of the pulpit he may be a model of justice truthfulness and the love that thinketh no evil but we are obliged to judge of his charity by the spirit we find in his sermons and shall only be glad to learn that his practice is in many respects an amiable non sequitur from his teaching  dr cumming’s mind is evidently not of the pietistic order  there is not the slightest leaning toward mysticism in his christianity—no indication of religious raptures of delight in god of spiritual communion with the father  he is most at home in the forensic view of justification and dwells on salvation as a scheme rather than as an experience  he insists on good works as the sign of justifying faith as labors to be achieved to the glory of god but he rarely represents them as the spontaneous necessary outflow of a soul filled with divine love  he is at home in the external the polemical the historical the circumstantial and is only episodically devout and practical  the great majority of his published sermons are occupied with argument or philippic against romanists and unbelievers with “vindications” of the bible with the political interpretation of prophecy or the criticism of public events and the devout aspiration or the spiritual and practical exhortation is tacked to them as a sort of fringe in a hurried sentence or two at the end  he revels in the demonstration that the pope is the man of sin he is copious on the downfall of the ottoman empire he appears to glow with satisfaction in turning a story which tends to show how he abashed an “infidel” it is a favorite exercise with him to form conjectures of the process by which the earth is to be burned up and to picture dr chalmers and mr wilberforce being caught up to meet christ in the air while romanists puseyites and infidels are given over to gnashing of teeth  but of really spiritual joys and sorrows of the life and death of christ as a manifestation of love that constrains the soul of sympathy with that yearning over the lost and erring which made jesus weep over jerusalem and prompted the sublime prayer “father forgive them” of the gentler fruits of the spirit and the peace of god which passeth understanding—of all this we find little trace in dr cumming’s discourses  his style is in perfect correspondence with this habit of mind  though diffuse as that of all preachers must be it has rapidity of movement perfect clearness and some aptness of illustration  he has much of that literary talent which makes a good journalist—the power of beating out an idea over a large space and of introducing farfetched à propos  his writings have indeed no high merit they have no originality or force of thought no striking felicity of presentation no depth of emotion throughout nine volumes we have alighted on no passage which impressed us as worth extracting and placing among the “beauties” of evangelical writers such as robert hall foster the essayist or isaac taylor everywhere there is commonplace cleverness nowhere a spark of rare thought of lofty sentiment or pathetic tenderness  we feel ourselves in company with a voluble retail talker whose language is exuberant but not exact and to whom we should never think of referring for precise information or for welldigested thought and experience  his argument continually slides into wholesale assertion and vague declamation and in his love of ornament he frequently becomes tawdry  for example he tells us “apoc sketches” p 265 that “botany weaves around the cross her amaranthine garlands and newton comes from his starry home—linnæus from his flowery restingplace—and werner and hutton from their subterranean graves at the voice of chalmers to acknowledge that all they learned and elicited in their respective provinces has only served to show more clearly that jesus of nazareth is enthroned on the riches of the universe”—and so prosaic an injunction to his hearers as that they should choose a residence within an easy distance of church is magnificently draped by him as an exportation to prefer a house “that basks in the sunshine of the countenance of god”  like all preachers of his class he is more fertile in imaginative paraphrase than in close exposition and in this way he gives us some remarkable fragments of what we may call the romance of scripture filling up the outline of the record with an elaborate coloring quite undreamed of by more literal minds  the serpent he informs us said to eve “can it be so  surely you are mistaken that god hath said you shall die a creature so fair so lovely so beautiful  it is impossible  the laws of nature and physical science tell you that my interpretation is correct you shall not die  i can tell you by my own experience as an angel that you shall be as gods knowing good and evil”  “apoc sketches” p 294  again according to dr cumming abel had so clear an idea of the incarnation and atonement that when he offered his sacrifice “he must have said ‘i feel myself a guilty sinner and that in myself i cannot meet thee alive i lay on thine altar this victim and i shed its blood as my testimony that mine should be shed and i look for forgiveness and undeserved mercy through him who is to bruise the serpent’s head and whose atonement this typifies’”  “occas disc” vol i p 23  indeed his productions are essentially ephemeral he is essentially a journalist who writes sermons instead of leading articles who instead of venting diatribes against her majesty’s ministers directs his power of invective against cardinal wiseman and the puseyites instead of declaiming on public spirit perorates on the “glory of god”  we fancy he is called in the more refined evangelical circles an “intellectual preacher” by the plainer sort of christians a “flowery preacher” and we are inclined to think that the more spiritually minded class of believers who look with greater anxiety for the kingdom of god within them than for the visible advent of christ in 1864 will be likely to find dr cumming’s declamatory flights and historicoprophetical exercitations as little better than “clouts o’ cauld parritch”  such is our general impression from his writings after an attentive perusal  there are some particular characteristics which we shall consider more closely but in doing so we must be understood as altogether declining any doctrinal discussion  we have no intention to consider the grounds of dr cumming’s dogmatic system to examine the principles of his prophetic exegesis or to question his opinion concerning the little horn the river euphrates or the seven vials  we identify ourselves with no one of the bodies whom he regards it as his special mission to attack we give our adhesion neither to romanism puseyism nor to that anomalous combination of opinions which he introduces to us under the name of infidelity  it is simply as spectators that we criticise dr cumming’s mode of warfare and we concern ourselves less with what he holds to be christian truth than with his manner of enforcing that truth less with the doctrines he teaches than with the moral spirit and tendencies of his teaching  one of the most striking characteristics of dr cumming’s writings is unscrupulosity of statement  his motto apparently is christianitatem quocunque modo christianitatem and the only system he includes under the term christianity is calvinistic protestantism  experience has so long shown that the human brain is a congenial nidus for inconsistent beliefs that we do not pause to inquire how dr cumming who attributes the conversion of the unbelieving to the divine spirit can think it necessary to cooperate with that spirit by argumentative white lies  nor do we for a moment impugn the genuineness of his zeal for christianity or the sincerity of his conviction that the doctrines he preaches are necessary to salvation on the contrary we regard the flagrant unveracity that we find on his pages as an indirect result of that conviction—as a result namely of the intellectual and moral distortion of view which is inevitably produced by assigning to dogmas based on a very complex structure of evidence the place and authority of first truths  a distinct appreciation of the value of evidence—in other words the intellectual perception of truth—is more closely allied to truthfulness of statement or the moral quality of veracity than is generally admitted  there is not a more pernicious fallacy afloat in common parlance than the wide distinction made between intellect and morality  amiable impulses without intellect man may have in common with dogs and horses but morality which is specifically human is dependent on the regulation of feeling by intellect  all human beings who can be said to be in any degree moral have their impulses guided not indeed always by their own intellect but by the intellect of human beings who have gone before them and created traditions and associations which have taken the rank of laws  now that highest moral habit the constant preference of truth both theoretically and practically preeminently demands the cooperation of the intellect with the impulses as is indicated by the fact that it is only found in anything like completeness in the highest class of minds  in accordance with this we think it is found that in proportion as religious sects exalt feeling above intellect and believe themselves to be guided by direct inspiration rather than by a spontaneous exertion of their faculties—that is in proportion as they are removed from rationalism—their sense of truthfulness is misty and confused  no one can have talked to the more enthusiastic methodists and listened to their stories of miracles without perceiving that they require no other passport to a statement than that it accords with their wishes and their general conception of god’s dealings nay they regard as a symptom of sinful scepticism an inquiry into the evidence for a story which they think unquestionably tends to the glory of god and in retailing such stories new particulars further tending to his glory are “borne in” upon their minds  now dr cumming as we have said is no enthusiastic pietist within a certain circle—within the mill of evangelical orthodoxy—his intellect is perpetually at work but that principle of sophistication which our friends the methodists derive from the predominance of their pietistic feelings is involved for him in the doctrine of verbal inspiration what is for them a state of emotion submerging the intellect is with him a formula imprisoning the intellect depriving it of its proper function—the free search for truth—and making it the mere servantofallwork to a foregone conclusion  minds fettered by this doctrine no longer inquire concerning a proposition whether it is attested by sufficient evidence but whether it accords with scripture they do not search for facts as such but for facts that will bear out their doctrine  they become accustomed to reject the more direct evidence in favor of the less direct and where adverse evidence reaches demonstration they must resort to devices and expedients in order to explain away contradiction  it is easy to see that this mental habit blunts not only the perception of truth but the sense of truthfulness and that the man whose faith drives him into fallacies treads close upon the precipice of falsehood  we have entered into this digression for the sake of mitigating the inference that is likely to be drawn from that characteristic of dr cumming’s works to which we have pointed  he is much in the same intellectual condition as that professor of padua who in order to disprove galileo’s discovery of jupiter’s satellites urged that as there were only seven metals there could not be more than seven planets—a mental condition scarcely compatible with candor  and we may well suppose that if the professor had held the belief in seven planets and no more to be a necessary condition of salvation his mental condition would have been so dazed that even if he had consented to look through galileo’s telescope his eyes would have reported in accordance with his inward alarms rather than with the external fact  so long as a belief in propositions is regarded as indispensable to salvation the pursuit of truth as such is not possible any more than it is possible for a man who is swimming for his life to make meteorological observations on the storm which threatens to overwhelm him  the sense of alarm and haste the anxiety for personal safety which dr cumming insists upon as the proper religious attitude unmans the nature and allows no thorough calm thinking no truly noble disinterested feeling  hence we by no means suspect that the unscrupulosity of statement with which we charge dr cumming extends beyond the sphere of his theological prejudices we do not doubt that religion apart he appreciates and practices veracity  a grave general accusation must be supported by details and in adducing those we purposely select the most obvious cases of misrepresentation—such as require no argument to expose them but can be perceived at a glance  among dr cumming’s numerous books one of the most notable for unscrupulosity of statement is the “manual of christian evidences” written as he tells us in his preface not to give the deepest solutions of the difficulties in question but to furnish scripture readers city missionaries and sunday school teachers with a “ready reply” to sceptical arguments  this announcement that readiness was the chief quality sought for in the solutions here given modifies our inference from the other qualities which those solutions present and it is but fair to presume that when the christian disputant is not in a hurry dr cumming would recommend replies less ready and more veracious here is an example of what in another place 74 he tells his readers is “change in their pocket    a little ready argument which they can employ and therewith answer a fool according to his folly”  from the nature of this argumentative small coin we are inclined to think dr cumming understands answering a fool according to his folly to mean giving him a foolish answer  we quote from the “manual of christian evidences” p 62      “some of the gods which the heathen worshipped were among the     greatest monsters that ever walked the earth  mercury was a thief     and because he was an expert thief he was enrolled among the gods     bacchus was a mere sensualist and drunkard and therefore he was     enrolled among the gods  venus was a dissipated and abandoned     courtesan and therefore she was enrolled among the goddesses  mars     was a savage that gloried in battle and in blood and therefore he     was deified and enrolled among the gods”  does dr cumming believe the purport of these sentences  if so this passage is worth handing down as his theory of the greek myth—as a specimen of the astounding ignorance which was possible in a metropolitan preacher ad 1854  and if he does not believe them    the inference must then be that he thinks delicate veracity about the ancient greeks is not a christian virtue but only a “splendid sin” of the unregenerate this inference is rendered the more probable by our finding a little further on that he is not more scrupulous about the moderns if they come under his definition of “infidels”  but the passage we are about to quote in proof of this has a worse quality than its discrepancy with fact  who that has a spark of generous feeling that rejoices in the presence of good in a fellowbeing has not dwelt with pleasure on the thought that lord byron’s unhappy career was ennobled and purified toward its close by a high and sympathetic purpose by honest and energetic efforts for his fellowmen  who has not read with deep emotion those last pathetic lines beautiful as the afterglow of sunset in which love and resignation are mingled with something of a melancholy heroism  who has not lingered with compassion over the dying scene at missolonghi—the sufferer’s inability to make his farewell messages of love intelligible and the last long hours of silent pain  yet for the sake of furnishing his disciples with a “ready reply” dr cumming can prevail on himself to inoculate them with a badspirited falsity like the following      “we have one striking exhibition of an infidel’s brightest     thoughts in some lines written in his dying moments by a man     gifted with great genius capable of prodigious intellectual prowess     but of worthless principle and yet more worthless practices—i mean     the celebrated lord byron  he says      “‘though gay companions o’er the bowl        dispel awhile the sense of ill     though pleasure fills the maddening soul        the heart—the heart is lonely still      “‘ay but to die and go alas        where all have gone and all must go     to be the nothing that i was        ere born to life and living woe      “‘count o’er the joys thine hours have seen        count o’er thy days from anguish free     and know whatever thou hast been        tis something better not to be      “‘nay for myself so dark my fate        through every turn of life hath been     man and the world so much i hate        i care not when i quit the scene’”  it is difficult to suppose that dr cumming can have been so grossly imposed upon—that he can be so illinformed as really to believe that these lines were “written” by lord byron in his dying moments but allowing him the full benefit of that possibility how shall we explain his introduction of this feebly rabid doggrel as “an infidel’s brightest thoughts”  in marshalling the evidences of christianity dr cumming directs most of his arguments against opinions that are either totally imaginary or that belong to the past rather than to the present while he entirely fails to meet the difficulties actually felt and urged by those who are unable to accept revelation  there can hardly be a stronger proof of misconception as to the character of freethinking in the present day than the recommendation of leland’s “short and easy method with the deists”—a method which is unquestionably short and easy for preachers disinclined to reconsider their stereotyped modes of thinking and arguing but which has quite ceased to realize those epithets in the conversion of deists yet dr cumming not only recommends this book but takes the trouble himself to write a feebler version of its arguments  for example on the question of the genuineness and authenticity of the new testament writing’s he says “if therefore at a period long subsequent to the death of christ a number of men had appeared in the world drawn up a book which they christened by the name of the holy scripture and recorded these things which appear in it as facts when they were only the fancies of their own imagination surely the jews would have instantly reclaimed that no such events transpired that no such person as jesus christ appeared in their capital and that their crucifixion of him and their alleged evil treatment of his apostles were mere fictions” 76  it is scarcely necessary to say that in such argument as this dr cumming is beating the air  he is meeting a hypothesis which no one holds and totally missing the real question  the only type of “infidel” whose existence dr cumming recognizes is that fossil personage who “calls the bible a lie and a forgery”  he seems to be ignorant—or he chooses to ignore the fact—that there is a large body of eminently instructed and earnest men who regard the hebrew and christian scriptures as a series of historical documents to be dealt with according to the rules of historical criticism and that an equally large number of men who are not historical critics find the dogmatic scheme built on the letter of the scriptures opposed to their profoundest moral convictions dr cumming’s infidel is a man who because his life is vicious tries to convince himself that there is no god and that christianity is an imposture but who is all the while secretly conscious that he is opposing the truth and cannot help “letting out” admissions “that the bible is the book of god”  we are favored with the following “creed of the infidel”      “i believe that there is no god but that matter is god and god is     matter and that it is no matter whether there is any god or not  i     believe also that the world was not made but that the world made     itself or that it had no beginning and that it will last forever     i believe that man is a beast that the soul is the body and that     the body is the soul and that after death there is neither body nor     soul  i believe there is no religion that natural religion is the     only religion and all religion unnatural  i believe not in     moses i believe in the first philosophers  i believe not in the     evangelists i believe in chubb collins toland tindal and hobbes     i believe in lord bolingbroke and i believe not in st paul  i     believe not in revelation i believe in tradition i believe in     the talmud i believe in the koran i believe not in the bible  i     believe in socrates i believe in confucius i believe in mahomet i     believe not in christ  and lastly i believe in all unbelief”  the intellectual and moral monster whose creed is this complex web of contradictions is moreover according to dr cumming a being who unites much simplicity and imbecility with his satanic hardihood—much tenderness of conscience with his obdurate vice  hear the “proof”      “i once met with an acute and enlightened infidel with whom i     reasoned day after day and for hours together i submitted to him     the internal the external and the experimental evidences but made     no impression on his scorn and unbelief  at length i entertained a     suspicion that there was something morally rather than     intellectually wrong and that the bias was not in the intellect but     in the heart one day therefore i said to him ‘i must now state my     conviction and you may call me uncharitable but duty compels me     you are living in some known and gross sin’  the man’s countenance     became pale he bowed and left me”—“man of evidences” p 254  here we have the remarkable psychological phenomenon of an “acute and enlightened” man who deliberately purposing to indulge in a favorite sin and regarding the gospel with scorn and unbelief is nevertheless so much more scrupulous than the majority of christians that he cannot “embrace sin and the gospel simultaneously” who is so alarmed at the gospel in which he does not believe that he cannot be easy without trying to crush it whose acuteness and enlightenment suggest to him as a means of crushing the gospel to argue from day to day with dr cumming and who is withal so naïve that he is taken by surprise when dr cumming failing in argument resorts to accusation and so tender in conscience that at the mention of his sin he turns pale and leaves the spot  if there be any human mind in existence capable of holding dr cumming’s “creed of the infidel” of at the same time believing in tradition and “believing in all unbelief” it must be the mind of the infidel just described for whose existence we have dr cumming’s ex officio word as a theologian and to theologians we may apply what sancho panza says of the bachelors of salamanca that they never tell lies—except when it suits their purpose  the total absence from dr cumming’s theological mind of any demarcation between fact and rhetoric is exhibited in another passage where he adopts the dramatic form      “ask the peasant on the hills—and i have asked amid the mountains of     braemar and deeside—‘how do you know that this book is divine and     that the religion you profess is true  you never read paley’  ‘no     i never heard of him’—‘you have never read butler’  ‘no i have     never heard of him’—‘nor chalmers’  ‘no i do not know him’—‘you     have never read any books on evidence’  ‘no i have read no such     books’—‘then how do you know this book is true’  ‘know it  tell     me that the dee the clunie and the garrawalt the streams at my     feet do not run that the winds do not sigh amid the gorges of these     blue hills that the sun does not kindle the peaks of lochnagar     tell me my heart does not beat and i will believe you but do not     tell me the bible is not divine  i have found its truth illuminating     my footsteps its consolations sustaining my heart  may my tongue     cleave to my mouth’s roof and my right hand forget its cunning if i     every deny what is my deepest inner experience that this blessed     book is the book of god’”—“church before the flood” p 35  dr cumming is so slippery and lax in his mode of presentation that we find it impossible to gather whether he means to assert that this is what a peasant on the mountains of braemar did say or that it is what such a peasant would say in the one case the passage may be taken as a measure of his truthfulness in the other of his judgment  his own faith apparently has not been altogether intuitive like that of his rhetorical peasant for he tells us “apoc sketches” p 405 that he has himself experienced what it is to have religious doubts  “i was tainted while at the university by this spirit of scepticism  i thought christianity might not be true  the very possibility of its being true was the thought i felt i must meet and settle  conscience could give me no peace till i had settled it  i read and i read from that day for fourteen or fifteen years till this and now i am as convinced upon the clearest evidence that this book is the book of god as that i now address you”  this experience however instead of impressing on him the fact that doubt may be the stamp of a truthloving mind—that sunt quibus non credidisse honor est et fidei futuræ pignus—seems to have produced precisely the contrary effect  it has not enabled him even to conceive the condition of a mind “perplext in faith but pure in deeds” craving light yearning for a faith that will harmonize and cherish its highest powers and aspirations but unable to find that faith in dogmatic christianity  his own doubts apparently were of a different kind  nowhere in his pages have we found a humble candid sympathetic attempt to meet the difficulties that may be felt by an ingenuous mind  everywhere he supposes that the doubter is hardened conceited consciously shutting his eyes to the light—a fool who is to be answered according to his folly—that is with ready replies made up of reckless assertions of apocryphal anecdotes and where other resources fail of vituperative imputation  as to the reading which he has prosecuted for fifteen years—either it has left him totally ignorant of the relation which his own religions creed bears to the criticism and philosophy of the nineteenth century or he systematically blinks that criticism and that philosophy and instead of honestly and seriously endeavoring to meet and solve what he knows to be the real difficulties contents himself with setting up popinjays to shoot at for the sake of confirming the ignorance and winning the heap admiration of his evangelical hearers and readers  like the catholic preacher who after throwing down his cap and apostrophizing it as luther turned to his audience and said “you see this heretical fellow has not a word to say for himself” dr cumming having drawn his ugly portrait of the infidel and put arguments of a convenient quality into his mouth finds a “short and easy method” of confounding this “croaking frog”  in his treatment of infidels we imagine he is guided by a mental process which may be expressed in the following syllogism whatever tends to the glory of god is true it is for the glory of god that infidels should be as bad as possible therefore whatever tends to show that infidels are as bad as possible is true  all infidels he tells us have been men of “gross and licentious lives”  is there not some wellknown unbeliever david hume for example of whom even dr cumming’s readers may have heard as an exception  no matter  some one suspected that he was not an exception and as that suspicion tends to the glory of god it is one for a christian to entertain  see “man of ev” p 73—if we were unable to imagine this kind of selfsophistication we should be obliged to suppose that relying on the ignorance of his evangelical disciples he fed them with direct and conscious falsehoods  “voltaire” he informs them “declares there is no god” he was “an antitheist that is one who deliberately and avowedly opposed and hated god who swore in his blasphemy that he would dethrone him” and “advocated the very depths of the lowest sensuality”  with regard to many statements of a similar kind equally at variance with truth in dr cumming’s volumes we presume that he has been misled by hearsay or by the secondhand character of his acquaintance with freethinking literature  an evangelical preacher is not obliged to be wellread  here however is a case which the extremest supposition of educated ignorance will not reach  even books of “evidences” quote from voltaire the line—      “si dieu n’existait pas il faudrait l’inventer”  even persons fed on the mere whey and buttermilk of literature must know that in philosophy voltaire was nothing if not a theist—must know that he wrote not against god but against jehovah the god of the jews whom he believed to be a false god—must know that to say voltaire was an atheist on this ground is as absurd as to say that a jacobite opposed hereditary monarchy because he declared the brunswick family had no title to the throne  that dr cumming should repeat the vulgar fables about voltaire’s death is merely what we might expect from the specimens we have seen of his illustrative stories  a man whose accounts of his own experience are apocryphal is not likely to put borrowed narratives to any severe test  the alliance between intellectual and moral perversion is strikingly typified by the way in which he alternates from the unveracious to the absurd from misrepresentation to contradiction  side by side with the abduction of “facts” such as those we have quoted we find him arguing on one page that the trinity was too grand a doctrine to have been conceived by man and was therefore divine and on another page that the incarnation had been preconceived by man and is therefore to be accepted as divine  but we are less concerned with the fallacy of his “ready replies” than with their falsity and even of this we can only afford space for a very few specimens  here is one “there is a thousand times more proof that the gospel of john was written by him than there is that the Αναβασις was written by xenophon or the ars poetica by horace”  if dr cumming had chosen plato’s epistles or anacreon’s poems instead of the anabasis or the ars poetica he would have reduced the extent of the falsehood and would have furnished a ready reply which would have been equally effective with his sundayschool teachers and their disputants  hence we conclude this prodigality of misstatement this exuberance of mendacity is an effervescence of zeal in majorem gloriam dei  elsewhere he tells us that “the idea of the author of the ‘vestiges’ is that man is the development of a monkey that the monkey is the embryo man so that if you keep a baboon long enough it will develop itself into a man” how well dr cumming has qualified himself to judge of the ideas in “that very unphilosophical book” as he pronounces it may be inferred from the fact that he implies the author of the “vestiges” to have originated the nebular hypothesis  in the volume from which the last extract is taken even the hardihood of assertion is surpassed by the suicidal character of the argument  it is called “the church before the flood” and is devoted chiefly to the adjustment of the question between the bible and geology  keeping within the limits we have prescribed to ourselves we do not enter into the matter of this discussion we merely pause a little over the volume in order to point out dr cumming’s mode of treating the question  he first tells us that “the bible has not a single scientific error in it” that “its slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true” and he asks      “how is it that moses with no greater education than the hindoo or     the ancient philosopher has written his book touching science at a     thousand points so accurately that scientific research has     discovered no flaws in it and yet in those investigations which have     taken place in more recent centuries it has not been shown that he     has committed one single error or made one solitary assertion which     can be proved by the maturest science or by the most eagleeyed     philosopher to be incorrect scientifically or historically”  according to this the relation of the bible to science should be one of the strong points of apologists for revelation the scientific accuracy of moses should stand at the head of their evidences and they might urge with some cogency that since aristotle who devoted himself to science and lived many ages after moses does little else than err ingeniously this fact that the jewish lawgiver though touching science at a thousand points has written nothing that has not been “demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true” is an irrefragable proof of his having derived his knowledge from a supernatural source  how does it happen then that dr cumming forsakes this strong position  how is it that we find him some pages further on engaged in reconciling genesis with the discoveries of science by means of imaginative hypotheses and feats of “interpretation”  surely that which has been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true does not require hypothesis and critical argument in order to show that it may possibly agree with those very discoveries by means of which its exact and strict truth has been demonstrated  and why should dr cumming suppose as we shall presently find him supposing that men of science hesitate to accept the bible because it appears to contradict their discoveries  by his own statement that appearance of contradiction does not exist on the contrary it has been demonstrated that the bible precisely agrees with their discoveries  perhaps however in saying of the bible that its “slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true” dr cumming merely means to imply that theologians have found out a way of explaining the biblical text so that it no longer in their opinion appears to be in contradiction with the discoveries of science  one of two things therefore either he uses language without the slightest appreciation of its real meaning or the assertions he makes on one page are directly contradicted by the arguments he urges on another  dr cumming’s principles—or we should rather say confused notions—of biblical interpretation as exhibited in this volume are particularly significant of his mental calibre  he says “church before the flood” p 93 “men of science who are full of scientific investigation and enamored of scientific discovery will hesitate before they accept a book which they think contradicts the plainest and the most unequivocal disclosures they have made in the bowels of the earth or among the stars of the sky  to all these we answer as we have already indicated there is not the least dissonance between god’s written book and the most mature discoveries of geological science  one thing however there may be there may be a contradiction between the discoveries of geology and our preconceived interpretations of the bible  but this is not because the bible is wrong but because our interpretation is wrong”  the italics in all cases are our own  elsewhere he says “it seems to me plainly evident that the record of genesis when read fairly and not in the light of our prejudices—and mind you the essence of popery is to read the bible in the light of our opinions instead of viewing our opinions in the light of the bible in its plain and obvious sense—falls in perfectly with the assertion of geologists”  on comparing these two passages we gather that when dr cumming under stress of geological discovery assigns to the biblical text a meaning entirely different from that which on his own showing was universally ascribed to it for more than three thousand years he regards himself as “viewing his opinions in the light of the bible in its plain and obvious sense”  now he is reduced to one of two alternatives either he must hold that the “plain and obvious meaning” of the whole bible differs from age to age so that the criterion of its meaning lies in the sum of knowledge possessed by each successive age—the bible being an elastic garment for the growing thought of mankind or he must hold that some portions are amenable to this criterion and others not so  in the former case he accepts the principle of interpretation adopted by the early german rationalists in the latter case he has to show a further criterion by which we can judge what parts of the bible are elastic and what rigid  if he says that the interpretation of the text is rigid wherever it treats of doctrines necessary to salvation we answer that for doctrines to be necessary to salvation they must first be true and in order to be true according to his own principle they must be founded on a correct interpretation of the biblical text  thus he makes the necessity of doctrines to salvation the criterion of infallible interpretation and infallible interpretation the criterion of doctrines being necessary to salvation  he is whirled round in a circle having by admitting the principle of novelty in interpretation completely deprived himself of a basis  that he should seize the very moment in which he is most palpably betraying that he has no test of biblical truth beyond his own opinion as an appropriate occasion for flinging the rather novel reproach against popery that its essence is to “read the bible in the light of our opinions” would be an almost pathetic selfexposure if it were not disgusting  imbecility that is not even meek ceases to be pitiable and becomes simply odious  parenthetic lashes of this kind against popery are very frequent with dr cumming and occur even in his more devout passages where their introduction must surely disturb the spiritual exercises of his hearers indeed roman catholics fare worse with him even than infidels  infidels are the small vermin—the mice to be bagged en passant  the main object of his chase—the rats which are to be nailed up as trophies—are the roman catholics  romanism is the masterpiece of satan but reassure yourselves dr cumming has been created  antichrist is enthroned in the vatican but he is stoutly withstood by the boanerges of crowncourt the personality of satan as might be expected is a very prominent tenet in dr cumming’s discourses those who doubt it are he thinks “generally specimens of the victims of satan as a triumphant seducer” and it is through the medium of this doctrine that he habitually contemplates roman catholics  they are the puppets of which the devil holds the strings  it is only exceptionally that he speaks of them as fellowmen acted on by the same desires fears and hopes as himself his rule is to hold them up to his hearers as foredoomed instruments of satan and vessels of wrath  if he is obliged to admit that they are “no shams” that they are “thoroughly in earnest”—that is because they are inspired by hell because they are under an “infranatural” influence if their missionaries are found wherever protestant missionaries go this zeal in propagating their faith is not in them a consistent virtue as it is in protestants but a “melancholy fact” affording additional evidence that they are instigated and assisted by the devil  and dr cumming is inclined to think that they work miracles because that is no more than might be expected from the known ability of satan who inspires them 86a  he admits indeed that “there is a fragment of the church of christ in the very bosom of that awful apostasy” 86b and that there are members of the church of rome in glory but this admission is rare and episodical—is a declaration pro formâ about as influential on the general disposition and habits as an aristocrat’s profession of democracy  this leads us to mention another conspicuous characteristic of dr cumming’s teaching—the absence of genuine charity  it is true that he makes large profession of tolerance and liberality within a certain circle he exhorts christians to unity he would have churchmen fraternize with dissenters and exhorts these two branches of god’s family to defer the settlement of their differences till the millennium but the love thus taught is the love of the clan which is the correlative of antagonism to the rest of mankind  it is not sympathy and helpfulness toward men as men but toward men as christians and as christians in the sense of a small minority  dr cumming’s religion may demand a tribute of love but it gives a charter to hatred it may enjoin charity but it fosters all uncharitableness  if i believe that god tells me to love my enemies but at the same time hates his own enemies and requires me to have one will with him which has the larger scope love or hatred  and we refer to those pages of dr cumming’s in which he opposes roman catholics puseyites and infidels—pages which form the larger proportion of what he has published—for proof that the idea of god which both the logic and spirit of his discourses keep present to his hearers is that of a god who hates his enemies a god who teaches love by fierce denunciations of wrath—a god who encourages obedience to his precepts by elaborately revealing to us that his own government is in precise opposition to those precepts  we know the usual evasions on this subject  we know dr cumming would say that even roman catholics are to be loved and succored as men that he would help even that “unclean spirit” cardinal wiseman out of a ditch  but who that is in the slightest degree acquainted with the action of the human mind will believe that any genuine and large charity can grow out of an exercise of love which is always to have an arrièrepensée of hatred  of what quality would be the conjugal love of a husband who loved his spouse as a wife but hated her as a woman  it is reserved for the regenerate mind according to dr cumming’s conception of it to be “wise amazed temperate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment”  precepts of charity uttered with a faint breath at the end of a sermon are perfectly futile when all the force of the lungs has been spent in keeping the hearer’s mind fixed on the conception of his fellowmen not as fellowsinners and fellowsufferers but as agents of hell as automata through whom satan plays his game upon earth—not on objects which call forth their reverence their love their hope of good even in the most strayed and perverted but on a minute identification of human things with such symbols as the scarlet whore the beast out of the abyss scorpions whose sting is in their tails men who have the mark of the beast and unclean spirits like frogs  you might as well attempt to educate the child’s sense of beauty by hanging its nursery with the horrible and grotesque pictures in which the early painters represented the last judgment as expect christian graces to flourish on that prophetic interpretation which dr cumming offers as the principal nutriment of his flock  quite apart from the critical basis of that interpretation quite apart from the degree of truth there may be in dr cumming’s prognostications—questions into which we do not choose to enter—his use of prophecy must be à priori condemned in the judgment of rightminded persons by its results as testified in the net moral effect of his sermons  the best minds that accept christianity as a divinely inspired system believe that the great end of the gospel is not merely the saving but the educating of men’s souls the creating within them of holy dispositions the subduing of egoistical pretensions and the perpetual enhancing of the desire that the will of god—a will synonymous with goodness and truth—may be done on earth  but what relation to all this has a system of interpretation which keeps the mind of the christian in the position of a spectator at a gladiatorial show of which satan is the wild beast in the shape of the great red dragon and two thirds of mankind the victims—the whole provided and got up by god for the edification of the saints  the demonstration that the second advent is at hand if true can have no really holy spiritual effect the highest state of mind inculcated by the gospel is resignation to the disposal of god’s providence—“whether we live we live unto the lord whether we die we die unto the lord”—not an eagerness to see a temporal manifestation which shall confound the enemies of god and give exaltation to the saints it is to dwell in christ by spiritual communion with his nature not to fix the date when he shall appear in the sky  dr cumming’s delight in shadowing forth the downfall of the man of sin in prognosticating the battle of gog and magog and in advertising the premillennial advent is simply the transportation of political passions on to a socalled religious platform it is the anticipation of the triumph of “our party” accomplished by our principal men being “sent for” into the clouds  let us be understood to speak in all seriousness if we were in search of amusement we should not seek for it by examining dr cumming’s works in order to ridicule them  we are simply discharging a disagreeable duty in delivering our opinion that judged by the highest standard even of orthodox christianity they are little calculated to produce—      “a closer walk with god     a calm and heavenly frame”  but are more likely to nourish egoistic complacency and pretension a hard and condemnatory spirit toward one’s fellowmen and a busy occupation with the minutiæ of events instead of a reverent contemplation of great facts and a wise application of great principles it would be idle to consider dr cumming’s theory of prophecy in any other light as a philosophy of history or a specimen of biblical interpretation it bears about the same relation to the extension of genuine knowledge as the astrological “house” in the heavens bears to the true structure and relations of the universe  the slight degree in which dr cumming’s faith is imbued with truly human sympathies is exhibited in the way he treats the doctrine of eternal punishment  here a little of that readiness to strain the letter of the scriptures which he so often manifests when his object is to prove a point against romanism would have been an amiable frailty if it had been applied on the side of mercy  when he is bent on proving that the prophecy concerning the man of sin in the second epistle to the thessalonians refers to the pope he can extort from the innocent word καθισαι the meaning cathedrize though why we are to translate “he as god cathedrizes in the temple of god” any more than we are to translate “cathedrize here while i go and pray yonder” it is for dr cumming to show more clearly than he has yet done  but when rigorous literality will favor the conclusion that the greater proportion of the human race will be eternally miserable—then he is rigorously literal  he says “the greek words εις τους αιώνας των αιώνων here translated ‘everlasting’ signify literally ‘unto the ages of ages’ αιει ων ‘always being’ that is everlasting ceaseless existence  plato uses the word in this sense when he says ‘the gods that live forever’ but i must also admit that this word is used several times in a limited extent—as for instance ‘the everlasting hills’  of course this does not mean that there never will be a time when the hills will cease to stand the expression here is evidently figurative but it implies eternity the hills shall remain as long as the earth lasts and no hand has power to remove them but that eternal one which first called them into being so the state of the soul remains the same after death as long as the soul exists and no one has power to alter it  the same word is often applied to denote the existence of god—‘the eternal god’  can we limit the word when applied to him  because occasionally used in a limited sense we must not infer it is always so  ‘everlasting’ plainly means in scripture ‘without end’ it is only to be explained figuratively when it is evident it cannot be interpreted in any other way”  we do not discuss whether dr cumming’s interpretation accords with the meaning of the new testament writers we simply point to the fact that the text becomes elastic for him when he wants freer play for his prejudices while he makes it an adamantine barrier against the admission that mercy will ultimately triumph—that god ie love will be all in all  he assures us that he does not “delight to dwell on the misery of the lost” and we believe him  that misery does not seem to be a question of feeling with him either one way or the other  he does not merely resign himself to the awful mystery of eternal punishment he contends for it  do we object he asks 90 to everlasting happiness then why object to everlasting misery—reasoning which is perhaps felt to be cogent by theologians who anticipate the everlasting happiness for themselves and the everlasting misery for their neighbors  the compassion of some christians has been glad to take refuge in the opinion that the bible allows the supposition of annihilation for the impenitent but the rigid sequence of dr cumming’s reasoning will not admit of this idea  he sees that flax is made into linen and linen into paper that paper when burned partly ascends as smoke and then again descends in rain or in dust and carbon  “not one particle of the original flax is lost although there may be not one particle that has not undergone an entire change annihilation is not but change of form is  it will be thus with our bodies at the resurrection  the death of the body means not annihilation  not one feature of the face will be annihilated”  having established the perpetuity of the body by this close and clear analogy namely that as there is a total change in the particles of flax in consequence of which they no longer appear as flax so there will not be a total change in the particles of the human body but they will reappear as the human body he does not seem to consider that the perpetuity of the body involves the perpetuity of the soul but requires separate evidence for this and finds such evidence by begging the very question at issue—namely by asserting that the text of the scripture implies “the perpetuity of the punishment of the lost and the consciousness of the punishment which they endure”  yet it is drivelling like this which is listened to and lauded as eloquence by hundreds and which a doctor of divinity can believe that he has his “reward as a saint” for preaching and publishing  one more characteristic of dr cumming’s writings and we have done this is the perverted moral judgment that everywhere reigns in them not that this perversion is peculiar to dr cumming it belongs to the dogmatic system which he shares with all evangelical believers  but the abstract tendencies of systems are represented in very different degrees according to the different characters of those who embrace them just as the same food tells differently on different constitutions and there are certain qualities in dr cumming that cause the perversion of which we speak to exhibit itself with peculiar prominence in his teaching  a single extract will enable us to explain what we mean      “the ‘thoughts’ are evil  if it were possible for human eye to     discern and to detect the thoughts that flutter around the heart of     an unregenerate man—to mark their hue and their multitude it would     be found that they are indeed ‘evil’  we speak not of the thief and     the murderer and the adulterer and such like whose crimes draw     down the cognizance of earthly tribunals and whose unenviable     character it is to take the lead in the paths of sin but we refer to     the men who are marked out by their practice of many of the seemliest     moralities of life—by the exercise of the kindliest affections and     the interchange of the sweetest reciprocities—and of these men if     unrenewed and unchanged we pronounce that their thoughts are evil     to ascertain this we must refer to the object around which our     thoughts ought continually to circulate  the scriptures assert that     this object is the glory of god that for this we ought to think     to act and to speak and that in thus thinking acting and     speaking there is involved the purest and most endearing bliss  now     it will be found true of the most amiable men that with all their     good society and kindliness of heart and all their strict and     unbending integrity they never or rarely think of the glory of god     the question never occurs to them—will this redound to the glory of     god  will this make his name more known his being more loved his     praise more sung  and just inasmuch as their every thought comes     short of this lofty aim in so much does it come short of good and     entitle itself to the character of evil  if the glory of god is not     the absorbing and the influential aim of their thoughts then they     are evil but god’s glory never enters into their minds  they are     amiable because it chances to be one of the constitutional     tendencies of their individual character left uneffaced by the fall     and they an just and upright because they have perhaps no     occasion to be otherwise or find it subservient to their interests     to maintain such a character”—“occ disc” vol i p 8  again we read ibid p 236      “there are traits in the christian character which the mere worldly     man cannot understand  he can understand the outward morality but     he cannot understand the inner spring of it he can understand     dorcas’ liberality to the poor but he cannot penetrate the ground of     dorcas’ liberality  some men give to the poor because they are     ostentatious or because they think the poor will ultimately avenge     their neglect but the christian gives to the poor not only     because he has sensibilities like other men but because inasmuch as     ye did it to the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me”  before entering on the more general question involved in these quotations we must point to the clauses we have marked with italics where dr cumming appears to express sentiments which we are happy to think are not shared by the majority of his brethren in the faith  dr cumming it seems is unable to conceive that the natural man can have any other motive for being just and upright than that it is useless to be otherwise or that a character for honesty is profitable according to his experience between the feelings of ostentation and selfish alarm and the feeling of love to christ there lie no sensibilities which can lead a man to relieve want  granting as we should prefer to think that it is dr cumming’s exposition of his sentiments which is deficient rather than his sentiments themselves still the fact that the deficiency lies precisely here and that he can overlook it not only in the haste of oral delivery but in the examination of proofsheets is strongly significant of his mental bias—of the faint degree in which he sympathizes with the disinterested elements of human feeling and of the fact which we are about to dwell upon that those feelings are totally absent from his religious theory  now dr cumming invariably assumes that in fulminating against those who differ from him he is standing on a moral elevation to which they are compelled reluctantly to look up that his theory of motives and conduct is in its loftiness and purity a perpetual rebuke to their low and vicious desires and practice  it is time he should be told that the reverse is the fact that there are men who do not merely cast a superficial glance at his doctrine and fail to see its beauty or justice but who after a close consideration of that doctrine pronounce it to be subversive of true moral development and therefore positively noxious  dr cumming is fond of showing up the teaching of romanism and accusing it of undermining true morality it is time he should be told that there is a large body both of thinkers and practical men who hold precisely the same opinion of his own teaching—with this difference that they do not regard it as the inspiration of satan but as the natural crop of a human mind where the soil is chiefly made up of egoistic passions and dogmatic beliefs  dr cumming’s theory as we have seen is that actions are good or evil according as they are prompted or not prompted by an exclusive reference to the “glory of god”  god then in dr cumming’s conception is a being who has no pleasure in the exercise of love and truthfulness and justice considered as affecting the wellbeing of his creatures he has satisfaction in us only in so far as we exhaust our motives and dispositions of all relation to our fellowbeings and replace sympathy with men by anxiety for the “glory of god”  the deed of grace darling when she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women was not good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and impelled her to brave death for the chance of saving others it was only good if she asked herself—will this redound to the glory of god  the man who endures tortures rather than betray a trust the man who spends years in toil in order to discharge an obligation from which the law declares him free must be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellowman but by a desire to make “the name of god more known”  the sweet charities of domestic life—the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness the forbearance toward frailties the prompt helpfulness in all efforts and sympathy in all joys are simply evil if they result from a “constitutional tendency” or from dispositions disciplined by the experience of suffering and the perception of moral loveliness  a wife is not to devote herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of the duties implied by a close relation—she is to be a faithful wife for the glory of god if she feels her natural affections welling up too strongly she is to repress them it will not do to act from natural affection—she must think of the glory of god  a man is to guide his affairs with energy and discretion not from an honest desire to fulfil his responsibilities as a member of society and a father but—that “god’s praise may be sung”  dr cumming’s christian pays his debts for the glory of god were it not for the coercion of that supreme motive it would be evil to pay them  a man is not to be just from a feeling of justice he is not to help his fellowmen out of goodwill to his fellowmen he is not to be a tender husband and father out of affection all these natural muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by a patent steelspring—anxiety for the “glory of god”  happily the constitution of human nature forbids the complete prevalence of such a theory  fatally powerful as religious systems have been human nature is stronger and wider than religious systems and though dogmas may hamper they cannot absolutely repress its growth build walls round the living tree as you will the bricks and mortar have by and by to give way before the slow and sure operation of the sap  but next to the hatred of the enemies of god which is the principle of persecution there perhaps has been no perversion more obstructive of true moral development than this substitution of a reference to the glory of god for the direct promptings of the sympathetic feelings  benevolence and justice are strong only in proportion as they are directly and inevitably called into activity by their proper objects pity is strong only because we are strongly impressed by suffering and only in proportion as it is compassion that speaks through the eyes when we soothe and moves the arm when we succor is a deed strictly benevolent  if the soothing or the succor be given because another being wishes or approves it the deed ceases to be one of benevolence and becomes one of deference of obedience of selfinterest or vanity  accessory motives may aid in producing an action but they presuppose the weakness of the direct motive and conversely when the direct motive is strong the action of accessory motives will be excluded  if then as dr cumming inculcates the glory of god is to be “the absorbing and the influential aim” in our thoughts and actions this must tend to neutralize the human sympathies the stream of feeling will be diverted from its natural current in order to feed an artificial canal  the idea of god is really moral in its influence—it really cherishes all that is best and loveliest in man—only when god is contemplated as sympathizing with the pure elements of human feeling as possessing infinitely all those attributes which we recognize to be moral in humanity  in this light the idea of god and the sense of his presence intensify all noble feeling and encourage all noble effort on the same principle that human sympathy is found a source of strength the brave man feels braver when he knows that another stout heart is beating time with his the devoted woman who is wearing out her years in patient effort to alleviate suffering or save vice from the last stages of degradation finds aid in the pressure of a friendly hand which tells her that there is one who understands her deeds and in her place would do the like  the idea of a god who not only sympathizes with all we feel and endure for our fellowmen but who will pour new life into our too languid love and give firmness to our vacillating purpose is an extension and multiplication of the effects produced by human sympathy and it has been intensified for the better spirits who have been under the influence of orthodox christianity by the contemplation of jesus as “god manifest in the flesh”  but dr cumming’s god is the very opposite of all this he is a god who instead of sharing and aiding our human sympathies is directly in collision with them who instead of strengthening the bond between man and man by encouraging the sense that they are both alike the objects of his love and care thrusts himself between them and forbids them to feel for each other except as they have relation to him  he is a god who instead of adding his solar force to swell the tide of those impulses that tend to give humanity a common life in which the good of one is the good of all commands us to check those impulses lest they should prevent us from thinking of his glory  it is in vain for dr cumming to say that we are to love man for god’s sake with the conception of god which his teaching presents the love of man for god’s sake involves as his writings abundantly show a strong principle of hatred  we can only love one being for the sake of another when there is an habitual delight in associating the idea of those two beings—that is when the object of our indirect love is a source of joy and honor to the object of our direct love but according to dr cumming’s theory the majority of mankind—the majority of his neighbors—are in precisely the opposite relation to god  his soul has no pleasure in them they belong more to satan than to him and if they contribute to his glory it is against their will  dr cumming then can only love some men for god’s sake the rest he must in consistency hate for god’s sake  there must be many even in the circle of dr cumming’s admirers who would be revolted by the doctrine we have just exposed if their natural good sense and healthy feeling were not early stifled by dogmatic beliefs and their reverence misled by pious phrases  but as it is many a rational question many a generous instinct is repelled as the suggestion of a supernatural enemy or as the ebullition of human pride and corruption  this state of inward contradiction can be put an end to only by the conviction that the free and diligent exertion of the intellect instead of being a sin is part of their responsibility—that right and reason are synonymous  the fundamental faith for man is faith in the result of a brave honest and steady use of all his faculties      “let knowledge grow from more to more        but more of reverence in us dwell        that mind and soul according well     may make one music as before        but vaster”  before taking leave of dr cumming let us express a hope that we have in no case exaggerated the unfavorable character of the inferences to be drawn from his pages  his creed often obliges him to hope the worst of men and exert himself in proving that the worst is true but thus far we are happier than he  we have no theory which requires us to attribute unworthy motives to dr cumming no opinions religious or irreligious which can make it a gratification to us to detect him in delinquencies on the contrary the better we are able to think of him as a man while we are obliged to disapprove him as a theologian the stronger will be the evidence for our conviction that the tendency toward good in human nature has a force which no creed can utterly counteract and which insures the ultimate triumph of that tendency over all dogmatic perversions    iv  german wit henry heine 99   “nothing” says goethe “is more significant of men’s character than what they find laughable”  the truth of this observation would perhaps have been more apparent if he had said culture instead of character  the last thing in which the cultivated man can have community with the vulgar is their jocularity and we can hardly exhibit more strikingly the wide gulf which separates him from them than by comparing the object which shakes the diaphragm of a coalheaver with the highly complex pleasure derived from a real witticism  that any high order of wit is exceedingly complex and demands a ripe and strong mental development has one evidence in the fact that we do not find it in boys at all in proportion to their manifestation of other powers  clever boys generally aspire to the heroic and poetic rather than the comic and the crudest of all their efforts are their jokes  many a witty man will remember how in his school days a practical joke more or less rabelaisian was for him the ne plus ultra of the ludicrous  it seems to have been the same with the boyhood of the human race  the history and literature of the ancient hebrews gives the idea of a people who went about their business and their pleasure as gravely as a society of beavers the smile and the laugh are often mentioned metaphorically but the smile is one of complacency the laugh is one of scorn  nor can we imagine that the facetious element was very strong in the egyptians no laughter lurks in the wondering eyes and the broad calm lips of their statues  still less can the assyrians have had any genius for the comic the round eyes and simpering satisfaction of their ideal faces belong to a type which is not witty but the cause of wit in others  the fun of these early races was we fancy of the afterdinner kind—loudthroated laughter over the winecup taken too little account of in sober moments to enter as an element into their art and differing as much from the laughter of a chamfort or a sheridan as the gastronomic enjoyment of an ancient briton whose dinner had no other “removes” than from acorns to beechmast and back again to acorns differed from the subtle pleasures of the palate experienced by his turtleeating descendant  in fact they had to live seriously through the stages which to subsequent races were to become comedy as those amiablelooking preadamite amphibia which professor owen has restored for us in effigy at sydenham took perfectly au sérieux the grotesque physiognomies of their kindred  heavy experience in their case as in every other was the base from which the salt of future wit was to be made  humor is of earlier growth than wit and it is in accordance with this earlier growth that it has more affinity with the poetic tendencies while wit is more nearly allied to the ratiocinative intellect  humor draws its materials from situations and characteristics wit seizes on unexpected and complex relations  humor is chiefly representative and descriptive it is diffuse and flows along without any other law than its own fantastic will or it flits about like a willofthewisp amazing us by its whimsical transitions  wit is brief and sudden and sharply defined as a crystal it does not make pictures it is not fantastic but it detects an unsuspected analogy or suggests a startling or confounding inference  every one who has had the opportunity of making the comparison will remember that the effect produced on him by some witticisms is closely akin to the effect produced on him by subtle reasoning which lays open a fallacy or absurdity and there are persons whose delight in such reasoning always manifests itself in laughter this affinity of wit with ratiocination is the more obvious in proportion as the species of wit is higher and deals less with less words and with superficialities than with the essential qualities of things  some of johnson’s most admirable witticisms consist in the suggestion of an analogy which immediately exposes the absurdity of an action or proposition and it is only their ingenuity condensation and instantaneousness which lift them from reasoning into wit—they are reasoning raised to a higher power  on the other hand humor in its higher forms and in proportion as it associates itself with the sympathetic emotions continually passes into poetry nearly all great modern humorists may be called prose poets  some confusion as to the nature of humor has been created by the fact that those who have written most eloquently on it have dwelt almost exclusively on its higher forms and have defined humor in general as the sympathetic presentation of incongruous elements in human nature and life—a definition which only applies to its later development  a great deal of humor may coexist with a great deal of barbarism as we see in the middle ages but the strongest flavor of the humor in such cases will come not from sympathy but more probably from triumphant egoism or intolerance at best it will be the love of the ludicrous exhibiting itself in illustrations of successful cunning and of the lex talionis as in reineke fuchs or shaking off in a holiday mood the yoke of a too exacting faith as in the old mysteries  again it is impossible to deny a high degree of humor to many practical jokes but no sympathetic nature can enjoy them  strange as the genealogy may seem the original parentage of that wonderful and delicious mixture of fun fancy philosophy and feeling which constitutes modern humor was probably the cruel mockery of a savage at the writhings of a suffering enemy—such is the tendency of things toward the good and beautiful on this earth probably the reason why high culture demands more complete harmony with its moral sympathies in humor than in wit is that humor is in its nature more prolix—that it has not the direct and irresistible force of wit wit is an electric shock which takes us by violence quite independently of our predominant mental disposition but humor approaches us more deliberately and leaves us masters of ourselves  hence it is that while coarse and cruel humor has almost disappeared from contemporary literature coarse and cruel wit abounds even refined men cannot help laughing at a coarse bon mot or a lacerating personality if the “shock” of the witticism is a powerful one while mere fun will have no power over them if it jar on their moral taste  hence too it is that while wit is perennial humor is liable to become superannuated  as is usual with definitions and classifications however this distinction between wit and humor does not exactly represent the actual fact  like all other species wit and humor overlap and blend with each other  there are bon mots like many of charles lamb’s which are a sort of facetious hybrids we hardly know whether to call them witty or humorous there are rather lengthy descriptions or narratives which like voltaire’s “micromégas” would be more humorous if they were not so sparkling and antithetic so pregnant with suggestion and satire that we are obliged to call them witty  we rarely find wit untempered by humor or humor without a spice of wit and sometimes we find them both united in the highest degree in the same mind as in shakespeare and molière  a happy conjunction this for wit is apt to be cold and thinlipped and mephistophelean in men who have no relish for humor whose lungs do never crow like chanticleer at fun and drollery and broadfaced rollicking humor needs the refining influence of wit  indeed it may be said that there is no really fine writing in which wit has not an implicit if not an explicit action  the wit may never rise to the surface it may never flame out into a witticism but it helps to give brightness and transparency it warns off from flights and exaggerations which verge on the ridiculous—in every genre of writing it preserves a man from sinking into the genre ennuyeux  and it is eminently needed for this office in humorous writing for as humor has no limits imposed on it by its material no law but its own exuberance it is apt to become preposterous and wearisome unless checked by wit which is the enemy of all monotony of all lengthiness of all exaggeration  perhaps the nearest approach nature has given us to a complete analysis in which wit is as thoroughly exhausted of humor as possible and humor as bare as possible of wit is in the typical frenchman and the typical german  voltaire the intensest example of pure wit fails in most of his fictions from his lack of humor  “micromégas” is a perfect tale because as it deals chiefly with philosophic ideas and does not touch the marrow of human feeling and life the writer’s wit and wisdom were allsufficient for his purpose  not so with “candide”  here voltaire had to give pictures of life as well as to convey philosophic truth and satire and here we feel the want of humor  the sense of the ludicrous is continually defeated by disgust and the scenes instead of presenting us with an amusing or agreeable picture are only the frame for a witticism  on the other hand german humor generally shows no sense of measure no instinctive tact it is either floundering and clumsy as the antics of a leviathan or laborious and interminable as a lapland day in which one loses all hope that the stars and quiet will ever come  for this reason jean paul the greatest of german humorists is unendurable to many readers and frequently tiresome to all  here as elsewhere the german shows the absence of that delicate perception that sensibility to gradation which is the essence of tact and taste and the necessary concomitant of wit  all his subtlety is reserved for the region of metaphysics  for identität in the abstract no one can have an acuter vision but in the concrete he is satisfied with a very loose approximation  he has the finest nose for empirismus in philosophical doctrine but the presence of more or less tobacco smoke in the air he breathes is imperceptible to him  to the typical german—vetter michel—it is indifferent whether his doorlock will catch whether his teacup be more or less than an inch thick whether or not his book have every other leaf unstitched whether his neighbor’s conversation be more or less of a shout whether he pronounce b or p t or d whether or not his adored one’s teeth be few and far between  he has the same sort of insensibility to gradations in time  a german comedy is like a german sentence you see no reason in its structure why it should ever come to an end and you accept the conclusion as an arrangement of providence rather than of the author  we have heard germans use the word langeweile the equivalent for ennui and we have secretly wondered what it can be that produces ennui in a german  not the longest of long tragedies for we have known him to pronounce that höchst fesselnd so enchaining not the heaviest of heavy books for he delights in that as gründlich deep sir deep not the slowest of journeys in a postwagen for the slower the horses the more cigars he can smoke before he reaches his journey’s end  german ennui must be something as superlative as barclay’s treble x which we suppose implies an extremely unknown quantity of stupefaction  it is easy to see that this national deficiency in nicety of perception must have its effect on the national appreciation and exhibition of humor  you find in germany ardent admirers of shakespeare who tell you that what they think most admirable in him is his wortspiel his verbal quibbles and one of these a man of no slight culture and refinement once cited to a friend of ours proteus’s joke in “the two gentlemen of verona”—“nod i why that’s noddy” as a transcendant specimen of shakespearian wit  german facetiousness is seldom comic to foreigners and an englishman with a swelled cheek might take up kladderadatsch the german punch without any danger of agitating his facial muscles indeed it is a remarkable fact that among the five great races concerned in modern civilization the german race is the only one which up to the present century had contributed nothing classic to the common stock of european wit and humor for reineke fuchs cannot be regarded as a peculiarly teutonic product  italy was the birthplace of pantomime and the immortal pulcinello spain had produced cervantes france had produced rabelais and molière and classic wits innumerable england had yielded shakspeare and a host of humorists  but germany had borne no great comic dramatist no great satirist and she has not yet repaired the omission she had not even produced any humorist of a high order among her great writers lessing is the one who is the most specifically witty  we feel the implicit influence of wit—the “flavor of mind”—throughout his writings and it is often concentrated into pungent satire as every reader of the hamburgische dramaturgie remembers still lessing’s name has not become european through his wit and his charming comedy minna von barnhelm has won no place on a foreign stage  of course we do not pretend to an exhaustive acquaintance with german literature we not only admit—we are sure that it includes much comic writing of which we know nothing  we simply state the fact that no german production of that kind before the present century ranked as european a fact which does not indeed determine the amount of the national facetiousness but which is quite decisive as to its quality whatever may be the stock of fun which germany yields for home consumption she has provided little for the palate of other lands  all honor to her for the still greater things she has done for us  she has fought the hardest fight for freedom of thought has produced the grandest inventions has made magnificent contributions to science has given us some of the divinest poetry and quite the divinest music in the world  no one reveres and treasures the products of the german mind more than we do  to say that that mind is not fertile in wit is only like saying that excellent wheat land is not rich pasture to say that we do not enjoy german facetiousness is no more than to say that though the horse is the finest of quadrupeds we do not like him to lay his hoof playfully on our shoulder  still as we have noticed that the pointless puns and stupid jocularity of the boy may ultimately be developed into the epigrammatic brilliancy and polished playfulness of the man as we believe that racy wit and chastened delicate humor are inevitably the results of invigorated and refined mental activity we can also believe that germany will one day yield a crop of wits and humorists  perhaps there is already an earnest of that future crop in the existence of heinrich heine a german born with the present century who to teutonic imagination sensibility and humor adds an amount of esprit that would make him brilliant among the most brilliant of frenchmen true this unique german wit is half a hebrew but he and his ancestors spent their youth in german air and were reared on wurst and sauerkraut so that he is as much a german as a pheasant is an english bird or a potato an irish vegetable  but whatever else he may be heine is one of the most remarkable men of this age no echo but a real voice and therefore like all genuine things in this world worth studying a surpassing lyric poet who has uttered our feelings for us in delicious song a humorist who touches leaden folly with the magic wand of his fancy and transmutes it into the fine gold of art—who sheds his sunny smile on human tears and makes them a beauteous rainbow on the cloudy background of life a wit who holds in his mighty hand the most scorching lightnings of satire an artist in prose literature who has shown even more completely than goethe the possibilities of german prose and—in spite of all charges against him true as well as false—a lover of freedom who has spoken wise and brave words on behalf of his fellowmen he is moreover a suffering man who with all the highlywrought sensibility of genius has to endure terrible physical ills and as such he calls forth more than an intellectual interest  it is true alas that there is a heavy weight in the other scale—that heine’s magnificent powers have often served only to give electric force to the expression of debased feeling so that his works are no phidian statue of gold and ivory and gems but have not a little brass and iron and miry clay mingled with the precious metal  the audacity of his occasional coarseness and personality is unparalleled in contemporary literature and has hardly been exceeded by the license of former days  hence before his volumes are put within the reach of immature minds there is need of a friendly penknife to exercise a strict censorship  yet when all coarseness all scurrility all mephistophelean contempt for the reverent feelings of other men is removed there will be a plenteous remainder of exquisite poetry of wit humor and just thought  it is apparently too often a congenial task to write severe words about the transgressions committed by men of genius especially when the censor has the advantage of being himself a man of no genius so that those transgressions seem to him quite gratuitous he forsooth never lacerated any one by his wit or gave irresistible piquancy to a coarse allusion and his indignation is not mitigated by any knowledge of the temptation that lies in transcendent power  we are also apt to measure what a gifted man has done by our arbitrary conception of what he might have done rather than by a comparison of his actual doings with our own or those of other ordinary men  we make ourselves overzealous agents of heaven and demand that our brother should bring usurious interest for his five talents forgetting that it is less easy to manage five talents than two  whatever benefit there may be in denouncing the evil it is after all more edifying and certainly more cheering to appreciate the good  hence in endeavoring to give our readers some account of heine and his works we shall not dwell lengthily on his failings we shall not hold the candle up to dusty verminhaunted corners but let the light fall as much as possible on the nobler and more attractive details  our sketch of heine’s life which has been drawn from various sources will be free from everything like intrusive gossip and will derive its coloring chiefly from the autobiographical hints and descriptions scattered through his own writings  those of our readers who happen to know nothing of heine will in this way be making their acquaintance with the writer while they are learning the outline of his career  we have said that heine was born with the present century but this statement is not precise for we learn that according to his certificate of baptism he was born december 12th 1799  however as he himself says the important point is that he was born and born on the banks of the rhine at düsseldorf where his father was a merchant  in his “reisebilder” he gives us some recollections in his wild poetic way of the dear old town where he spent his childhood and of his schoolboy troubles there  we shall quote from these in butterfly fashion sipping a little nectar here and there without regard to any strict order      “i first saw the light on the banks of that lovely stream where     folly grows on the green hills and in autumn is plucked pressed     poured into casks and sent into foreign lands  believe me i     yesterday heard some one utter folly which in anno 1811 lay in a     bunch of grapes i then saw growing on the johannisberg    mon     dieu if i had only such faith in me that i could remove mountains     the johannisberg would be the very mountain i should send for     wherever i might be but as my faith is not so strong imagination     must help me and it transports me at once to the lovely rhine        i am again a child and playing with other children on the     schlossplatz at düsseldorf on the rhine  yes madam there was i     born and i note this expressly in case after my death seven     cities—schilda krähwinkel polkwitz bockum dülken göttingen and     schöppenstädt—should contend for the honor of being my birthplace     düsseldorf is a town on the rhine sixteen thousand men live there     and many hundred thousand men besides lie buried there     among     them many of whom my mother says that it would be better if they     were still living for example my grandfather and my uncle the old     herr von geldern and the young herr von geldern both such celebrated     doctors who saved so many men from death and yet must die     themselves  and the pious ursula who carried me in her arms when i     was a child also lies buried there and a rosebush grows on her     grave she loved the scent of roses so well in life and her heart     was pure roseincense and goodness  the knowing old canon too lies     buried there  heavens what an object he looked when i last saw him     he was made up of nothing but mind and plasters and nevertheless     studied day and night as if he were alarmed lest the worms should     find an idea too little in his head  and the little william lies     there and for this i am to blame  we were schoolfellows in the     franciscan monastery and were playing on that side of it where the     düssel flows between stone walls and i said ‘william fetch out the     kitten that has just fallen in’—and merrily he went down on to the     plank which lay across the brook snatched the kitten out of the     water but fell in himself and was dragged out dripping and dead     the kitten lived to a good old age    princes in that day were     not the tormented race as they are now the crown grew firmly on     their heads and at night they drew a nightcap over it and slept     peacefully and peacefully slept the people at their feet and when     the people waked in the morning they said ‘good morning father’     and the princes answered ‘good morning dear children’  but it was     suddenly quite otherwise for when we awoke one morning at     düsseldorf and were ready to say ‘good morning father’ lo the     father was gone away and in the whole town there was nothing but     dumb sorrow everywhere a sort of funeral disposition and people     glided along silently to the market and read the long placard placed     on the door of the town hall  it was dismal weather yet the lean     tailor kilian stood in his nankeen jacket which he usually wore     only in the house and his blue worsted stockings hung down so that     his naked legs peeped out mournfully and his thin lips trembled     while he muttered the announcement to himself  and an old soldier     read rather louder and at many a word a crystal tear trickled down     to his brave old mustache  i stood near him and wept in company and     asked him ‘why we wept’  he answered ‘the elector has     abdicated’  and then he read again and at the words ‘for the     longmanifested fidelity of my subjects’ and ‘hereby set you free     from your allegiance’ he wept more than ever  it is strangely     touching to see an old man like that with faded uniform and scarred     face weep so bitterly all of a sudden  while we were reading the     electoral arms were taken down from the town hall everything had     such a desolate air that it was as if an eclipse of the sun were     expected    i went home and wept and wailed out ‘the elector     has abdicated’  in vain my mother took a world of trouble to explain     the thing to me  i knew what i knew i was not to be persuaded but     went crying to bed and in the night dreamed that the world was at an     end”  the next morning however the sun rises as usual and joachim murat is proclaimed grand duke whereupon there is a holiday at the public school and heinrich or harry for that was his baptismal name which he afterward had the good taste to change perched on the bronze horse of the electoral statue sees quite a different scene from yesterday’s      “the next day the world was again all in order and we had school as     before and things were got by heart as before—the roman emperors     chronology the nouns in im the verba irregularia greek     hebrew geography mental arithmetic—heavens my head is still dizzy     with it—all must be learned by heart  and a great deal of this came     very conveniently for me in after life  for if i had not known the     roman kings by heart it would subsequently have been quite     indifferent to me whether niebuhr had proved or had not proved that     they never really existed    but oh the trouble i had at school     with the endless dates  and with arithmetic it was still worse     what i understood best was subtraction for that has a very practical     rule ‘four can’t be taken from three therefore i must borrow one’     but i advise every one in such a case to borrow a few extra pence     for no one can tell what may happen    as for latin you have no     idea madam what a complicated affair it is  the romans would never     have found time to conquer the world if they had first had to learn     latin  luckily for them they already knew in their cradles what     nouns have their accusative in im  i on the contrary had to     learn them by heart in the sweat of my brow nevertheless it is     fortunate for me that i know them    and the fact that i have them     at my fingerends if i should ever happen to want them suddenly     affords me much inward repose and consolation in many troubled hours     of life    of greek i will not say a word i should get too much     irritated  the monks in the middle ages were not so far wrong when     they maintained that greek was an invention of the devil  god knows     the suffering i endured over it    with hebrew it went somewhat     better for i had always a great liking for the jews though to this     very hour they crucify my good name but i could never get on so far     in hebrew as my watch which had much familiar intercourse with     pawnbrokers and in this way contracted many jewish habits—for     example it wouldn’t go on saturdays”  heine’s parents were apparently not wealthy but his education was cared for by his uncle solomon heine a great banker in hamburg so that he had no early pecuniary disadvantages to struggle with  he seems to have been very happy in his mother who was not of hebrew but of teutonic blood he often mentions her with reverence and affection and in the “buch der lieder” there are two exquisite sonnets addressed to her which tell how his proud spirit was always subdued by the charm of her presence and how her love was the home of his heart after restless weary ramblings      “wie mächtig auch mein stolzer muth sich blähe     in deiner selig süssen trauten nahe     ergreift mich oft ein demuthvolles zagen                und immer irrte ich naeh liebe immer     nach liebe doch die liebe fand ich nimmer     und kehrte um nach hause krank und trübe     doch da bist du entgegen mir gekommen     und ach was da in deinem aug’ geschwommen     das war die süsse langgesuchte liebe”  he was at first destined for a mercantile life but nature declared too strongly against this plan  “god knows” he has lately said in conversation with his brother “i would willingly have become a banker but i could never bring myself to that pass  i very early discerned that bankers would one day be the rulers of the world”  so commerce was at length given up for law the study of which he began in 1819 at the university of bonn  he had already published some poems in the corner of a newspaper and among them was one on napoleon the object of his youthful enthusiasm  this poem he says in a letter to st réné taillandier was written when he was only sixteen  it is still to be found in the “buch der lieder” under the title “die grenadiere” and it proves that even in its earliest efforts his genius showed a strongly specific character  it will be easily imagined that the germs of poetry sprouted too vigorously in heine’s brain for jurisprudence to find much room there lectures on history and literature we are told were more diligently attended than lectures on law  he had taken care too to furnish his trunk with abundant editions of the poets and the poet he especially studied at that time was byron  at a later period we find his taste taking another direction for he writes “of all authors byron is precisely the one who excites in me the most intolerable emotion whereas scott in every one of his works gladdens my heart soothes and invigorates me”  another indication of his bent in these bonn days was a newspaper essay in which he attacked the romantic school and here also he went through that chickenpox of authorship—the production of a tragedy  heine’s tragedy—almansor—is as might be expected better than the majority of these youthful mistakes  the tragic collision lies in the conflict between natural affection and the deadly hatred of religion and of race—in the sacrifice of youthful lovers to the strife between moor and spaniard moslem and christian  some of the situations are striking and there are passages of considerable poetic merit but the characters are little more than shadowy vehicles for the poetry and there is a want of clearness and probability in the structure  it was published two years later in company with another tragedy in one act called william ratcliffe in which there is rather a feeble use of the scotch secondsight after the manner of the fate in the greek tragedy we smile to find heine saying of his tragedies in a letter to a friend soon after their publication “i know they will be terribly cut up but i will confess to you in confidence that they are very good better than my collection of poems which are not worth a shot”  elsewhere he tells us that when after one of paganini’s concerts he was passionately complimenting the great master on his violinplaying  paganini interrupted him thus “but how were you pleased with my bows”  in 1820 heine left bonn for göttingen  he there pursued his omission of law studies and at the end of three months he was rusticated for a breach of the laws against duelling  while there he had attempted a negotiation with brockhaus for the printing of a volume of poems and had endured the first ordeal of lovers and poets—a refusal  it was not until a year after that he found a berlin publisher for his first volume of poems subsequently transformed with additions into the “buch der lieder”  he remained between two and three years at berlin and the society he found there seems to have made these years an important epoch in his culture  he was one of the youngest members of a circle which assembled at the house of the poetess elise von hohenhausen the translator of byron—a circle which included chamisso varnhagen and rahel varnhagen’s wife  for rahel heine had a profound admiration and regard he afterward dedicated to her the poems included under the tide “heimkehr” and he frequently refers to her or quotes her in a way that indicates how he valued her influence  according to his friend f von hohenhausen the opinions concerning heine’s talent were very various among his berlin friends and it was only a small minority that had any presentiment of his future fame  in this minority was elise von hohenhausen who proclaimed heine as the byron of germany but her opinion was met with much headshaking and opposition  we can imagine how precious was such a recognition as hers to the young poet then only two or three and twenty and with by no means an impressive personality for superficial eyes  perhaps even the deepsighted were far from detecting in that small blonde pale young man with quiet gentle manners the latent powers of ridicule and sarcasm—the terrible talons that were one day to be thrust out from the velvet paw of the young leopard  it was apparently during this residence in berlin that heine united himself with the lutheran church  he would willingly like many of his friends he tells us have remained free from all ecclesiastical ties if the authorities there had not forbidden residence in prussia and especially in berlin to every one who did not belong to one of the positive religions recognized by the state      “as henry iv once laughingly said ‘paris vaut bien une messe’ so     i might with reason say ‘berlin vaut bien une prêche’ and i could     afterward as before accommodate myself to the very enlightened     christianity filtrated from all superstition which could then be     had in the churches of berlin and which was even free from the     divinity of christ like turtlesoup without turtle”  at the same period too heine became acquainted with hegel  in his lately published “geständnisse” confessions he throws on hegel’s influence over him the blue light of demoniacal wit and confounds us by the most bewildering doubleedged sarcasms but that influence seems to have been at least more wholesome than the one which produced the mocking retractations of the “geständnisse”  through all his selfsatire we discern that in those days he had something like real earnestness and enthusiasm which are certainly not apparent in his present theistic confession of faith      “on the whole i never felt a strong enthusiasm for this philosophy     and conviction on the subject was out of question  i never was an     abstract thinker and i accepted the synthesis of the hegelian     doctrine without demanding any proof since its consequences     flattered my vanity  i was young and proud and it pleased my     vainglory when i learned from hegel that the true god was not as my     grandmother believed the god who lives in heaven but myself here     upon earth  this foolish pride had not in the least a pernicious     influence on my feelings on the contrary it heightened these to the     pitch of heroism  i was at that time so lavish in generosity and     selfsacrifice that i must assuredly have eclipsed the most brilliant     deeds of those good bourgeois of virtue who acted merely from a     sense of duty and simply obeyed the laws of morality”  his sketch of hegel is irresistibly amusing but we must warn the reader that heine’s anecdotes are often mere devices of style by which he conveys his satire or opinions  the reader will see that he does not neglect an opportunity of giving a sarcastic lash or two in passing to meyerbeer for whose music he has a great contempt  the sarcasm conveyed in the substitution of reputation for music and journalists for musicians might perhaps escape any one unfamiliar with the sly and unexpected turns of heine’s ridicule      “to speak frankly i seldom understood him and only arrived at the     meaning of his words by subsequent reflection  i believe he wished     not to be understood and hence his practice of sprinkling his     discourse with modifying parentheses hence perhaps his preference     for persons of whom he knew that they did not understand him and to     whom he all the more willingly granted the honor of his familiar     acquaintance  thus every one in berlin wondered at the intimate     companionship of the profound hegel with the late heinrich beer a     brother of giacomo meyerbeer who is universally known by his     reputation and who has been celebrated by the cleverest journalists     this beer namely heinrich was a thoroughly stupid fellow and     indeed was afterward actually declared imbecile by his family and     placed under guardianship because instead of making a name for     himself in art or in science by means of his great fortune he     squandered his money on childish trifles and for example one day     bought six thousand thalers’ worth of walkingsticks  this poor man     who had no wish to pass either for a great tragic dramatist or for a     great stargazer or for a laurelcrowned musical genius a rival of     mozart and rossini and preferred giving his money for     walkingsticks—this degenerate beer enjoyed hegel’s most confidential     society he was the philosopher’s bosom friend his pylades and     accompanied him everywhere like his shadow  the equally witty and     gifted felix mendelssohn once sought to explain this phenomenon by     maintaining that hegel did not understand heinrich beer  i now     believe however that the real ground of that intimacy consisted in     this—hegel was convinced that no word of what he said was understood     by heinrich beer and he could therefore in his presence give     himself up to all the intellectual outpourings of the moment  in     general hegel’s conversation was a sort of monologue sighed forth     by starts in a noiseless voice the odd roughness of his expressions     often struck me and many of them have remained in my memory  one     beautiful starlight evening we stood together at the window and i a     young man of oneandtwenty having just had a good dinner and     finished my coffee spoke with enthusiasm of the stars and called     them the habitations of the departed  but the master muttered to     himself ‘the stars hum hum  the stars are only a brilliant     leprosy on the face of the heavens’  ‘for god’s sake’ i cried ‘is     there then no happy place above where virtue is rewarded after     death’  but he staring at me with his pale eyes said cuttingly     ‘so you want a bonus for having taken care of your sick mother and     refrained from poisoning your worthy brother’  at these words he     looked anxiously round but appeared immediately set at rest when he     observed that it was only heinrich beer who had approached to invite     him to a game at whist”  in 1823 heine returned to göttingen to complete his career as a lawstudent and this time he gave evidence of advanced mental maturity not only by producing many of the charming poems subsequently included in the “reisebilder” but also by prosecuting his professional studies diligently enough to leave göttingen in 1825 as doctor juris hereupon he settled at hamburg as an advocate but his profession seems to have been the least pressing of his occupations  in those days a small blonde young man with the brim of his hat drawn over his nose his coat flying open and his hands stuck in his trousers pockets might be seen stumbling along the streets of hamburg staring from side to side and appearing to have small regard to the figure he made in the eyes of the good citizens  occasionally an inhabitant more literary than usual would point out this young man to his companion as heinrich heine but in general the young poet had not to endure the inconveniences of being a lion  his poems were devoured but he was not asked to devour flattery in return  whether because the fair hamburgers acted in the spirit of johnson’s advice to hannah more—to “consider what her flattery was worth before she choked him with it”—or for some other reason heine according to the testimony of august lewald to whom we owe these particulars of his hamburg life was left free from the persecution of teaparties not however from another persecution of genius—nervous headaches which some persons we are told regarded as an improbable fiction intended as a pretext for raising a delicate white hand to his forehead  it is probable that the sceptical persons alluded to were themselves untroubled with nervous headaches and that their hands were not delicate  slight details these but worth telling about a man of genius because they help us to keep in mind that he is after all our brother having to endure the petty everyday ills of life as we have with this difference that his heightened sensibility converts what are mere insect stings for us into scorpion stings for him  it was perhaps in these hamburg days that heine paid the visit to goethe of which he gives us this charming little picture      “when i visited him in weimar and stood before him i involuntarily     glanced at his side to see whether the eagle was not there with the     lightning in his beak  i was nearly speaking greek to him but as i     observed that he understood german i stated to him in german that     the plums on the road between jena and weimar were very good  i had     for so many long winter nights thought over what lofty and profound     things i would say to goethe if ever i saw him  and when i saw him     at last i said to him that the saxon plums were very good  and     goethe smiled”  during the next few years heine produced the most popular of all his works—those which have won him his place as the greatest of living german poets and humorists  between 1826 and 1829 appeared the four volumes of the “reisebilder” pictures of travel and the “buch der lieder” book of songs a volume of lyrics of which it is hard to say whether their greatest charm is the lightness and finish of their style their vivid and original imaginativeness or their simple pure sensibility  in his “reisebilder” heine carries us with him to the hartz to the isle of norderney to his native town düsseldorf to italy and to england sketching scenery and character now with the wildest most fantastic humor now with the finest idyllic sensibility—letting his thoughts wander from poetry to politics from criticism to dreamy reverie and blending fun imagination reflection and satire in a sort of exquisite evervarying shimmer like the hues of the opal  heine’s journey to england did not at all heighten his regard for the english  he calls our language the “hiss of egoism zischlaute des egoismus and his ridicule of english awkwardness is as merciless as—english ridicule of german awkwardness  his antipathy toward us seems to have grown in intensity like many of his other antipathies and in his “vermischte schriften” he is more bitter than ever  let us quote one of his philippics since bitters are understood to be wholesome      “it is certainly a frightful injustice to pronounce sentence of     condemnation on an entire people  but with regard to the english     momentary disgust might betray me into this injustice and on looking     at the mass i easily forget the many brave and noble men who     distinguished themselves by intellect and love of freedom  but     these especially the british poets were always all the more     glaringly in contrast with the rest of the nation they were isolated     martyrs to their national relations and besides great geniuses do     not belong to the particular land of their birth they scarcely     belong to this earth the golgotha of their sufferings  the mass—the     english blockheads god forgive me—are hateful to me in my inmost     soul and i often regard them not at all as my fellowmen but as     miserable automata—machines whose motive power is egoism  in these     moods it seems to me as if i heard the whizzing wheelwork by which     they think feel reckon digest and pray their praying their     mechanical anglican churchgoing with the gilt prayerbook under     their arms their stupid tiresome sunday their awkward piety is     most of all odious to me  i am firmly convinced that a blaspheming     frenchman is a more pleasing sight for the divinity than a praying     englishman”  on his return from england heine was employed at munich in editing the allgemeinen politischen annalen but in 1830 he was again in the north and the news of the july revolution surprised him on the island of heligoland  he has given us a graphic picture of his democratic enthusiasm in those days in some letters apparently written from heligoland which he has inserted in his book on börne  we quote some passages not only for their biographic interest as showing a phase of heine’s mental history but because they are a specimen of his power in that kind of dithyrambic writing which in less masterly hands easily becomes ridiculous      “the thick packet of newspapers arrived from the continent with these     warm glowinghot tidings  they were sunbeams wrapped up in     packingpaper and they inflamed my soul till it burst into the     wildest conflagration    it is all like a dream to me especially     the name lafayette sounds to me like a legend out of my earliest     childhood  does he really sit again on horseback commanding the     national guard  i almost fear it may not be true for it is in     print  i will myself go to paris to be convinced of it with my     bodily eyes    it must be splendid when he rides through the     street the citizen of two worlds the godlike old man with his     silver locks streaming down his sacred shoulder    he greets     with his dear old eyes the grandchildren of those who once fought     with him for freedom and equality    it is now sixty years since     he returned from america with the declaration of human rights the     decalogue of the world’s new creed which was revealed to him amid     the thunders and lightnings of cannon    and the tricolored flag     waves again on the towers of paris and its streets resound with the     marseillaise    it is all over with my yearning for repose  i     now know again what i will do what i ought to do what i must do        i am the son of the revolution and seize again the hallowed     weapons on which my mother pronounced her magic benediction        flowers flowers i will crown my head for the deathfight  and the     lyre too reach me the lyre that i may sing a battlesong        words like flaming stars that shoot down from the heavens and burn     up the palaces and illuminate the huts    words like bright     javelins that whirr up to the seventh heaven and strike the pious     hypocrites who have skulked into the holy of holies    i am all     joy and song all sword and flame  perhaps too all delirium        one of those sunbeams wrapped in brown paper has flown to my brain     and set my thoughts aglow  in vain i dip my head into the sea  no     water extinguishes this greek fire    even the poor heligolanders     shout for joy although they have only a sort of dim instinct of what     has occurred  the fisherman who yesterday took me over to the little     sand island which is the bathingplace here said to me smilingly     ‘the poor people have won’  yes instinctively the people comprehend     such events perhaps better than we with all our means of     knowledge  thus frau von varnhagen once told me that when the issue     of the battle of leipzig was not yet known the maidservant suddenly     rushed into the room with the sorrowful cry ‘the nobles have won’        this morning another packet of newspapers is come i devour them     like manna  child that i am affecting details touch me yet more     than the momentous whole  oh if i could but see the dog medor        the dog medor brought his master his gun and cartridgebox and     when his master fell and was buried with his fellowheroes in the     court of the louvre there stayed the poor dog like a monument of     faithfulness sitting motionless on the grave day and night eating     but little of the food that was offered him—burying the greater part     of it in the earth perhaps as nourishment for his buried master”  the enthusiasm which was kept thus at boiling heat by imagination cooled down rapidly when brought into contact with reality  in the same book be indicates in his caustic way the commencement of that change in his political temperature—for it cannot be called a change in opinion—which has drawn down on him immense vituperation from some of the patriotic party but which seems to have resulted simply from the essential antagonism between keen wit and fanaticism      “on the very first days of my arrival in paris i observed that things     wore in reality quite different colors from those which had been     shed on them when in perspective by the light of my enthusiasm     the silver locks which i saw fluttering so majestically on the     shoulders of lafayette the hero of two worlds were metamorphosed     into a brown perruque which made a pitiable covering for a narrow     skull  and even the dog medor which i visited in the court of the     louvre and which encamped under tricolored flags and trophies very     quietly allowed himself to be fed—he was not at all the right dog     but quite an ordinary brute who assumed to himself merits not his     own as often happens with the french and like many others he made     a profit out of the glory of the revolution     he was pampered     and patronized perhaps promoted to the highest posts while the true     medor some days after the battle modestly slunk out of sight like     the true people who created the revolution”  that it was not merely interest in french politics which sent heine to paris in 1831 but also a perception that german air was not friendly to sympathizers in july revolutions is humorously intimated in the “geständnisse”      “i had done much and suffered much and when the sun of the july     revolution arose in france i had become very weary and needed some     recreation  also my native air was every day more unhealthy for me     and it was time i should seriously think of a change of climate  i     had visions the clouds terrified me and made all sorts of ugly     faces at me  it often seemed to me as if the sun were a prussian     cockade at night i dreamed of a hideous black eagle which gnawed my     liver and i was very melancholy  add to this i had become     acquainted with an old berlin justizrath who had spent many years in     the fortress of spandau and he related to me how unpleasant it is     when one is obliged to wear irons in winter  for myself i thought it     very unchristian that the irons were not warmed a trifle  if the     irons were warmed a little for us they would not make so unpleasant     an impression and even chilly natures might then bear them very     well it would be only proper consideration too if the fetters were     perfumed with essence of roses and laurels as is the case in this     country france  i asked my justizrath whether he often got oysters     to eat at spandau  he said no spandau was too far from the sea     moreover he said meat was very scarce there and there was no kind     of volaille except flies which fell into one’s soup    now as     i really needed some recreation and as spandau is too far from the     sea for oysters to be got there and the spandau flysoup did not     seem very appetizing to me as besides all this the prussian chains     are very cold in winter and could not be conducive to my health i     resolved to visit paris”  since this time paris has been heine’s home and his best prose works have been written either to inform the germans on french affairs or to inform the french on german philosophy and literature  he became a correspondent of the allgemeine zeitung and his correspondence which extends with an interruption of several years from 1831 to 1844 forms the volume entitled “französische zustände” french affairs and the second and third volume of his “vermischte schriften”  it is a witty and often wise commentary on public men and public events louis philippe casimir périer thiers guizot rothschild the catholic party the socialist party have their turn of satire and appreciation for heine deals out both with an impartiality which made his less favorable critics—börne for example—charge him with the rather incompatible sins of reckless caprice and venality  literature and art alternate with politics we have now a sketch of george sand or a description of one of horace vernet’s pictures now a criticism of victor hugo or of liszt now an irresistible caricature of spontini or kalkbrenner and occasionally the predominant satire is relieved by a fine saying or a genial word of admiration  and all is done with that airy lightness yet precision of touch which distinguishes heine beyond any living writer  the charge of venality was loudly made against heine in germany first it was said that he was paid to write then that he was paid to abstain from writing and the accusations were supposed to have an irrefragable basis in the fact that he accepted a stipend from the french government  he has never attempted to conceal the reception of that stipend and we think his statement in the “vermischte schriften” of the circumstances under which it was offered and received is a sufficient vindication of himself and m guizot from any dishonor in the matter  it may be readily imagined that heine with so large a share of the gallic element as he has in his composition was soon at his ease in parisian society and the years here were bright with intellectual activity and social enjoyment  “his wit” wrote august lewald “is a perpetual gushing fountain he throws off the most delicious descriptions with amazing facility and sketches the most comic characters in conversations”  such a man could not be neglected in paris and heine was sought on all sides—as a guest in distinguished salons as a possible proselyte in the circle of the saint simonians  his literary productiveness seems to have been furthered by his congenial life which however was soon to some extent embittered by the sense of exile for since 1835 both his works and his person have been the object of denunciation by the german governments  between 1833 and 1845 appeared the four volumes of the “salon” “die romantische schule” both written in the first instance in french the book on börne “atta troll” a romantic poem “deutschland” an exquisitely humorous poem describing his last visit to germany and containing some grand passages of serious writing and the “neue gedichte” a collection of lyrical poems  among the most interesting of his prose works are the second volume of the “salon” which contains a survey of religion and philosophy in germany and the “romantische schule” a delightful introduction to that phase of german literature known as the romantic school  the book on börne which appeared in 1840 two years after the death of that writer excited great indignation in germany as a wreaking of vengeance on the dead an insult to the memory of a man who had worked and suffered in the cause of freedom—a cause which was heine’s own  börne we may observe parenthetically for the information of those who are not familiar with recent german literature was a remarkable political writer of the ultraliberal party in germany who resided in paris at the same time with heine a man of stern uncompromising partisanship and bitter humor without justifying heine’s production of this book we see excuses for him which should temper the condemnation passed on it  there was a radical opposition of nature between him and börne to use his own distinction heine is a hellene—sensuous realistic exquisitely alive to the beautiful while börne was a nazarene—ascetic spiritualistic despising the pure artist as destitute of earnestness  heine has too keen a perception of practical absurdities and damaging exaggerations ever to become a thoroughgoing partisan and with a love of freedom a faith in the ultimate triumph of democratic principles of which we see no just reason to doubt the genuineness and consistency he has been unable to satisfy more zealous and onesided liberals by giving his adhesion to their views and measures or by adopting a denunciatory tone against those in the opposite ranks  börne could not forgive what he regarded as heine’s epicurean indifference and artistic dalliance and he at length gave vent to his antipathy in savage attacks on him through the press accusing him of utterly lacking character and principle and even of writing under the influence of venal motives  to these attacks heine remained absolutely mute—from contempt according to his own account but the retort which he resolutely refrained from making during börne’s life comes in this volume published after his death with the concentrated force of longgathering thunder  the utterly inexcusable part of the book is the caricature of börne’s friend madame wohl and the scurrilous insinuations concerning börne’s domestic life  it is said we know not with how much truth that heine had to answer for these in a duel with madame wohl’s husband and that after receiving a serious wound he promised to withdraw the offensive matter from a future edition  that edition however has not been called for  whatever else we may think of the book it is impossible to deny its transcendent talent—the dramatic vigor with which börne is made present to us the critical acumen with which he is characterized and the wonderful play of wit pathos and thought which runs through the whole  but we will let heine speak for himself and first we will give part of his graphic description of the way in which börne’s mind and manners grated on his taste      “to the disgust which in intercourse with börne i was in danger of     feeling toward those who surrounded him was added the annoyance i     felt from his perpetual talk about politics  nothing but political     argument and again political argument even at table where he     managed to hunt me out  at dinner when i so gladly forget all the     vexations of the world he spoiled the best dishes for me by his     patriotic gall which he poured as a bitter sauce over everything     calf’s feet à la maître d’hôtel then my innocent bonne bouche     he completely spoiled for me by job’s tidings from germany which he     scraped together out of the most unreliable newspapers  and then his     accursed remarks which spoiled one’s appetite    this was a sort     of tabletalk which did not greatly exhilarate me and i avenged     myself by affecting an excessive almost impassioned indifference for     the object of börne’s enthusiasm  for example börne was indignant     that immediately on my arrival in paris i had nothing better to do     than to write for german papers a long account of the exhibition of     pictures  i omit all discussion as to whether that interest in art     which induced me to undertake this work was so utterly irreconcilable     with the revolutionary interests of the day but börne saw in it a     proof of my indifference toward the sacred cause of humanity and i     could in my turn spoil the taste of his patriotic sauerkraut for     him by talking all dinnertime of nothing but pictures of robert’s     ‘reapers’ horace vernet’s ‘judith’ and scheffer’s ‘faust’        that i never thought it worth while to discuss my political     principles with him it is needless to say and once when he declared     that he had found a contradiction in my writings i satisfied myself     with the ironical answer ‘you are mistaken mon cher such     contradictions never occur in my works for always before i begin to     write i read over the statement of my political principles in my     previous writings that i may not contradict myself and that no one     may be able to reproach me with apostasy from my liberal     principles’”  and here is his own account of the spirit in which the book was written      “i was never börne’s friend nor was i ever his enemy  the     displeasure which he could often excite in me was never very     important and he atoned for it sufficiently by the cold silence     which i opposed to all his accusations and raillery  while he lived     i wrote not a line against him i never thought about him i ignored     him completely and that enraged him beyond measure  if i now speak     of him i do so neither out of enthusiasm nor out of uneasiness i am     conscious of the coolest impartiality  i write here neither an     apology nor a critique and as in painting the man i go on my own     observation the image i present of him ought perhaps to be regarded     as a real portrait  and such a monument is due to him—to the great     wrestler who in the arena of our political games wrestled so     courageously and earned if not the laurel certainly the crown of     oak leaves  i give an image with his true features without     idealization—the more like him the more honorable for his memory  he     was neither a genius nor a hero he was no olympian god  he was a     man a denizen of this earth he was a good writer and a great     patriot    beautiful delicious peace which i feel at this     moment in the depths of my soul  thou rewardest me sufficiently for     everything i have done and for everything i have despised    i     shall defend myself neither from the reproach of indifference nor     from the suspicion of venality  i have for years during the life of     the insinuator held such selfjustification unworthy of me now even     decency demands silence  that would be a frightful     spectacle—polemics between death and exile  dost thou stretch out     to me a beseeching hand from the grave  without rancor i reach mine     toward thee    see how noble it is and pure  it was never soiled     by pressing the hands of the mob any more than by the impure gold of     the people’s enemy  in reality thou hast never injured me    in     all thy insinuations there is not a louis d’or’s worth of truth”  in one of these years heine was married and in deference to the sentiments of his wife married according to the rites of the catholic church  on this fact busy rumor afterward founded the story of his conversion to catholicism and could of course name the day and spot on which he abjured protestanism  in his “geständnisse” heine publishes a denial of this rumor less he says for the sake of depriving the catholics of the solace they may derive from their belief in a new convert than in order to cut off from another party the more spiteful satisfaction of bewailing his instability      “that statement of time and place was entirely correct  i was     actually on the specified day in the specified church which was     moreover a jesuit church namely st sulpice and i then went     through a religious act  but this act was no odious abjuration but     a very innocent conjugation that is to say my marriage already     performed according to the civil law there received the     ecclesiastical consecration because my wife whose family are     staunch catholics would not have thought her marriage sacred enough     without such a ceremony  and i would on no account cause this     beloved being any uneasiness or disturbance in her religious views”  for sixteen years—from 1831 to 1847—heine lived that rapid concentrated life which is known only in paris but then alas stole on the “days of darkness” and they were to be many  in 1847 he felt the approach of the terrible spinal disease which has for seven years chained him to his bed in acute suffering  the last time he went out of doors he tells us was in may 1848      “with difficulty i dragged myself to the louvre and i almost sank     down as i entered the magnificent hall where the everblessed goddess     of beauty our beloved lady of milo stands on her pedestal  at her     feet i lay long and wept so bitterly that a stone must have pitied     me  the goddess looked compassionately on me but at the same time     disconsolately as if she would say dost thou not see then that i     have no arms and thus cannot help thee”  since 1848 then this poet whom the lovely objects of nature have always “haunted like a passion” has not descended from the second story of a parisian house this man of hungry intellect has been shut out from all direct observation of life all contact with society except such as is derived from visitors to his sickroom  the terrible nervous disease has affected his eyes the sight of one is utterly gone and he can only raise the lid of the other by lifting it with his finger  opium alone is the beneficent genius that stills his pain  we hardly know whether to call it an alleviation or an intensification of the torture that heine retains his mental vigor his poetic imagination and his incisive wit for if this intellectual activity fills up a blank it widens the sphere of suffering  his brother described him in 1851 as still in moments when the hand of pain was not too heavy on him the same heinrich heine poet and satirist by turns  in such moments he would narrate the strangest things in the gravest manner  but when he came to an end he would roguishly lift up the lid of his right eye with his finger to see the impression he had produced and if his audience had been listening with a serious face he would break into homeric laughter  we have other proof than personal testimony that heine’s disease allows his genius to retain much of its energy in the “romanzero” a volume of poems published in 1851 and written chiefly during the three first years of his illness and in the first volume of the “vermischte schriften” also the product of recent years  very plaintive is the poet’s own description of his condition in the epilogue to the “romanzero”      “do i really exist  my body is so shrunken that i am hardly anything     but a voice and my bed reminds me of the singing grave of the     magician merlin which lies in the forest of brozeliand in brittany     under tall oaks whose tops soar like green flames toward heaven     alas  i envy thee those trees and the fresh breeze that moves their     branches brother merlin for no green leaf rustles about my     mattressgrave in paris where early and late i hear nothing but the     rolling of vehicles hammering quarrelling and pianostrumming  a     grave without repose death without the privileges of the dead who     have no debts to pay and need write neither letters nor books—that     is a piteous condition  long ago the measure has been taken for my     coffin and for my necrology but i die so slowly that the process is     tedious for me as well as my friends  but patience everything has     an end  you will one day find the booth closed where the puppetshow     of my humor has so often delighted you”  as early as 1850 it was rumored that since heine’s illness a change had taken place in his religious views and as rumor seldom stops short of extremes it was soon said that he had become a thorough pietist catholics and protestants by turns claiming him as a convert  such a change in so uncompromising an iconoclast in a man who had been so zealous in his negations as heine naturally excited considerable sensation in the camp he was supposed to have quitted as well as in that he was supposed to have joined  in the second volume of the “salon” and in the “romantische schule” written in 1834 and ’35 the doctrine of pantheism is dwelt on with a fervor and unmixed seriousness which show that pantheism was then an animating faith to heine and he attacks what he considers the false spiritualism and asceticism of christianity as the enemy of true beauty in art and of social wellbeing  now however it was said that heine had recanted all his heresies but from the fact that visitors to his sickroom brought away very various impressions as to his actual religious views it seemed probable that his love of mystification had found a tempting opportunity for exercise on this subject and that as one of his friends said he was not inclined to pour out unmixed wine to those who asked for a sample out of mere curiosity  at length in the epilogue to the “romanzero” dated 1851 there appeared amid much mystifying banter a declaration that he had embraced theism and the belief in a future life and what chiefly lent an air of seriousness and reliability to this affirmation was the fact that he took care to accompany it with certain negations      “as concerns myself i can boast of no particular progress in     politics i adhered after 1848 to the same democratic principles     which had the homage of my youth and for which i have ever since     glowed with increasing fervor  in theology on the contrary i must     accuse myself of retrogression since as i have already confessed i     returned to the old superstition—to a personal god  this fact is     once for all not to be stifled as many enlightened and wellmeaning     friends would fain have had it  but i must expressly contradict the     report that my retrograde movement has carried me as far as to the     threshold of a church and that i have even been received into her     lap  no my religions convictions and views have remained free from     any tincture of ecclesiasticism no chiming of bells has allured me     no altar candles have dazzled me  i have dallied with no dogmas and     have not utterly renounced my reason”  this sounds like a serious statement  but what shall we say to a convert who plays with his newlyacquired belief in a future life as heine does in the very next page  he says to his reader      “console thyself we shall meet again in a better world where i also     mean to write thee better books  i take for granted that my health     will there be improved and that swedenborg has not deceived me  he     relates namely with great confidence that we shall peacefully     carry on our old occupations in the other world just as we have done     in this that we shall there preserve our individuality unaltered     and that death will produce no particular change in our organic     development  swedenborg is a thoroughly honorable fellow and quite     worthy of credit in what he tells us about the other world where he     saw with his own eyes the persons who had played a great part on our     earth  most of them he says remained unchanged and busied     themselves with the same things as formerly they remained     stationary were oldfashioned rococo—which now and then produced     a ludicrous effect  for example our dear dr martin luther kept     fast by his doctrine of grace about which he had for three hundred     years daily written down the same mouldy arguments—just in the same     way as the late baron ekstein who during twenty years printed in the     allgemeine zeitung one and the same article perpetually chewing     over again the old cud of jesuitical doctrine  but as we have said     all persons who once figured here below were not found by swedenborg     in such a state of fossil immutability many had considerably     developed their character both for good and evil in the other     world and this gave rise to some singular results  some who had     been heroes and saints on earth had there sunk into scamps and     goodfornothings and there were examples too of a contrary     transformation  for instance the fumes of selfconceit mounted to     saint anthony’s head when he learned what immense veneration and     adoration had been paid to him by all christendom and he who here     below withstood the most terrible temptations was now quite an     impertinent rascal and dissolute gallowsbird who vied with his pig     in rolling himself in the mud  the chaste susanna from having been     excessively vain of her virtue which she thought indomitable came     to a shameful fall and she who once so gloriously resisted the two     old men was a victim to the seductions of the young absalom the son     of david  on the contrary lot’s daughters had in the lapse of time     become very virtuous and passed in the other world for models of     propriety the old man alas had stuck to the wineflask”  in his “geständnisse” the retractation of former opinions and profession of theism are renewed but in a strain of irony that repels our sympathy and baffles our psychology  yet what strange deep pathos is mingled with the audacity of the following passage      “what avails it me that enthusiastic youths and maidens crown my     marble bust with laurel when the withered hands of an aged nurse are     pressing spanish flies behind my ears  what avails it me that all     the roses of shiraz glow and waft incense for me  alas  shiraz is     two thousand miles from the rue d’amsterdam where in the wearisome     loneliness of my sickroom i get no scent except it be perhaps     the perfume of warmed towels  alas  god’s satire weighs heavily on     me  the great author of the universe the aristophanes of heaven     was bent on demonstrating with crushing force to me the little     earthly german aristophanes how my wittiest sarcasms are only     pitiful attempts at jesting in comparison with his and how miserably     i am beneath him in humor in colossal mockery”  for our own part we regard the paradoxical irreverence with which heine professes his theoretical reverence as pathological as the diseased exhibition of a predominant tendency urged into anomalous action by the pressure of pain and mental privation—as a delirium of wit starved of its proper nourishment  it is not for us to condemn who have never had the same burden laid on us it is not for pigmies at their ease to criticise the writhings of the titan chained to the rock  on one other point we must touch before quitting heine’s personal history  there is a standing accusation against him in some quarters of wanting political principle of wishing to denationalize himself and of indulging in insults against his native country  whatever ground may exist for these accusations that ground is not so far as we see to be found in his writings  he may not have much faith in german revolutions and revolutionists experience in his case as in that of others may have thrown his millennial anticipations into more distant perspective but we see no evidence that he has ever swerved from his attachment to the principles of freedom or written anything which to a philosophic mind is incompatible with true patriotism  he has expressly denied the report that he wished to become naturalized in france and his yearning toward his native land and the accents of his native language is expressed with a pathos the more reliable from the fact that he is sparing in such effusions  we do not see why heine’s satire of the blunders and foibles of his fellowcountrymen should be denounced as a crime of lèsepatrie any more than the political caricatures of any other satirist  the real offences of heine are his occasional coarseness and his unscrupulous personalities which are reprehensible not because they are directed against his fellowcountrymen but because they are personalities  that these offences have their precedents in men whose memory the world delights to honor does not remove their turpitude but it is a fact which should modify our condemnation in a particular case unless indeed we are to deliver our judgments on a principle of compensation—making up for our indulgence in one direction by our severity in another  on this ground of coarseness and personality a true bill may be found against heine not we think on the ground that he has laughed at what is laughable in his compatriots  here is a specimen of the satire under which we suppose german patriots wince      “rhenish bavaria was to be the startingpoint of the german     revolution  zweibrücken was the bethlehem in which the infant     saviour—freedom—lay in the cradle and gave whimpering promise of     redeeming the world  near his cradle bellowed many an ox who     afterward when his horns were reckoned on showed himself a very     harmless brute  it was confidently believed that the german     revolution would begin in zweibrücken and everything was there ripe     for an outbreak  but as has been hinted the tenderheartedness of     some persons frustrated that illegal undertaking  for example among     the bipontine conspirators there was a tremendous braggart who was     always loudest in his rage who boiled over with the hatred of     tyranny and this man was fixed on to strike the first blow by     cutting down a sentinel who kept an important post     ‘what’     cried the man when this order was given him—‘what—me  can you     expect so horrible so bloodthirsty an act of me  i—i kill an     innocent sentinel  i who am the father of a family  and this     sentinel is perhaps also father of a family  one father of a family     kill another father of a family  yes  kill—murder’”  in political matters heine like all men whose intellect and taste predominate too far over their impulses to allow of their becoming partisans is offensive alike to the aristocrat and the democrat  by the one he is denounced as a man who holds incendiary principles by the other as a halfhearted “trimmer”  he has no sympathy as he says with “that vague barren pathos that useless effervescence of enthusiasm which plunges with the spirit of a martyr into an ocean of generalities and which always reminds me of the american sailor who had so fervent an enthusiasm for general jackson that he at last sprang from the top of a mast into the sea crying “i die for general jackson”      “but thou liest brutus thou liest cassius and thou too liest     asinius in maintaining that my ridicule attacks those ideas which     are the precious acquisition of humanity and for which i myself have     so striven and suffered  no for the very reason that those ideas     constantly hover before the poet in glorious splendor and majesty he     is the more irresistibly overcome by laughter when he sees how     rudely awkwardly and clumsily those ideas are seized and mirrored     in the contracted minds of contemporaries    there are mirrors     which have so rough a surface that even an apollo reflected in them     becomes a caricature and excites our laughter  but we laugh then     only at the caricature not at the god”  for the rest why should we demand of heine that he should be a hero a patriot a solemn prophet any more than we should demand of a gazelle that it should draw well in harness  nature has not made him of her sterner stuff—not of iron and adamant but of pollen of flowers the juice of the grape and puck’s mischievous brain plenteously mixing also the dews of kindly affection and the golddust of noble thoughts  it is after all a tribute which his enemies pay him when they utter their bitterest dictum namely that he is “nur dichter”—only a poet  let us accept this point of view for the present and leaving all consideration of him as a man look at him simply as a poet and literary artist  heine is essentially a lyric poet  the finest products of his genius are      “short swallow flights of song that dip     their wings in tears and skim away”  and they are so emphatically songs that in reading them we feel as if each must have a twin melody born in the same moment and by the same inspiration  heine is too impressible and mercurial for any sustained production even in his short lyrics his tears sometimes pass into laughter and his laughter into tears and his longer poems “atta troll” and “deutschland” are full of ariostolike transitions  his song has a wide compass of notes he can take us to the shores of the northern sea and thrill us by the sombre sublimity of his pictures and dreamy fancies he can draw forth our tears by the voice he gives to our own sorrows or to the sorrows of “poor peter” he can throw a cold shudder over us by a mysterious legend a ghost story or a still more ghastly rendering of hard reality he can charm us by a quiet idyl shake us with laughter at his overflowing fun or give us a piquant sensation of surprise by the ingenuity of his transitions from the lofty to the ludicrous  this last power is not indeed essentially poetical but only a poet can use it with the same success as heine for only a poet can poise our emotion and expectation at such a height as to give effect to the sudden fall heine’s greatest power as a poet lies in his simple pathos in the evervaried but always natural expression he has given to the tender emotions  we may perhaps indicate this phase of his genius by referring to wordsworth’s beautiful little poem “she dwelt among the untrodden ways” the conclusion—      “she dwelt alone and few could know        when lucy ceased to be     but she is in her grave and oh        the difference to me”—  is entirely in heine’s manner and so is tennyson’s poem of a dozen lines called “circumstance”  both these poems have heine’s pregnant simplicity  but lest this comparison should mislead we must say that there is no general resemblance between either wordsworth or tennyson and heine  their greatest qualities lie quite a way from the light delicate lucidity the easy rippling music of heine’s style  the distinctive charm of his lyrics may best be seen by comparing them with goethe’s  both have the same masterly finished simplicity and rhythmic grace but there is more thought mingled with goethe’s feeling—his lyrical genius is a vessel that draws more water than heine’s and though it seems to glide along with equal ease we have a sense of greater weight and force accompanying the grace of its movements  but for this very reason heine touches our hearts more strongly his songs are all music and feeling—they are like birds that not only enchant us with their delicious notes but nestle against us with their soft breasts and make us feel the agitated beating of their hearts  he indicates a whole sad history in a single quatrain there is not an image in it not a thought but it is beautiful simple and perfect as a “big round tear”—it is pure feeling breathed in pure music      “anfangs wollt’ ich fast verzagen     und ich glaubt’ ich trug es nie     und ich hab’ es doch getragen—     aber fragt mich nur nicht wie” 134  he excels equally in the more imaginative expression of feeling he represents it by a brief image like a finely cut cameo he expands it into a mysterious dream or dramatizes it in a little story half ballad half idyl and in all these forms his art is so perfect that we never have a sense of artificiality or of unsuccessful effort but all seems to have developed itself by the same beautiful necessity that brings forth vineleaves and grapes and the natural curls of childhood  of heine’s humorous poetry “deutschland” is the most charming specimen—charming especially because its wit and humor grow out of a rich loam of thought “atta troll” is more original more various more fantastic but it is too great a strain on the imagination to be a general favorite  we have said that feeling is the element in which heine’s poetic genius habitually floats but he can occasionally soar to a higher region and impart deep significance to picturesque symbolism he can flash a sublime thought over the past and into the future he can pour forth a lofty strain of hope or indignation  few could forget after once hearing them the stanzas at the close of “deutschland” in which he warns the king of prussia not to incur the irredeemable hell which the injured poet can create for him—the singing flames of a dante’s terza rima      “kennst du die hölle des dante nicht     die schrecklichen terzetten     wen da der dichter hineingesperrt     den kann kein gott mehr retten      “kein gott kein heiland erlöst ihn je     aus diesen singenden flammen     nimm dich in acht das wir dich nicht     zu solcher hölle verdammen”  135  as a prosaist heine is in one point of view even more distinguished than as a poet  the german language easily lends itself to all the purposes of poetry like the ladies of the middle ages it is gracious and compliant to the troubadours  but as these same ladies were often crusty and repulsive to their unmusical mates so the german language generally appears awkward and unmanageable in the hands of prose writers indeed the number of really fine german prosaists before heine would hardly have exceeded the numerating powers of a new hollander who can count three and no more  persons the most familiar with german prose testify that there is an extra fatigue in reading it just as we feel an extra fatigue from our walk when it takes us over ploughed clay  but in heine’s hands german prose usually so heavy so clumsy so dull becomes like clay in the hands of the chemist compact metallic brilliant it is german in an allotropic condition  no dreary labyrinthine sentences in which you find “no end in wandering mazes lost” no chains of adjectives in linked harshness long drawn out no digressions thrown in as parentheses but crystalline definiteness and clearness fine and varied rhythm and all that delicate precision all those felicities of word and cadence which belong to the highest order of prose  and heine has proved—what madame de stäel seems to have doubted—that it is possible to be witty in german indeed in reading him you might imagine that german was preeminently the language of wit so flexible so subtle so piquant does it become under his management he is far more an artist in prose than goethe  he has not the breadth and repose and the calm development which belong to goethe’s style for they are foreign to his mental character but he excels goethe in susceptibility to the manifold qualities of prose and in mastery over its effects  heine is full of variety of light and shadow he alternates between epigrammatic pith imaginative grace sly allusion and daring piquancy and athwart all these there runs a vein of sadness tenderness and grandeur which reveals the poet  he continually throws out those finely chiselled sayings which stamp themselves on the memory and become familiar by quotation  for example “the people have time enough they are immortal kings only are mortal”—“wherever a great soul utters its thoughts there is golgotha”—“nature wanted to see how she looked and she created goethe”—“only the man who has known bodily suffering is truly a man his limbs have their passion history they are spiritualized”  he calls rubens “this flemish titan the wings of whose genius were so strong that he soared as high as the sun in spite of the hundredweight of dutch cheeses that hung on his legs”  speaking of börne’s dislike to the calm creations of the true artist he says “he was like a child which insensible to the glowing significance of a greek statue only touches the marble and complains of cold”  the most poetic and specifically humorous of heine’s prose writings are the “reisebilder”  the comparison with sterne is inevitable here but heine does not suffer from it for if he falls below sterne in raciness of humor he is far above him in poetic sensibility and in reach and variety of thought  heine’s humor is never persistent it never flows on long in easy gayety and drollery where it is not swelled by the tide of poetic feeling it is continually dashing down the precipice of a witticism  it is not broad and unctuous it is aërial and spritelike a momentary restingplace between his poetry and his wit  in the “reisebilder” he runs through the whole gamut of his powers and gives us every hue of thought from the wildly droll and fantastic to the sombre and the terrible  here is a passage almost dantesque in conception      “alas one ought in truth to write against no one in this world     each of us is sick enough in this great lazaretto and many a     polemical writing reminds me involuntarily of a revolting quarrel in     a little hospital at cracow of which i chanced to be a witness and     where it was horrible to hear how the patients mockingly reproached     each other with their infirmities how one who was wasted by     consumption jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy how one     laughed at another’s cancer in the nose and this one again at his     neighbor’s lockedjaw or squint until at last the delirious     feverpatient sprang out of bed and tore away the coverings from the     wounded bodies of his companions and nothing was to be seen but     hideous misery and mutilation”  and how fine is the transition in the very next chapter where after quoting the homeric description of the feasting gods he says      “then suddenly approached panting a pale jew with drops of blood     on his brow with a crown of thorns on his head and a great cross     laid on his shoulders and he threw the cross on the high table of     the gods so that the golden cups tottered and the gods became dumb     and pale and grew ever paler till they at last melted away into     vapor”  the richest specimens of heine’s wit are perhaps to be found in the works which have appeared since the “reisebilder”  the years if they have intensified his satirical bitterness have also given his wit a finer edge and polish  his sarcasms are so subtly prepared and so slily allusive that they may often escape readers whose sense of wit is not very acute but for those who delight in the subtle and delicate flavors of style there can hardly be any wit more irresistible than heine’s  we may measure its force by the degree in which it has subdued the german language to its purposes and made that language brilliant in spite of a long hereditary transmission of dulness  as one of the most harmless examples of his satire take this on a man who has certainly had his share of adulation      “assuredly it is far from my purpose to depreciate m victor cousin     the titles of this celebrated philosopher even lay me under an     obligation to praise him  he belongs to that living pantheon of     france which we call the peerage and his intelligent legs rest on     the velvet benches of the luxembourg  i must indeed sternly repress     all private feelings which might seduce me into an excessive     enthusiasm  otherwise i might be suspected of servility for m     cousin is very influential in the state by means of his position and     his tongue  this consideration might even move me to speak of his     faults as frankly as of his virtues  will he himself disapprove of     this  assuredly not  i know that we cannot do higher honor to great     minds than when we throw as strong a light on their demerits as on     their merits  when we sing the praises of a hercules we must also     mention that he once laid aside the lion’s skin and sat down to the     distaff what then he remains notwithstanding a hercules  so when     we relate similar circumstances concerning m cousin we must     nevertheless add with discriminating eulogy m cousin if he has     sometimes sat twaddling at the distaff has never laid aside the     lion’s skin    it is true that having been suspected of     demagogy he spent some time in a german prison just as lafayette     and richard cœur de lion  but that m cousin there in his leisure     hours studied kant’s ‘critique of pure reason’ is to be doubted on     three grounds  first this book is written in german  secondly in     order to read this book a man must understand german  thirdly m     cousin does not understand german    i fear i am passing unawares     from the sweet waters of praise into the bitter ocean of blame  yes     on one account i cannot refrain from bitterly blaming m     cousin—namely that he who loves truth far more than he loves plato     and tenneman is unjust to himself when he wants to persuade us that     he has borrowed something from the philosophy of schelling and hegel     against this selfaccusation i must take m cousin under my     protection  on my word and conscience this honorable man has not     stolen a jot from schelling and hegel and if he brought home     anything of theirs it was merely their friendship  that does honor     to his heart  but there are many instances of such false     selfaccusation in psychology  i knew a man who declared that he had     stolen silver spoons at the king’s table and yet we all knew that     the poor devil had never been presented at court and accused himself     of stealing these spoons to make us believe that he had been a guest     at the palace  no  in german philosophy m cousin has always kept     the sixth commandment here he has never pocketed a single idea not     so much as a saltspoon of an idea  all witnesses agree in attesting     that in this respect m cousin is honor itself     i prophesy to     you that the renown of m cousin like the french revolution will go     round the world  i hear some one wickedly add undeniably the renown     of m cousin is going round the world and it has already taken its     departure from france”  the following “symbolical myth” about louis philippe is very characteristic of heine’s manner      “i remember very well that immediately on my arrival in paris i     hastened to the palais royal to see louis philippe  the friend who     conducted me told me that the king now appeared on the terrace only     at stated hours but that formerly he was to be seen at any time for     five francs  ‘for five francs’ i cried with amazement ‘does he     then show himself for money’  ‘no but he is shown for money and it     happens in this way there is a society of claqueurs marchands de     contremarques and such riffraff who offered every foreigner to     show him the king for five francs if he would give ten francs he     might see the king raise his eyes to heaven and lay his hand     protestingly on his heart if he would give twenty francs the king     would sing the marseillaise  if the foreigner gave five francs they     raised a loud cheering under the king’s windows and his majesty     appeared on the terrace bowed and retired  if ten francs they     shouted still louder and gesticulated as if they had been possessed     when the king appeared who then as a sign of silent emotion raised     his eyes to heaven and laid his hand on his heart  english visitors     however would sometimes spend as much as twenty francs and then the     enthusiasm mounted to the highest pitch no sooner did the king     appear on the terrace than the marseillaise was struck up and roared     out frightfully until louis philippe perhaps only for the sake of     putting an end to the singing bowed laid his hand on his heart and     joined in the marseillaise  whether as is asserted he beat time     with his foot i cannot say’”  one more quotation and it must be our last      “oh the women  we must forgive them much for they love much—and     many  their hate is properly only love turned inside out  sometimes     they attribute some delinquency to us because they think they can in     this way gratify another man  when they write they have always one     eye on the paper and the other on a man and this is true of all     authoresses except the countess hahnhahn who has only one eye”    v  the natural history of german life 141   it is an interesting branch of psychological observation to note the images that are habitually associated with abstract or collective terms—what may be called the picturewriting of the mind which it carries on concurrently with the more subtle symbolism of language perhaps the fixity or variety of these associated images would furnish a tolerably fair test of the amount of concrete knowledge and experience which a given word represents in the minds of two persons who use it with equal familiarity  the word railways for example will probably call up in the mind of a man who is not highly locomotive the image either of a “bradshaw” or of the station with which he is most familiar or of an indefinite length of tramroad he will alternate between these three images which represent his stock of concrete acquaintance with railways  but suppose a man to have had successively the experience of a “navvy” an engineer a traveller a railway director and shareholder and a landed proprietor in treaty with a railway company and it is probable that the range of images which would by turns present themselves to his mind at the mention of the word “railways” would include all the essential facts in the existence and relations of the thing  now it is possible for the firstmentioned personage to entertain very expanded views as to the multiplication of railways in the abstract and their ultimate function in civilization  he may talk of a vast network of railways stretching over the globe of future “lines” in madagascar and elegant refreshmentrooms in the sandwich islands with none the less glibness because his distinct conceptions on the subject do not extend beyond his one station and his indefinite length of tramroad  but it is evident that if we want a railway to be made or its affairs to be managed this man of wide views and narrow observation will not serve our purpose  probably if we could ascertain the images called up by the terms “the people” “the masses” “the proletariat” “the peasantry” by many who theorize on those bodies with eloquence or who legislate without eloquence we should find that they indicate almost as small an amount of concrete knowledge—that they are as far from completely representing the complex facts summed up in the collective term as the railway images of our nonlocomotive gentleman  how little the real characteristics of the workingclasses are known to those who are outside them how little their natural history has been studied is sufficiently disclosed by our art as well as by our political and social theories  where in our picture exhibitions shall we find a group of true peasantry  what english artist even attempts to rival in truthfulness such studies of popular life as the pictures of teniers or the ragged boys of murillo  even one of the greatest painters of the preeminently realistic school while in his picture of “the hireling shepherd” he gave us a landscape of marvellous truthfulness placed a pair of peasants in the foreground who were not much more real than the idyllic swains and damsels of our chimney ornaments  only a total absence of acquaintance and sympathy with our peasantry could give a moment’s popularity to such a picture as “cross purposes” where we have a peasant girl who looks as if she knew l e l’s poems by heart and english rustics whose costume seems to indicate that they are meant for ploughmen with exotic features that remind us of a handsome primo tenore  rather than such cockney sentimentality as this as an education for the taste and sympathies we prefer the most crapulous group of boors that teniers ever painted  but even those among our painters who aim at giving the rustic type of features who are far above the effeminate feebleness of the “keepsake” style treat their subjects under the influence of traditions and prepossessions rather than of direct observation  the notion that peasants are joyous that the typical moment to represent a man in a smockfrock is when he is cracking a joke and showing a row of sound teeth that cottage matrons are usually buxom and village children necessarily rosy and merry are prejudices difficult to dislodge from the artistic mind which looks for its subjects into literature instead of life  the painter is still under the influence of idyllic literature which has always expressed the imagination of the cultivated and townbred rather than the truth of rustic life  idyllic ploughmen are jocund when they drive their team afield idyllic shepherds make bashful love under hawthorn bushes idyllic villagers dance in the checkered shade and refresh themselves not immoderately with spicy nutbrown ale but no one who has seen much of actual ploughmen thinks them jocund no one who is well acquainted with the english peasantry can pronounce them merry  the slow gaze in which no sense of beauty beams no humor twinkles the slow utterance and the heavy slouching walk remind one rather of that melancholy animal the camel than of the sturdy countryman with striped stockings red waistcoat and hat aside who represents the traditional english peasant  observe a company of haymakers  when you see them at a distance tossing up the forkfuls of hay in the golden light while the wagon creeps slowly with its increasing burden over the meadow and the bright green space which tells of work done gets larger and larger you pronounce the scene “smiling” and you think these companions in labor must be as bright and cheerful as the picture to which they give animation  approach nearer and you will certainly find that haymaking time is a time for joking especially if there are women among the laborers but the coarse laugh that bursts out every now and then and expresses the triumphant taunt is as far as possible from your conception of idyllic merriment  that delicious effervescence of the mind which we call fun has no equivalent for the northern peasant except tipsy revelry the only realm of fancy and imagination for the english clown exists at the bottom of the third quart pot  the conventional countryman of the stage who picks up pocketbooks and never looks into them and who is too simple even to know that honesty has its opposite represents the still lingering mistake that an unintelligible dialect is a guarantee for ingenuousness and that slouching shoulders indicate an upright disposition  it is quite true that a thresher is likely to be innocent of any adroit arithmetical cheating but he is not the less likely to carry home his master’s corn in his shoes and pocket a reaper is not given to writing beggingletters but he is quite capable of cajoling the dairymaid into filling his smallbeer bottle with ale  the selfish instincts are not subdued by the sight of buttercups nor is integrity in the least established by that classic rural occupation sheepwashing  to make men moral something more is requisite than to turn them out to grass  opera peasants whose unreality excites mr ruskin’s indignation are surely too frank an idealization to be misleading and since popular chorus is one of the most effective elements of the opera we can hardly object to lyric rustics in elegant laced boddices and picturesque motley unless we are prepared to advocate a chorus of colliers in their pit costume or a ballet of charwomen and stockingweavers  but our social novels profess to represent the people as they are and the unreality of their representations is a grave evil  the greatest benefit we owe to the artist whether painter poet or novelist is the extension of our sympathies  appeals founded on generalizations and statistics require a sympathy readymade a moral sentiment already in activity but a picture of human life such as a great artist can give surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is a part from themselves which may be called the raw material of moral sentiment  when scott takes us into luckie mucklebackit’s cottage or tells the story of “the two drovers” when wordsworth sings to us the reverie of “poor susan” when kingsley shows us alton locke gazing yearningly over the gate which leads from the highway into the first wood he ever saw when hornung paints a group of chimneysweepers—more is done toward linking the higher classes with the lower toward obliterating the vulgarity of exclusiveness than by hundreds of sermons and philosophical dissertations  art is the nearest thing to life it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellowmen beyond the bounds of our personal lot  all the more sacred is the task of the artist when he undertakes to paint the life of the people falsification here is far more pernicious than in the more artificial aspects of life  it is not so very serious that we should have false ideas about evanescent fashions—about the manners and conversation of beaux and duchesses but it is serious that our sympathy with the perennial joys and struggles the toil the tragedy and the humor in the life of our more heavily laden fellowmen should be perverted and turned toward a false object instead of the true one  this perversion is not the less fatal because the misrepresentation which give rise to it has what the artist considers a moral end  the thing for mankind to know is not what are the motives and influences which the moralist thinks ought to act on the laborer or the artisan but what are the motives and influences which do act on him  we want to be taught to feel not for the heroic artisan or the sentimental peasant but for the peasant in all his coarse apathy and the artisan in all his suspicious selfishness  we have one great novelist who is gifted with the utmost power of rendering the external traits of our town population and if he could give us their psychological character—their conception of life and their emotions—with the same truth as their idiom and manners his books would be the greatest contribution art has ever made to the awakening of social sympathies  but while he can copy mrs plornish’s colloquial style with the delicate accuracy of a sunpicture while there is the same startling inspiration in his description of the gestures and phrases of “boots” as in the speeches of shakespeare’s mobs or numskulls he scarcely ever passes from the humorous and external to the emotional and tragic without becoming as transcendent in his unreality as he was a moment before in his artistic truthfulness  but for the precious salt of his humor which compels him to reproduce external traits that serve in some degree as a corrective to his frequently false psychology his preternaturally virtuous poor children and artisans his melodramatic boatmen and courtesans would be as obnoxious as eugène sue’s idealized proletaires in encouraging the miserable fallacy that high morality and refined sentiment can grow out of harsh social relations ignorance and want or that the workingclasses are in a condition to enter at once into a millennial state of altruism wherein every one is caring for everyone else and no one for himself  if we need a true conception of the popular character to guide our sympathies rightly we need it equally to check our theories and direct us in their application  the tendency created by the splendid conquests of modern generalization to believe that all social questions are merged in economical science and that the relations of men to their neighbors may be settled by algebraic equations—the dream that the uncultured classes are prepared for a condition which appeals principally to their moral sensibilities—the aristocractic dilettantism which attempts to restore the “good old times” by a sort of idyllic masquerading and to grow feudal fidelity and veneration as we grow prize turnips by an artificial system of culture—none of these diverging mistakes can coexist with a real knowledge of the people with a thorough study of their habits their ideas their motives  the landholder the clergyman the millowner the miningagent have each an opportunity for making precious observations on different sections of the workingclasses but unfortunately their experience is too often not registered at all or its results are too scattered to be available as a source of information and stimulus to the public mind generally  if any man of sufficient moral and intellectual breadth whose observations would not be vitiated by a foregone conclusion or by a professional point of view would devote himself to studying the natural history of our social classes especially of the small shopkeepers artisans and peasantry—the degree in which they are influenced by local conditions their maxims and habits the points of view from which they regard their religions teachers and the degree in which they are influenced by religious doctrines the interaction of the various classes on each other and what are the tendencies in their position toward disintegration or toward development—and if after all this study he would give us the result of his observation in a book well nourished with specific facts his work would be a valuable aid to the social and political reformer  what we are desiring for ourselves has been in some degree done for the germans by riehl the author of the very remarkable books the titles of which are placed at the head of this article and we wish to make these books known to our readers not only for the sake of the interesting matter they contain and the important reflections they suggest but also as a model for some future or actual student of our own people  by way of introducing riehl to those who are unacquainted with his writings we will give a rapid sketch from his picture of the german peasantry and perhaps this indication of the mode in which he treats a particular branch of his subject may prepare them to follow us with more interest when we enter on the general purpose and contents of his works  in england at present when we speak of the peasantry we mean scarcely more than the class of farmservants and farmlaborers and it is only in the most primitive districts as in wales for example that farmers are included under the term  in order to appreciate what riehl says of the german peasantry we must remember what the tenantfarmers and small proprietors were in england half a century ago when the master helped to milk his own cows and the daughters got up at one o’clock in the morning to brew—when the family dined in the kitchen with the servants and sat with them round the kitchen fire in the evening  in those days the quarried parlor was innocent of a carpet and its only specimens of art were a framed sampler and the best teaboard the daughters even of substantial farmers had often no greater accomplishment in writing and spelling than they could procure at a dameschool and instead of carrying on sentimental correspondence they were spinning their future tablelinen and looking after every saving in butter and eggs that might enable them to add to the little stock of plate and china which they were laying in against their marriage  in our own day setting aside the superior order of farmers whose style of living and mental culture are often equal to that of the professional class in provincial towns we can hardly enter the least imposing farmhouse without finding a bad piano in the “drawingroom” and some old annuals disposed with a symmetrical imitation of negligence on the table though the daughters may still drop their h’s their vowels are studiously narrow and it is only in very primitive regions that they will consent to sit in a covered vehicle without springs which was once thought an advance in luxury on the pillion  the condition of the tenantfarmers and small proprietors in germany is we imagine about on a par not certainly in material prosperity but in mental culture and habits with that of the english farmers who were beginning to be thought oldfashioned nearly fifty years ago and if we add to these the farm servants and laborers we shall have a class approximating in its characteristics to the bauernthum or peasantry described by riehl  in germany perhaps more than in any other country it is among the peasantry that we must look for the historical type of the national physique  in the towns this type has become so modified to express the personality of the individual that even “family likeness” is often but faintly marked  but the peasants may still be distinguished into groups by their physical peculiarities  in one part of the country we find a longerlegged in another a broadershouldered race which has inherited these peculiarities for centuries  for example in certain districts of hesse are seen long faces with high foreheads long straight noses and small eyes with arched eyebrows and large eyelids  on comparing these physiognomies with the sculptures in the church of st elizabeth at marburg executed in the thirteenth century it will be found that the same old hessian type of face has subsisted unchanged with this distinction only that the sculptures represent princes and nobles whose features then bore the stamp of their race while that stamp is now to be found only among the peasants  a painter who wants to draw mediæval characters with historic truth must seek his models among the peasantry this explains why the old german painters gave the heads of their subjects a greater uniformity of type than the painters of our day the race had not attained to a high degree of individualization in features and expression  it indicates too that the cultured man acts more as an individual the peasant more as one of a group  hans drives the plough lives and thinks just as kunz does and it is this fact that many thousands of men are as like each other in thoughts and habits as so many sheep or oysters which constitutes the weight of the peasantry in the social and political scale  in the cultivated world each individual has his style of speaking and writing  but among the peasantry it is the race the district the province that has its style—namely its dialect its phraseology its proverbs and its songs which belong alike to the entire body of the people  this provincial style of the peasant is again like his physique a remnant of history to which he clings with the utmost tenacity  in certain parts of hungary there are still descendants of german colonists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries who go about the country as reapers retaining their old saxon songs and manners while the more cultivated german emigrants in a very short time forget their own language and speak hungarian  another remarkable case of the same kind is that of the wends a slavonic race settled in lusatia whose numbers amount to 200000 living either scattered among the german population or in separate parishes  they have their own schools and churches and are taught in the slavonic tongue  the catholics among them are rigid adherents of the pope the protestants not less rigid adherents of luther or doctor luther as they are particular in calling him—a custom which a hundred years ago was universal in protestant germany  the wend clings tenaciously to the usages of his church and perhaps this may contribute not a little to the purity in which he maintains the specific characteristics of his race  german education german law and government service in the standing army and many other agencies are in antagonism to his national exclusiveness but the wives and mothers here as elsewhere are a conservative influence and the habits temporarily laid aside in the outer world are recovered by the fireside  the wends form several stout regiments in the saxon army they are sought far and wide as diligent and honest servants and many a weakly dresden or leipzig child becomes thriving under the care of a wendish nurse  in their villages they have the air and habits of genuine sturdy peasants and all their customs indicate that they have been from the first an agricultural people  for example they have traditional modes of treating their domestic animals  each cow has its own name generally chosen carefully so as to express the special qualities of the animal and all important family events are narrated to the bees—a custom which is found also in westphalia whether by the help of the bees or not the wend farming is especially prosperous and when a poor bohemian peasant has a son born to him he binds him to the end of a long pole and turns his face toward lusatia that he may be as lucky as the wends who live there  the peculiarity of the peasant’s language consists chiefly in his retention of historical peculiarities which gradually disappear under the friction of cultivated circles  he prefers any proper name that may be given to a day in the calendar rather than the abstract date by which he very rarely reckons  in the baptismal names of his children he is guided by the old custom of the country not at all by whim and fancy many old baptismal names formerly common in germany would have become extinct but for their preservation among the peasantry especially in north germany and so firmly have they adhered to local tradition in this matter that it would be possible to give a sort of topographical statistics of proper names and distinguish a district by its rustic names as we do by its flora and fauna  the continuous inheritance of certain favorite proper names in a family in some districts forces the peasant to adopt the princely custom of attaching a numeral to the name and saying when three generations are living at once hans i ii and iii or—in the more antique fashion—hans the elder the middle and the younger  in some of our english counties there is a similar adherence to a narrow range of proper names and a mode of distinguishing collateral branches in the same family you will hear of jonathan’s bess thomas’s bess and samuel’s bess—the three bessies being cousins  the peasant’s adherence to the traditional has much greater inconvenience than that entailed by a paucity of proper names  in the black forest and in hüttenberg you will see him in the dogdays wearing a thick fur cap because it is an historical fur cap—a cap worn by his grandfather  in the wetterau that peasant girl is considered the handsomest who wears the most petticoats  to go to fieldlabor in seven petticoats can be anything but convenient or agreeable but it is the traditionally correct thing and a german peasant girl would think herself as unfavorably conspicuous in an untraditional costume as an english servantgirl would now think herself in a “linseywolsey” apron or a thick muslin cap  in many districts no medical advice would induce the rustic to renounce the tight leather belt with which he injures his digestive functions you could more easily persuade him to smile on a new communal system than on the unhistorical invention of braces  in the eighteenth century in spite of the philanthropic preachers of potatoes the peasant for years threw his potatoes to the pigs and the dogs before he could be persuaded to put them on his own table  however the unwillingness of the peasant to adopt innovations has a not unreasonable foundation in the fact that for him experiments are practical not theoretical and must be made with expense of money instead of brains—a fact that is not perhaps sufficiently taken into account by agricultural theorists who complain of the farmer’s obstinacy  the peasant has the smallest possible faith in theoretic knowledge he thinks it rather dangerous than otherwise as is well indicated by a lower rhenish proverb—“one is never too old to learn said an old woman so she learned to be a witch”  between many villages an historical feud once perhaps the occasion of much bloodshed is still kept up under the milder form of an occasional round of cudgelling and the launching of traditional nicknames  an historical feud of this kind still exists for example among many villages on the rhine and more inland places in the neighborhood rheinschnacke of which the equivalent is perhaps “watersnake” is the standing term of ignominy for the inhabitant of the rhine village who repays it in kind by the epithet “karst” mattock or “kukuk” cuckoo according as the object of his hereditary hatred belongs to the field or the forest  if any romeo among the “mattocks” were to marry a juliet among the “watersnakes” there would be no lack of tybalts and mercutios to carry the conflict from words to blows though neither side knows a reason for the enmity  a droll instance of peasant conservatism is told of a village on the taunus whose inhabitants from time immemorial had been famous for impromptu cudgelling  for this historical offence the magistrates of the district had always inflicted the equally historical punishment of shutting up the most incorrigible offenders not in prison but in their own pigsty  in recent times however the government wishing to correct the rudeness of these peasants appointed an “enlightened” man as a magistrate who at once abolished the original penalty above mentioned but this relaxation of punishment was so far from being welcome to the villagers that they presented a petition praying that a more energetic man might be given them as a magistrate who would have the courage to punish according to law and justice “as had been beforetime”  and the magistrate who abolished incarceration in the pigsty could never obtain the respect of the neighborhood  this happened no longer ago than the beginning of the present century  but it must not be supposed that the historical piety of the german peasant extends to anything not immediately connected with himself  he has the warmest piety toward the old tumbledown house which his grandfather built and which nothing will induce him to improve but toward the venerable ruins of the old castle that overlooks his village he has no piety at all and carries off its stones to make a fence for his garden or tears down the gothic carving of the old monastic church which is “nothing to him” to mark off a footpath through his field  it is the same with historical traditions  the peasant has them fresh in his memory so far as they relate to himself  in districts where the peasantry are unadulterated you can discern the remnants of the feudal relations in innumerable customs and phrases but you will ask in vain for historical traditions concerning the empire or even concerning the particular princely house to which the peasant is subject  he can tell you what “half people and whole people” mean in hesse you will still hear of “four horses making a whole peasant” or of “fourday and threeday peasants” but you will ask in vain about charlemagne and frederic barbarossa  riehl well observes that the feudal system which made the peasant the bondman of his lord was an immense benefit in a country the greater part of which had still to be colonized—rescued the peasant from vagabondage and laid the foundation of persistency and endurance in future generations  if a free german peasantry belongs only to modern times it is to his ancestor who was a serf and even in the earliest times a slave that the peasant owes the foundation of his independence namely his capability of a settled existence—nay his unreasoning persistency which has its important function in the development of the race  perhaps the very worst result of that unreasoning persistency is the peasant’s inveterate habit of litigation  every one remembers the immortal description of dandle dinmont’s importunate application to lawyer pleydell to manage his “bit lawsuit” till at length pleydell consents to help him to ruin himself on the ground that dandle may fall into worse hands  it seems this is a scene which has many parallels in germany  the farmer’s lawsuit is his point of honor and he will carry it through though he knows from the very first day that he shall get nothing by it  the litigious peasant piques himself like mr saddletree on his knowledge of the law and this vanity is the chief impulse to many a lawsuit  to the mind of the peasant law presents itself as the “custom of the country” and it is his pride to be versed in all customs  custom with him holds the place of sentiment of theory and in many cases of affection  riehl justly urges the importance of simplifying law proceedings so as to cut off this vanity at its source and also of encouraging by every possible means the practice of arbitration  the peasant never begins his lawsuit in summer for the same reason that he does not make love and marry in summer—because he has no time for that sort of thing  anything is easier to him than to move out of his habitual course and he is attached even to his privations  some years ago a peasant youth out of the poorest and remotest region of the westerwald was enlisted as a recruit at weilburg in nassau  the lad having never in his life slept in a bed when he had got into one for the first time began to cry like a child and he deserted twice because he could not reconcile himself to sleeping in a bed and to the “fine” life of the barracks he was homesick at the thought of his accustomed poverty and his thatched hut  a strong contrast this with the feeling of the poor in towns who would be far enough from deserting because their condition was too much improved  the genuine peasant is never ashamed of his rank and calling he is rather inclined to look down on every one who does not wear a smock frock and thinks a man who has the manners of the gentry is likely to be rather windy and unsubstantial  in some places even in french districts this feeling is strongly symbolized by the practice of the peasantry on certain festival days to dress the images of the saints in peasant’s clothing  history tells us of all kinds of peasant insurrections the object of which was to obtain relief for the peasants from some of their many oppressions but of an effort on their part to step out of their hereditary rank and calling to become gentry to leave the plough and carry on the easier business of capitalists or government functionaries there is no example  the german novelists who undertake to give pictures of peasantlife fall into the same mistake as our english novelists they transfer their own feelings to ploughmen and woodcutters and give them both joys and sorrows of which they know nothing  the peasant never questions the obligation of family ties—he questions no custom—but tender affection as it exists among the refined part of mankind is almost as foreign to him as white hands and filbertshaped nails  that the aged father who has given up his property to his children on condition of their maintaining him for the remainder of his life is very far from meeting with delicate attentions is indicated by the proverb current among the peasantry—“don’t take your clothes off before you go to bed”  among rustic moral tales and parables not one is more universal than the story of the ungrateful children who made their grayheaded father dependent on them for a maintenance eat at a wooden trough became he shook the food out of his trembling hands  then these same ungrateful children observed one day that their own little boy was making a tiny wooden trough and when they asked him what it was for he answered—that his father and mother might eat out of it when he was a man and had to keep them  marriage is a very prudential affair especially among the peasants who have the largest share of property  politic marriages are as common among them as among princes and when a peasantheiress in westphalia marries her husband adopts her name and places his own after it with the prefix geborner née  the girls marry young and the rapidity with which they get old and ugly is one among the many proofs that the early years of marriage are fuller of hardships than of conjugal tenderness  “when our writers of village stories” says riehl “transferred their own emotional life to the peasant they obliterated what is precisely his most predominant characteristic namely that with him general custom holds the place of individual feeling”  we pay for greater emotional susceptibility too often by nervous diseases of which the peasant knows nothing  to him headache is the least of physical evils because he thinks headwork the easiest and least indispensable of all labor  happily many of the younger sons in peasant families by going to seek their living in the towns carry their hardy nervous system to amalgamate with the overwrought nerves of our town population and refresh them with a little rude vigor  and a return to the habits of peasant life is the best remedy for many moral as well as physical diseases induced by perverted civilization  riehl points to colonization as presenting the true field for this regenerative process on the other side of the ocean a man will have the courage to begin life again as a peasant while at home perhaps opportunity as well as courage will fail him  apropos of this subject of emigration he remarks the striking fact that the native shrewdness and motherwit of the german peasant seem to forsake him entirely when he has to apply them under new circumstances and on relations foreign to his experience hence it is that the german peasant who emigrates so constantly falls a victim to unprincipled adventurers in the preliminaries to emigration but if once he gets his foot on the american soil he exhibits all the firstrate qualities of an agricultural colonist and among all german emigrants the peasant class are the most successful  but many disintegrating forces have been at work on the peasant character and degeneration is unhappily going on at a greater pace than development  in the wine districts especially the inability of the small proprietors to bear up under the vicissitudes of the market or to insure a high quality of wine by running the risks of a late vintage and the competition of beer and cider with the inferior wines have tended to produce that uncertainty of gain which with the peasant is the inevitable cause of demoralization  the small peasant proprietors are not a new class in germany but many of the evils of their position are new  they are more dependent on ready money than formerly thus where a peasant used to get his wood for building and firing from the common forest he has now to pay for it with hard cash he used to thatch his own house with the help perhaps of a neighbor but now he pays a man to do it for him he used to pay taxes in kind he now pays them in money the chances of the market have to be discounted and the peasant falls into the hands of moneylenders  here is one of the cases in which social policy clashes with a purely economical policy  political vicissitudes have added their influence to that of economical changes in disturbing that dim instinct that reverence for traditional custom which is the peasant’s principle of action  he is in the midst of novelties for which he knows no reason—changes in political geography changes of the government to which he owes fealty changes in bureaucratic management and police regulations  he finds himself in a new element before an apparatus for breathing in it is developed in him his only knowledge of modern history is in some of its results—for instance that he has to pay heavier taxes from year to year  his chief idea of a government is of a power that raises his taxes opposes his harmless customs and torments him with new formalities  the source of all this is the false system of “enlightening” the peasant which has been adopted by the bureaucratic governments  a system which disregards the traditions and hereditary attachments of the peasant and appeals only to a logical understanding which is not yet developed in him is simply disintegrating and ruinous to the peasant character  the interference with the communal regulations has been of this fatal character  instead of endeavoring to promote to the utmost the healthy life of the commune as an organism the conditions of which are bound up with the historical characteristics of the peasant the bureaucratic plan of government is bent on improvement by its patent machinery of stateappointed functionaries and offhand regulations in accordance with modern enlightenment  the spirit of communal exclusiveness—the resistance to the indiscriminate establishment of strangers is an intense traditional feeling in the peasant  “this gallows is for us and our children” is the typical motto of this spirit  but such exclusiveness is highly irrational and repugnant to modern liberalism therefore a bureaucratic government at once opposes it and encourages to the utmost the introduction of new inhabitants in the provincial communes  instead of allowing the peasants to manage their own affairs and if they happen to believe that five and four make eleven to unlearn the prejudice by their own experience in calculation so that they may gradually understand processes and not merely see results bureaucracy comes with its “ready reckoner” and works all the peasant’s sums for him—the surest way of maintaining him in his stupidity however it may shake his prejudice  another questionable plan for elevating the peasant is the supposed elevation of the clerical character by preventing the clergyman from cultivating more than a trifling part of the land attached to his benefice that he may be as much as possible of a scientific theologian and as little as possible of a peasant  in this riehl observes lies one great source of weakness to the protestant church as compared with the catholic which finds the great majority of its priests among the lower orders and we have had the opportunity of making an analogous comparison in england where many of us can remember country districts in which the great mass of the people were christianized by illiterate methodist and independent ministers while the influence of the parish clergyman among the poor did not extend much beyond a few old women in scarlet cloaks and a few exceptional churchgoing laborers  bearing in mind the general characteristics of the german peasant it is easy to understand his relation to the revolutionary ideas and revolutionary movements of modern times  the peasant in germany as elsewhere is a born grumbler  he has always plenty of grievances in his pocket but he does not generalize those grievances he does not complain of “government” or “society” probably because he has good reason to complain of the burgomaster  when a few sparks from the first french revolution fell among the german peasantry and in certain villages of saxony the country people assembled together to write down their demands there was no glimpse in their petition of the “universal rights of man” but simply of their own particular affairs as saxon peasants  again after the july revolution of 1830 there were many insignificant peasant insurrections but the object of almost all was the removal of local grievances  tollhouses were pulled down stamped paper was destroyed in some places there was a persecution of wild boars in others of that plentiful tame animal the german rath or councillor who is never called into council  but in 1848 it seemed as if the movements of the peasants had taken a new character in the small western states of germany it seemed as if the whole class of peasantry was in insurrection but in fact the peasant did not know the meaning of the part he was playing  he had heard that everything was being set right in the towns and that wonderful things were happening there so he tied up his bundle and set off  without any distinct object or resolution the country people presented themselves on the scene of commotion and were warmly received by the party leaders  but seen from the windows of ducal palaces and ministerial hotels these swarms of peasants had quite another aspect and it was imagined that they had a common plan of cooperation  this however the peasants have never had  systematic cooperation implies general conceptions and a provisional subordination of egoism to which even the artisans of towns have rarely shown themselves equal and which are as foreign to the mind of the peasant as logarithms or the doctrine of chemical proportions  and the revolutionary fervor of the peasant was soon cooled  the old mistrust of the towns was reawakened on the spot  the tyrolese peasants saw no great good in the freedom of the press and the constitution because these changes “seemed to please the gentry so much”  peasants who had given their voices stormily for a german parliament asked afterward with a doubtful look whether it were to consist of infantry or cavalry  when royal domains were declared the property of the state the peasants in some small principalities rejoiced over this because they interpreted it to mean that every one would have his share in them after the manner of the old common and forest rights  the very practical views of the peasants with regard to the demands of the people were in amusing contrast with the abstract theorizing of the educated townsmen  the peasant continually withheld all state payments until he saw how matters would turn out and was disposed to reckon up the solid benefit in the form of land or money that might come to him from the changes obtained  while the townsman was heating his brains about representation on the broadest basis the peasant asked if the relation between tenant and landlord would continue as before and whether the removal of the “feudal obligations” meant that the farmer should become owner of the land  it is in the same naïve way that communism is interpreted by the german peasantry  the wide spread among them of communistic doctrines the eagerness with which they listened to a plan for the partition of property seemed to countenance the notion that it was a delusion to suppose the peasant would be secured from this intoxication by his love of secure possession and peaceful earnings  but in fact the peasant contemplated “partition” by the light of an historical reminiscence rather than of novel theory  the golden age in the imagination of the peasant was the time when every member of the commune had a right to as much wood from the forest as would enable him to sell some after using what he wanted in firing—in which the communal possessions were so profitable that instead of his having to pay rates at the end of the year each member of the commune was something in pocket  hence the peasants in general understood by “partition” that the state lands especially the forests would be divided among the communes and that by some political legerdemain or other everybody would have free firewood free grazing for his cattle and over and above that a piece of gold without working for it  that he should give up a single clod of his own to further the general “partition” had never entered the mind of the peasant communist and the perception that this was an essential preliminary to “partition” was often a sufficient cure for his communism  in villages lying in the neighborhood of large towns however where the circumstances of the peasantry are very different quite another interpretation of communism is prevalent  here the peasant is generally sunk to the position of the proletaire living from hand to mouth he has nothing to lose but everything to gain by “partition”  the coarse nature of the peasant has here been corrupted into bestiality by the disturbance of his instincts while he is as yet incapable of principles and in this type of the degenerate peasant is seen the worst example of ignorance intoxicated by theory  a significant hint as to the interpretation the peasants put on revolutionary theories may be drawn from the way they employed the few weeks in which their movements were unchecked  they felled the forest trees and shot the game they withheld taxes they shook off the imaginary or real burdens imposed on them by their mediatized princes by presenting their “demands” in a very rough way before the ducal or princely “schloss” they set their faces against the bureaucratic management of the communes deposed the government functionaries who had been placed over them as burgomasters and magistrates and abolished the whole bureaucratic system of procedure simply by taking no notice of its regulations and recurring to some tradition—some old order or disorder of things  in all this it is clear that they were animated not in the least by the spirit of modern revolution but by a purely narrow and personal impulse toward reaction  the idea of constitutional government lies quite beyond the range of the german peasant’s conceptions  his only notion of representation is that of a representation of ranks—of classes his only notion of a deputy is of one who takes care not of the national welfare but of the interests of his own order  herein lay the great mistake of the democratic party in common with the bureaucratic governments that they entirely omitted the peculiar character of the peasant from their political calculations they talked of the “people” and forgot that the peasants were included in the term  only a baseless misconception of the peasant’s character could induce the supposition that he would feel the slightest enthusiasm about the principles involved in the reconstitution of the empire or even about the reconstitution itself  he has no zeal for a written law as such but only so far as it takes the form of a living law—a tradition it was the external authority which the revolutionary party had won in baden that attracted the peasants into a participation of the struggle  such riehl tells us are the general characteristics of the german peasantry—characteristics which subsist amid a wide variety of circumstances  in mecklenburg pomerania and brandenburg the peasant lives on extensive estates in westphalia he lives in large isolated homesteads in the westerwald and in sauerland in little groups of villages and hamlets on the rhine land is for the most part parcelled out among small proprietors who live together in large villages  then of course the diversified physical geography of germany gives rise to equally diversified methods of landculture and out of these various circumstances grow numerous specific differences in manner and character but the generic character of the german peasant is everywhere the same in the clean mountain hamlet and in the dirty fishing village on the coast in the plains of north germany and in the backwoods of america “everywhere he has the same historical character—everywhere custom is his supreme law  where religion and patriotism are still a naïve instinct are still a sacred custom there begins the class of the german peasantry”                                        our readers will perhaps already have gathered from the foregoing portrait of the german peasant that riehl is not a man who looks at objects through the spectacles either of the doctrinaire or the dreamer and they will be ready to believe what he tells us in his preface namely that years ago he began his wanderings over the hills and plains of germany for the sake of obtaining in immediate intercourse with the people that completion of his historical political and economical studies which he was unable to find in books  he began his investigations with no party prepossessions and his present views were evolved entirely from his own gradually amassed observations  he was first of all a pedestrian and only in the second place a political author  the views at which he has arrived by this inductive process he sums up in the term—socialpoliticalconservatism but his conservatism is we conceive of a thoroughly philosophical kind  he sees in european society incarnate history and any attempt to disengage it from its historical elements must he believes be simply destructive of social vitality 164  what has grown up historically can only die out historically by the gradual operation of necessary laws  the external conditions which society has inherited from the past are but the manifestation of inherited internal conditions in the human beings who compose it the internal conditions and the external are related to each other as the organism and its medium and development can take place only by the gradual consentaneous development of both  take the familiar example of attempts to abolish titles which have been about as effective as the process of cutting off poppyheads in a cornfield  jedem menschem says riehl ist sein zopf angeboren warum soll denn der sociale sprachgebrauch nicht auch sein zopf haben—which we may render—“as long as snobism runs in the blood why should it not run in our speech”  as a necessary preliminary to a purely rational society you must obtain purely rational men free from the sweet and bitter prejudices of hereditary affection and antipathy which is as easy as to get running streams without springs or the leafy shade of the forest without the secular growth of trunk and branch  the historical conditions of society may be compared with those of language  it must be admitted that the language of cultivated nations is in anything but a rational state the great sections of the civilized world are only approximatively intelligible to each other and even that only at the cost of long study one word stands for many things and many words for one thing the subtle shades of meaning and still subtler echoes of association make language an instrument which scarcely anything short of genius can wield with definiteness and certainty suppose then that the effect which has been again and again made to construct a universal language on a rational basis has at length succeeded and that you have a language which has no uncertainty no whims of idiom no cumbrous forms no fitful simmer of manyhued significance no hoary archaisms “familiar with forgotten years”—a patent deodorized and nonresonant language which effects the purpose of communication as perfectly and rapidly as algebraic signs  your language may be a perfect medium of expression to science but will never express life which is a great deal more than science  with the anomalies and inconveniences of historical language you will have parted with its music and its passions and its vital qualities as an expression of individual character with its subtle capabilities of wit with everything that gives it power over the imagination and the next step in simplification will be the invention of a talking watch which will achieve the utmost facility and despatch in the communication of ideas by a graduated adjustment of ticks to be represented in writing by a corresponding arrangement of dots  a melancholy “language of the future”  the sensory and motor nerves that run in the same sheath are scarcely bound together by a more necessary and delicate union than that which binds men’s affections imagination wit and humor with the subtle ramifications of historical language  language must be left to grow in precision completeness and unity as minds grow in clearness comprehensiveness and sympathy  and there is an analogous relation between the moral tendencies of men and the social conditions they have inherited  the nature of european men has its roots intertwined with the past and can only be developed by allowing those roots to remain undisturbed while the process of development is going on until that perfect ripeness of the seed which carries with it a life independent of the root  this vital connection with the past is much more vividly felt on the continent than in england where we have to recall it by an effort of memory and reflection for though our english life is in its core intensely traditional protestantism and commerce have modernized the face of the land and the aspects of society in a far greater degree than in any continental country      “abroad” says ruskin “a building of the eighth or tenth century     stands ruinous in the open streets the children play round it the     peasants heap their corn in it the buildings of yesterday nestle     about it and fit their new stones in its rents and tremble in     sympathy as it trembles  no one wonders at it or thinks of it as     separate and of another time we feel the ancient world to be a real     thing and one with the new antiquity is no dream it is rather the     children playing about the old stones that are the dream  but all is     continuous and the words “from generation to generation”     understandable here”  this conception of european society as incarnate history is the fundamental idea of riehl’s books  after the notable failure of revolutionary attempts conducted from the point of view of abstract democratic and socialistic theories after the practical demonstration of the evils resulting from a bureaucratic system which governs by an undiscriminating dead mechanism riehl wishes to urge on the consideration of his countrymen a social policy founded on the special study of the people as they are—on the natural history of the various social ranks  he thinks it wise to pause a little from theorizing and see what is the material actually present for theory to work upon  it is the glory of the socialists—in contrast with the democratic doctrinaires who have been too much occupied with the general idea of “the people” to inquire particularly into the actual life of the people—that they have thrown themselves with enthusiastic zeal into the study at least of one social group namely the factory operatives and here lies the secret of their partial success  but unfortunately they have made this special duty of a single fragment of society the basis of a theory which quietly substitutes for the small group of parisian proletaires or english factoryworkers the society of all europe—nay of the whole world  and in this way they have lost the best fruit of their investigations  for says riehl the more deeply we penetrate into the knowledge of society in its details the more thoroughly we shall be convinced that a universal social policy has no validity except on paper and can never be carried into successful practice  the conditions of german society are altogether different from those of french of english or of italian society and to apply the same social theory to these nations indiscriminately is about as wise a procedure as triptolemus yellowley’s application of the agricultural directions in virgil’s “georgics” to his farm in the shetland isles  it is the clear and strong light in which riehl places this important position that in our opinion constitutes the suggestive value of his books for foreign as well as german readers  it has not been sufficiently insisted on that in the various branches of social science there is an advance from the general to the special from the simple to the complex analogous with that which is found in the series of the sciences from mathematics to biology  to the laws of quantity comprised in mathematics and physics are superadded in chemistry laws of quality to these again are added in biology laws of life and lastly the conditions of life in general branch out into its special conditions or natural history on the one hand and into its abnormal conditions or pathology on the other  and in this series or ramification of the sciences the more general science will not suffice to solve the problems of the more special  chemistry embraces phenomena which are not explicable by physics biology embraces phenomena which are not explicable by chemistry and no biological generalization will enable us to predict the infinite specialities produced by the complexity of vital conditions  so social science while it has departments which in their fundamental generality correspond to mathematics and physics namely those grand and simple generalizations which trace out the inevitable march of the human race as a whole and as a ramification of these the laws of economical science has also in the departments of government and jurisprudence which embrace the conditions of social life in all their complexity what may be called its biology carrying us on to innumerable special phenomena which outlie the sphere of science and belong to natural history  and just as the most thorough acquaintance with physics or chemistry or general physiology will not enable you at once to establish the balance of life in your private vivarium so that your particular society of zoophytes mollusks and echinoderms may feel themselves as the germans say at ease in their skin so the most complete equipment of theory will not enable a statesman or a political and social reformer to adjust his measures wisely in the absence of a special acquaintance with the section of society for which he legislates with the peculiar characteristics of the nation the province the class whose wellbeing he has to consult  in other words a wise social policy must be based not simply on abstract social science but on the natural history of social bodies  riehl’s books are not dedicated merely to the argumentative maintenance of this or of any other position they are intended chiefly as a contribution to that knowledge of the german people on the importance of which he insists  he is less occupied with urging his own conclusions than with impressing on his readers the facts which have led him to those conclusions  in the volume entitled “land und leute” which though published last is properly an introduction to the volume entitled “die bürgerliche gesellschaft” he considers the german people in their physical geographical relations he compares the natural divisions of the race as determined by land and climate and social traditions with the artificial divisions which are based on diplomacy and he traces the genesis and influences of what we may call the ecclesiastical geography of germany—its partition between catholicism and protestantism  he shows that the ordinary antithesis of north and south germany represents no real ethnographical distinction and that the natural divisions of germany founded on its physical geography are threefold—namely the low plains the middle mountain region and the high mountain region or lower middle and upper germany and on this primary natural division all the other broad ethnographical distinctions of germany will be i found to rest  the plains of north or lower germany include all the seaboard the nation possesses and this together with the fact that they are traversed to the depth of 600 miles by navigable rivers makes them the natural seat of a trading race  quite different is the geographical character of middle germany  while the northern plains are marked off into great divisions by such rivers as the lower rhine the weser and the oder running almost in parallel lines this central region is cut up like a mosaic by the capricious lines of valleys and rivers  here is the region in which you find those famous roofs from which the rainwater runs toward two different seas and the mountaintops from which you may look into eight or ten german states  the abundance of waterpower and the presence of extensive coalmines allow of a very diversified industrial development in middle germany  in upper germany or the high mountain region we find the same symmetry in the lines of the rivers as in the north almost all the great alpine streams flow parallel with the danube  but the majority of these rivers are neither navigable nor available for industrial objects and instead of serving for communication they shut off one great tract from another  the slow development the simple peasant life of many districts is here determined by the mountain and the river  in the southeast however industrial activity spreads through bohemia toward austria and forms a sort of balance to the industrial districts of the lower rhine  of course the boundaries of these three regions cannot be very strictly defined but an approximation to the limits of middle germany may be obtained by regarding it as a triangle of which one angle lies in silesia another in aixlachapelle and a third at lake constance  this triple division corresponds with the broad distinctions of climate in the northern plains the atmosphere is damp and heavy in the southern mountain region it is dry and rare and there are abrupt changes of temperature sharp contrasts between the seasons and devastating storms but in both these zones men are hardened by conflict with the roughness of the climate  in middle germany on the contrary there is little of this struggle the seasons are more equable and the mild soft air of the valleys tends to make the inhabitants luxurious and sensitive to hardships  it is only in exceptional mountain districts that one is here reminded of the rough bracing air on the heights of southern germany it is a curious fact that as the air becomes gradually lighter and rarer from the north german coast toward upper germany the average of suicides regularly decreases  mecklenburg has the highest number then prussia while the fewest suicides occur in bavaria and austria  both the northern and southern regions have still a large extent of waste lands downs morasses and heaths and to these are added in the south abundance of snowfields and naked rock while in middle germany culture has almost overspread the face of the land and there are no large tracts of waste  there is the same proportion in the distribution of forests  again in the north we see a monotonous continuity of wheatfields potatogrounds meadowlands and vast heaths and there is the same uniformity of culture over large surfaces in the southern tablelands and the alpine pastures  in middle germany on the contrary there is a perpetual variety of crops within a short space the diversity of land surface and the corresponding variety in the species of plants are an invitation to the splitting up of estates and this again encourages to the utmost the motley character of the cultivation  according to this threefold division it appears that there are certain features common to north and south germany in which they differ from central germany and the nature of this difference riehl indicates by distinguishing the former as centralized land and the latter as individualized land a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact that north and south germany possess the great lines of railway which are the medium for the traffic of the world while middle germany is far richer in lines for local communication and possesses the greatest length of railway within the smallest space  disregarding superficialities the east frieslanders the schleswigholsteiners the mecklenburghers and the pomeranians are much more nearly allied to the old bavarians the tyrolese and the styrians than any of these are allied to the saxons the thuringians or the rhinelanders  both in north and south germany original races are still found in large masses and popular dialects are spoken you still find there thoroughly peasant districts thorough villages and also at great intervals thorough cities you still find there a sense of rank  in middle germany on the contrary the original races are fused together or sprinkled hither and thither the peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or confused there is no very strict line of demarkation between the country and the town population hundreds of small towns and large villages being hardly distinguishable in their characteristics and the sense of rank as part of the organic structure of society is almost extinguished again both in the north and south there is still a strong ecclesiastical spirit in the people and the pomeranian sees antichrist in the pope as clearly as the tyrolese sees him in doctor luther while in middle germany the confessions are mingled they exist peaceably side by side in very narrow space and tolerance or indifference has spread itself widely even in the popular mind  and the analogy or rather the causal relation between the physical geography of the three regions and the development of the population goes still further      “for” observes riehl “the striking connection which has been     pointed out between the local geological formations in germany and     the revolutionary disposition of the people has more than a     metaphorical significance  where the primeval physical revolutions     of the globe have been the wildest in their effects and the most     multiform strata have been tossed together or thrown one upon the     other it is a very intelligible consequence that on a land surface     thus broken up the population should sooner develop itself into     small communities and that the more intense life generated in these     smaller communities should become the most favorable nidus for the     reception of modern culture and with this a susceptibility for its     revolutionary ideas while a people settled in a region where its     groups are spread over a large space will persist much more     obstinately in the retention of its original character  the people     of middle germany have none of that exclusive onesidedness which     determines the peculiar genius of great national groups just as this     onesidedness or uniformity is wanting to the geological and     geographical character of their land”  this ethnographical outline riehl fills up with special and typical descriptions and then makes it the startingpoint for a criticism of the actual political condition of germany  the volume is fall of vivid pictures as well as penetrating glances into the maladies and tendencies of modern society  it would be fascinating as literature if it were not important for its facts and philosophy  but we can only commend it to our readers and pass on to the volume entitled “die bürgerliche gesellschaft” from which we have drawn our sketch of the german peasantry  here riehl gives us a series of studies in that natural history of the people which he regards as the proper basis of social policy  he holds that in european society there are three natural ranks or estates the hereditary landed aristocracy the citizens or commercial class and the peasantry or agricultural class  by natural ranks he means ranks which have their roots deep in the historical structure of society and are still in the present showing vitality above ground he means those great social groups which are not only distinguished externally by their vocation but essentially by their mental character their habits their mode of life—by the principle they represent in the historical development of society  in his conception of the “fourth estate” he differs from the usual interpretation according to which it is simply equivalent to the proletariat or those who are dependent on daily wages whose only capital is their skill or bodily strength—factory operatives artisans agricultural laborers to whom might be added especially in germany the daylaborers with the quill the literary proletariat  this riehl observes is a valid basis of economical classification but not of social classification  in his view the fourth estate is a stratum produced by the perpetual abrasion of the other great social groups it is the sign and result of the decomposition which is commencing in the organic constitution of society its elements are derived alike from the aristocracy the bourgeoisie and the peasantry  it assembles under its banner the deserters of historical society and forms them into a terrible army which is only just awaking to the consciousness of its corporate power  the tendency of this fourth estate by the very process of its formation is to do away with the distinctive historical character of the other estates and to resolve their peculiar rank and vocation into a uniform social relation founded on an abstract conception of society  according to riehl’s classification the daylaborers whom the political economist designates as the fourth estate belong partly to the peasantry or agricultural class and partly to the citizens or commercial class  riehl considers in the first place the peasantry and aristocracy as the “forces of social persistence” and in the second the bourgeoisie and the “fourth estate” as the “forces of social movement”  the aristocracy he observes is the only one among these four groups which is denied by others besides socialists to have any natural basis as a separate rank  it is admitted that there was once an aristocracy which had an intrinsic ground of existence but now it is alleged this is an historical fossil an antiquarian relic venerable because gray with age it what it is asked can consist the peculiar vocation of the aristocracy since it has no longer the monopoly of the land of the higher military functions and of government offices and since the service of the court has no longer any political importance  to this riehl replies that in great revolutionary crises the “men of progress” have more than once “abolished” the aristocracy  but remarkably enough the aristocracy has always reappeared  this measure of abolition showed that the nobility were no longer regarded as a real class for to abolish a real class would be an absurdity  it is quite possible to contemplate a voluntary breaking up of the peasant or citizen class in the socialistic sense but no man in his senses would think of straightway “abolishing” citizens and peasants  the aristocracy then was regarded as a sort of cancer or excrescence of society  nevertheless not only has it been found impossible to annihilate an hereditary nobility by decree but also the aristocracy of the eighteenth century outlived even the selfdestructive acts of its own perversity  a life which was entirely without object entirely destitute of functions would not says riehl be so persistent  he has an acute criticism of those who conduct a polemic against the idea of an hereditary aristocracy while they are proposing an “aristocracy of talent” which after all is based on the principle of inheritance  the socialists are therefore only consistent in declaring against an aristocracy of talent  “but when they have turned the world into a great foundling hospital they will still be unable to eradicate the ‘privileges of birth’”  we must not follow him in his criticism however nor can we afford to do more than mention hastily his interesting sketch of the mediæval aristocracy and his admonition to the german aristocracy of the present day that the vitality of their class is not to be sustained by romantic attempts to revive mediæval forms and sentiments but only by the exercise of functions as real and salutary for actual society as those of the mediæval aristocracy were for the feudal age  “in modern society the divisions of rank indicate division of labor according to that distribution of functions in the social organism which the historical constitution of society has determined  in this way the principle of differentiation and the principle of unity are identical”  the elaborate study of the german bourgeoisie which forms the next division of the volume must be passed over but we may pause a moment to note riehl’s definition of the social philister philistine an epithet for which we have no equivalent not at all however for want of the object it represents  most people who read a little german know that the epithet philister originated in the burschenleben or studentlife of germany and that the antithesis of bursch and philister was equivalent to the antithesis of “gown” and “town” but since the word has passed into ordinary language it has assumed several shades of significance which have not yet been merged into a single absolute meaning and one of the questions which an english visitor in germany will probably take an opportunity of asking is “what is the strict meaning of the word philister”  riehl’s answer is that the philister “is one who is indifferent to all social interests all public life as distinguished from selfish and private interests he has no sympathy with political and social events except as they affect his own comfort and prosperity as they offer him material for amusement or opportunity for gratifying his vanity  he has no social or political creed but is always of the opinion which is most convenient for the moment  he is always in the majority and is the main element of unreason and stupidity in the judgment of a “discerning public”  it seems presumptuous in us to dispute riehl’s interpretation of a german word but we must think that in literature the epithet philister has usually a wider meaning than this—includes his definition and something more  we imagine the philister is the personification of the spirit which judges everything from a lower point of view than the subject demands which judges the affairs of the parish from the egotistic or purely personal point of view which judges the affairs of the nation from the parochial point of view and does not hesitate to measure the merits of the universe from the human point of view  at least this must surely be the spirit to which goethe alludes in a passage cited by riehl himself where he says that the germans need not be ashamed of erecting a monument to him as well as to blucher for if blucher had freed them from the french he goethe had freed them from the nets of the philister      “ihr mögt mirimmer ungescheut     gleich blüchern denkmal setzen     von franzosen hat er euch befreit     ich von philisternetzen”  goethe could hardly claim to be the apostle of public spirit but he is eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point of observation so that we may see things in their relative proportions  the most interesting chapters in the description of the “fourth estate” which concludes the volume are those on the “aristocratic proletariat” and the “intellectual proletariat”  the fourth estate in germany says riehl has its centre of gravity not as in england and france in the day laborers and factory operatives and still less in the degenerate peasantry  in germany the educated proletariat is the leaven that sets the mass in fermentation the dangerous classes there go about not in blouses but in frock coats they begin with the impoverished prince and end in the hungriest littérateur  the custom that all the sons of a nobleman shall inherit their father’s title necessarily goes on multiplying that class of aristocrats who are not only without function but without adequate provision and who shrink from entering the ranks of the citizens by adopting some honest calling  the younger son of a prince says riehl is usually obliged to remain without any vocation and however zealously he may study music painting literature or science he can never be a regular musician painter or man of science his pursuit will be called a “passion” not a “calling” and to the end of his days he remains a dilettante  “but the ardent pursuit of a fixed practical calling can alone satisfy the active man”  direct legislation cannot remedy this evil  the inheritance of titles by younger sons is the universal custom and custom is stronger than law  but if all government preference for the “aristocratic proletariat” were withdrawn the sensible men among them would prefer emigration or the pursuit of some profession to the hungry distinction of a title without rents  the intellectual proletaires riehl calls the “church militant” of the fourth estate in germany  in no other country are they so numerous in no other country is the trade in material and industrial capital so far exceeded by the wholesale and retail trade the traffic and the usury in the intellectual capital of the nation  germany yields more intellectual produce than it can use and pay for      “this overproduction which is not transient but permanent nay is     constantly on the increase evidences a diseased state of the     national industry a perverted application of industrial powers and     is a far more pungent satire on the national condition than all the     poverty of operatives and peasants    other nations need not envy     us the preponderance of the intellectual proletariat over the     proletaires of manual labor  for man more easily becomes diseased     from overstudy than from the labor of the hands and it is precisely     in the intellectual proletariat that there are the most dangerous     seeds of disease  this is the group in which the opposition between     earnings and wants between the ideal social position and the real     is the most hopelessly irreconcilable”  we must unwillingly leave our readers to make acquaintance for themselves with the graphic details with which riehl follows up this general statement but before quitting these admirable volumes let us say lest our inevitable omissions should have left room for a different conclusion that riehl’s conservatism is not in the least tinged with the partisanship of a class with a poetic fanaticism for the past or with the prejudice of a mind incapable of discerning the grander evolution of things to which all social forms are but temporarily subservient  it is the conservatism of a cleareyed practical but withal largeminded man—a little caustic perhaps now and then in his epigrams on democratic doctrinaires who have their nostrum for all political and social diseases and on communistic theories which he regards as “the despair of the individual in his own manhood reduced to a system” but nevertheless able and willing to do justice to the elements of fact and reason in every shade of opinion and every form of effort  he is as far as possible from the folly of supposing that the sun will go backward on the dial because we put the hands of our clock backward he only contends against the opposite folly of decreeing that it shall be midday while in fact the sun is only just touching the mountaintops and all along the valley men are stumbling in the twilight    vi  silly novels by lady novelists   silly novels by lady novelists are a genus with many species determined by the particular quality of silliness that predominates in them—the frothy the prosy the pious or the pedantic  but it is a mixture of all these—a composite order of feminine fatuity—that produces the largest class of such novels which we shall distinguish as the mindandmillinery species  the heroine is usually an heiress probably a peeress in her own right with perhaps a vicious baronet an amiable duke and an irresistible younger son of a marquis as lovers in the foreground a clergyman and a poet sighing for her in the middle distance and a crowd of undefined adorers dimly indicated beyond  her eyes and her wit are both dazzling her nose and her morals are alike free from any tendency to irregularity she has a superb contralto and a superb intellect she is perfectly well dressed and perfectly religious she dances like a sylph and reads the bible in the original tongues  or it may be that the heroine is not an heiress—that rank and wealth are the only things in which she is deficient but she infallibly gets into high society she has the triumph of refusing many matches and securing the best and she wears some family jewels or other as a sort of crown of righteousness at the end  rakish men either bite their lips in impotent confusion at her repartees or are touched to penitence by her reproofs which on appropriate occasions rise to a lofty strain of rhetoric indeed there is a general propensity in her to make speeches and to rhapsodize at some length when she retires to her bedroom  in her recorded conversations she is amazingly eloquent and in her unrecorded conversations amazingly witty  she is understood to have a depth of insight that looks through and through the shallow theories of philosophers and her superior instincts are a sort of dial by which men have only to set their clocks and watches and all will go well  the men play a very subordinate part by her side  you are consoled now and then by a hint that they have affairs which keeps you in mind that the workingday business of the world is somehow being carried on but ostensibly the final cause of their existence is that they may accompany the heroine on her “starring” expedition through life  they see her at a ball and they are dazzled at a flowershow and they are fascinated on a riding excursion and they are witched by her noble horsemanship at church and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her demeanor  she is the ideal woman in feelings faculties and flounces  for all this she as often as not marries the wrong person to begin with and she suffers terribly from the plots and intrigues of the vicious baronet but even death has a soft place in his heart for such a paragon and remedies all mistakes for her just at the right moment  the vicious baronet is sure to be killed in a duel and the tedious husband dies in his bed requesting his wife as a particular favor to him to marry the man she loves best and having already dispatched a note to the lover informing him of the comfortable arrangement  before matters arrive at this desirable issue our feelings are tried by seeing the noble lovely and gifted heroine pass through many mauvais moments but we have the satisfaction of knowing that her sorrows are wept into embroidered pockethandkerchiefs that her fainting form reclines on the very best upholstery and that whatever vicissitudes she may undergo from being dashed out of her carriage to having her head shaved in a fever she comes out of them all with a complexion more blooming and locks more redundant than ever  we may remark by the way that we have been relieved from a serious scruple by discovering that silly novels by lady novelists rarely introduce us into any other than very lofty and fashionable society  we had imagined that destitute women turned novelists as they turned governesses because they had no other “ladylike” means of getting their bread  on this supposition vacillating syntax and improbable incident had a certain pathos for us like the extremely supererogatory pincushions and illdevised nightcaps that are offered for sale by a blind man  we felt the commodity to be a nuisance but we were glad to think that the money went to relieve the necessitous and we pictured to ourselves lonely women struggling for a maintenance or wives and daughters devoting themselves to the production of “copy” out of pure heroism—perhaps to pay their husband’s debts or to purchase luxuries for a sick father  under these impressions we shrank from criticising a lady’s novel her english might be faulty but we said to ourselves her motives are irreproachable her imagination may be uninventive but her patience is untiring  empty writing was excused by an empty stomach and twaddle was consecrated by tears  but no  this theory of ours like many other pretty theories has had to give way before observation women’s silly novels we are now convinced are written under totally different circumstances  the fair writers have evidently never talked to a tradesman except from a carriage window they have no notion of the workingclasses except as “dependents” they think five hundred a year a miserable pittance belgravia and “baronial halls” are their primary truths and they have no idea of feeling interest in any man who is not at least a great landed proprietor if not a prime minister  it is clear that they write in elegant boudoirs with violetcolored ink and a ruby pen that they must be entirely indifferent to publishers’ accounts and inexperienced in every form of poverty except poverty of brains  it is true that we are constantly struck with the want of verisimilitude in their representations of the high society in which they seem to live but then they betray no closer acquaintance with any other form of life  if their peers and peeresses are improbable their literary men tradespeople and cottagers are impossible and their intellect seems to have the peculiar impartiality of reproducing both what they have seen and heard and what they have not seen and heard with equal unfaithfulness  there are few women we suppose who have not seen something of children under five years of age yet in “compensation” a recent novel of the mindandmillinery species which calls itself a “story of real life” we have a child of four and a half years old talking in this ossianic fashion      “‘oh i am so happy dear grand mamma—i have seen—i have seen such a     delightful person he is like everything beautiful—like the smell of     sweet flowers and the view from ben lemond—or no better than     that—he is like what i think of and see when i am very very happy     and he is really like mamma too when she sings and his forehead is     like that distant sea’ she continued pointing to the blue     mediterranean ‘there seems no end—no end or like the clusters of     stars i like best to look at on a warm fine night    don’t look     so    your forehead is like loch lomond when the wind is blowing     and the sun is gone in i like the sunshine best when the lake is     smooth    so now—i like it better than ever    it is more     beautiful still from the dark cloud that has gone over it when the     sun suddenly lights up all the colors of the forests and shining     purple rocks and it is all reflected in the waters below’”  we are not surprised to learn that the mother of this infant phenomenon who exhibits symptoms so alarmingly like those of adolescence repressed by gin is herself a phœnix  we are assured again and again that she had a remarkably original in mind that she was a genius and “conscious of her originality” and she was fortunate enough to have a lover who was also a genius and a man of “most original mind”  this lover we read though “wonderfully similar” to her “in powers and capacity” was “infinitely superior to her in faith and development” and she saw in him “‘agape’—so rare to find—of which she had read and admired the meaning in her greek testament having from her great facility in learning languages read the scriptures in their original tongues” of course  greek and hebrew are mere play to a heroine sanscrit is no more than a b c to her and she can talk with perfect correctness in any language except english  she is a polking polyglot a creuzer in crinoline  poor men  there are so few of you who know even hebrew you think it something to boast of if like bolingbroke you only “understand that sort of learning and what is writ about it” and you are perhaps adoring women who can think slightingly of you in all the semitic languages successively  but then as we are almost invariably told that a heroine has a “beautifully small head” and as her intellect has probably been early invigorated by an attention to costume and deportment we may conclude that she can pick up the oriental tongues to say nothing of their dialects with the same aërial facility that the butterfly sips nectar  besides there can be no difficulty in conceiving the depth of the heroine’s erudition when that of the authoress is so evident  in “laura gay” another novel of the same school the heroine seems less at home in greek and hebrew but she makes up for the deficiency by a quite playful familiarity with the latin classics—with the “dear old virgil” “the graceful horace the humane cicero and the pleasant livy” indeed it is such a matter of course with her to quote latin that she does it at a picnic in a very mixed company of ladies and gentlemen having we are told “no conception that the nobler sex were capable of jealousy on this subject  and if indeed” continues the biographer of laura gray “the wisest and noblest portion of that sex were in the majority no such sentiment would exist but while miss wyndhams and mr redfords abound great sacrifices must be made to their existence”  such sacrifices we presume as abstaining from latin quotations of extremely moderate interest and applicability which the wise and noble minority of the other sex would be quite as willing to dispense with as the foolish and ignoble majority  it is as little the custom of wellbred men as of wellbred women to quote latin in mixed parties they can contain their familiarity with “the humane cicero” without allowing it to boil over in ordinary conversation and even references to “the pleasant livy” are not absolutely irrepressible  but ciceronian latin is the mildest form of miss gay’s conversational power  being on the palatine with a party of sightseers she falls into the following vein of wellrounded remark “truth can only be pure objectively for even in the creeds where it predominates being subjective and parcelled out into portions each of these necessarily receives a hue of idiosyncrasy that is a taint of superstition more or less strong while in such creeds as the roman catholic ignorance interest the basis of ancient idolatries and the force of authority have gradually accumulated on the pure truth and transformed it at last into a mass of superstition for the majority of its votaries and how few are there alas whose zeal courage and intellectual energy are equal to the analysis of this accumulation and to the discovery of the pearl of great price which lies hidden beneath this heap of rubbish”  we have often met with women much more novel and profound in their observations than laura gay but rarely with any so inopportunely longwinded  a clerical lord who is half in love with her is alarmed by the daring remarks just quoted and begins to suspect that she is inclined to freethinking  but he is mistaken when in a moment of sorrow he delicately begs leave to “recall to her memory a depôt of strength and consolation under affliction which until we are hard pressed by the trials of life we are too apt to forget” we learn that she really has “recurrence to that sacred depôt” together with the teapot  there is a certain flavor of orthodoxy mixed with the parade of fortunes and fine carriages in “laura gay” but it is an orthodoxy mitigated by study of “the humane cicero” and by an “intellectual disposition to analyze”  “compensation” is much more heavily dosed with doctrine but then it has a treble amount of snobbish worldliness and absurd incident to tickle the palate of pious frivolity  linda the heroine is still more speculative and spiritual than laura gay but she has been “presented” and has more and far grander lovers very wicked and fascinating women are introduced—even a french lionne and no expense is spared to get up as exciting a story as you will find in the most immoral novels  in fact it is a wonderful pot pourri of almack’s scotch secondsight mr rogers’s breakfasts italian brigands deathbed conversions superior authoresses italian mistresses and attempts at poisoning old ladies the whole served up with a garnish of talk about “faith and development” and “most original minds”  even miss susan barton the superior authoress whose pen moves in a “quick decided manner when she is composing” declines the finest opportunities of marriage and though old enough to be linda’s mother since we are told that she refused linda’s father has her hand sought by a young earl the heroine’s rejected lover  of course genius and morality must be backed by eligible offers or they would seem rather a dull affair and piety like other things in order to be comme il faut must be in “society” and have admittance to the best circles  “rank and beauty” is a more frothy and less religious variety of the mindandmillinery species  the heroine we are told “if she inherited her father’s pride of birth and her mother’s beauty of person had in herself a tone of enthusiastic feeling that perhaps belongs to her age even in the lowly born but which is refined into the high spirit of wild romance only in the far descended who feel that it is their best inheritance”  this enthusiastic young lady by dint of reading the newspaper to her father falls in love with the prime minister who through the medium of leading articles and “the resumé of the debates” shines upon her imagination as a bright particular star which has no parallax for her living in the country as simple miss wyndham  but she forthwith becomes baroness umfraville in her own right astonishes the world with her beauty and accomplishments when she bursts upon it from her mansion in spring gardens and as you foresee will presently come into contact with the unseen objet aimé  perhaps the words “prime minister” suggest to you a wrinkled or obese sexagenarian but pray dismiss the image  lord rupert conway has been “called while still almost a youth to the first situation which a subject can hold in the universe” and even leading articles and a resumé of the debates have not conjured up a dream that surpasses the fact      “the door opened again and lord rupert conway entered  evelyn gave     one glance  it was enough she was not disappointed  it seemed as     if a picture on which she had long gazed was suddenly instinct with     life and had stepped from its frame before her  his tall figure     the distinguished simplicity of his air—it was a living vandyke a     cavalier one of his noble cavalier ancestors or one to whom her     fancy had always likened him who long of yore had with an umfraville     fought the paynim far beyond the sea  was this reality”  very little like it certainly  by and by it becomes evident that the ministerial heart is touched  lady umfraville is on a visit to the queen at windsor and—      “the last evening of her stay when they returned from riding mr     wyndham took her and a large party to the top of the keep to see the     view  she was leaning on the battlements gazing from that ‘stately     height’ at the prospect beneath her when lord rupert was by her     side  ‘what an unrivalled view’ exclaimed she      “‘yes it would have been wrong to go without having been up here     you are pleased with your visit’      “‘enchanted  a queen to live and die under to live and die for’      “‘ha’ cried he with sudden emotion and with a eureka expression     of countenance as if he had indeed found a heart in unison with his     own”  the “eureka expression of countenance” you see at once to be prophetic of marriage at the end of the third volume but before that desirable consummation there are very complicated misunderstandings arising chiefly from the vindictive plotting of sir luttrel wycherley who is a genius a poet and in every way a most remarkable character indeed  he is not only a romantic poet but a hardened rake and a cynical wit yet his deep passion for lady umfraville has so impoverished his epigrammatic talent that he cuts an extremely poor figure in conversation  when she rejects him he rushes into the shrubbery and rolls himself in the dirt and on recovering devotes himself to the most diabolical and laborious schemes of vengeance in the course of which he disguises himself as a quack physician and enters into general practice foreseeing that evelyn will fall ill and that he shall be called in to attend her  at last when all his schemes are frustrated he takes leave of her in a long letter written as you will perceive from the following passage entirely in the style of an eminent literary man      “oh lady nursed in pomp and pleasure will you ever cast one     thought upon the miserable being who addresses you  will you ever     as your gilded galley is floating down the unruffled stream of     prosperity will you ever while lulled by the sweetest music—thine     own praises—hear the faroff sigh from that world to which i am     going”  on the whole however frothy as it is we rather prefer “rank and beauty” to the two other novels we have mentioned  the dialogue is more natural and spirited there is some frank ignorance and no pedantry and you are allowed to take the heroine’s astounding intellect upon trust without being called on to read her conversational refutations of sceptics and philosophers or her rhetorical solutions of the mysteries of the universe  writers of the mindandmillinery school are remarkably unanimous in their choice of diction  in their novels there is usually a lady or gentleman who is more or less of a upas tree the lover has a manly breast minds are redolent of various things hearts are hollow events are utilized friends are consigned to the tomb infancy is an engaging period the sun is a luminary that goes to his western couch or gathers the raindrops into his refulgent bosom life is a melancholy boon albion and scotia are conversational epithets  there is a striking resemblance too in the character of their moral comments such for instance as that “it is a fact no less true than melancholy that all people more or less richer or poorer are swayed by bad example” that “books however trivial contain some subjects from which useful information may be drawn” that “vice can too often borrow the language of virtue” that “merit and nobility of nature must exist to be accepted for clamor and pretension cannot impose upon those too well read in human nature to be easily deceived” and that “in order to forgive we must have been injured”  there is doubtless a class of readers to whom these remarks appear peculiarly pointed and pungent for we often find them doubly and trebly scored with the pencil and delicate hands giving in their determined adhesion to these hardy novelties by a distinct très vrai emphasized by many notes of exclamation  the colloquial style of these novels is often marked by much ingenious inversion and a careful avoidance of such cheap phraseology as can be heard every day  angry young gentlemen exclaim “’tis ever thus methinks” and in the half hour before dinner a young lady informs her next neighbor that the first day she read shakespeare she “stole away into the park and beneath the shadow of the greenwood tree devoured with rapture the inspired page of the great magician”  but the most remarkable efforts of the mindandmillinery writers lie in their philosophic reflections  the authoress of “laura gay” for example having married her hero and heroine improves the event by observing that “if those sceptics whose eyes have so long gazed on matter that they can no longer see aught else in man could once enter with heart and soul into such bliss as this they would come to say that the soul of man and the polypus are not of common origin or of the same texture”  lady novelists it appears can see something else besides matter they are not limited to phenomena but can relieve their eyesight by occasional glimpses of the noumenon and are therefore naturally better able than any one else to confound sceptics even of that remarkable but to us unknown school which maintains that the soul of man is of the same texture as the polypus  the most pitiable of all silly novels by lady novelists are what we may call the oracular species—novels intended to expound the writer’s religious philosophical or moral theories  there seems to be a notion abroad among women rather akin to the superstition that the speech and actions of idiots are inspired and that the human being most entirely exhausted of commonsense is the fittest vehicle of revelation  to judge from their writings there are certain ladies who think that an amazing ignorance both of science and of life is the best possible qualification for forming an opinion on the knottiest moral and speculative questions  apparently their recipe for solving all such difficulties is something like this take a woman’s head stuff it with a smattering of philosophy and literature chopped small and with false notions of society baked hard let it hang over a desk a few hours every day and serve up hot in feeble english when not required  you will rarely meet with a lady novelist of the oracular class who is diffident of her ability to decide on theological questions—who has any suspicion that she is not capable of discriminating with the nicest accuracy between the good and evil in all church parties—who does not see precisely how it is that men have gone wrong hitherto—and pity philosophers in general that they have not had the opportunity of consulting her  great writers who have modestly contented themselves with putting their experience into fiction and have thought it quite a sufficient task to exhibit men and things as they are she sighs over as deplorably deficient in the application of their powers  “they have solved no great questions”—and she is ready to remedy their omission by setting before you a complete theory of life and manual of divinity in a love story where ladies and gentlemen of good family go through genteel vicissitudes to the utter confusion of deists puseyites and ultraprotestants and to the perfect establishment of that peculiar view of christianity which either condenses itself into a sentence of small caps or explodes into a cluster of stars on the three hundred and thirtieth page  it is true the ladies and gentlemen will probably seem to you remarkably little like any you have had the fortune or misfortune to meet with for as a general rule the ability of a lady novelist to describe actual life and her fellowmen is in inverse proportion to her confident eloquence about god and the other world and the means by which she usually chooses to conduct you to true ideas of the invisible is a totally false picture of the visible  as typical a novel of the oracular kind as we can hope to meet with is “the enigma a leaf from the chronicles of the wolchorley house”  the “enigma” which this novel is to solve is certainly one that demands powers no less gigantic than those of a lady novelist being neither more nor less than the existence of evil  the problem is stated and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page  the spirited young lady with raven hair says “all life is an inextricable confusion” and the meek young lady with auburn hair looks at the picture of the madonna which she is copying and—“there seemed the solution of that mighty enigma”  the style of this novel is quite as lofty as its purpose indeed some passages on which we have spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach in spite of the illustrative aid of italics and small caps and we must await further “development” in order to understand them  of ernest the model young clergyman who sets every one right on all occasions we read that “he held not of marriage in the marketable kind after a social desecration” that on one eventful night “sleep had not visited his divided heart where tumultuated in varied type and combination the aggregate feelings of grief and joy” and that “for the marketable human article he had no toleration be it of what sort or set for what value it might whether for worship or class his upright soul abhorred it whose ultimatum the selfdeceiver was to him the great spiritual lie ‘living in a vain show deceiving and being deceived’ since he did not suppose the phylactery and enlarged border on the garment to be merely a social trick”  the italics and small caps are the author’s and we hope they assist the reader’s comprehension  of sir lionel the model old gentleman we are told that “the simple ideal of the middle age apart from its anarchy and decadence in him most truly seemed to live again when the ties which knit men together were of heroic cast  the firstborn colors of pristine faith and truth engraven on the common soul of man and blent into the wide arch of brotherhood where the primæval law of order grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind and mutually interdependent” you see clearly of course how colors are first engraven on the soul and then blent into a wide arch on which arch of colors—apparently a rainbow—the law of order grew and multiplied each—apparently the arch and the law—perfect after his kind  if after this you can possibly want any further aid toward knowing what sir lionel was we can tell you that in his soul “the scientific combinations of thought could educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in the primæval pulses which floated as an atmosphere around it” and that when he was sealing a letter “lo the responsive throb in that good man’s bosom echoed back in simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him not as his eye bedewed with love rested too with something of ancestral pride on the undimmed motto of the family—‘loiaute’”  the slightest matters have their vulgarity fumigated out of them by the same elevated style  commonplace people would say that a copy of shakespeare lay on a drawingroom table but the authoress of “the enigma” bent on edifying periphrasis tells you that there lay on the table “that fund of human thought and feeling which teaches the heart through the little name ‘shakespeare’”  a watchman sees a light burning in an upper window rather longer than usual and thinks that people are foolish to sit up late when they have an opportunity of going to bed but lest this fact should seem too low and common it is presented to us in the following striking and metaphysical manner “he marvelled—as a man will think for others in a necessarily separate personality consequently though disallowing it in false mental premise—how differently he should act how gladly he should prize the rest so lightly held of within”  a footman—an ordinary jeames with large calves and aspirated vowels—answers the doorbell and the opportunity is seized to tell you that he was a “type of the large class of pampered menials who follow the curse of cain—‘vagabonds’ on the face of the earth and whose estimate of the human class varies in the graduated scale of money and expenditure    these and such as these o england be the false lights of thy morbid civilization”  we have heard of various “false lights” from dr cumming to robert owen from dr pusey to the spiritrappers but we never before heard of the false light that emanates from plush and powder  in the same way very ordinary events of civilized life are exalted into the most awful crises and ladies in full skirts and manches à la chinoise conduct themselves not unlike the heroines of sanguinary melodramas  mrs percy a shallow woman of the world wishes her son horace to marry the auburnhaired grace she being an heiress but he after the manner of sons falls in love with the ravenhaired kate the heiress’s portionless cousin and moreover grace herself shows every symptom of perfect indifference to horace  in such cases sons are often sulky or fiery mothers are alternately manœuvring and waspish and the portionless young lady often lies awake at night and cries a good deal we are getting used to these things now just as we are used to eclipses of the moon which no longer set us howling and beating tin kettles  we never heard of a lady in a fashionable “front” behaving like mrs percy under these circumstances  happening one day to see horace talking to grace at a window without in the least knowing what they are talking about or having the least reason to believe that grace who is mistress of the house and a person of dignity would accept her son if he were to offer himself she suddenly rushes up to them and clasps them both saying “with a flushed countenance and in an excited manner”—“this is indeed happiness for may i not call you so grace—my grace—my horace’s grace—my dear children”  her son tells her she is mistaken and that he is engaged to kate whereupon we have the following scene and tableau      “gathering herself up to an unprecedented height  her eyes     lightening forth the fire of her anger      “‘wretched boy’ she said hoarsely and scornfully and clenching her     hand ‘take then the doom of your own choice  bow down your     miserable head and let a mother’s—’      “‘curse not’ spake a deep low voice from behind and mrs percy     started scared as though she had seen a heavenly visitant appear     to break upon her in the midst of her sin      “meantime horace had fallen on his knees at her feet and hid his     face in his hands      “who then is she—who  truly his ‘guardian spirit’ hath stepped     between him and the fearful words which however unmerited must     have hung as a pall over his future existence—a spell which could     not be unbound—which could not be unsaid      “of an earthly paleness but calm with the still ironbound calmness     of death—the only calm one there—katherine stood and her words smote     on the ear in tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation     rung on the heart like a chill isolated tolling of some fatal knell      “‘he would have plighted me his faith but i did not accept it you     cannot therefore—you dare not curse him  and here’ she     continued raising her hand to heaven whither her large dark eyes     also rose with a chastened glow which for the first time     suffering had lighted in those passionate orbs—‘here i promise     come weal come woe that horace wolchorley and i do never     interchange vows without his mother’s sanction—without his mother’s     blessing’”  here and throughout the story we see that confusion of purpose which is so characteristic of silly novels written by women  it is a story of quite modern drawingroom society—a society in which polkas are played and puseyism discussed yet we have characters and incidents and traits of manner introduced which are mere shreds from the most heterogeneous romances  we have a blind irish harper “relic of the picturesque bards of yore” startling us at a sundayschool festival of tea and cake in an english village we have a crazy gypsy in a scarlet cloak singing snatches of romantic song and revealing a secret on her deathbed which with the testimony of a dwarfish miserly merchant who salutes strangers with a curse and a devilish laugh goes to prove that ernest the model young clergyman is kate’s brother and we have an ultravirtuous irish barney discovering that a document is forged by comparing the date of the paper with the date of the alleged signature although the same document has passed through a court of law and occasioned a fatal decision  the “hall” in which sir lionel lives is the venerable countryseat of an old family and this we suppose sets the imagination of the authoress flying to donjons and battlements where “lo the warder blows his horn” for as the inhabitants are in their bedrooms on a night certainly within the recollection of pleaceman x and a breeze springs up which we are at first told was faint and then that it made the old cedars bow their branches to the greensward she falls into this mediæval vein of description the italics are ours “the banner unfurled it at the sound and shook its guardian wing above while the startled owl flapped her in the ivy the firmament looking down through her ‘argus eyes’—      ‘ministers of heaven’s mute melodies’  and lo two strokes tolled from out the warder tower and ‘two o’clock’ reechoed its interpreter below”  such stories as this of “the enigma” remind us of the pictures clever children sometimes draw “out of their own head” where you will see a modern villa on the right two knights in helmets fighting in the foreground and a tiger grinning in a jungle on the left the several objects being brought together because the artist thinks each pretty and perhaps still more because he remembers seeing them in other pictures  but we like the authoress much better on her mediæval stilts than on her oracular ones—when she talks of the ich and of “subjective” and “objective” and lays down the exact line of christian verity between “righthand excesses and lefthand declensions”  persons who deviate from this line are introduced with a patronizing air of charity  of a certain miss inshquine she informs us with all the lucidity of italics and small caps that “function not form as the inevitable outer expression of the spirit in this tabernacle age weakly engrossed her” and à propos of miss mayjar an evangelical lady who is a little too apt to talk of her visits to sick women and the state of their souls we are told that the model clergyman is “not one to disallow through the super crust the undercurrent toward good in the subject or the positive benefits nevertheless to the object”  we imagine the doublerefined accent and protrusion of chin which are feebly represented by the italics in this lady’s sentences  we abstain from quoting any of her oracular doctrinal passages because they refer to matters too serious for our pages just now  the epithet “silly” may seem impertinent applied to a novel which indicates so much reading and intellectual activity as “the enigma” but we use this epithet advisedly  if as the world has long agreed a very great amount of instruction will not make a wise man still less will a very mediocre amount of instruction make a wise woman  and the most mischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary form because it tends to confirm the popular prejudice against the more solid education of women  when men see girls wasting their time in consultations about bonnets and ball dresses and in giggling or sentimental loveconfidences or middleaged women mismanaging their children and solacing themselves with acrid gossip they can hardly help saying “for heaven’s sake let girls be better educated let them have some better objects of thought—some more solid occupations”  but after a few hours’ conversation with an oracular literary woman or a few hours’ reading of her books they are likely enough to say “after all when a woman gets some knowledge see what use she makes of it  her knowledge remains acquisition instead of passing into culture instead of being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and fact she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments she keeps a sort of mental pocketmirror and is continually looking in it at her own ‘intellectuality’ she spoils the taste of one’s muffin by questions of metaphysics ‘puts down’ men at a dinnertable with her superior information and seizes the opportunity of a soirée to catechise us on the vital question of the relation between mind and matter  and then look at her writings  she mistakes vagueness for depth bombast for eloquence and affectation for originality she struts on one page rolls her eyes on another grimaces in a third and is hysterical in a fourth she may have read many writings of great men and a few writings of great women but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own style and theirs as a yorkshireman is to discern the difference between his own english and a londoner’s rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect  no—the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a soil to bear much tillage it is only fit for the very lightest crops”  it is true that the men who come to such a decision on such very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the wisest in the world but we have not now to contest their opinion—we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as representatives of the feminine intellect  we do not believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by associating with a woman of true culture whose mind had absorbed her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it  a really cultured woman like a really cultured man is all the simpler and the less obtrusive for her knowledge it has made her see herself and her opinions in something like just proportions she does not make it a pedestal from which she flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and things but makes it a point of observation from which to form a right estimate of herself she neither spouts poetry nor quotes cicero on slight provocation not because she thinks that a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men but because that mode of exhibiting her memory and latinity does not present itself to her as edifying or graceful  she does not write books to confound philosophers perhaps because she is able to write books that delight them  in conversation she is the least formidable of women because she understands you without wanting to make you aware that you can’t understand her  she does not give you information which is the raw material of culture—she gives you sympathy which is its subtlest essence  a more numerous class of silly novels than the oracular which are generally inspired by some form of high church or transcendental christianity is what we may call the white neckcloth species which represent the tone of thought and feeling in the evangelical party  this species is a kind of genteel tract on a large scale intended as a sort of medicinal sweetmeat for low church young ladies an evangelical substitute for the fashionable novel as the may meetings are a substitute for the opera  even quaker children one would think can hardly have been denied the indulgence of a doll but it must be a doll dressed in a drab gown and a coalscuttlebonnet—not a worldly doll in gauze and spangles  and there are no young ladies we imagine—unless they belong to the church of the united brethren in which people are married without any lovemaking—who can dispense with love stories thus for evangelical young ladies there are evangelical love stories in which the vicissitudes of the tender passion are sanctified by saving views of regeneration and the atonement  these novels differ from the oracular ones as a low churchwoman often differs from a high churchwoman they are a little less supercilious and a great deal more ignorant a little less correct in their syntax and a great deal more vulgar  the orlando of evangelical literature is the young curate looked at from the point of view of the middle class where cambric bands are understood to have as thrilling an effect on the hearts of young ladies as epaulettes have in the classes above and below it  in the ordinary type of these novels the hero is almost sure to be a young curate frowned upon perhaps by worldly mammas but carrying captive the hearts of their daughters who can “never forget that sermon” tender glances are seized from the pulpit stairs instead of the operabox têteàtêtes are seasoned with quotations from scripture instead of quotations from the poets and questions as to the state of the heroine’s affections are mingled with anxieties as to the state of her soul  the young curate always has a background of welldressed and wealthy if not fashionable society—for evangelical silliness is as snobbish as any other kind of silliness—and the evangelical lady novelist while she explains to you the type of the scapegoat on one page is ambitious on another to represent the manners and conversations of aristocratic people  her pictures of fashionable society are often curious studies considered as efforts of the evangelical imagination but in one particular the novels of the white neckcloth school are meritoriously realistic—their favorite hero the evangelical young curate is always rather an insipid personage  the most recent novel of this species that we happen to have before us is “the old grey church”  it is utterly tame and feeble there is no one set of objects on which the writer seems to have a stronger grasp than on any other and we should be entirely at a loss to conjecture among what phases of life her experience has been gained but for certain vulgarisms of style which sufficiently indicate that she has had the advantage though she has been unable to use it of mingling chiefly with men and women whose manners and characters have not had all their bosses and angles rubbed down by refined conventionalism  it is less excusable in an evangelical novelist than in any other gratuitously to seek her subjects among titles and carriages  the real drama of evangelicalism—and it has abundance of fine drama for any one who has genius enough to discern and reproduce it—lies among the middle and lower classes and are not evangelical opinions understood to give an especial interest in the weak things of the earth rather than in the mighty why then cannot our evangelical lady novelists show us the operation of their religious views among people there really are many such in the world who keep no carriage “not so much as a brassbound gig” who even manage to eat their dinner without a silver fork and in whose mouths the authoress’s questionable english would be strictly consistent  why can we not have pictures of religious life among the industrial classes in england as interesting as mrs stowe’s pictures of religious life among the negroes  instead of this pious ladies nauseate us with novels which remind us of what we sometimes see in a worldly woman recently “converted”—she is as fond of a fine dinnertable as before but she invites clergymen instead of beaux she thinks as much of her dress as before but she adopts a more sober choice of colors and patterns her conversation is as trivial as before but the triviality is flavored with gospel instead of gossip  in “the old grey church” we have the same sort of evangelical travesty of the fashionable novel and of course the vicious intriguing baronet is not wanting  it is worth while to give a sample of the style of conversation attributed to this highborn rake—a style that in its profuse italics and palpable innuendoes is worthy of miss squeers  in an evening visit to the ruins of the colosseum eustace the young clergyman has been withdrawing the heroine miss lushington from the rest of the party for the sake of a têteàtête the baronet is jealous and vents his pique in this way      “there they are and miss lushington no doubt quite safe for she     is under the holy guidance of pope eustace the first who has of     course been delivering to her an edifying homily on the wickedness     of the heathens of yore who as tradition tells us in this very     place let loose the wild beastises on poor st paul—oh no by the     bye i believe i am wrong and betraying my want of clergy and that     it was not at all st paul nor was it here  but no matter it would     equally serve as a text to preach from and from which to diverge to     the degenerate heathen christians of the present day and all their     naughty practices and so end with an exhortation to ‘come but from     among them and be separate’—and i am sure miss lushington you     have most scrupulously conformed to that injunction this evening for     we have seen nothing of you since our arrival  but every one seems     agreed it has been a charming party of pleasure and i am sure we     all feel much indebted to mr gray for having suggested it and     as he seems so capital a cicerone i hope he will think of something     else equally agreeable to all”  this drivelling kind of dialogue and equally drivelling narrative which like a bad drawing represents nothing and barely indicates what is meant to be represented runs through the book and we have no doubt is considered by the amiable authoress to constitute an improving novel which christian mothers will do well to put into the hands of their daughters  but everything is relative we have met with american vegetarians whose normal diet was dry meal and who when their appetite wanted stimulating tickled it with wet meal and so we can imagine that there are evangelical circles in which “the old grey church” is devoured as a powerful and interesting fiction  but perhaps the least readable of silly women’s novels are the modernantique species which unfold to us the domestic life of jannes and jambres the private love affairs of sennacherib or the mental struggles and ultimate conversion of demetrius the silversmith  from most silly novels we can at least extract a laugh but those of the modernantique school have a ponderous a leaden kind of fatuity under which we groan  what can be more demonstrative of the inability of literary women to measure their own powers than their frequent assumption of a task which can only be justified by the rarest concurrence of acquirement with genius  the finest effort to reanimate the past is of course only approximative—is always more or less an infusion of the modern spirit into the ancient form—      was ihr den geist der zeiten heisst     das ist im grund der herren eigner geist     in dem die zeiten sich bespiegeln  admitting that genius which has familiarized itself with all the relics of an ancient period can sometimes by the force of its sympathetic divination restore the missing notes in the “music of humanity” and reconstruct the fragments into a whole which will really bring the remote past nearer to us and interpret it to our duller apprehension—this form of imaginative power must always be among the very rarest because it demands as much accurate and minute knowledge as creative vigor  yet we find ladies constantly choosing to make their mental mediocrity more conspicuous by clothing it in a masquerade of ancient names by putting their feeble sentimentality into the mouths of roman vestals or egyptian princesses and attributing their rhetorical arguments to jewish highpriests and greek philosophers  a recent example of this heavy imbecility is “adonijah a tale of the jewish dispersion” which forms part of a series “uniting” we are told “taste humor and sound principles”  “adonijah” we presume exemplifies the tale of “sound principles” the taste and humor are to be found in other members of the series  we are told on the cover that the incidents of this tale are “fraught with unusual interest” and the preface winds up thus “to those who feel interested in the dispersed of israel and judea these pages may afford perhaps information on an important subject as well as amusement”  since the “important subject” on which this book is to afford information is not specified it may possibly lie in some esoteric meaning to which we have no key but if it has relation to the dispersed of israel and judea at any period of their history we believe a tolerably wellinformed schoolgirl already knows much more of it than she will find in this “tale of the jewish dispersion”  “adonijah” is simply the feeblest kind of love story supposed to be instructive we presume because the hero is a jewish captive and the heroine a roman vestal because they and their friends are converted to christianity after the shortest and easiest method approved by the “society for promoting the conversion of the jews” and because instead of being written in plain language it is adorned with that peculiar style of grandiloquence which is held by some lady novelists to give an antique coloring and which we recognize at once in such phrases as these—“the splendid regnal talent undoubtedly possessed by the emperor nero”—“the expiring scion of a lofty stem”—“the virtuous partner of his couch”—“ah by vesta”—and “i tell thee roman”  among the quotations which serve at once for instruction and ornament on the cover of this volume there is one from miss sinclair which informs us that “works of imagination are avowedly read by men of science wisdom and piety” from which we suppose the reader is to gather the cheering inference that dr daubeny mr mill or mr maurice may openly indulge himself with the perusal of “adonijah” without being obliged to secrete it among the sofa cushions or read it by snatches under the dinnertable                                        “be not a baker if your head be made of butter” says a homely proverb which being interpreted may mean let no woman rush into print who is not prepared for the consequences  we are aware that our remarks are in a very different tone from that of the reviewers who with perennial recurrence of precisely similar emotions only paralleled we imagine in the experience of monthly nurses tell one lady novelist after another that they “hail” her productions “with delight”  we are aware that the ladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be told in the choicest phraseology of puffery that their pictures of life are brilliant their characters well drawn their style fascinating and their sentiments lofty  but if they are inclined to resent our plainness of speech we ask them to reflect for a moment on the chary praise and often captious blame which their panegyrists give to writers whose works are on the way to become classics  no sooner does a woman show that she has genius or effective talent than she receives the tribute of being moderately praised and severely criticised  by a peculiar thermometric adjustment when a woman’s talent is at zero journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch when she attains mediocrity it is already at no more than summer heat and if ever she reaches excellence critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point  harriet martineau currer bell and mrs gaskell have been treated as cavalierly as if they had been men and every critic who forms a high estimate of the share women may ultimately take in literature will on principle abstain from any exceptional indulgence toward the productions of literary women  for it must be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively into feminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due hardly more to the want of intellectual power than to the want of those moral qualities that contribute to literary excellence—patient diligence a sense of the responsibility involved in publication and an appreciation of the sacredness of the writer’s art  in the majority of woman’s books you see that kind of facility which springs from the absence of any high standard that fertility in imbecile combination or feeble imitation which a little selfcriticism would check and reduce to barrenness just as with a total want of musical ear people will sing out of tune while a degree more melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent  the foolish vanity of wishing to appear in print instead of being counterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or moral derogation implied in futile authorship seems to be encouraged by the extremely false impression that to write at all is a proof of superiority in a woman  on this ground we believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly represented by the mass of feminine literature and that while the few women who write well are very far above the ordinary intellectual level of their sex the many women who write ill are very far below it  so that after all the severer critics are fulfilling a chivalrous duty in depriving the mere fact of feminine authorship of any false prestige which may give it a delusive attraction and in recommending women of mediocre faculties—as at least a negative service they can render their sex—to abstain from writing  the standing apology for women who become writers without any special qualification is that society shuts them out from other spheres of occupation  society is a very culpable entity and has to answer for the manufacture of many unwholesome commodities from bad pickles to bad poetry  but society like “matter” and her majesty’s government and other lofty abstractions has its share of excessive blame as well as excessive praise  where there is one woman who writes from necessity we believe there are three women who write from vanity and besides there is something so antispetic in the mere healthy fact of working for one’s bread that the most trashy and rotten kind of feminine literature is not likely to have been produced under such circumstances  “in all labor there is profit” but ladies’ silly novels we imagine are less the result of labor than of busy idleness  happily we are not dependent on argument to prove that fiction is a department of literature in which women can after their kind fully equal men  a cluster of great names both living and dead rush to our memories in evidence that women can produce novels not only fine but among the very finest—novels too that have a precious speciality lying quite apart from masculine aptitudes and experience  no educational restrictions can shut women out from the materials of fiction and there is no species of art which is so free from rigid requirements  like crystalline masses it may take any form and yet be beautiful we have only to pour in the right elements—genuine observation humor and passion  but it is precisely this absence of rigid requirement which constitutes the fatal seduction of novelwriting to incompetent women ladies are not wont to be very grossly deceived as to their power of playing on the piano here certain positive difficulties of execution have to be conquered and incompetence inevitably breaks down  every art which had its absolute technique is to a certain extent guarded from the intrusions of mere lefthanded imbecility  but in novelwriting there are no barriers for incapacity to stumble against no external criteria to prevent a writer from mistaking foolish facility for mastery and so we have again and again the old story of la fontaine’s ass who pats his nose to the flute and finding that he elicits some sound exclaims “moi aussie je joue de la flute”—a fable which we commend at parting to the consideration of any feminine reader who is in danger of adding to the number of “silly novels by lady novelists”    vii  worldliness and otherworldliness the poet young 205   the study of men as they have appeared in different ages and under various social conditions may be considered as the natural history of the race  let us then for a moment imagine ourselves as students of this natural history “dredging” the first half of the eighteenth century in search of specimens  about the year 1730 we have hauled up a remarkable individual of the species divine—a surprising name considering the nature of the animal before us but we are used to unsuitable names in natural history  let us examine this individual at our leisure  he is on the verge of fifty and has recently undergone his metamorphosis into the clerical form  rather a paradoxical specimen if you observe him narrowly a sort of cross between a sycophant and a psalmist a poet whose imagination is alternately fired by the “last day” and by a creation of peers who fluctuates between rhapsodic applause of king george and rhapsodic applause of jehovah  after spending “a foolish youth the sport of peers and poets” after being a hangeron of the profligate duke of wharton after aiming in vain at a parliamentary career and angling for pensions and preferment with fulsome dedications and fustian odes he is a little disgusted with his imperfect success and has determined to retire from the general mendicancy business to a particular branch in other words he has determined on that renunciation of the world implied in “taking orders” with the prospect of a good living and an advantageous matrimonial connection  and no man can be better fitted for an established church  he personifies completely her nice balance of temporalities and spiritualities  he is equally impressed with the momentousness of death and of burial fees he languishes at once for immortal life and for “livings” he has a fervid attachment to patrons in general but on the whole prefers the almighty he will teach with something more than official conviction the nothingness of earthly things and he will feel something more than private disgust if his meritorious efforts in directing men’s attention to another world are not rewarded by substantial preferment in this  his secular man believes in cambric bands and silk stockings as characteristic attire for “an ornament of religion and virtue” hopes courtiers will never forget to copy sir robert walpole and writes begging letters to the king’s mistress  his spiritual man recognizes no motives more familiar than golgotha and “the skies” it walks in graveyards or it soars among the stars  his religion exhausts itself in ejaculations and rebukes and knows no medium between the ecstatic and the sententious  if it were not for the prospect of immortality he considers it would be wise and agreeable to be indecent or to murder one’s father and heaven apart it would be extremely irrational in any man not to be a knave  man he thinks is a compound of the angel and the brute the brute is to be humbled by being reminded of its “relation to the stalls” and frightened into moderation by the contemplation of deathbeds and skulls the angel is to be developed by vituperating this world and exalting the next and by this double process you get the christian—“the highest style of man”  with all this our newmade divine is an unmistakable poet  to a clay compounded chiefly of the worldling and the rhetorician there is added a real spark of promethean fire  he will one day clothe his apostrophes and objurgations his astronomical religion and his charnelhouse morality in lasting verse which will stand like a juggernaut made of gold and jewels at once magnificent and repulsive for this divine is edward young the future author of the “night thoughts”  it would be extremely illbred in us to suppose that our readers are not acquainted with the facts of young’s life they are among the things that “every one knows” but we have observed that with regard to these universally known matters the majority of readers like to be treated after the plan suggested by monsieur jourdain  when that distinguished bourgeois was asked if he knew latin he implied “oui mais faîtes comme si je ne le savais pas”  assuming then as a polite writer should that our readers know everything about young it will be a direct sequitur from that assumption that we should proceed as if they knew nothing and recall the incidents of his biography with as much particularity as we may without trenching on the space we shall need for our main purpose—the reconsideration of his character as a moral and religious poet  judging from young’s works one might imagine that the preacher had been organized in him by hereditary transmission through a long line of clerical forefathers—that the diamonds of the “night thoughts” had been slowly condensed from the charcoal of ancestral sermons  yet it was not so  his grandfather apparently wrote himself gentleman not clerk and there is no evidence that preaching had run in the family blood before it took that turn in the person of the poet’s father who was quadruply clerical being at once rector prebendary court chaplain and dean  young was born at his father’s rectory of upham in 1681  we may confidently assume that even the author of the “night thoughts” came into the world without a wig but apart from dr doran’s authority we should not have ventured to state that the excellent rector “kissed with dignified emotion his only son and intended namesake”  dr doran doubtless knows this from his intimate acquaintance with clerical physiology and psychology  he has ascertained that the paternal emotions of prebendaries have a sacerdotal quality and that the very chyme and chyle of a rector are conscious of the gown and band  in due time the boy went to winchester college and subsequently though not till he was twentytwo to oxford where for his father’s sake he was befriended by the wardens of two colleges and in 1708 three years after his father’s death nominated by archbishop tenison to a law fellowship at all souls  of young’s life at oxford in these years hardly anything is known  his biographer croft has nothing to tell us but the vague report that when “young found himself independent and his own master at all souls he was not the ornament to religion and morality that he afterward became” and the perhaps apocryphal anecdote that tindal the atheist confessed himself embarrassed by the originality of young’s arguments  both the report and the anecdote however are borne out by indirect evidence  as to the latter young has left us sufficient proof that he was fond of arguing on the theological side and that he had his own way of treating old subjects  as to the former we learn that pope after saying other things which we know to be true of young added that he passed “a foolish youth the sport of peers and poets” and from all the indications we possess of his career till he was nearly fifty we are inclined to think that pope’s statement only errs by defect and that he should rather have said “a foolish youth and middle age”  it is not likely that young was a very hard student for he impressed johnson who saw him in his old age as “not a great scholar” and as surprisingly ignorant of what johnson thought “quite common maxims” in literature and there is no evidence that he filled either his leisure or his purse by taking pupils  his career as an author did not commence till he was nearly thirty even dating from the publication of a portion of the “last day” in the tatler so that he could hardly have been absorbed in composition  but where the fully developed insect is parasitic we believe the larva is usually parasitic also and we shall probably not be far wrong in supposing that young at oxford as elsewhere spent a good deal of his time in hanging about possible and actual patrons and accommodating himself to the habits with considerable flexibility of conscience and of tongue being none the less ready upon occasion to present himself as the champion of theology and to rhapsodize at convenient moments in the company of the skies or of skulls  that brilliant profligate the duke of wharton to whom young afterward clung as his chief patron was at this time a mere boy and though it is probable that their intimacy had commenced since the duke’s father and mother were friends of the old dean that intimacy ought not to aggravate any unfavorable inference as to young’s oxford life  it is less likely that he fell into any exceptional vice than that he differed from the men around him chiefly in his episodes of theological advocacy and rhapsodic solemnity  he probably sowed his wild oats after the coarse fashion of his times for he has left us sufficient evidence that his moral sense was not delicate but his companions who were occupied in sowing their own oats perhaps took it as a matter of course that he should be a rake and were only struck with the exceptional circumstance that he was a pious and moralizing rake  there is some irony in the fact that the two first poetical productions of young published in the same year were his “epistles to lord lansdowne” celebrating the recent creation of peers—lord lansdowne’s creation in particular and the “last day”  other poets besides young found the device for obtaining a tory majority by turning twelve insignificant commoners into insignificant lords an irresistible stimulus to verse but no other poet showed so versatile an enthusiasm—so nearly equal an ardor for the honor of the new baron and the honor of the deity  but the twofold nature of the sycophant and the psalmist is not more strikingly shown in the contrasted themes of the two poems than in the transitions from bombast about monarchs to bombast about the resurrection in the “last day” itself  the dedication of the poem to queen anne young afterward suppressed for he was always ashamed of having flattered a dead patron  in this dedication croft tells us “he gives her majesty praise indeed for her victories but says that the author is more pleased to see her rise from this lower world soaring above the clouds passing the first and second heavens and leaving the fixed stars behind her nor will he lose her there he says but keep her still in view through the boundless spaces on the other side of creation in her journey toward eternal bliss till he behold the heaven of heavens open and angels receiving and conveying her still onward from the stretch of his imagination which tires in her pursuit and falls back again to earth”  the selfcriticism which prompted the suppression of the dedication did not however lead him to improve either the rhyme or the reason of the unfortunate couplet—      “when other bourbons reign in other lands     and if men’s sins forbid not other annes”  in the “epistle to lord lansdowne” young indicates his taste for the drama and there is evidence that his tragedy of “busiris” was “in the theatre” as early as this very year 1713 though it was not brought on the stage till nearly six years later so that young was now very decidedly bent on authorship for which his degree of bcl taken in this year was doubtless a magical equipment  another poem “the force of religion or vanquished love” founded on the execution of lady jane grey and her husband quickly followed showing fertility in feeble and tasteless verse and on the queen’s death in 1714 young lost no time in making a poetical lament for a departed patron a vehicle for extravagant laudation of the new monarch  no further literary production of his appeared until 1716 when a latin oration which he delivered on the foundation of the codrington library at all souls gave him a new opportunity for displaying his alacrity in inflated panegyric  in 1717 it is probable that young accompanied the duke of wharton to ireland though so slender are the materials for his biography that the chief basis for this supposition is a passage in his “conjectures on original composition” written when he was nearly eighty in which he intimates that he had once been in that country  but there are many facts surviving to indicate that for the next eight or nine years young was a sort of attaché of wharton’s  in 1719 according to legal records the duke granted him an annuity in consideration of his having relinquished the office of tutor to lord burleigh with a life annuity of £100 a year on his grace’s assurances that he would provide for him in a much more ample manner  and again from the same evidence it appears that in 1721 young received from wharton a bond for £600 in compensation of expenses incurred in standing for parliament at the duke’s desire and as an earnest of greater services which his grace had promised him on his refraining from the spiritual and temporal advantages of taking orders with a certainty of two livings in the gift of his college  it is clear therefore that lay advancement as long as there was any chance of it had more attractions for young than clerical preferment and that at this time he accepted the duke of wharton as the pilot of his career  a more creditable relation of young’s was his friendship with tickell with whom he was in the habit of interchanging criticisms and to whom in 1719—the same year let us note in which he took his doctor’s degree—he addressed his “lines on the death of addison”  close upon these followed his “paraphrase of part of the book of job” with a dedication to parker recently made lord chancellor showing that the possession of wharton’s patronage did not prevent young from fishing in other waters  he know nothing of parker but that did not prevent him from magnifying the new chancellor’s merits on the other hand he did know wharton but this again did not prevent him from prefixing to his tragedy “the revenge” which appeared in 1721 a dedication attributing to the duke all virtues as well as all accomplishments  in the concluding sentence of this dedication young naïvely indicates that a considerable ingredient in his gratitude was a lively sense of anticipated favors  “my present fortune is his bounty and my future his care which i will venture to say will always be remembered to his honor since he i know intended his generosity as an encouragement to merit through his very pardonable partiality to one who bears him so sincere a duty and respect i happen to receive the benefit of it”  young was economical with his ideas and images he was rarely satisfied with using a clever thing once and this bit of ingenious humility was afterward made to do duty in the “instalment” a poem addressed to walpole      “be this thy partial smile from censure free     ’twas meant for merit though it fell on me”  it was probably “the revenge” that young was writing when as we learn from spence’s anecdotes the duke of wharton gave him a skull with a candle fixed in it as the most appropriate lamp by which to write tragedy  according to young’s dedication the duke was “accessory” to the scenes of this tragedy in a more important way “not only by suggesting the most beautiful incident in them but by making all possible provision for the success of the whole”  a statement which is credible not indeed on the ground of young’s dedicatory assertion but from the known ability of the duke who as pope tells us possessed            “each gift of nature and of art     and wanted nothing but an honest heart”  the year 1722 seems to have been the period of a visit to mr dodington of eastbury in dorsetshire—the “pure dorsetian downs” celebrated by thomson—in which young made the acquaintance of voltaire for in the subsequent dedication of his “sea piece” to “mr voltaire” he recalls their meeting on “dorset downs” and it was in this year that christopher pitt a gentlemanpoet of those days addressed an “epistle to dr edward young at eastbury in dorsetshire” which has at least the merit of this biographical couplet      “while with your dodington retired you sit     charm’d with his flowing burgundy and wit”  dodington apparently was charmed in his turn for he told dr wharton that young was “far superior to the french poet in the variety and novelty of his bonmots and repartees”  unfortunately the only specimen of young’s wit on this occasion that has been preserved to us is the epigram represented as an extempore retort spoken aside surely to voltaire’s criticism of milton’s episode of sin and death      “thou art so witty profligate and thin     at once we think thee milton death and sin”—  an epigram which in the absence of “flowing burgundy” does not strike us as remarkably brilliant  let us give young the benefit of the doubt thrown on the genuineness of this epigram by his own poetical dedication in which he represents himself as having “soothed” voltaire’s “rage” against milton “with gentle rhymes” though in other respects that dedication is anything but favorable to a high estimate of young’s wit other evidence apart we should not be eager for the afterdinner conversation of the man who wrote      “thine is the drama how renown’d     thine epic’s loftier trump to sound—     but let arion’s seastrung harp be mine     but where’s his dolphin  know’st thou where     may that be found in thee voltaire”  the “satires” appeared in 1725 and 1726 each of course with its laudatory dedication and its compliments insinuated among the rhymes the seventh and last is dedicated to sir robert walpole is very short and contains nothing in particular except lunatic flattery of george the first and his prime minister attributing that royal hog’s late escape from a storm at sea to the miraculous influence of his grand and virtuous soul—for george he says rivals the angels      “george who in foes can soft affections raise     and charm envenom’d satire into praise     nor human rage alone his pow’r perceives     but the mad winds and the tumultuous waves     ev’n storms death’s fiercest ministers forbear     and in their own wild empire learn to spare     thus nature’s self supporting man’s decree     styles britain’s sovereign sovereign of the sea”  as for walpole what he felt at this tremendous crisis      “no powers of language but his own can tell     his own which nature and the graces form     at will to raise or hush the civil storm”  it is a coincidence worth noticing that this seventh satire was published in 1726 and that the warrant of george the first granting young a pension of £200 a year from ladyday 1725 is dated may 3d 1726  the gratitude exhibited in this satire may have been chiefly prospective but the “instalment” a poem inspired by the thrilling event of walpole’s installation as knight of the garter was clearly written with the double ardor of a man who has got a pension and hopes for something more  his emotion about walpole is precisely at the same pitch as his subsequent emotion about the second advent  in the “instalment” he says      “with invocations some their hearts inflame     i need no muse a walpole is my theme”  and of god coming to judgment he says in the “night thoughts”      “i find my inspiration is my theme     the grandeur of my subject is my muse”  nothing can be feebler than this “instalment” except in the strength of impudence with which the writer professes to scorn the prostitution of fair fame the “profanation of celestial fire”  herbert croft tells us that young made more than three thousand pounds by his “satires”—a surprising statement taken in connection with the reasonable doubt he throws on the story related in spence’s “anecdotes” that the duke of wharton gave young £2000 for this work  young however seems to have been tolerably fortunate in the pecuniary results of his publications and with his literary profits his annuity from wharton his fellowship and his pension not to mention other bounties which may be inferred from the high merits he discovers in many men of wealth and position we may fairly suppose that he now laid the foundation of the considerable fortune he left at his death  it is probable that the duke of wharton’s final departure for the continent and disgrace at court in 1726 and the consequent cessation of young’s reliance on his patronage tended not only to heighten the temperature of his poetical enthusiasm for sir robert walpole but also to turn his thoughts toward the church again as the secondbest means of rising in the world  on the accession of george the second young found the same transcendent merits in him as in his predecessor and celebrated them in a style of poetry previously unattempted by him—the pindaric ode a poetic form which helped him to surpass himself in furious bombast “ocean an ode concluding with a wish” was the title of this piece  he afterward pruned it and cut off among other things the concluding wish expressing the yearning for humble retirement which of course had prompted him to the effusion but we may judge of the rejected stanzas by the quality of those he has allowed to remain  for example calling on britain’s dead mariners to rise and meet their “country’s fullblown glory” in the person of the new king he says            “what powerful charm           can death disarm     your long your iron slumbers break           by jove by fame           by george’s name     awake awake awake awake”  soon after this notable production which was written with the ripe folly of fortyseven young took orders and was presently appointed chaplain to the king  “the brothers” his third and last tragedy which was already in rehearsal he now withdrew from the stage and sought reputation in a way more accordant with the decorum of his new profession by turning prose writer  but after publishing “a true estimate of human life” with a dedication to the queen as one of the “most shining representatives” of god on earth and a sermon entitled “an apology for princes or the reverence due to government” preached before the house of commons his pindaric ambition again seized him and he matched his former ode by another called “imperium pelagi a naval lyric written in imitation of pindar’s spirit occasioned by his majesty’s return from hanover 1729 and the succeeding peace”  since he afterward suppressed this second ode we must suppose that it was rather worse than the first  next came his two “epistles to pope concerning the authors of the age” remarkable for nothing but the audacity of affectation with which the most servile of poets professes to despise servility  in 1730 young was presented by his college with the rectory of welwyn in hertfordshire and in the following year when he was just fifty he married lady elizabeth lee a widow with two children who seems to have been in favor with queen caroline and who probably had an income—two attractions which doubtless enhanced the power of her other charms pastoral duties and domesticity probably cured young of some bad habits but unhappily they did not cure him either of flattery or of fustian three more odes followed quite as bad as those of his bachelorhood except that in the third he announced the wise resolution of never writing another  it must have been about this time since young was now “turned of fifty” that he wrote the letter to mrs howard afterward lady suffolk george the second’s mistress which proves that he used other engines besides pindaric ones in “besieging court favor”  the letter is too characteristic to be omitted                                                            “monday morning      “madam i know his majesty’s goodness to his servants and his love     of justice in general so well that i am confident if his majesty     knew my case i should not have any cause to despair of his gracious     favor to me      “abilities         want      good manners       sufferings             service            and

1741 leaving him one son born in 1733  that he had attached himself strongly to her two daughters by her former marriage there is better evidence in the report mentioned by mrs montagu of his practical kindness and liberality to the younger than in his lamentations over the elder as the “narcissa” of the “night thoughts”  “narcissa” had died in 1735 shortly after marriage to mr temple the son of lord palmerston and mr temple himself after a second marriage died in 1740 a year before lady elizabeth young these then are the three deaths supposed to have inspired “the complaint” which forms the three first books of the “night thoughts”      “insatiate archer could not one suffice     thy shaft flew thrice and thrice my peace was slain     and thrice ere thrice yon moon had fill’d her horn”  since we find young departing from the truth of dates in order to heighten the effect of his calamity or at least of his climax we need not be surprised that he allowed his imagination great freedom in other matters besides chronology and that the character of “philander” can by no process be made to fit mr temple  the supposition that the muchlectured “lorenzo” of the “night thoughts” was young’s own son is hardly rendered more absurd by the fact that the poem was written when that son was a boy than by the obvious artificiality of the characters young introduces as targets for his arguments and rebukes  among all the trivial efforts of conjectured criticism there can hardly be one more futile than the attempts to discover the original of those pitiable layfigures the “lorenzos” and “altamonts” of young’s didactic prose and poetry  his muse never stood face to face with a genuine living human being she would have been as much startled by such an encounter as a necromancer whose incantations and blue fire had actually conjured up a demon  the “night thoughts” appeared between 1741 and 1745  although he declares in them that he has chosen god for his “patron” henceforth this is not at all to the prejudice of some half dozen lords duchesses and right honorables who have the privilege of sharing finelyturned compliments with their copatron  the line which closed the second night in the earlier editions—      “wits spare not heaven o wilmington—nor thee”—  is an intense specimen of that perilous juxtaposition of ideas by which young in his incessant search after point and novelty unconsciously converts his compliments into sarcasms and his apostrophe to the moon as more likely to be favorable to his song if he calls her “fair portland of the skies” is worthy even of his pindaric ravings  his ostentatious renunciation of worldly schemes and especially of his twentyyears’ siege of court favor are in the tone of one who retains some hope in the midst of his querulousness  he descended from the astronomical rhapsodies of his “ninth night” published in 1745 to more terrestrial strains in his “reflections on the public situation of the kingdom” dedicated to the duke of newcastle but in this critical year we get a glimpse of him through a more prosaic and less refracting medium  he spent a part of the year at tunbridge wells and mrs montagu who was there too gives a very lively picture of the “divine doctor” in her letters to the duchess of portland on whom young had bestowed the superlative bombast to which we have recently alluded we shall borrow the quotations from dr doran in spite of their length because to our mind they present the most agreeable portrait we possess of young      “i have great joy in dr young whom i disturbed in a reverie  at     first he started then bowed then fell back into a surprise then     began a speech relapsed into his astonishment two or three times     forgot what he had been saying began a new subject and so went on     i told him your grace desired he would write longer letters to which     he cried ‘ha’ most emphatically and i leave you to interpret what     it meant  he has made a friendship with one person here whom i     believe you would not imagine to have been made for his bosom friend     you would perhaps suppose it was a bishop or dean a prebend a     pious preacher a clergyman of exemplary life or if a layman of     most virtuous conversation one that had paraphrased st matthew or     wrote comments on st paul    you would not guess that this     associate of the doctor’s was—old cibber  certainly in their     religious moral and civil character there is no relation but in     their dramatic capacity there is some—mrs montagu was not aware     that cibber whom young had named not disparagingly in his satires     was the brother of his old schoolfellow but to return to our hero     ‘the waters’ says mrs montagu ‘have raised his spirits to a fine     pitch as your grace will imagine when i tell you how sublime an     answer he made to a very vulgar question  i asked him how long he     stayed at the wells he said ‘as long as my rival stayed—as long as     the sun did’  among the visitors at the wells were lady sunderland     wife of sir robert sutton and her sister mrs tichborne  ‘he did     an admirable thing to lady sunderland on her mentioning sir robert     sutton he asked her where sir robert’s lady was on which we all     laughed very heartily and i brought him off half ashamed to my     lodgings where during breakfast he assured me he had asked after     lady sunderland because he had a great honor for her and that     having a respect for her sister he designed to have inquired after     her if we had not put it out of his head by laughing at him  you     must know mrs tichborne sat next to lady sunderland  it would have     been admirable to have had him finish his compliment in that manner’        ‘his expressions all bear the stamp of novelty and his     thoughts of sterling sense  he practises a kind of philosophical     abstinence    he carried mrs rolt and myself to tunbridge five     miles from hence where we were to see some fine old ruins  first     rode the doctor on a tall steed decently caparisoned in dark gray     next ambled mrs rolt on a hackney horse    then followed your     humble servant on a milkwhite palfrey  i rode on in safety and at     leisure to observe the company especially the two figures that     brought up the rear  the first was my servant valiantly armed with     two uncharged pistols the last was the doctor’s man whose uncombed     hair so resembled the mane of the horse he rode one could not help     imagining they were of kin and wishing for the honor of the family     that they had had one comb betwixt them  on his head was a velvet     cap much resembling a black saucepan and on his side hung a little     basket  at last we arrived at the king’s head where the loyalty of     the doctor induced him to alight and then knighterrantlike he     took his damsels from off their palfreys and courteously handed us     into the inn’    the party returned to the wells and ‘the silver     cynthia held up her lamp in the heavens’ the while  ‘the night     silenced all but our divine doctor who sometimes uttered things fit     to be spoken in a season when all nature seems to be hushed and     hearkening  i followed gathering wisdom as i went till i found by     my horse’s stumbling that i was in a bad road and that the blind     was leading the blind  so i placed my servant between the doctor and     myself which he not perceiving went on in a most philosophical     strain to the great admiration of my poor clown of a servant who     not being wrought up to any pitch of enthusiasm nor making any     answer to all the fine things he heard the doctor wondering i was     dumb and grieving i was so stupid looked round and declared his     surprise’”  young’s oddity and absence of mind are gathered from other sources besides these stories of mrs montagu’s and gave rise to the report that he was the original of fielding’s “parson adams” but this croft denies and mentions another young who really sat for the portrait and who we imagine had both more greek and more genuine simplicity than the poet his love of chatting with colley cibber was an indication that the old predilection for the stage survived in spite of his emphatic contempt for “all joys but joys that never can expire” and the production of “the brothers” at drury lane in 1753 after a suppression of fifteen years was perhaps not entirely due to the expressed desire to give the proceeds to the society for the propagation of the gospel  the author’s profits were not more than £400—in those days a disappointing sum and young as we learn from his friend richardson did not make this the limit of his donation but gave a thousand guineas to the society  “i had some talk with him” says richardson in one of his letters “about this great action  ‘i always’ said he ‘intended to do something handsome for the society  had i deferred it to my demise i should have given away my son’s money  all the world are inclined to pleasure could i have given myself a greater by disposing of the sum to a different use i should have done it’”  surely he took his old friend richardson for “lorenzo”  his next work was “the centaur not fabulous in six letters to a friend on the life in vogue” which reads very much like the most objurgatory parts of the “night thoughts” reduced to prose  it is preceded by a preface which though addressed to a lady is in its denunciations of vice as grossly indecent and almost as flippant as the epilogues written by “friends” which he allowed to be reprinted after his tragedies in the latest edition of his works  we like much better than “the centaur” “conjectures on original composition” written in 1759 for the sake he says of communicating to the world the wellknown anecdote about addison’s deathbed and with the exception of his poem on resignation the last thing he ever published  the estrangement from his son which must have embittered the later years of his life appears to have begun not many years after the mother’s death  on the marriage of her second daughter who had previously presided over young’s household a mrs hallows understood to be a woman of discreet age and the daughter a widow of a clergyman who was an old friend of young’s became housekeeper at welwyn  opinions about ladies are apt to differ  “mrs hallows was a woman of piety improved by reading” says one witness  “she was a very coarse woman” says dr johnson and we shall presently find some indirect evidence that her temper was perhaps not quite so much improved as her piety  servants it seems were not fond of remaining long in the house with her a satirical curate named kidgell hints at “drops of juniper” taken as a cordial but perhaps he was spiteful and a teetotaller and young’s son is said to have told his father that “an old man should not resign himself to the management of anybody”  the result was that the son was banished from home for the rest of his father’s lifetime though young seems never to have thought of disinheriting him  our latest glimpses of the aged poet are derived from certain letters of mr jones his curate—letters preserved in the british museum and happily made accessible to common mortals in nichols’s “anecdotes”  mr jones was a man of some literary activity and ambition—a collector of interesting documents and one of those concerned in the “free and candid disquisitions” the design of which was “to point out such things in our ecclesiastical establishment as want to be reviewed and amended”  on these and kindred subjects he corresponded with dr birch occasionally troubling him with queries and manuscripts  we have a respect for mr jones  unlike any person who ever troubled us with queries or manuscripts he mitigates the infliction by such gifts as “a fat pullet” wishing he “had anything better to send but this depauperizing vicarage of alconbury too often checks the freedom and forwardness of my mind” another day comes a “pound canister of tea” another a “young fatted goose”  clearly mr jones was entirely unlike your literary correspondents of the present day he forwarded manuscripts but he had “bowels” and forwarded poultry too  his first letter from welwyn is dated june 1759 not quite six years before young’s death  in june 1762 he expresses a wish to go to london “this summer  but” he continues      “my time and pains are almost continually taken up here and    i     have been i now find a considerable loser upon the whole by     continuing here so long  the consideration of this and the     inconveniences i sustained and do still experience from my late     illness obliged me at last to acquaint the doctor young with my     case and to assure him that i plainly perceived the duty and     confinement here to be too much for me for which reason i must i     said beg to be at liberty to resign my charge at michaelmas  i     began to give him these notices in february when i was very ill and     now i perceive by what he told me the other day that he is in some     difficulty for which reason he is at last he says resolved to     advertise and even which is much wondered at to raise the     salary considerably higher  what he allowed my predecessors was     20l per annum and now he proposes 50l as he tells me  i     never asked him to raise it for me though i well knew it was not     equal to the duty nor did i say a word about myself when he lately     suggested to me his intentions upon this subject”  in a postscript to this letter he says      “i may mention to you farther as a friend that may be trusted that     in all likelihood the poor old gentleman will not find it a very easy     matter unless by dint of money and force upon himself to procure     a man that he can like for his next curate nor one that will stay     with him so long as i have done  then his great age will recur to     people’s thoughts and if he has any foibles either in temper or     conduct they will be sure not to be forgotten on this occasion by     those who know him and those who do not will probably be on their     guard  on these and the like considerations it is by no means an     eligible office to be seeking out for a curate for him as he has     several times wished me to do and would if he knew that i am now     writing to you wish your assistance also  but my best friends here     who well foresee the probable consequences and wish me well     earnestly dissuade me from complying and i will decline the office     with as much decency as i can but high salary will i suppose fetch     in somebody or other soon”  in the following july he writes      “the old gentleman here i may venture to tell you freely seems to     me to be in a pretty odd way of late—moping dejected selfwilled     and as if surrounded with some perplexing circumstances  though i     visit him pretty frequently for short intervals i say very little to     his affairs not choosing to be a party concerned especially in     cases of so critical and tender a nature  there is much mystery in     almost all his temporal affairs as well as in many of his     speculative theories  whoever lives in this neighborhood to see his     exit will probably see and hear some very strange things  time will     show—i am afraid not greatly to his credit  there is thought to be     an irremovable obstruction to his happiness within his walls as     well as another without them but the former is the more powerful     and like to continue so  he has this day been trying anew to engage     me to stay with him  no lucrative views can tempt me to sacrifice my     liberty or my health to such measures as are proposed here  nor do     i like to have to do with persons whose word and honor cannot be     depended on  so much for this very odd and unhappy topic”  in august mr jones’s tone is slightly modified  earnest entreaties not lucrative considerations have induced him to cheer the doctor’s dejected heart by remaining at welwyn some time longer  the doctor is “in various respects a very unhappy man” and few know so much of these respects as mr jones  in september he recurs to the subject      “my ancient gentleman here is still full of trouble which moves my     concern though it moves only the secret laughter of many and some     untoward surmises in disfavor of him and his household  the loss of     a very large sum of money about 200l is talked of whereof this     vill and neighborhood is full  some disbelieve others says ‘it is     no wonder where about eighteen or more servants are sometimes     taken and dismissed in the course of a year’  the gentleman himself     is allowed by all to be far more harmless and easy in his family than     some one else who hath too much the lead in it  this among others     was one reason for my late motion to quit”  no other mention of young’s affairs occurs until april 2d 1765 when he says that dr young is very ill attended by two physicians      “having mentioned this young gentleman dr young’s son i would     acquaint you next that he came hither this morning having been sent     for as i am told by the direction of mrs hallows  indeed she     intimated to me as much herself  and if this be so i must say that     it is one of the most prudent acts she ever did or could have done     in such a case as this as it may prove a means of preventing much     confusion after the death of the doctor  i have had some little     discourse with the son he seems much affected and i believe really     is so  he earnestly wishes his father might be pleased to ask after     him for you must know he has not yet done this nor is in my     opinion like to do it  and it has been said farther that upon a     late application made to him on the behalf of his son he desired     that no more might be said to him about it  how true this may be i     cannot as yet be certain all i shall say is it seems not improbable        i heartily wish the ancient man’s heart may prove tender toward     his son though knowing him so well i can scarce hope to hear     such desirable news”  eleven days later he writes      “i have now the pleasure to acquaint you that the late dr young     though he had for many years kept his son at a distance from him yet     has now at last left him all his possessions after the payment of     certain legacies so that the young gentleman who bears a fair     character and behaves well as far as i can hear or see will i     hope soon enjoy and make a prudent use of a handsome fortune  the     father on his deathbed and since my return from london was applied     to in the tenderest manner by one of his physicians and by another     person to admit the son into his presence to make submission     intreat forgiveness and obtain his blessing  as to an interview     with his son he intimated that he chose to decline it as his     spirits were then low and his nerves weak  with regard to the next     particular he said ‘i heartily forgive him’ and upon ‘mention of     this last he gently lifted up his hand and letting it gently fall     pronounced these words ‘god bless him’    i know it will give     you pleasure to be farther informed that he was pleased to make     respectful mention of me in his will expressing his satisfaction in     my care of his parish bequeathing to me a handsome legacy and     appointing me to be one of his executors”  so far mr jones in his confidential correspondence with a “friend who may be trusted”  in a letter communicated apparently by him to the gentleman’s magazine seven years later namely in 1782 on the appearance of croft’s biography of young we find him speaking of “the ancient gentleman” in a tone of reverential eulogy quite at variance with the free comments we have just quoted  but the rev john jones was probably of opinion with mrs montagu whose contemporary and retrospective letters are also set in a different key that “the interests of religion were connected with the character of a man so distinguished for piety as dr young”  at all events a subsequent quasiofficial statement weighs nothing as evidence against contemporary spontaneous and confidential hints  to mrs hallows young left a legacy of £1000 with the request that she would destroy all his manuscripts  this final request from some unknown cause was not complied with and among the papers he left behind him was the following letter from archbishop secker which probably marks the date of his latest effort after preferment                                       “deanery of st paul’s july 8 1758      “good dr young i have long wondered that more suitable notice of     your great merit hath not been taken by persons in power  but how to     remedy the omission i see not  no encouragement hath ever been given     me to mention things of this nature to his majesty  and therefore     in all likelihood the only consequence of doing it would be     weakening the little influence which else i may possibly have on some     other occasions  your fortune and your reputation set you above the     need of advancement and your sentiments above that concern for     it on your own account which on that of the public is     sincerely felt by      “your loving brother                                                                “tho cant”  the loving brother’s irony is severe  perhaps the least questionable testimony to the better side of young’s character is that of bishop hildesley who as the vicar of a parish near welwyn had been young’s neighbor for upward of twenty years  the affection of the clergy for each other we have observed is like that of the fair sex not at all of a blind and infatuated kind and we may therefore the rather believe them when they give each other any extraofficial praise  bishop hildesley then writing of young to richardson says      “the impertinence of my frequent visits to him was amply rewarded     forasmuch as i can truly say he never received me but with     agreeable open complacency and i never left him but with profitable     pleasure and improvement  he was one or other the most modest the     most patient of contradiction and the most informing and     entertaining i ever conversed with—at least of any man who had so     just pretensions to pertinacity and reserve”  mr langton however who was also a frequent visitor of young’s informed boswell—      “that there was an air of benevolence in his manner but that he     could obtain from him less information than he had hoped to receive     from one who had lived so much in intercourse with the brightest men     of what had been called the augustan age of england and that he     showed a degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences     that were then passing which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man     of such intellectual stores of such an advanced age and who had     retired from life with declared disappointment in his expectations”  the same substance we know will exhibit different qualities under different tests and after all imperfect reports of individual impressions whether immediate or traditional are a very frail basis on which to build our opinion of a man  one’s character may be very indifferently mirrored in the mind of the most intimate neighbor it all depends on the quality of that gentleman’s reflecting surface  but discarding any inferences from such uncertain evidence the outline of young’s character is too distinctly traceable in the wellattested facts of his life and yet more in the selfbetrayal that runs through all his works for us to fear that our general estimate of him may be false  for while no poet seems less easy and spontaneous than young no poet discloses himself more completely  men’s minds have no hidingplace out of themselves—their affectations do but betray another phase of their nature  and if in the present view of young we seem to be more intent on laying bare unfavorable facts than on shrouding them in “charitable speeches” it is not because we have any irreverential pleasure in turning men’s characters “the seamy side without” but because we see no great advantage in considering a man as he was not  young’s biographers and critics have usually set out from the position that he was a great religious teacher and that his poetry is morally sublime and they have toned down his failings into harmony with their conception of the divine and the poet  for our own part we set out from precisely the opposite conviction—namely that the religious and moral spirit of young’s poetry is low and false and we think it of some importance to show that the “night thoughts” are the reflex of the mind in which the higher human sympathies were inactive  this judgment is entirely opposed to our youthful predilections and enthusiasm  the sweet gardenbreath of early enjoyment lingers about many a page of the “night thoughts” and even of the “last day” giving an extrinsic charm to passages of stilted rhetoric and false sentiment but the sober and repeated reading of maturer years has convinced us that it would hardly be possible to find a more typical instance than young’s poetry of the mistake which substitutes interested obedience for sympathetic emotion and baptizes egoism as religion                                        pope said of young that he had “much of a sublime genius without commonsense”  the deficiency pope meant to indicate was we imagine moral rather than intellectual it was the want of that fine sense of what is fitting in speech and action which is often eminently possessed by men and women whose intellect is of a very common order but who have the sincerity and dignity which can never coexist with the selfish preoccupations of vanity or interest  this was the “commonsense” in which young was conspicuously deficient and it was partly owing to this deficiency that his genius waiting to be determined by the highest prize fluttered uncertainly from effort to effort until when he was more than sixty it suddenly spread its broad wing and soared so as to arrest the gaze of other generations besides his own  for he had no versatility of faculty to mislead him  the “night thoughts” only differ from his previous works in the degree and not in the kind of power they manifest  whether he writes prose or poetry rhyme or blank verse dramas satires odes or meditations we see everywhere the same young—the same narrow circle of thoughts the same love of abstractions the same telescopic view of human things the same appetency toward antithetic apothegm and rhapsodic climax  the passages that arrest us in his tragedies are those in which he anticipates some fine passage in the “night thoughts” and where his characters are only transparent shadows through which we see the bewigged embonpoint of the didactic poet excogitating epigrams or ecstatic soliloquies by the light of a candle fixed in a skull  thus in “the revenge” “alonzo” in the conflict of jealousy and love that at once urges and forbids him to murder his wife says      “this vast and solid earth that blazing sun     those skies through which it rolls must all have end     what then is man  the smallest part of nothing     day buries day month month and year the year     our life is but a chain of many deaths     can then death’s self be feared  our life much rather     life is the desert life the solitude     death joins us to the great majority     ’tis to be born to plato and to cæsar     ’tis to be great forever     ’tis pleasure ’tis ambition then to die”  his prose writings all read like the “night thoughts” either diluted into prose or not yet crystallized into poetry  for example in his “thoughts for age” he says      “though we stand on its awful brink such our leaden bias to the     world we turn our faces the wrong way we are still looking on our     old acquaintance time though now so wasted and reduced that we     can see little more of him than his wings and his scythe our age     enlarges his wings to our imagination and our fear of death his     scythe as time himself grows less  his consumption is deep his     annihilation is at hand”  this is a dilution of the magnificent image—      “time in advance behind him hides his wings     and seems to creep decrepit with his age     behold him when past by  what then is seen     but his proud pinions swifter than the winds”  again      “a requesting omnipotence  what can stun and confound thy reason     more  what more can ravish and exalt thy heart  it cannot but     ravish and exalt it cannot but gloriously disturb and perplex thee     to take in all that suggests  thou child of the dust  thou speck     of misery and sin  how abject thy weakness how great is thy power     thou crawler on earth and possible i was about to say controller     of the skies  weigh and weigh well the wondrous truths i have in     view which cannot be weighed too much which the more they are     weighed amaze the more which to have supposed before they were     revealed would have been as great madness and to have presumed on     as great sin as it is now madness and sin not to believe”  even in his pindaric odes in which he made the most violent efforts against nature he is still neither more nor less than the young of the “last day” emptied and swept of his genius and possessed by seven demons of fustian and bad rhyme  even here his “ercles’ vein” alternates with his moral platitudes and we have the perpetual text of the “night thoughts”         “gold pleasure buys        but pleasure dies     for soon the gross fruition cloys        though raptures court        the sense is short     but virtue kindles living joys—         “joys felt alone        joys asked of none     which time’s and fortune’s arrows miss        joys that subsist        though fates resist     an unprecarious endless bliss         “unhappy they        and falsely gay     who bask forever in success        a constant feast        quite palls the taste     and long enjoyment is distress”  in the “last day” again which is the earliest thing he wrote we have an anticipation of all his greatest faults and merits  conspicuous among the faults is that attempt to exalt our conceptions of deity by vulgar images and comparisons which is so offensive in the later “night thoughts”  in a burst of prayer and homage to god called forth by the contemplation of christ coming to judgment he asks who brings the change of the seasons and answers      “not the great ottoman or greater czar     not europe’s arbitress of peace and war”  conceive the soul in its most solemn moments assuring god that it doesn’t place his power below that of louis napoleon or queen victoria  but in the midst of uneasy rhymes inappropriate imagery vaulting sublimity that o’erleaps itself and vulgar emotions we have in this poem an occasional flash of genius a touch of simple grandeur which promises as much as young ever achieved  describing the oncoming of the dissolution of all things he says      “no sun in radiant glory shines on high     no light but from the terrors of the sky”  and again speaking of great armies      “whose rear lay wrapt in night while breaking dawn     rous’d the broad front and call’d the battle on”  and this wail of the lost souls is fine               “and this for sin     could i offend if i had never been     but still increas’d the senseless happy mass     flow’d in the stream or shiver’d in the grass     father of mercies  why from silent earth     didst thou awake and curse me into birth     tear me from quiet ravish me from night     and make a thankless present of thy light     push into being a reverse of thee     and animate a clod with misery”  but it is seldom in young’s rhymed poems that the effect of a felicitous thought or image is not counteracted by our sense of the constraint he suffered from the necessities of rhyme—that “gothic demon” as he afterward called it “which modern poetry tasting became mortal”  in relation to his own power no one will question the truth of this dictum that “blank verse is verse unfallen uncurst verse reclaimed reinthroned in the true language of the gods who never thundered nor suffered their homer to thunder in rhyme”  his want of mastery in rhyme is especially a drawback on the effects of his satires for epigrams and witticisms are peculiarly susceptible to the intrusion of a superfluous word or to an inversion which implies constraint  here even more than elsewhere the art that conceals art is an absolute requisite and to have a witticism presented to us in limping or cumbrous rhythm is as counteractive to any electrifying effect as to see the tentative grimaces by which a comedian prepares a grotesque countenance  we discern the process instead of being startled by the result  this is one reason why the satires read seriatim have a flatness to us which when we afterward read picked passages we are inclined to disbelieve in and to attribute to some deficiency in our own mood  but there are deeper reasons for that dissatisfaction  young is not a satirist of a high order  his satire has neither the terrible vigor the lacerating energy of genuine indignation nor the humor which owns loving fellowship with the poor human nature it laughs at nor yet the personal bitterness which as in pope’s characters of sporus and atticus insures those living touches by virtue of which the individual and particular in art becomes the universal and immortal  young could never describe a real complex human being but what he could do with eminent success was to describe with neat and finished point obvious types of manners rather than of character—to write cold and clever epigrams on personified vices and absurdities  there is no more emotion in his satire than if he were turning witty verses on a waxen image of cupid or a lady’s glove  he has none of these felicitious epithets none of those pregnant lines by which pope’s satires have enriched the ordinary speech of educated men  young’s wit will be found in almost every instance to consist in that antithetic combination of ideas which of all the forms of wit is most within reach of a clever effort  in his gravest arguments as well as in his lightest satire one might imagine that he had set himself to work out the problem how much antithesis might be got out of a given subject  and there he completely succeeds  his neatest portraits are all wrought on this plan  “narcissus” for example who      “omits no duty nor can envy say     he miss’d these many years the church or play     he makes no noise in parliament ’tis true     but pays his debts and visit when ’tis due     his character and gloves are ever clean     and then he can outbow the bowing dean     a smile eternal on his lip he wears     which equally the wise and worthless shares     in gay fatigues this most undaunted chief     patient of idleness beyond belief     most charitably lends the town his face     for ornament in every public place     as sure as cards he to th’ assembly comes     and is the furniture of drawingrooms     when ombre calls his hand and heart are free     and joined to two he fails not—to make three     narcissus is the glory of his race     for who does nothing with a better grace     to deck my list by nature were designed     such shining expletives of human kind     who want while through blank life they dream along     sense to be right and passion to be wrong”  it is but seldom that we find a touch of that easy slyness which gives an additional zest to surprise but here is an instance      “see tityrus with merriment possest     is burst with laughter ere he hears the jest     what need he stay for when the joke is o’er     his teeth will be no whiter than before”  like pope whom he imitated he sets out with a psychological mistake as the basis of his satire attributing all forms of folly to one passion—the love of fame or vanity—a much grosser mistake indeed than pope’s exaggeration of the extent to which the “ruling passion” determines conduct in the individual  not that young is consistent in his mistake  he sometimes implies no more than what is the truth—that the love of fame is the cause not of all follies but of many  young’s satires on women are superior to pope’s which is only saying that they are superior to pope’s greatest failure  we can more frequently pick out a couplet as successful than an entire sketch  of the too emphatic “syrena” he says      “her judgment just her sentence is too strong     because she’s right she’s ever in the wrong”  of the diplomatic “julia”      “for her own breakfast she’ll project a scheme     nor take her tea without a stratagem”  of “lyce” the old painted coquette      “in vain the cock has summoned sprites away     she walks at noon and blasts the bloom of day”  of the nymph who “gratis clears religious mysteries”      “’tis hard too she who makes no use but chat     of her religion should be barr’d in that”  the description of the literary belle “daphne” well prefaces that of “stella” admired by johnson      “with legs toss’d high on her sophee she sits     vouchsafing audience to contending wits     of each performance she’s the final test     one act read o’er she prophecies the rest     and then pronouncing with decisive air     fully convinces all the town—she’s fair     had lonely daphne hecatessa’s face     how would her elegance of taste decrease     some ladies’ judgment in their features lies     and all their genius sparkles in their eyes     but hold she cries lampooner have a care     must i want common sense because i’m fair     o no see stella her eyes shine as bright     as if her tongue was never in the right     and yet what real learning judgment fire     she seems inspir’d and can herself inspire     how then if malice ruled not all the fair     could daphne publish and could she forbear”  after all when we have gone through young’s seven satires we seem to have made but an indifferent meal  they are a sort of fricassee with some little solid meat in them and yet the flavor is not always piquant it is curious to find him when he pauses a moment from his satiric sketching recurring to his old platitudes      “can gold calm passion or make reason shine     can we dig peace or wisdom from the mine     wisdom to gold prefer”—  platitudes which he seems inevitably to fall into for the same reason that some men are constantly asserting their contempt for criticism—because he felt the opposite so keenly  the outburst of genius in the earlier books of the “night thoughts” is the more remarkable that in the interval between them and the satires he had produced nothing but his pindaric odes in which he fell far below the level of his previous works  two sources of this sudden strength were the freedom of blank verse and the presence of a genuine emotion most persons in speaking of the “night thoughts” have in their minds only the two or three first nights the majority of readers rarely getting beyond these unless as wilson says they “have but few books are poor and live in the country”  and in these earlier nights there is enough genuine sublimity and genuine sadness to bribe us into too favorable a judgment of them as a whole  young had only a very few things to say or sing—such as that life is vain that death is imminent that man is immortal that virtue is wisdom that friendship is sweet and that the source of virtue is the contemplation of death and immortality—and even in his two first nights he had said almost all he had to say in his finest manner  through these first outpourings of “complaint” we feel that the poet is really sad that the bird is singing over a rifled nest and we bear with his morbid picture of the world and of life as the joblike lament of a man whom “the hand of god hath touched”  death has carried away his bestbeloved and that “silent land” whither they are gone has more reality for the desolate one than this world which is empty of their love      “this is the desert this the solitude     how populous how vital is the grave”  joy died with the loved one               “the disenchanted earth     lost all her lustre  where her glitt’ring towers     her golden mountains where  all darkened down     to naked waste a dreary vale of tears     the great magician’s dead”  under the pang of parting it seems to the bereaved man as if love were only a nerve to suffer with and he sickens at the thought of every joy of which he must one day say—“it was”  in its unreasoning anguish the soul rushes to the idea of perpetuity as the one element of bliss      “o ye blest scenes of permanent delight—     could ye so rich in rapture fear an end—     that ghastly thought would drink up all your joy     and quite unparadise the realms of light”  in a man under the immediate pressure of a great sorrow we tolerate morbid exaggerations we are prepared to see him turn away a weary eye from sunlight and flowers and sweet human faces as if this rich and glorious life had no significance but as a preliminary of death we do not criticise his views we compassionate his feelings  and so it is with young in these earlier nights  there is already some artificiality even in his grief and feeling often slides into rhetoric but through it all we are thrilled with the unmistakable cry of pain which makes us tolerant of egoism and hyperbole      “in every varied posture place and hour     how widow’d every thought of every joy     thought busy thought too busy for my peace     through the dark postern of time long elapsed     led softly by the stillness of the night—     led like a murderer and such it proves     strays wretched rover o’er the pleasing past—     in quest of wretchedness perversely strays     and finds all desert now and meets the ghosts     of my departed joys”  but when he becomes didactic rather than complaining—when he ceases to sing his sorrows and begins to insist on his opinions—when that distaste for life which we pity as a transient feeling is thrust upon us as a theory we become perfectly cool and critical and are not in the least inclined to be indulgent to false views and selfish sentiments  seeing that we are about to be severe on young’s failings and failures we ought if a reviewer’s space were elastic to dwell also on his merits—on the startling vigor of his imagery—on the occasional grandeur of his thought—on the piquant force of that grave satire into which his meditations continually run  but since our “limits” are rigorous we must content ourselves with the less agreeable half of the critic’s duty and we may the rather do so because it would be difficult to say anything new of young in the way of admiration while we think there are many salutary lessons remaining to be drawn from his faults  one of the most striking characteristics of young is his radical insincerity as a poetic artist  this added to the thin and artificial texture of his wit is the true explanation of the paradox—that a poet who is often inopportunely witty has the opposite vice of bombastic absurdity  the source of all grandiloquence is the want of taking for a criterion the true qualities of the object described or the emotion expressed  the grandiloquent man is never bent on saying what he feels or what he sees but on producing a certain effect on his audience hence he may float away into utter inanity without meeting any criterion to arrest him  here lies the distinction between grandiloquence and genuine fancy or bold imaginativeness  the fantastic or the boldly imaginative poet may be as sincere as the most realistic he is true to his own sensibilities or inward vision and in his wildest flights he never breaks loose from his criterion—the truth of his own mental state  now this disruption of language from genuine thought and feeling is what we are constantly detecting in young and his insincerity is the more likely to betray him into absurdity because he habitually treats of abstractions and not of concrete objects or specific emotions  he descants perpetually on virtue religion “the good man” life death immortality eternity—subjects which are apt to give a factitious grandeur to empty wordiness  when a poet floats in the empyrean and only takes a bird’seye view of the earth some people accept the mere fact of his soaring for sublimity and mistake his dim vision of earth for proximity to heaven  thus      “his hand the good man fixes on the skies     and bids earth roll nor feels her idle whirl”  may perhaps pass for sublime with some readers  but pause a moment to realize the image and the monstrous absurdity of a man’s grasping the skies and hanging habitually suspended there while he contemptuously bids the earth roll warns you that no genuine feeling could have suggested so unnatural a conception  again      “see the man immortal him i mean     who lives as such whose heart full bent on heaven     leans all that way his bias to the stars”  this is worse than the previous example for you can at least form some imperfect conception of a man hanging from the skies though the position strikes you as uncomfortable and of no particular use but you are utterly unable to imagine how his heart can lean toward the stars examples of such vicious imagery resulting from insincerity may be found perhaps in almost every page of the “night thoughts”  but simple assertions or aspirations undisguised by imagery are often equally false  no writer whose rhetoric was checked by the slightest truthful intentions could have said—      “an eye of awe and wonder let me roll     and roll forever”  abstracting the more poetical associations with the eye this is hardly less absurd than if he had wished to stand forever with his mouth open  again               “far beneath     a soul immortal is a mortal joy”  happily for human nature we are sure no man really believes that  which of us has the impiety not to feel that our souls are only too narrow for the joy of looking into the trusting eyes of our children of reposing on the love of a husband or a wife—nay of listening to the divine voice of music or watching the calm brightness of autumnal afternoons  but young could utter this falsity without detecting it because when he spoke of “mortal joys” he rarely had in his mind any object to which he could attach sacredness  he was thinking of bishoprics and benefices of smiling monarchs patronizing prime ministers and a “much indebted muse”  of anything between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and moderately conscious  often indeed he sinks very much below even the bishopric and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but such as breathes gaslight and the fumes of wine  his picture of life is precisely such as you would expect from a man who has risen from his bed at two o’clock in the afternoon with a headache and a dim remembrance that he has added to his “debts of honor”      “what wretched repetition cloys us here     what periodic potions for the sick     distemper’d bodies and distemper’d minds”  and then he flies off to his usual antithesis      “in an eternity what scenes shall strike     adventures thicken novelties surprise”  “earth” means lords and levees duchesses and dalilahs southsea dreams and illegal percentage and the only things distinctly preferable to these are eternity and the stars  deprive young of this antithesis and more than half his eloquence would be shrivelled up  place him on a breezy common where the furze is in its golden bloom where children are playing and horses are standing in the sunshine with fondling necks and he would have nothing to say  here are neither depths of guilt nor heights of glory and we doubt whether in such a scene he would be able to pay his usual compliment to the creator      “where’er i torn what claim on all applause”  it is true that he sometimes—not often—speaks of virtue as capable of sweetening life as well as of taking the sting from death and winning heaven and lest we should be guilty of any unfairness to him we will quote the two passages which convey this sentiment the most explicitly in the one he gives “lorenzo” this excellent recipe for obtaining cheerfulness               “go fix some weighty truth     chain down some passion do some generous good     teach ignorance to see or grief to smile     correct thy friend befriend thy greatest foe     or with warm heart and confidence divine     spring up and lay strong hold on him who made thee”  the other passage is vague but beautiful and its music has murmured in our minds for many years               “the cuckoo seasons sing     the same dull note to such as nothing prize     but what those seasons from the teeming earth     to doting sense indulge  but nobler minds     which relish fruit unripened by the sun     make their days various various as the dyes     on the dove’s neck which wanton in his rays     on minds of dovelike innocence possess’d     on lighten’d minds that bask in virtue’s beams     nothing hangs tedious nothing old revolves     in that for which they long for which they live     their glorious efforts winged with heavenly hopes     each rising morning sees still higher rise     each bounteous dawn its novelty presents     to worth maturing new strength lustre fame     while nature’s circle like a chariot wheel     boiling beneath their elevated aims     makes their fair prospect fairer every hour     advancing virtue in a line to bliss”  even here where he is in his most amiable mood you see at what a telescopic distance he stands from mother earth and simple human joys—“nature’s circle rolls beneath”  indeed we remember no mind in poetic literature that seems to have absorbed less of the beauty and the healthy breath of the common landscape than young’s  his images often grand and finely presented—witness that sublimely sudden leap of thought      “embryos we must be till we burst the shell     yon ambient azure shell and spring to life”—  lie almost entirely within that circle of observation which would be familiar to a man who lived in town hung about the theatres read the newspaper and went home often by moon and starlight  there is no natural object nearer than the moon that seems to have any strong attraction for him and even to the moon he chiefly appeals for patronage and “pays his court” to her  it is reckoned among the many deficiencies of “lorenzo” that he “never asked the moon one question”—an omission which young thinks eminently unbecoming a rational being  he describes nothing so well as a comet and is tempted to linger with fond detail over nothing more familiar than the day of judgment and an imaginary journey among the stars  once on saturn’s ring he feels at home and his language becomes quite easy               “what behold i now     a wilderness of wonders burning round     where larger suns inhabit higher spheres     perhaps the villas of descending gods”  it is like a sudden relief from a strained posture when in the “night thoughts” we come on any allusion that carries us to the lanes woods or fields  such allusions are amazingly rare and we could almost count them on a single hand  that we may do him no injustice we will quote the three best      “like blossom’d trees o’erturned by vernal storm     lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay                                              “in the same brook none ever bathed him twice     to the same life none ever twice awoke     we call the brook the same—the same we think     our life though still more rapid in its flow     nor mark the much irrevocably lapsed     and mingled with the sea”                                              “the crown of manhood is a winter joy     an evergreen that stands the northern blast     and blossoms in the rigor of our fate”  the adherence to abstractions or to the personification of abstractions is closely allied in young to the want of genuine emotion  he sees virtue sitting on a mount serene far above the mists and storms of earth he sees religion coming down from the skies with this world in her left hand and the other world in her right but we never find him dwelling on virtue or religion as it really exists—in the emotions of a man dressed in an ordinary coat and seated by his fireside of an evening with his hand resting on the head of his little daughter in courageous effort for unselfish ends in the internal triumph of justice and pity over personal resentment in all the sublime selfrenunciation and sweet charities which are found in the details of ordinary life now emotion links itself with particulars and only in a faint and secondary manner with abstractions  an orator may discourse very eloquently on injustice in general and leave his audience cold but let him state a special case of oppression and every heart will throb  the most untheoretic persons are aware of this relation between true emotion and particular facts as opposed to general terms and implicitly recognize it in the repulsion they feel toward any one who professes strong feeling about abstractions—in the interjectional “humbug” which immediately rises to their lips  wherever abstractions appear to excite strong emotion this occurs in men of active intellect and imagination in whom the abstract term rapidly and vividly calls up the particulars it represents these particulars being the true source of the emotion and such men if they wished to express their feeling would be infallibly prompted to the presentation of details  strong emotion can no more be directed to generalities apart from particulars than skill in figures can be directed to arithmetic apart from numbers  generalities are the refuge at once of deficient intellectual activity and deficient feeling  if we except the passages in “philander” “narcissa” and “lucia” there is hardly a trace of human sympathy of selfforgetfulness in the joy or sorrow of a fellowbeing throughout this long poem which professes to treat the various phases of man’s destiny  and even in the “narcissa” night young repels us by the low moral tone of his exaggerated lament this married stepdaughter died at lyons and being a protestant was denied burial so that her friends had to bury her in secret—one of the many miserable results of superstition but not a fact to throw an educated still less a christian man into a fury of hatred and vengeance in contemplating it after the lapse of five years  young however takes great pains to simulate a bad feeling               “of grief     and indignation rival bursts i pour’d     half execration mingled with my pray’r     kindled at man while i his god adored     sore grudg’d the savage land her sacred dust     stamp’d the cursed soil and with humanity     denied narcissa wish’d them all a grave”  the odiously bad taste of this last clause makes us hope that it is simply a platitude and not intended as witticism until he removes the possibility of this favorable doubt by immediately asking “flows my resentment into guilt”  when by an afterthought he attempts something like sympathy he only betrays more clearly his want of it  thus in the first night when he turns from his private griefs to depict earth as a hideous abode of misery for all mankind and asks      “what then am i who sorrow for myself”  he falls at once into calculating the benefit of sorrowing for others      “more generous sorrow while it sinks exalts     and conscious virtue mitigates the pang     nor virtue more than prudence bids me give     swollen thought a second channel”  this remarkable negation of sympathy is in perfect consistency with young’s theory of ethics               “virtue is a crime     a crime of reason if it costs us pain     unpaid”  if there is no immortality for man—      “sense take the rein blind passion drive us on     and ignorance befriend us on our way       yes give the pulse full empire live the brute     since as the brute we die  the sum of man     of godlike man to revel and to rot”                                              “if this life’s gain invites him to the deed     why not his country sold his father slain”                                              “ambition avarice by the wise disdain’d     is perfect wisdom while mankind are fools     and think a turf or tombstone covers all”                                              “die for thy country thou romantic fool     seize seize the plank thyself and let her sink”                                              “as in the dying parent dies the child     virtue with immortality expires     who tells me he denies his soul immortal     whate’er his boost has told me he’s a knave     his duty ’tis to love himself alone     nor care though mankind perish if he smiles”  we can imagine the man who “denies his soul immortal” replying “it is quite possible that you would be a knave and love yourself alone if it were not for your belief in immortality but you are not to force upon me what would result from your own utter want of moral emotion  i am just and honest not because i expect to live in another world but because having felt the pain of injustice and dishonesty toward myself i have a fellowfeeling with other men who would suffer the same pain if i were unjust or dishonest toward them  why should i give my neighbor short weight in this world because there is not another world in which i should have nothing to weigh out to him  i am honest because i don’t like to inflict evil on others in this life not because i’m afraid of evil to myself in another  the fact is i do not love myself alone whatever logical necessity there may be for that in your mind  i have a tender love for my wife and children and friends and through that love i sympathize with like affections in other men  it is a pang to me to witness the sufferings of a fellowbeing and i feel his suffering the more acutely because he is mortal—because his life is so short and i would have it if possible filled with happiness and not misery through my union and fellowship with the men and women i have seen i feel a like though a fainter sympathy with those i have not seen and i am able so to live in imagination with the generations to come that their good is not alien to me and is a stimulus to me to labor for ends which may not benefit myself but will benefit them  it is possible that you may prefer to ‘live the brute’ to sell your country or to slay your father if you were not afraid of some disagreeable consequences from the criminal laws of another world but even if i could conceive no motive but my own worldly interest or the gratification of my animal desire i have not observed that beastliness treachery and parricide are the direct way to happiness and comfort on earth  and i should say that if you feel no motive to common morality but your fear of a criminal bar in heaven you are decidedly a man for the police on earth to keep their eye upon since it is matter of worldold experience that fear of distant consequences is a very insufficient barrier against the rush of immediate desire  fear of consequences is only one form of egoism which will hardly stand against half a dozen other forms of egoism bearing down upon it  and in opposition to your theory that a belief in immortality is the only source of virtue i maintain that so far as moral action is dependent on that belief so far the emotion which prompts it is not truly moral—is still in the stage of egoism and has not yet attained the higher development of sympathy  in proportion as a man would care less for the rights and welfare of his fellow if he did not believe in a future life in that proportion is he wanting in the genuine feelings of justice and benevolence as the musician who would care less to play a sonata of beethoven’s finely in solitude than in public where he was to be paid for it is wanting in genuine enthusiasm for music”  thus far might answer the man who “denies himself immortal” and allowing for that deficient recognition of the finer and more indirect influences exercised by the idea of immortality which might be expected from one who took up a dogmatic position on such a subject we think he would have given a sufficient reply to young and other theological advocates who like him pique themselves on the loftiness of their doctrine when they maintain that “virtue with immortality expires”  we may admit indeed that if the better part of virtue consists as young appears to think in contempt for mortal joys in “meditation of our own decease” and in “applause” of god in the style of a congratulatory address to her majesty—all which has small relation to the wellbeing of mankind on this earth—the motive to it must be gathered from something that lies quite outside the sphere of human sympathy  but for certain other elements of virtue which are of more obvious importance to untheological minds—a delicate sense of our neighbor’s rights an active participation in the joys and sorrows of our fellowmen a magnanimous acceptance of privation or suffering for ourselves when it is the condition of good to others in a word the extension and intensification of our sympathetic nature—we think it of some importance to contend that they have no more direct relation to the belief in a future state than the interchange of gases in the lungs has to the plurality of worlds nay to us it is conceivable that in some minds the deep pathos lying in the thought of human mortality—that we are here for a little while and then vanish away that this earthly life is all that is given to our loved ones and to our many suffering fellowmen—lies nearer the fountains of moral emotion than the conception of extended existence  and surely it ought to be a welcome fact if the thought of mortality as well as of immortality be favorable to virtue  do writers of sermons and religious novels prefer that men should be vicious in order that there may be a more evident political and social necessity for printed sermons and clerical fictions  because learned gentlemen are theological are we to have no more simple honesty and goodwill  we can imagine that the proprietors of a patent watersupply have a dread of common springs but for our own part we think there cannot be too great a security against a lack of fresh water or of pure morality  to us it is a matter of unmixed rejoicing that this latter necessary of healthful life is independent of theological ink and that its evolution is insured in the interaction of human souls as certainly as the evolution of science or of art with which indeed it is but a twin ray melting into them with undefinable limits  to return to young  we can often detect a man’s deficiencies in what he admires more clearly than in what he contemns—in the sentiments he presents as laudable rather than in those he decries  and in young’s notion of what is lofty he casts a shadow by which we can measure him without further trouble  for example in arguing for human immortality he says      “first what is true ambition  the pursuit     of glory nothing less than man can share               the visible and present are for brutes     a slender portion and a narrow bound     these reason with an energy divine     o’erleaps and claims the future and unseen     the vast unseen the future fathomless     when the great soul buoys up to this high point     leaving gross nature’s sediments below     then and then only adam’s offspring quits     the sage and hero of the fields and woods     asserts his rank and rises into man”  so then if it were certified that as some benevolent minds have tried to infer our dumb fellowcreatures would share a future existence in which it is to be hoped we should neither beat starve nor maim them our ambition for a future life would cease to be “lofty”  this is a notion of loftiness which may pair off with dr whewell’s celebrated observation that bentham’s moral theory is low because it includes justice and mercy to brutes  but for a reflection of young’s moral personality on a colossal scale we must turn to those passages where his rhetoric is at its utmost stretch of inflation—where he addresses the deity discourses of the divine operations or describes the last judgment  as a compound of vulgar pomp crawling adulation and hard selfishness presented under the guise of piety there are few things in literature to surpass the ninth night entitled “consolation” especially in the pages where he describes the last judgment—a subject to which with naïve selfbetrayal he applies phraseology favored by the exuberant pennyaliner  thus when god descends and the groans of hell are opposed by “shouts of joy” much as cheers and groans contend at a public meeting where the resolutions are not passed unanimously the poet completes his climax in this way      “hence in one peal of loud eternal praise     the charmed spectators thunder their applause”  in the same taste he sings      “eternity the various sentence past     assigns the sever’d throng distinct abodes     sulphureous or ambrosial”  exquisite delicacy of indication  he is too nice to be specific as to the interior of the “sulphureous” abode but when once half the human race are shut up there hear how he enjoys turning the key on them               “what ensues     the deed predominant the deed of deeds     which makes a hell of hell a heaven of heaven     the goddess with determin’d aspect turns     her adamantine key’s enormous size     through destiny’s inextricable wards     deep driving every bolt on both their fates     then from the crystal battlements of heaven     down down she hurls it through the dark profound     ten thousand thousand fathom there to rust     and ne’er unlock her resolution more     the deep resounds and hell through all her glooms     returns in groans the melancholy roar”  this is one of the blessings for which dr young thanks god “most”         “for all i bless thee most for the severe     her death—my own at hand—the fiery gulf     that flaming bound of wrath omnipotent     it thunders—but it thunders to preserve        its wholesome dread     averts the dreaded pain its hideous groans     join heaven’s sweet hallelujahs in thy praise     great source of good alone  how kind in all     in vengeance kind  pain death gehenna save”     ie save me dr young who in return for that favor promise to give my divine patron the monopoly of that exuberance in laudatory epithet of which specimens may be seen at any moment in a large number of dedications and odes to kings queens prime ministers and other persons of distinction  that in young’s conception is what god delights in  his crowning aim in the “drama” of the ages is to vindicate his own renown  the god of the “night thoughts” is simply young himself “writ large”—a didactic poet who “lectures” mankind in the antithetic hyperbole of mortal and immortal joys earth and the stars hell and heaven and expects the tribute of inexhaustible “applause” young has no conception of religion as anything else than egoism turned heavenward and he does not merely imply this he insists on it religion he tells us in argumentative passages too long to quote is “ambition pleasure and the love of gain” directed toward the joys of the future life instead of the present  and his ethics correspond to his religion  he vacillates indeed in his ethical theory and shifts his position in order to suit his immediate purpose in argument but he never changes his level so as to see beyond the horizon of mere selfishness sometimes he insists as we have seen that the belief in a future life is the only basis of morality but elsewhere he tells us—      “in selfapplause is virtue’s golden prize”  virtue with young must always squint—must never look straight toward the immediate object of its emotion and effort  thus if a man risks perishing in the snow himself rather than forsake a weaker comrade he must either do this because his hopes and fears are directed to another world or because he desires to applaud himself afterward  young if we may believe him would despise the action as folly unless it had these motives  let us hope he was not so bad as he pretended to be  the tides of the divine life in man move under the thickest ice of theory  another indication of young’s deficiency in moral ie in sympathetic emotion is his unintermitting habit of pedagogic moralizing  on its theoretic and perceptive side morality touches science on its emotional side art  now the products of art are great in proportion as they result from that immediate prompting of innate power which we call genius and not from labored obedience to a theory or rule and the presence of genius or innate prompting is directly opposed to the perpetual consciousness of a rule  the action of faculty is imperious and excludes the reflection why it should act  in the same way in proportion as morality is emotional ie has affinity with art it will exhibit itself in direct sympathetic feeling and action and not as the recognition of a rule  love does not say “i ought to love”—it loves  pity does not say “it is right to be pitiful”—it pities justice does not say “i am bound to be just”—it feels justly  it is only where moral emotion is comparatively weak that the contemplation of a rule or theory habitually mingles with its action and in accordance with this we think experience both in literature and life has shown that the minds which are preeminently didactic—which insist on a “lesson” and despise everything that will not convey a moral are deficient in sympathetic emotion  a certain poet is recorded to have said that he “wished everything of his burned that did not impress some moral even in loveverses it might be flung in by the way”  what poet was it who took this medicinal view of poetry  dr watts or james montgomery or some other singer of spotless life and ardent piety  not at all  it was waller  a significant fact in relation to our position that the predominant didactic tendency proceeds rather from the poet’s perception that it is good for other men to be moral than from any overflow of moral feeling in himself  a man who is perpetually thinking in apothegms who has an unintermittent flux of admonition can have little energy left for simple emotion  and this is the case with young  in his highest flights of contemplation and his most wailing soliloquies he interrupts himself to fling an admonitory parenthesis at “lorenzo” or to hint that “folly’s creed” is the reverse of his own before his thoughts can flow he must fix his eye on an imaginary miscreant who gives unlimited scope for lecturing and recriminates just enough to keep the spring of admonition and argument going to the extent of nine books  it is curious to see how this pedagogic habit of mind runs through young’s contemplation of nature  as the tendency to see our own sadness reflected in the external world has been called by mr ruskin the “pathetic fallacy” so we may call young’s disposition to see a rebuke or a warning in every natural object the “pedagogic fallacy”  to his mind the heavens are “forever scolding as they shine” and the great function of the stars is to be a “lecture to mankind”  the conception of the deity as a didactic author is not merely an implicit point of view with him he works it out in elaborate imagery and at length makes it the occasion of his most extraordinary achievement in the “art of sinking” by exclaiming à propos we need hardly say of the nocturnal heavens      “divine instructor  thy first volume this     for man’s perusal all in capitals”  it is this pedagogic tendency this sermonizing attitude of young’s mind which produces the wearisome monotony of his pauses  after the first two or three nights he is rarely singing rarely pouring forth any continuous melody inspired by the spontaneous flow of thought or feeling  he is rather occupied with argumentative insistence with hammering in the proofs of his propositions by disconnected verses which he puts down at intervals  the perpetual recurrence of the pause at the end of the line throughout long passages makes them as fatiguing to the ear as a monotonous chant which consists of the endless repetition of one short musical phrase  for example                  “past hours     if not by guilt yet wound us by their flight     if folly bound our prospect by the grave     all feeling of futurity be numb’d     all godlike passion for eternals quench’d     all relish of realities expired     renounced all correspondence with the skies     our freedom chain’d quite wingless our desire     in sense darkprison’d all that ought to soar     prone to the centre crawling in the dust     dismounted every great and glorious aim     enthralled every faculty divine     heartburied in the rubbish of the world”  how different from the easy graceful melody of cowper’s blank verse indeed it is hardly possible to criticise young without being reminded at every step of the contrast presented to him by cowper  and this contrast urges itself upon us the more from the fact that there is to a certain extent a parallelism between the “night thoughts” and the “task”  in both poems the author achieves his greatest in virtue of the new freedom conferred by blank verse both poems are professionally didactic and mingle much satire with their graver meditations both poems are the productions of men whose estimate of this life was formed by the light of a belief in immortality and who were intensely attached to christianity  on some grounds we might have anticipated a more morbid view of things from cowper than from young  cowper’s religion was dogmatically the more gloomy for he was a calvinist while young was a “low” arminian believing that christ died for all and that the only obstacle to any man’s salvation lay in his will which he could change if he chose  there was real and deep sadness involved in cowper’s personal lot while young apart from his ambitious and greedy discontent seems to have had no great sorrow  yet see how a lovely sympathetic nature manifests itself in spite of creed and circumstance  where is the poem that surpasses the “task” in the genuine love it breathes at once toward inanimate and animate existence—in truthfulness of perception and sincerity of presentation—in the calm gladness that springs from a delight in objects for their own sake without selfreference—in divine sympathy with the lowliest pleasures with the most shortlived capacity for pain  here is no railing at the earth’s “melancholy map” but the happiest lingering over her simplest scenes with all the fond minuteness of attention that belongs to love no pompous rhetoric about the inferiority of the “brutes” but a warm plea on their behalf against man’s inconsiderateness and cruelty and a sense of enlarged happiness from their companionship in enjoyment no vague rant about human misery and human virtue but that close and vivid presentation of particular sorrows and privations of particular deeds and misdeeds which is the direct road to the emotions how cowper’s exquisite mind falls with the mild warmth of morning sunlight on the commonest objects at once disclosing every detail and investing every detail with beauty  no object is too small to prompt his song—not the sooty film on the bars or the spoutless teapot holding a bit of mignonette that serves to cheer the dingy townlodging with a “hint that nature lives” and yet his song is never trivial for he is alive to small objects not because his mind is narrow but because his glance is clear and his heart is large  instead of trying to edify us by supercilious allusions to the “brutes” and the “stalls” he interests us in that tragedy of the henroost when the thief has wrenched the door      “where chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps     in unsuspecting pomp”  in the patient cattle that on the winter’s morning         “mourn in corners where the fence     screens them and seem half petrified to sleep     in unrecumbent sadness”  in the little squirrel that surprised by him in his woodland walk               “at once swift as a bird     ascends the neighboring beech there whisks his brush     and perks his ears and stamps and cries aloud     with all the prettiness of feign’d alarm     and anger insignificantly fierce”  and then he passes into reflection not with curt apothegm and snappish reproof but with that melodious flow of utterance which belongs to thought when it is carried along in a stream of feeling      “the heart is hard in nature and unfit     for human fellowship as being void     of sympathy and therefore dead alike     to love and friendship both that is not pleased     with sight of animals enjoying life     nor feels their happiness augment his own”  his large and tender heart embraces the most everyday forms of human life—the carter driving his team through the wintry storm the cottager’s wife who painfully nursing the embers on her hearth while her infants “sit cowering o’er the sparks”      “retires content to quake so they be warm’d”  or the villager with her little ones going out to pick      “a cheap but wholesome salad from the brook”  and he compels our colder natures to follow his in its manifold sympathies not by exhortations not by telling us to meditate at midnight to “indulge” the thought of death or to ask ourselves how we shall “weather an eternal night” but by presenting to us the object of his compassion truthfully and lovingly  and when he handles greater themes when he takes a wider survey and considers the men or the deeds which have a direct influence on the welfare of communities and nations there is the same unselfish warmth of feeling the same scrupulous truthfulness  he is never vague in his remonstrance or his satire but puts his finger on some particular vice or folly which excites his indignation or “dissolves his heart in pity” because of some specific injury it does to his fellowman or to a sacred cause  and when he is asked why he interests himself about the sorrows and wrongs of others hear what is the reason he gives  not like young that the movements of the planets show a mutual dependence and that      “thus man his sovereign duty learns in this     material picture of benevolence”  or that—      “more generous sorrow while it sinks exalts     and conscious virtue mitigates the pang”  what is cowper’s answer when he imagines some “sage erudite profound” asking him “what’s the world to you”      “much  i was born of woman and drew milk     as sweet as charity from human breasts     i think articulate i laugh and weep     and exercise all functions of a man     how then should i and any man that lives     be strangers to each other”  young is astonished that men can make war on each other—that any one can “seize his brother’s throat” while      “the planets cry ‘forbear’”  cowper weeps because      “there is no flesh in man’s obdurate heart     it does not feel for man”  young applauds god as a monarch with an empire and a court quite superior to the english or as an author who produces “volumes for man’s perusal” cowper sees his father’s love in all the gentle pleasures of the home fireside in the charms even of the wintry landscape and thinks—      “happy who walks with him whom what he finds     of flavor or of scent in fruit or flower     or what he views of beautiful or grand     in nature from the broad majestic oak     to the green blade that twinkles in the sun     prompts with remembrance of a present god”  to conclude—for we must arrest ourselves in a contrast that would lead us beyond our bounds  young flies for his utmost consolation to the day of judgment when               “final ruin fiercely drives     her ploughshare o’er creation”  when earth stars and sun are swept aside      “and now all dross removed heaven’s own pure day     full on the confines of our ether flames     while dreadful contrast far how far beneath     hell bursting belches forth her blazing seas     and storms suphureous her voracious jaws     expanding wide and roaring for her prey”  dr young and similar “ornaments of religion and virtue” passing of course with grateful “applause” into the upper region  cowper finds his highest inspiration in the millennium—in the restoration of this our beloved home of earth to perfect holiness and bliss when the supreme      “shall visit earth in mercy shall descend     propitious in his chariot paved with love     and what his storms have blasted and defaced     for man’s revolt shall with a smile repair”  and into what delicious melody his song flows at the thought of that blessedness to be enjoyed by future generations on earth      “the dwellers in the vales and on the rocks     shout to each other and the mountains tops     from distant mountains catch the flying joy     till nation after nation taught the strain     earth rolls the rapturous hosanna round”  the sum of our comparison is this in young we have the type of that deficient human sympathy that impiety toward the present and the visible which flies for its motives its sanctities and its religion to the remote the vague and the unknown in cowper we have the type of that genuine love which cherishes things in proportion to their nearness and feels its reverence grow in proportion to the intimacy of its knowledge    viii  the influence of rationalism 257   there is a valuable class of books on great subjects which have something of the character and functions of good popular lecturing  they are not original not subtle not of close logical texture not exquisite either in thought or style but by virtue of these negatives they are all the more fit to act on the average intelligence  they have enough of organizing purpose in them to make their facts illustrative and to leave a distinct result in the mind even when most of the facts are forgotten and they have enough of vagueness and vacillation in their theory to win them ready acceptance from a mixed audience  the vagueness and vacillation are not devices of timidity they are the honest result of the writer’s own mental character which adapts him to be the instructor and the favorite of “the general reader”  for the most part the general reader of the present day does not exactly know what distance he goes he only knows that he does not go “too far”  of any remarkable thinker whose writings have excited controversy he likes to have it said that “his errors are to be deplored” leaving it not too certain what those errors are he is fond of what may be called disembodied opinions that float in vapory phrases above all systems of thought or action he likes an undefined christianity which opposes itself to nothing in particular an undefined education of the people an undefined amelioration of all things in fact he likes sound views—nothing extreme but something between the excesses of the past and the excesses of the present  this modern type of the general reader may be known in conversation by the cordiality with which he assents to indistinct blurred statements say that black is black he will shake his head and hardly think it say that black is not so very black he will reply “exactly”  he has no hesitation if you wish it even to get up at a public meeting and express his conviction that at times and within certain limits the radii of a circle have a tendency to be equal but on the other hand he would urge that the spirit of geometry may be carried a little too far his only bigotry is a bigotry against any clearly defined opinion not in the least based on a scientific scepticism but belonging to a lack of coherent thought—a spongy texture of mind that gravitates strongly to nothing  the one thing he is staunch for is the utmost liberty of private haziness  but precisely these characteristics of the general reader rendering him incapable of assimilating ideas unless they are administered in a highly diluted form make it a matter of rejoicing that there are clever fairminded men who will write books for him—men very much above him in knowledge and ability but not too remote from him in their habits of thinking and who can thus prepare for him infusions of history and science that will leave some solidifying deposit and save him from a fatal softening of the intellectual skeleton  among such serviceable writers mr lecky’s “history of the rise and influence of the spirit of rationalism in europe” entitles him to a high place  he has prepared himself for its production by an unusual amount of welldirected reading he has chosen his facts and quotations with much judgment and he gives proof of those important moral qualifications impartiality seriousness and modesty  this praise is chiefly applicable to the long chapter on the history of magic and witchcraft which opens the work and to the two chapters on the antecedents and history of persecution which occur the one at the end of the first volume the other at the beginning of the second  in these chapters mr lecky has a narrower and bettertraced path before him than in other portions of his work he is more occupied with presenting a particular class of facts in their historical sequence and in their relation to certain grand tidemarks of opinion than with disquisition and his writing is freer than elsewhere from an apparent confusedness of thought and an exuberance of approximative phrases which can be serviceable in no other way than as diluents needful for the sort of reader we have just described  the history of magic and witchcraft has been judiciously chosen by mr lecky as the subject of his first section on the declining sense of the miraculous because it is strikingly illustrative of a position with the truth of which he is strongly impressed though he does not always treat of it with desirable clearness and precision namely that certain beliefs become obsolete not in consequence of direct arguments against them but because of their incongruity with prevalent habits of thought here is his statement of the two “classes of influences” by which the mass of men in what is called civilized society get their beliefs gradually modified      “if we ask why it is that the world has rejected what was once so     universally and so intensely believed why a narrative of an old     woman who had been seen riding on a broomstick or who was proved to     have transformed herself into a wolf and to have devoured the flocks     of her neighbors is deemed so entirely incredible most persons     would probably be unable to give a very definite answer to the     question  it is not because we have examined the evidence and found     it insufficient for the disbelief always precedes when it does not     prevent examination  it is rather because the idea of absurdity is     so strongly attached to such narratives that it is difficult even to     consider them with gravity  yet at one time no such improbability     was felt and hundreds of persons have been burnt simply on the two     grounds i have mentioned      “when so complete a change takes place in public opinion it may be     ascribed to one or other of two causes  it may be the result of a     controversy which has conclusively settled the question establishing     to the satisfaction of all parties a clear preponderance of argument     or fact in favor of one opinion and making that opinion a truism     which is accepted by all enlightened men even though they have not     themselves examined the evidence on which it rests  thus if any one     in a company of ordinarily educated persons were to deny the motion     of the earth or the circulation of the blood his statement would be     received with derision though it is probable that some of his     audience would be unable to demonstrate the first truth and that     very few of them could give sufficient reasons for the second  they     may not themselves be able to defend their position but they are     aware that at certain known periods of history controversies on     those subjects took place and that known writers then brought     forward some definite arguments or experiments which were ultimately     accepted by the whole learned world as rigid and conclusive     demonstrations  it is possible also for as complete a change to be     effected by what is called the spirit of the age  the general     intellectual tendencies pervading the literature of a century     profoundly modify the character of the public mind  they form a new     tone and habit of thought  they alter the measure of probability     they create new attractions and new antipathies and they eventually     cause as absolute a rejection of certain old opinions as could be     produced by the most cogent and definite arguments”  mr lecky proceeds to some questionable views concerning the evidences of witchcraft which seem to be irreconcilable even with his own remarks later on but they lead him to the statement thoroughly made out by his historical survey that “movement was mainly silent unargumentative and insensible that men came gradually to disbelieve in witchcraft because they came gradually to look upon it as absurd and that this new tone of thought appeared first of all in those who were least subject to theological influences and soon spread through the educated laity and last of all took possession of the clergy”  we have rather painful proof that this “second class of influences” with a vast number go hardly deeper than fashion and that witchcraft to many of us is absurd only on the same ground that our grandfathers’ gigs are absurd  it is felt preposterous to think of spiritual agencies in connection with ragged beldames soaring on broomsticks in an age when it is known that mediums of communication with the invisible world are usually unctuous personages dressed in excellent broadcloth who soar above the curtainpoles without any broomstick and who are not given to unprofitable intrigues  the enlightened imagination rejects the figure of a witch with her profile in dark relief against the moon and her broomstick cutting a constellation  no undiscovered natural laws no names of “respectable” witnesses are invoked to make us feel our presumption in questioning the diabolic intimacies of that obsolete old woman for it is known now that the undiscovered laws and the witnesses qualified by the payment of income tax are all in favor of a different conception—the image of a heavy gentleman in boots and black coattails foreshortened against the cornice  yet no less a person than sir thomas browne once wrote that those who denied there were witches inasmuch as they thereby denied spirits also were “obliquely and upon consequence a sort not of infidels but of atheists”  at present doubtless in certain circles unbelievers in heavy gentlemen who float in the air by means of undiscovered laws are also taxed with atheism illiberal as it is not to admit that mere weakness of understanding may prevent one from seeing how that phenomenon is necessarily involved in the divine origin of things  with still more remarkable parallelism sir thomas browne goes on “those that to refute their incredulity desire to see apparitions shall questionless never behold any nor have the power to be so much as witches  the devil hath made them already in a heresy as capital as witchcraft and to appear to them were but to convert them” it would be difficult to see what has been changed here but the mere drapery of circumstance if it were not for this prominent difference between our own days and the days of witchcraft that instead of torturing drowning or burning the innocent we give hospitality and large pay to—the highly distinguished medium  at least we are safely rid of certain horrors but if the multitude—that “farraginous concurrence of all conditions tempers sexes and ages”—do not roll back even to a superstition that carries cruelty in its train it is not because they possess a cultivated reason but because they are pressed upon and held up by what we may call an external reason—the sum of conditions resulting from the laws of material growth from changes produced by great historical collisions shattering the structures of ages and making new highways for events and ideas and from the activities of higher minds no longer existing merely as opinions and teaching but as institutions and organizations with which the interests the affections and the habits of the multitude are inextricably interwoven  no undiscovered laws accounting for small phenomena going forward under drawingroom tables are likely to affect the tremendous facts of the increase of population the rejection of convicts by our colonies the exhaustion of the soil by cotton plantations which urge even upon the foolish certain questions certain claims certain views concerning the scheme of the world that can never again be silenced  if right reason is a right representation of the coexistence and sequences of things here are coexistences and sequences that do not wait to be discovered but press themselves upon us like bars of iron  no séances at a guinea a head for the sake of being pinched by “mary jane” can annihilate railways steamships and electric telegraphs which are demonstrating the interdependence of all human interests and making selfinterest a duct for sympathy  these things are part of the external reason to which internal silliness has inevitably to accommodate itself  three points in the history of magic and witchcraft are well brought out by mr lecky  first that the cruelties connected with it did not begin until men’s minds had ceased to repose implicitly in a sacramental system which made them feel well armed against evil spirits that is until the eleventh century when there came a sort of morning dream of doubt and heresy bringing on the one side the terror of timid consciences and on the other the terrorism of authority or zeal bent on checking the rising struggle  in that time of comparative mental repose says mr lecky      “all those conceptions of diabolical presence all that     predisposition toward the miraculous which acted so fearfully upon     the imaginations of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries existed     but the implicit faith the boundless and triumphant credulity with     which the virtue of ecclesiastical rites was accepted rendered them     comparatively innocuous  if men had been a little less     superstitious the effects of their superstition would have been much     more terrible  it was firmly believed that any one who deviated from     the strict line of orthodoxy must soon succumb beneath the power of     satan but as there was no spirit of rebellion or doubt this     persuasion did not produce any extraordinary terrorism”  the church was disposed to confound heretical opinion with sorcery false doctrine was especially the devil’s work and it was a ready conclusion that a denier or innovator had held consultation with the father of lies it is a saying of a zealous catholic in the sixteenth century quoted by maury in his excellent work “de la magie”—“crescit cum magia hæresis cum hæresi magia”  even those who doubted were terrified at their doubts for trust is more easily undermined than terror  fear is earlier born than hope lays a stronger grasp on man’s system than any other passion and remains master of a larger group of involuntary actions  a chief aspect of man’s moral development is the slow subduing of fear by the gradual growth of intelligence and its suppression as a motive by the presence of impulses less animally selfish so that in relation to invisible power fear at last ceases to exist save in that interfusion with higher faculties which we call awe  secondly mr lecky shows clearly that dogmatic protestantism holding the vivid belief in satanic agency to be an essential of piety would have felt it shame to be a whit behind catholicism in severity against the devil’s servants  luther’s sentiment was that he would not suffer a witch to live he was not much more merciful to jews and in spite of his fondness for children believing a certain child to have been begotten by the devil he recommended the parents to throw it into the river  the torch must be turned on the worst errors of heroic minds—not in irreverent ingratitude but for the sake of measuring our vast and various debt to all the influences which have concurred in the intervening ages to make us recognize as detestable errors the honest convictions of men who in mere individual capacity and moral force were very much above us  again the scotch puritans during the comparatively short period of their ascendency surpassed all christians before them in the elaborate ingenuity of the tortures they applied for the discovery of witchcraft and sorcery and did their utmost to prove that if scotch calvinism was the true religion the chief “note” of the true religion was cruelty  it is hardly an endurable task to read the story of their doings thoroughly to imagine them as a past reality is already a sort of torture  one detail is enough and it is a comparatively mild one  it was the regular profession of men called “prickers” to thrust long pins into the body of a suspected witch in order to detect the insensible spot which was the infallible sign of her guilt  on a superficial view one would be in danger of saying that the main difference between the teachers who sanctioned these things and the muchdespised ancestors who offered human victims inside a huge wicker idol was that they arrived at a more elaborate barbarity by a longer series of dependent propositions we do not share mr buckle’s opinion that a scotch minister’s groans were a part of his deliberate plan for keeping the people in a state of terrified subjection the ministers themselves held the belief they taught and might well groan over it  what a blessing has a little false logic been to the world  seeing that men are so slow to question their premises they must have made each other much more miserable if pity had not sometimes drawn tender conclusions not warranted by major and minor if there had not been people with an amiable imbecility of reasoning which enabled them at once to cling to hideous beliefs and to be conscientiously inconsistent with them in their conduct  there is nothing like acute deductive reasoning for keeping a man in the dark it might be called the technique of the intellect and the concentration of the mind upon it corresponds to that predominance of technical skill in art which ends in degradation of the artist’s function unless new inspiration and invention come to guide it  and of this there is some good illustration furnished by that third node in the history of witchcraft the beginning of its end which is treated in an interesting manner by mr lecky  it is worth noticing that the most important defences of the belief in witchcraft against the growing scepticism in the latter part of the sixteenth century and in the seventeenth were the productions of men who in some departments were among the foremost thinkers of their time  one of them was jean bodin the famous writer on government and jurisprudence whose “republic” hallam thinks had an important influence in england and furnished “a store of arguments and examples that were not lost on the thoughtful minds of our countrymen”  in some of his views he was original and bold for example he anticipated montesquieu in attempting to appreciate the relations of government and climate  hallam inclines to the opinion that he was a jew and attached divine authority only to the old testament but this was enough to furnish him with his chief data for the existence of witches and for their capital punishment and in the account of his “republic” given by hallam there is enough evidence that the sagacity which often enabled him to make fine use of his learning was also often entangled in it to temper our surprise at finding a writer on political science of whom it could be said that along with montesquieu he was “the most philosophical of those who had read so deeply the most learned of those who had thought so much” in the van of the forlorn hope to maintain the reality of witchcraft  it should be said that he was equally confident of the unreality of the copernican hypothesis on the ground that it was contrary to the tenets of the theologians and philosophers and to commonsense and therefore subversive of the foundations of every science  of his work on witchcraft mr lecky says      “the ‘démonomanie des sorciers’ is chiefly an appeal to authority     which the author deemed on this subject so unanimous and so     conclusive that it was scarcely possible for any sane man to resist     it  he appealed to the popular belief in all countries in all ages     and in all religions  he cited the opinions of an immense multitude     of the greatest writers of pagan antiquity and of the most     illustrious of the fathers  he showed how the laws of all nations     recognized the existence of witchcraft and he collected hundreds of     cases which had been investigated before the tribunals of his own or     of other countries  he relates with the most minute and     circumstantial detail and with the most unfaltering confidence all     the proceedings at the witches’ sabbath the methods which the     witches employed in transporting themselves through the air their     transformations their carnal intercourse with the devil their     various means of injuring their enemies the signs that lead to their     detection their confessions when condemned and their demeanor at     the stake”  something must be allowed for a lawyer’s affection toward a belief which had furnished so many “cases”  bodin’s work had been immediately prompted by the treatise “de prestigiis dænionum” written by john wier a german physician a treatise which is worth notice as an example of a transitional form of opinion for which many analogies may be found in the history both of religion and science  wier believed in demons and in possession by demons but his practice as a physician had convinced him that the socalled witches were patients and victims that the devil took advantage of their diseased condition to delude them and that there was no consent of an evil will on the part of the women  he argued that the word in leviticus translated “witch” meant “poisoner” and besought the princes of europe to hinder the further spilling of innocent blood these heresies of wier threw bodin into such a state of amazed indignation that if he had been an ancient jew instead of a modern economical one he would have rent his garments  “no one had ever heard of pardon being accorded to sorcerers” and probably the reason why charles ix died young was because he had pardoned the sorcerer trios echelles  we must remember that this was in 1581 when the great scientific movement of the renaissance had hardly begun—when galileo was a youth of seventeen and kepler a boy of ten  but directly afterward on the other side came montaigne whose sceptical acuteness could arrive at negatives without any apparatus of method  a certain keen narrowness of nature will secure a man from many absurd beliefs which the larger soul vibrating to more manifold influences would have a long struggle to part with  and so we find the charming chatty montaigne—in one of the brightest of his essays “des boiteux” where he declares that from his own observation of witches and sorcerers he should have recommended them to be treated with curative hellebore—stating in his own way a pregnant doctrine since taught more gravely  it seems to him much less of a prodigy that men should lie or that their imaginations should deceive them than that a human body should be carried through the air on a broomstick or up a chimney by some unknown spirit  he thinks it a sad business to persuade oneself that the test of truth lies in the multitude of believers—“en une prosse où les fols surpassent de tant les sages en nombre”  ordinarily he has observed when men have something stated to them as a fact they are more ready to explain it than to inquire whether it is real “ils passent pardessus les propositions mais ils examinent les conséquences ils laissent les choses et courent aux causes”  there is a sort of strong and generous ignorance which is as honorable and courageous as science—“ignorance pour laquelle concevoir il n’y a pas moins de science qu’à concevoir la science”  and à propos of the immense traditional evidence which weighed with such men as bodin he says—“as for the proofs and arguments founded on experience and facts i do not pretend to unravel these  what end of a thread is there to lay hold of  i often cut them as alexander did his knot  après tout c’est mettre ses conjectures â bien haut prix que d’en faire cuire un homme tout dif”  writing like this when it finds eager readers is a sign that the weather is changing yet much later namely after 1665 when the royal society had been founded our own glanvil the author of the “scepsis scientifica” a work that was a remarkable advance toward the true definition of the limits of inquiry and that won him his election as fellow of the society published an energetic vindication of the belief in witchcraft of which mr lecky gives the following sketch      “the ‘sadducismus triumphatus’ which is probably the ablest book     ever published in defence of the superstition opens with a striking     picture of the rapid progress of the scepticism in england     everywhere a disbelief in witchcraft was becoming fashionable in the     upper classes but it was a disbelief that arose entirely from a     strong sense of its antecedent improbability  all who were opposed     to the orthodox faith united in discrediting witchcraft  they     laughed at it as palpably absurd as involving the most grotesque     and ludicrous conceptions as so essentially incredible that it would     be a waste of time to examine it  this spirit had arisen since the     restoration although the laws were still in force and although     little or no direct reasoning had been brought to bear upon the     subject  in order to combat it glanvil proceeded to examine the     general question of the credibility of the miraculous  he saw that     the reason why witchcraft was ridiculed was because it was a phase     of the miraculous and the work of the devil that the scepticism was     chiefly due to those who disbelieved in miracles and the devil and     that the instances of witchcraft or possession in the bible were     invariably placed on a level with those that were tried in the law     courts of england  that the evidence of the belief was overwhelming     he firmly believed and this indeed was scarcely disputed but     until the sense of à priori improbability was removed no possible     accumulation of facts would cause men to believe it  to that task he     accordingly addressed himself  anticipating the idea and almost the     words of modern controversialists he urged that there was such a     thing as a credulity of unbelief and that those who believed so     strange a concurrence of delusions as was necessary on the     supposition of the unreality of witchcraft were far more credulous     than those who accepted the belief  he made his very scepticism his     principal weapon and analyzing with much acuteness the à priori     objections he showed that they rested upon an unwarrantable     confidence in our knowledge of the laws of the spirit world that     they implied the existence of some strict analogy between the     faculties of men and of spirits and that as such analogy most     probably did not exist no reasoning based on the supposition could     dispense men from examining the evidence  he concluded with a large     collection of cases the evidence of which was as he thought     incontestable”  we have quoted this sketch because glanvil’s argument against the à priori objection of absurdity is fatiguingly urged in relation to other alleged marvels which to busy people seriously occupied with the difficulties of affairs of science or of art seem as little worthy of examination as aëronautic broomsticks  and also because we here see glanvil in combating an incredulity that does not happen to be his own wielding that very argument of traditional evidence which he had made the subject of vigorous attack in his “scepsis scientifica”  but perhaps large minds have been peculiarly liable to this fluctuation concerning the sphere of tradition because while they have attacked its misapplications they have been the more solicited by the vague sense that tradition is really the basis of our best life  our sentiments may be called organized traditions and a large part of our actions gather all their justification all their attraction and aroma from the memory of the life lived of the actions done before we were born  in the absence of any profound research into psychological functions or into the mysteries of inheritance in the absence of any comprehensive view of man’s historical development and the dependence of one age on another a mind at all rich in sensibilities must always have had an indefinite uneasiness in an undistinguishing attack on the coercive influence of tradition  and this may be the apology for the apparent inconsistency of glanvil’s acute criticism on the one side and his indignation at the “looser gentry” who laughed at the evidences for witchcraft on the other  we have already taken up too much space with this subject of witchcraft else we should be tempted to dwell on sir thomas browne who far surpassed glanvil in magnificent incongruity of opinion and whose works are the most remarkable combination existing of witty sarcasm against ancient nonsense and modern obsequiousness with indications of a capacious credulity  after all we may be sharing what seems to us the hardness of these men who sat in their studies and argued at their ease about a belief that would be reckoned to have caused more misery and bloodshed than any other superstition if there had been no such thing as persecution on the ground of religious opinion  on this subject of persecution mr lecky writes his best with clearness of conception with calm justice bent on appreciating the necessary tendency of ideas and with an appropriateness of illustration that could be supplied only by extensive and intelligent reading  persecution he shows is not in any sense peculiar to the catholic church it is a direct sequence of the doctrines that salvation is to be had only within the church and that erroneous belief is damnatory—doctrines held as fully by protestant sects as by the catholics and in proportion to its power protestantism has been as persecuting as catholicism  he maintains in opposition to the favorite modern notion of persecution defeating its own object that the church holding the dogma of exclusive salvation was perfectly consequent and really achieved its end of spreading one belief and quenching another by calling in the aid of the civil arm  who will say that governments by their power over institutions and patronage as well as over punishment have not power also over the interests and inclinations of men and over most of those external conditions into which subjects are born and which make them adopt the prevalent belief as a second nature  hence to a sincere believer in the doctrine of exclusive salvation governments had it in their power to save men from perdition and wherever the clergy were at the elbow of the civil arm no matter whether they were catholic or protestant persecution was the result  “compel them to come in” was a rule that seemed sanctioned by mercy and the horrible sufferings it led men to inflict seemed small to minds accustomed to contemplate as a perpetual source of motive the eternal unmitigated miseries of a hell that was the inevitable destination of a majority among mankind  it is a significant fact noted by mr lecky that the only two leaders of the reformation who advocated tolerance were zuinglius and socinus both of them disbelievers in exclusive salvation  and in corroboration of other evidence that the chief triumphs of the reformation were due to coercion he commends to the special attention of his readers the following quotation from a work attributed without question to the famous protestant theologian jurieu who had himself been hindered as a protestant from exercising his professional functions in france and was settled as pastor at rotterdam  it should be remembered that jurieu’s labors fell in the latter part of the seventeenth century and in the beginning of the eighteenth and that he was the contemporary of bayle with whom he was in bitter controversial hostility  he wrote then at a time when there was warm debate on the question of toleration and it was his great object to vindicate himself and his french fellowprotestants from all laxity on this point      “peut on nier que le panganisme est tombé dans le monde par     l’autorité des empereurs romains  on peut assurer sans temerité que     le paganisme seroit encore debout et que les trois quarts de     l’europe seroient encore payens si constantin et ses successeurs     n’avaient employé leur autorité pour l’abolir  mais je vous prie     de quelles voies dieu s’est il servi dans ces derniers siècles pour     rétablir la veritable religion dans l’occident  les rois de suède     ceux de danemarck ceux d’angleterre les magistrats souverains     de suisse des païs bas des villes livres d’allemagne les     princes électeurs et autres princes souverains de l’empire     n’ont ils pas emploié leur autorité pour abbattre le papisme”  indeed wherever the tremendous alternative of everlasting torments is believed in—believed in so that it becomes a motive determining the life—not only persecution but every other form of severity and gloom are the legitimate consequences  there is much ready declamation in these days against the spirit of asceticism and against zeal for doctrinal conversion but surely the macerated form of a saint francis the fierce denunciations of a saint dominic the groans and prayerful wrestlings of the puritan who seasoned his bread with tears and made all pleasurable sensation sin are more in keeping with the contemplation of unending anguish as the destiny of a vast multitude whose nature we share than the rubicund cheerfulness of some modern divines who profess to unite a smiling liberalism with a wellbred and tacit but unshaken confidence in the reality of the bottomless pit  but in fact as mr lecky maintains that awful image with its group of associated dogmas concerning the inherited curse and the damnation of unbaptized infants of heathens and of heretics has passed away from what he is fond of calling “the realizations” of christendom  these things are no longer the objects of practical belief  they may be mourned for in encyclical letters bishops may regret them doctors of divinity may sign testimonials to the excellent character of these decayed beliefs but for the mass of christians they are no more influential than unrepealed but forgotten statutes  and with these dogmas has melted away the strong basis for the defence of persecution  no man now writes eager vindications of himself and his colleagues from the suspicion of adhering to the principle of toleration  and this momentous change it is mr lecky’s object to show is due to that concurrence of conditions which he has chosen to call “the advance of the spirit of rationalism”  in other parts of his work where he attempts to trace the action of the same conditions on the acceptance of miracles and on other chief phases of our historical development mr lecky has laid himself open to considerable criticism  the chapters on the “miracles of the church” the æsthetic scientific and moral development of rationalism the secularization of politics and the industrial history of rationalism embrace a wide range of diligently gathered facts but they are nowhere illuminated by a sufficiently clear conception and statement of the agencies at work or the mode of their action in the gradual modification of opinion and of life  the writer frequently impresses us as being in a state of hesitation concerning his own standingpoint which may form a desirable stage in private meditation but not in published exposition  certain epochs in theoretic conception certain considerations which should be fundamental to his survey are introduced quite incidentally in a sentence or two or in a note which seems to be an afterthought  great writers and their ideas are touched upon too slightly and with too little discrimination and important theories are sometimes characterized with a rashness which conscientious revision will correct  there is a fatiguing use of vague or shifting phrases such as “modern civilization” “spirit of the age” “tone of thought” “intellectual type of the age” “bias of the imagination” “habits of religious thought” unbalanced by any precise definition and the spirit of rationalism is sometimes treated of as if it lay outside the specific mental activities of which it is a generalized expression  mr curdle’s famous definition of the dramatic unities as “a sort of a general oneness” is not totally false but such luminousness as it has could only be perceived by those who already knew what the unities were  mr lecky has the advantage of being strongly impressed with the great part played by the emotions in the formation of opinion and with the high complexity of the causes at work in social evolution but he frequently writes as if he had never yet distinguished between the complexity of the conditions that produce prevalent states of mind and the inability of particular minds to give distinct reasons for the preferences or persuasions produced by those states  in brief he does not discriminate or does not help his reader to discriminate between objective complexity and subjective confusion  but the most muddleheaded gentleman who represents the spirit of the age by observing as he settles his collar that the development theory is quite “the thing” is a result of definite processes if we could only trace them  “mental attitudes” and “predispositions” however vague in consciousness have not vague causes any more than the “blind motions of the spring” in plants and animals  the word “rationalism” has the misfortune shared by most words in this gray world of being somewhat equivocal  this evil may be nearly overcome by careful preliminary definition but mr lecky does not supply this and the original specific application of the word to a particular phase of biblical interpretation seems to have clung about his use of it with a misleading effect  through some parts of his book he appears to regard the grand characteristic of modern thought and civilization compared with ancient as a radiation in the first instance from a change in religious conceptions  the supremely important fact that the gradual reduction of all phenomena within the sphere of established law which carries as a consequence the rejection of the miraculous has its determining current in the development of physical science seems to have engaged comparatively little of his attention at least he gives it no prominence  the great conception of universal regular sequence without partiality and without caprice—the conception which is the most potent force at work in the modification of our faith and of the practical form given to our sentiments—could only grow out of that patient watching of external fact and that silencing of preconceived notions which are urged upon the mind by the problems of physical science  there is not room here to explain and justify the impressions of dissatisfaction which have been briefly indicated but a serious writer like mr lecky will not find such suggestions altogether useless  the objections even the misunderstandings of a reader who is not careless or illdisposed may serve to stimulate an author’s vigilance over his thoughts as well as his style  it would be gratifying to see some future proof that mr lecky has acquired juster views than are implied in the assertion that philosophers of the sensational school “can never rise to the conception of the disinterested” and that he has freed himself from all temptation to that mingled laxity of statement and illpitched elevation of tone which are painfully present in the closing pages of his second volume    ix  the grammar of ornament 272   the inventor of movable types says the venerable teufelsdröckh was disbanding hired armies cashiering most kings and senates and creating a whole new democratic world  has any one yet said what great things are being done by the men who are trying to banish ugliness from our streets and our homes and to make both the outside and inside of our dwellings worthy of a world where there are forests and flowertressed meadows and the plumage of birds where the insects carry lessons of color on their wings and even the surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders of iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage  they too are modifying opinions for they are modifying men’s moods and habits which are the mothers of opinions having quite as much to do with their formation as the responsible father—reason  think of certain hideous manufacturing towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious perdition and the pleasure is chiefly gin  the dingy surface of wall pierced by the ugliest windows the staring shopfronts paperhangings carpets brass and gilt mouldings and advertising placards have an effect akin to that of malaria it is easy to understand that with such surroundings there is more belief in cruelty than in beneficence and that the best earthly bliss attainable is the dulling of the external senses  for it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is taken for beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty the subtle relation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life forbids that bad taste should ever be harmless to our moral sensibility or our intellectual discernment and—more than that—as it is probable that fine musical harmonies have a sanative influence over our bodily organization it is also probable that just coloring and lovely combinations of lines may be necessary to the complete wellbeing of our systems apart from any conscious delight in them  a savage may indulge in discordant chuckles and shrieks and gutturals and think that they please the gods but it does not follow that his frame would not be favorably wrought upon by the vibrations of a grand church organ  one sees a person capable of choosing the worst style of wallpaper become suddenly afflicted by its ugliness under an attack of illness  and if an evil state of blood and lymph usually goes along with an evil state of mind who shall say that the ugliness of our streets the falsity of our ornamentation the vulgarity of our upholstery have not something to do with those bad tempers which breed false conclusions  on several grounds it is possible to make a more speedy and extensive application of artistic reform to our interior decoration than to our external architecture  one of these grounds is that most of our ugly buildings must stand we cannot afford to pull them down  but every year we are decorating interiors afresh and people of modest means may benefit by the introduction of beautiful designs into stucco ornaments paperhangings draperies and carpets  fine taste in the decoration of interiors is a benefit that spreads from the palace to the clerk’s house with one parlor  all honor then to the architect who has zealously vindicated the claim of internal ornamentation to be a part of the architect’s function and has labored to rescue that form of art which is most closely connected with the sanctities and pleasures of our hearths from the hands of uncultured tradesmen  all the nation ought at present to know that this effort is peculiarly associated with the name of mr owen jones and those who are most disposed to dispute with the architect about his coloring must at least recognize the high artistic principle which has directed his attention to colored ornamentation as a proper branch of architecture  one monument of his effort in this way is his “grammar of ornament” of which a new and cheaper edition has just been issued  the one point in which it differs from the original and more expensive edition viz the reduction in the size of the pages the amount of matter and number of plates are unaltered is really an advantage it is now a very manageable folio and when the reader is in a lounging mood may be held easily on the knees  it is a magnificent book and those who know no more of it than the title should be told that they will find in it a pictorial history of ornamental design from its rudimentary condition as seen in the productions of savage tribes through all the other great types of art—the egyptian assyrian ancient persian greek roman byzantine arabian moresque mohammedanpersian indian celtic mediæval renaissance elizabethan and italian  the letterpress consists first of an introductory statement of fundamental principles of ornamentation—principles says the author which will be found to have been obeyed more or less instinctively by all nations in proportion as their art has been a genuine product of the national genius and secondly of brief historical essays some of them contributed by other eminent artists presenting a commentary on each characteristic series of illustrations with the useful appendage of bibliographical lists  the title “grammar of ornament” is so far appropriate that it indicates what mr owen jones is most anxious to be understood concerning the object of his work namely that it is intended to illustrate historically the application of principles and not to present a collection of models for mere copyists  the plates correspond to examples in syntax not to be repeated parrotlike but to be studied as embodiments of syntactical principles  there is a logic of form which cannot be departed from in ornamental design without a corresponding remoteness from perfection unmeaning irrelevant lines are as bad as irrelevant words or clauses that tend no whither  and as a suggestion toward the origination of fresh ornamental design the work concludes with some beautiful drawings of leaves and flowers from nature that the student tracing in them the simple laws of form which underlie an immense variety in beauty may the better discern the method by which the same laws were applied in the finest decorative work of the past and may have all the clearer prospect of the unexhausted possibilities of freshness which lie before him if refraining from mere imitation he will seek only such likeness to existing forms of ornamental art as arises from following like principles of combination    x  address to working men by felix holt   fellowworkmen i am not going to take up your time by complimenting you it has been the fashion to compliment kings and other authorities when they have come into power and to tell them that under their wise and beneficent rule happiness would certainly overflow the land  but the end has not always corresponded to that beginning  if it were true that we who work for wages had more of the wisdom and virtue necessary to the right use of power than has been shown by the aristocratic and mercantile classes we should not glory much in that fact or consider that it carried with it any near approach to infallibility  in my opinion there has been too much complimenting of that sort and whenever a speaker whether he is one of ourselves or not wastes our time in boasting or flattery i say let us hiss him  if we have the beginning of wisdom which is to know a little truth about ourselves we know that as a body we are neither very wise nor very virtuous  and to prove this i will not point specially to our own habits and doings but to the general state of the country  any nation that had within it a majority of men—and we are the majority—possessed of much wisdom and virtue would not tolerate the bad practices the commercial lying and swindling the poisonous adulteration of goods the retail cheating and the political bribery which are carried on boldly in the midst of us  a majority has the power of creating a public opinion  we could groan and hiss before we had the franchise if we had groaned and hissed in the right place if we had discerned better between good and evil if the multitude of us artisans and factory hands and miners and laborers of all sorts had been skilful faithful welljudging industrious sober—and i don’t see how there can be wisdom and virtue anywhere without these qualities—we should have made an audience that would have shamed the other classes out of their share in the national vices  we should have had better members of parliament better religious teachers honester tradesmen fewer foolish demagogues less impudence in infamous and brutal men and we should not have had among us the abomination of men calling themselves religious while living in splendor on illgotten gains  i say it is not possible for any society in which there is a very large body of wise and virtuous men to be as vicious as our society is—to have as low a standard of right and wrong to have so much belief in falsehood or to have so degrading barbarous a notion of what pleasure is or of what justly raises a man above his fellows therefore let us have none with this nonsense about our being much better than the rest of our countryman or the pretence that that was a reason why we ought to have such an extension of the franchise as has been given to us  the reason for our having the franchise as i want presently to show lies somewhere else than in our personal good qualities and does not in the least lie in any high betting chance that a delegate is a better man than a duke or that a sheffield grinder is a better man than any one of the firm he works for  however we have got our franchise now  we have been sarcastically called in the house of commons the future masters of the country and if that sarcasm contains any truth it seems to me that the first thing we had better think of is our heavy responsibility that is to say the terrible risk we run of working mischief and missing good as others have done before us  suppose certain men discontented with the irrigation of a country which depended for all its prosperity on the right direction being given to the waters of a great river had got the management of the irrigation before they were quite sure how exactly it could be altered for the better or whether they could command the necessary agency for such on alteration  those men would have a difficult and dangerous business on their hands and the more sense feeling and knowledge they had the more they would be likely to tremble rather than to triumph our situation is not altogether unlike theirs  for general prosperity and wellbeing is a vast crop that like the corn in egypt can be come at not at all by hurried snatching but only by a welljudged patient process and whether our political power will be any good to us now we have got it must depend entirely on the means and materials—the knowledge ability and honesty we have at command  these three things are the only conditions on which we can get any lasting benefit as every clever workman among us knows he knows that for an article to be worth much there must be a good invention or plan to go upon there must be a wellprepared material and there must be skilful and honest work in carrying out the plan  and by this test we may try those who want to be our leaders  have they anything to offer us besides indignant talk when they tell us we ought to have this that or the other thing can they explain to us any reasonable fair safe way of getting it  can they argue in favor of a particular change by showing us pretty closely how the change is likely to work  i don’t want to decry a just indignation on the contrary i should like it to be more thorough and general  a wise man more than two thousand years ago when he was asked what would most tend to lessen injustice in the world said “if every bystander felt as indignant at a wrong as if he himself were the sufferer”  let us cherish such indignation  but the longgrowing evils of a great nation are a tangled business asking for a good deal more than indignation in order to be got rid of  indignation is a fine warhorse but the warhorse must be ridden by a man it must be ridden by rationality skill courage armed with the right weapons and taking definite aim  we have reason to be discontented with many things and looking back either through the history of england to much earlier generations or to the legislation and administrations of later times we are justified in saying that many of the evils under which our country now suffers are the consequences of folly ignorance neglect or selfseeking in those who at different times have wielded the powers of rank office and money but the more bitterly we feel this the more loudly we utter it the stronger is the obligation we lay on ourselves to beware lest we also by a too hasty wresting of measures which seem to promise an immediate partial relief make a worse time of it for our own generation and leave a bad inheritance to our children  the deepest curse of wrongdoing whether of the foolish or wicked sort is that its effects are difficult to be undone  i suppose there is hardly anything more to be shuddered at than that part of the history of disease which shows how when a man injures his constitution by a life of vicious excess his children and grandchildren inherit diseased bodies and minds and how the effects of that unhappy inheritance continue to spread beyond our calculation  this is only one example of the law by which human lives are linked together another example of what we complain of when we point to our pauperism to the brutal ignorance of multitudes among our fellow countrymen to the weight of taxation laid on us by blamable wars to the wasteful channels made for the public money to the expense and trouble of getting justice and call these the effects of bad rule  this is the law that we all bear the yoke of the law of no man’s making and which no man can undo everybody now sees an example of it in the case of ireland  we who are living now are sufferers by the wrongdoing of those who lived before us we are the sufferers by each other’s wrongdoing and the children who come after us are and will be sufferers from the same causes  will any man say he doesn’t care for that law—it is nothing to him—what he wants is to better himself  with what face then will he complain of any injury  if he says that in politics or in any sort of social action he will not care to know what are likely to be the consequences to others besides himself he is defending the very worst doings that have brought about his discontent  he might as well say that there is no better rule needful for men than that each should tug and drive for what will please him without caring how that tugging will act on the fine widespread network of society in which he is fast meshed  if any man taught that as a doctrine we should know him for a fool  but there are men who act upon it every scoundrel for example whether he is a rich religious scoundrel who lies and cheats on a large scale and will perhaps come and ask you to send him to parliament or a poor pocketpicking scoundrel who will steal your loose pence while you are listening round the platform  none of us are so ignorant as not to know that a society a nation is held together by just the opposite doctrine and action—by the dependence of men on each other and the sense they have of a common interest in preventing injury  and we working men are i think of all classes the last that can afford to forget this for if we did we should be much like sailors cutting away the timbers of our own ship to warm our grog with  for what else is the meaning of our tradesunions  what else is the meaning of every flag we carry every procession we make every crowd we collect for the sake of making some protest on behalf of our body as receivers of wages if not this that it is our interest to stand by each other and that this being the common interest no one of us will try to make a good bargain for himself without considering what will be good for his fellows  and every member of a union believes that the wider he can spread his union the stronger and surer will be the effect of it  so i think i shall be borne out in saying that a working man who can put two and two together or take three from four and see what will be the remainder can understand that a society to be well off must be made up chiefly of men who consider the general good as well as their own  well but taking the world as it is—and this is one way we must take it when we want to find out how it can be improved—no society is made up of a single class society stands before us like that wonderful piece of life the human body with all its various parts depending on one another and with a terrible liability to get wrong because of that delicate dependence  we all know how many diseases the human body is apt to suffer from and how difficult it is even for the doctors to find out exactly where the seat or beginning of the disorder is  that is because the body is made up of so many various parts all related to each other or likely all to feel the effect if any one of them goes wrong  it is somewhat the same with our old nations or societies  no society ever stood long in the world without getting to be composed of different classes  now it is all pretence to say that there is no such thing as class interest  it is clear that if any particular number of men get a particular benefit from any existing institution they are likely to band together in order to keep up that benefit and increase it until it is perceived to be unfair and injurious to another large number who get knowledge and strength enough to set up a resistance  and this again has been part of the history of every great society since history began but the simple reason for this being that any large body of men is likely to have more of stupidity narrowness and greed than of farsightedness and generosity it is plain that the number who resist unfairness and injury are in danger of becoming injurious in their turn and in this way a justifiable resistance has become a damaging convulsion making everything worse instead of better  this has been seen so often that we ought to profit a little by the experience  so long as there is selfishness in men so long as they have not found out for themselves institutions which express and carry into practice the truth that the highest interest of mankind must at last be a common and not a divided interest so long as the gradual operation of steady causes has not made that truth a part of every man’s knowledge and feeling just as we now not only know that it is good for our health to be cleanly but feel that cleanliness is only another word for comfort which is the underside or lining of all pleasure so long i say as men wink at their own knowingness or hold their heads high because they have got an advantage over their fellows so long class interest will be in danger of making itself felt injuriously  no set of men will get any sort of power without being in danger of wanting more than their right share  but on the other hand it is just as certain that no set of men will get angry at having less than their right share and set up a claim on that ground without falling into just the same danger of exacting too much and exacting it in wrong ways  it’s human nature we have got to work with all round and nothing else  that seems like saying something very commonplace—nay obvious as if one should say that where there are hands there are mouths  yet to hear a good deal of the speechifying and to see a good deal of the action that go forward one might suppose it was forgotten  but i come back to this that in our old society there are old institutions and among them the various distinctions and inherited advantages of classes which have shaped themselves along with all the wonderful slowgrowing system of things made up of our laws our commerce and our stores of all sorts whether in material objects such as buildings and machinery or in knowledge such as scientific thought and professional skill  just as in that case i spoke of before the irrigation of a country which must absolutely have its water distributed or it will bear no crop there are the old channels the old banks and the old pumps which must be used as they are until new and better have been prepared or the structure of the old has been gradually altered but it would be fool’s work to batter down a pump only because a better might be made when you had no machinery ready for a new one it would be wicked work if villages lost their crops by it  now the only safe way by which society can be steadily improved and our worst evils reduced is not by any attempt to do away directly with the actually existing class distinctions and advantages as if everybody could have the same sort of work or lead the same sort of life which none of my hearers are stupid enough to suppose but by the turning of class interests into class functions or duties  what i mean is that each class should be urged by the surrounding conditions to perform its particular work under the strong pressure of responsibility to the nation at large that our public affairs should be got into a state in which there should be no impunity for foolish or faithless conduct  in this way the public judgment would sift out incapability and dishonesty from posts of high charge and even personal ambition would necessarily become of a worthier sort since the desires of the most selfish men must be a good deal shaped by the opinions of those around them and for one person to put on a cap and bells or to go about dishonest or paltry ways of getting rich that he may spend a vast sum of money in having more finery than his neighbors he must be pretty sure of a crowd who will applaud him  now changes can only be good in proportion as they help to bring about this sort of result in proportion as they put knowledge in the place of ignorance and fellowfeeling in the place of selfishness  in the course of that substitution class distinctions must inevitably change their character and represent the varying duties of men not their varying interests but this end will not come by impatience  “day will not break the sooner because we get up before the twilight”  still less will it come by mere undoing or change merely as change  and moreover if we believed that it would be unconditionally hastened by our getting the franchise we should be what i call superstitious men believing in magic or the production of a result by hocuspocus  our getting the franchise will greatly hasten that good end in proportion only as every one of us has the knowledge the foresight the conscience that will make him welljudging and scrupulous in the use of it  the nature of things in this world has been determined for us beforehand and in such a way that no ship can be expected to sail well on a difficult voyage and reach the right port unless it is well manned the nature of the winds and the waves of the timbers the sails and the cordage will not accommodate itself to drunken mutinous sailors  you will not suspect me of wanting to preach any cant to you or of joining in the pretence that everything is in a fine way and need not be made better  what i am striving to keep in our minds is the care the precaution with which we should go about making things better so that the public order may not be destroyed so that no fatal shock may be given to this society of ours this living body in which our lives are bound up  after the reform bill of 1832 i was in an election riot which showed me clearly on a small scale what public disorder must always be and i have never forgotten that the riot was brought about chiefly by the agency of dishonest men who professed to be on the people’s side  now the danger hanging over change is great just in proportion as it tends to produce such disorder by giving any large number of ignorant men whose notions of what is good are of a low and brutal sort the belief that they have got power into their hands and may do pretty much as they like  if any one can look round us and say that he sees no signs of any such danger now and that our national condition is running along like a clear broadening stream safe not to get choked with mud i call him a cheerful man perhaps he does his own gardening and seldom taken exercise far away from home  to us who have no gardens and often walk abroad it is plain that we can never get into a bit of a crowd but we must rub clothes with a set of roughs who have the worst vices of the worst rich—who are gamblers sots libertines knaves or else mere sensual simpletons and victims  they are the ugly crop that has sprung up while the stewards have been sleeping they are the multiplying brood begotten by parents who have been left without all teaching save that of a too craving body without all wellbeing save the fading delusions of drugged beer and gin  they are the hideous margin of society at one edge drawing toward it the undesigning ignorant poor at the other darkening imperceptibly into the lowest criminal class  here is one of the evils which cannot be got rid of quickly and against which any of us who have got sense decency and instruction have need to watch  that these degraded fellowmen could really get the mastery in a persistent disobedience to the laws and in a struggle to subvert order i do not believe but wretched calamities must come from the very beginning of such a struggle and the continuance of it would be a civil war in which the inspiration on both sides might soon cease to be even a false notion of good and might become the direct savage impulse of ferocity  we have all to see to it that we do not help to rouse what i may call the savage beast in the breasts of our generation—that we do not help to poison the nation’s blood and make richer provision for bestiality to come  we know well enough that oppressors have sinned in this way—that oppression has notoriously made men mad and we are determined to resist oppression but let us if possible show that we can keep sane in our resistance and shape our means more and more reasonably toward the least harmful and therefore the speediest attainment of our end  let us i say show that our spirits are too strong to be driven mad but can keep that sober determination which alone gives mastery over the adaptation of means and a first guarantee of this sanity will be to act as if we understood that the fundamental duty of a government is to preserve order to enforce obedience of the laws  it has been held hitherto that a man can be depended on as a guardian of order only when he has much money and comfort to lose  but a better state of things would be that men who had little money and not much comfort should still be guardians of order because they had sense to see that disorder would do no good and had a heart of justice pity and fortitude to keep them from making more misery only because they felt some misery themselves  there are thousands of artisans who have already shown this fine spirit and have endured much with patient heroism  if such a spirit spread and penetrated us all we should soon become the masters of the country in the best sense and to the best ends  for the public order being preserved there can be no government in future that will not be determined by our insistance on our fair and practicable demands  it is only by disorder that our demands will be choked that we shall find ourselves lost among a brutal rabble with all the intelligence of the country opposed to us and see government in the shape of guns that will sweep us down in the ignoble martyrdom of fools  it has been a too common notion that to insist much on the preservation of order is the part of a selfish aristocracy and a selfish commercial class because among these in the nature of things have been found the opponents of change  i am a radical and what is more i am not a radical with a title or a french cook or even an entrance into fine society  i expect great changes and i desire them  but i don’t expect them to come in a hurry by mere inconsiderate sweeping  a hercules with a big besom is a fine thing for a filthy stable but not for weeding a seedbed where his besom would soon make a barren floor  that is oldfashioned talk some one may say  we know all that  yes when things are put in an extreme way most people think they know them but after all they are comparatively few who see the small degrees by which those extremes are arrived at or have the resolution and selfcontrol to resist the little impulses by which they creep on surely toward a fatal end  does anybody set out meaning to ruin himself or to drink himself to death or to waste his life so that he becomes a despicable old man a superannuated nuisance like a fly in winter  yet there are plenty of whose lot this is the pitiable story  well now supposing us all to have the best intentions we working men as a body run some risk of bringing evil on the nation in that unconscious manner—half hurrying half pushed in a jostling march toward an end we are not thinking of  for just as there are many things which we know better and feel much more strongly than the richer softerhanded classes can know or feel them so there are many things—many precious benefits—which we by the very fact of our privations our lack of leisure and instruction are not so likely to be aware of and take into our account  those precious benefits form a chief part of what i may call the common estate of society a wealth over and above buildings machinery produce shipping and so on though closely connected with these a wealth of a more delicate kind that we may more unconsciously bring into danger doing harm and not knowing that we do it  i mean that treasure of knowledge science poetry refinement of thought feeling and manners great memories and the interpretation of great records which is carried on from the minds of one generation to the minds of another  this is something distinct from the indulgences of luxury and the pursuit of vain finery and one of the hardships in the lot of working men is that they have been for the most part shut out from sharing in this treasure  it can make a man’s life very great very full of delight though he has no smart furniture and no horses it also yields a great deal of discovery that corrects error and of invention that lessens bodily pain and must at least make life easier for all  now the security of this treasure demands not only the preservation of order but a certain patience on our part with many institutions and facts of various kinds especially touching the accumulation of wealth which from the light we stand in we are more likely to discern the evil than the good of  it is constantly the task of practical wisdom not to say “this is good and i will have it” but to say “this is the less of two unavoidable evils and i will bear it”  and this treasure of knowledge which consists in the fine activity the exalted vision of many minds is bound up at present with conditions which have much evil in them  just as in the case of material wealth and its distribution we are obliged to take the selfishness and weaknesses of human nature into account and however we insist that men might act better are forced unless we are fanatical simpletons to consider how they are likely to act so in this matter of the wealth that is carried in men’s minds we have to reflect that the too absolute predominance of a class whose wants have been of a common sort who are chiefly struggling to get better and more food clothing shelter and bodily recreation may lead to hasty measures for the sake of having things more fairly shared which even if they did not fail of their object would at last debase the life of the nation  do anything which will throw the classes who hold the treasures of knowledge—nay i may say the treasure of refined needs—into the background cause them to withdraw from public affairs stop too suddenly any of the sources by which their leisure and ease are furnished rob them of the chances by which they may be influential and preeminent and you do something as shortsighted as the acts of france and spain when in jealousy and wrath not altogether unprovoked they drove from among them races and classes that held the traditions of handicraft and agriculture you injure your own inheritance and the inheritance of your children you may truly say that this which i call the common estate of society has been anything but common to you but the same may be said by many of us of the sunlight and the air of the sky and the fields of parks and holiday games  nevertheless that these blessings exist makes life worthier to us and urges us the more to energetic likely means of getting our share in them and i say let us watch carefully lest we do anything to lessen this treasure which is held in the minds of men while we exert ourselves first of all and to the very utmost that we and our children may share in all its benefits  yes exert ourselves to the utmost to break the yoke of ignorance  if we demand more leisure more ease in our lives let us show that we don’t deserve the reproach of wanting to shirk that industry which in some form or other every man whether rich or poor should feel himself as much bound to as he is bound to decency  let us show that we want to have some time and strength left to us that we may use it not for brutal indulgence but for the rational exercise of the faculties which make us men  without this no political measures can benefit us  no political institution will alter the nature of ignorance or hinder it from producing vice and misery let ignorance start how it will it must run the same round of low appetites poverty slavery and superstition  some of us know this well—nay i will say feel it for knowledge of this kind cuts deep and to us it is one of the most painful facts belonging to our condition that there are numbers of our fellowworkmen who are so far from feeling in the same way that they never use the imperfect opportunities already offered them for giving their children some schooling but turn their little ones of tender age into breadwinners often at cruel tasks exposed to the horrible infection of childish vice  of course the causes of these hideous things go a long way back  parents’ misery has made parents’ wickedness  but we who are still blessed with the hearts of fathers and the consciences of men—we who have some knowledge of the curse entailed on broods of creatures in human shape whose enfeebled bodies and dull perverted minds are mere centres of uneasiness in whom even appetite is feeble and joy impossible—i say we are bound to use all the means at our command to help in putting a stop to this horror  here it seems to me is a way in which we may use extended cooperation among us to the most momentous of all purposes and make conditions of enrolment that would strengthen all educational measures  it is true enough that there is a low sense of parental duties in the nation at large and that numbers who have no excuse in bodily hardship seem to think it a light thing to beget children to bring human beings with all their tremendous possibilities into this difficult world and then take little heed how they are disciplined and furnished for the perilous journey they are sent on without any asking of their own  this is a sin shared in more or less by all classes but there are sins which like taxation fall the heaviest on the poorest and none have such galling reasons as we working men to try and rouse to the utmost the feeling of responsibility in fathers and mothers  we have been urged into cooperation by the pressure of common demands  in war men need each other more and where a given point has to be defended fighters inevitably find themselves shoulder to shoulder  so fellowship grows so grow the rules of fellowship which gradually shape themselves to thoroughness as the idea of a common good becomes more complete  we feel a right to say if you will be one of us you must make such and such a contribution—you must renounce such and such a separate advantage—you must set your face against such and such an infringement  if we have any false ideas about our common good our rules will be wrong and we shall be cooperating to damage each other  but now here is a part of our good without which everything else we strive for will be worthless—i mean the rescue of our children  let us demand from the members of our unions that they fulfil their duty as parents in this definite matter which rules can reach  let us demand that they send their children to school so as not to go on recklessly breeding a moral pestilence among us just as strictly as we demand that they pay their contributions to a common fund understood to be for a common benefit  while we watch our public men let us watch one another as to this duty which is also public and more momentous even than obedience to sanitary regulations while we resolutely declare against the wickedness in high places let us set ourselves also against the wickedness in low places not quarrelling which came first or which is the worse of the two—not trying to settle the miserable precedence of plague or famine but insisting unflinchingly on remedies once ascertained and summoning those who hold the treasure of knowledge to remember that they hold it in trust and that with them lies the task of searching for new remedies and finding the right methods of applying them  to find right remedies and right methods  here is the great function of knowledge here the life of one man may make a fresh era straight away in which a sort of suffering that has existed shall exist no more  for the thousands of years down to the middle of the sixteenth century that human limbs had been hacked and amputated nobody knew how to stop the bleeding except by searing the ends of the vessels with redhot iron but then came a man named ambrose paré and said “tie up the arteries” that was a fine word to utter  it contained the statement of a method—a plan by which a particular evil was forever assuaged  let us try to discern the men whose words carry that sort of kernel and choose such men to be our guides and representatives—not choose platform swaggerers who bring us nothing but the ocean to make our broth with  to get the chief power into the hands of the wisest which means to get our life regulated according to the truest principles mankind is in possession of is a problem as old as the very notion of wisdom  the solution comes slowly because men collectively can only be made to embrace principles and to act on them by the slow stupendous teaching of the world’s events  men will go on planting potatoes and nothing else but potatoes till a potato disease comes and forces them to find out the advantage of a varied crop  selfishness stupidity sloth persist in trying to adapt the world to their desires till a time comes when the world manifests itself as too decidedly inconvenient to them wisdom stands outside of man and urges itself upon him like the marks of the changing seasons before it finds a home within him directs his actions and from the precious effects of obedience begets a corresponding love  but while still outside of us wisdom often looks terrible and wears strange forms wrapped in the changing conditions of a struggling world it wears now the form of wants and just demands in a great multitude of british men wants and demands urged into existence by the forces of a maturing world  and it is in virtue of this—in virtue of this presence of wisdom on our aide as a mighty fact physical and moral which must enter into and shape the thoughts and actions of mankind—that we working men have obtained the suffrage  not because we are an excellent multitude but because we are a needy multitude  but now for our own part we have seriously to consider this outside wisdom which lies in the supreme unalterable nature of things and watch to give it a home within us and obey it  if the claims of the unendowed multitude of working men hold within them principles which must shape the future it is not less true that the endowed classes in their inheritance from the past hold the precious material without which no worthy noble future can be moulded  many of the highest uses of life are in their keeping and if privilege has often been abused it has also been the nurse of excellence  here again we have to submit ourselves to the great law of inheritance  if we quarrel with the way in which the labors and earnings of the past have been preserved and handed down we are just as bigoted just as narrow just as wanting in that religion which keeps an open ear and an obedient mind to the teachings of fact as we accuse those of being who quarrel with the new truths and new needs which are disclosed in the present  the deeper insight we get into the causes of human trouble and the ways by which men are made better and happier the less we shall be inclined to the unprofitable spirit and practice of reproaching classes as such in a wholesale fashion  not all the evils of our condition are such as we can justly blame others for and i repeat many of them are such as no changes of institutions can quickly remedy  to discern between the evils that energy can remove and the evils that patience must bear makes the difference between manliness and childishness between good sense and folly  and more than that without such discernment seeing that we have grave duties toward our own body and the country at large we can hardly escape acts of fatal rashness and injustice  i am addressing a mixed assembly of workmen and some of you may be as well or better fitted than i am to take up this office  but they will not think it amiss in me that i have tried to bring together the considerations most likely to be of service to us in preparing ourselves for the use of our new opportunities  i have avoided touching on special questions  the best help toward judging well on these is to approach them in the right temper without vain expectation and with a resolution which is mixed with temperance     footnotes   31  1  “madame de sablé  etudes sur les femmes illustres et la
