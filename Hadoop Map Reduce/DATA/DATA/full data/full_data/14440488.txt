doctrine of liberty     on compromise     chapter i   introductory  the design of the following essay is to consider in a short and direct way some of the limits that are set by sound reason to the practice of the various arts of accommodation economy management conformity or compromise the right of thinking freely and acting independently of using our minds without excessive awe of authority and shaping our lives without unquestioning obedience to custom is now a finally accepted principle in some sense or other with every school of thought that has the smallest chance of commanding the future under what circumstances does the exercise and vindication of the right thus conceded in theory become a positive duty in practice if the majority are bound to tolerate dissent from the ruling opinions and beliefs under what conditions and within what limitations is the dissentient imperatively bound to avail himself of this toleration how far and in what way ought respect either for immediate practical convenience or for current prejudices to weigh against respect for truth for how much is it well that the individual should allow the feelings and convictions of the many to count when he comes to shape to express and to act upon his own feelings and convictions are we only to be permitted to defend general principles on condition that we draw no practical inferences from them is every other idea to yield precedence and empire to existing circumstances and is the immediate and universal workableness of a policy to be the main test of its intrinsic fitness  to attempt to answer all these questions fully would be nothing less than to attempt a compendium of life and duty in all their details a summa of cases of conscience a guide to doubters at every point of the compass the aim of the present writer is a comparatively modest one namely to seek one or two of the most general principles which ought to regulate the practice of compliance and to suggest some of the bearings which they may have in their application to certain difficulties in modern matters of conduct  it is pretty plain that an inquiry of this kind needs to be fixed by reference to a given set of social circumstances tolerably well understood there are some common rules as to the expediency of compromise and conformity but their application is a matter of endless variety and the widest elasticity the interesting and useful thing is to find the relation of these too vague rules to actual conditions to transform them into practical guides and real interpreters of what is right and best in thought and conduct in a special and definite kind of emergency according to the current assumptions of the writer and the preacher the one commanding law is that men should cling to truth and right if the very heavens fall in principle this is universally accepted to the partisans of authority and tradition it is as much a commonplace as to the partisans of the most absolute and unflinching rationalism yet in practice all schools alike are forced to admit the necessity of a measure of accommodation in the very interests of truth itself fanatic is a name of such ill repute exactly because one who deserves to be called by it injures good causes by refusing timely and harmless concession by irritating prejudices that a wiser way of urging his own opinion might have turned aside by making no allowances respecting no motives and recognising none of those qualifying principles which are nothing less than necessary to make his own principle true and fitting in a given society the interesting question in connection with compromise obviously turns upon the placing of the boundary that divides wise suspense in forming opinions wise reserve in expressing them and wise tardiness in trying to realise them from unavowed disingenuousness and selfillusion from voluntary dissimulation and from indolence and pusillanimity these are the three departments or provinces of compromise our subject is a question of boundaries1 and this question being mainly one of time and circumstance may be most satisfactorily discussed in relation to the time and the circumstances which we know best or at least whose deficiencies and requirements are most pressingly visible to us  though england counts her full share of fearless truthseekers in most departments of inquiry yet there is on the whole no weakening but a rather marked confirmation of what has become an inveterate national characteristic and has long been recognised as such a profound distrust namely of all general principles a profound dislike both of much reference to them and of any disposition to invest them with practical authority and a silent but most pertinacious measurement of philosophic truths by political tests it is not at all easy humanly speaking says one who has tried the experiment to wind an englishman up to the level of dogma the difficulty has extended further than the dogma of theology the supposed antagonism between expediency and principle has been pressed further and further away from the little piece of true meaning that it ever could be rightly allowed to have until it has now come to signify the paramount wisdom of counting the narrow immediate and personal expediency for everything and the whole general ultimate and completed expediency for nothing principle is only another name for a proposition stating the terms of one of these larger expediencies when principle is held in contempt or banished to the far dreamland of the philosopher and the student with an affectation of reverence that in a materialist generation is in truth the most overweening kind of contempt this only means that men are thinking much of the interests of today and little of the more ample interests of the many days to come it means that the conditions of the time are unfriendly to the penetration and the breadth of vision which disclose to us the whole range of consequences that follow on certain kinds of action or opinion and unfriendly to the intrepidity and disinterestedness which make us willing to sacrifice our own present ease or near convenience in the hope of securing higher advantages for others or for ourselves in the future  let us take politics for example what is the state of the case with us if we look at national life in its broadest aspect a german has his dream of a great fatherland which shall not only be one and consolidated but shall in due season win freedom for itself and be as a sacred hearth whence others may borrow the warmth of freedom and order for themselves a spaniard has his vision either of militant loyalty to god and the saints and the exiled line of his kings or else of devotion to the newly won liberty and to the raising up of his fallen nation an american in the midst of the political corruption which for the moment obscures the great democratic experiment yet has his imagination kindled by the size and resources of his land and his enthusiasm fired by the high destinies which he believes to await its people in the centuries to come a frenchman republican or royalist with all his frenzies and foolfury of red or white still has his hope and dream and aspiration with which to enlarge his life and lift him on an ample pinion out from the circle of a poor egoism what stirs the hope and moves the aspiration of our englishman surely nothing either in the heavens above or on the earth beneath the english are as a people little susceptible in the region of the imagination but they have done good work in the world acquired a splendid historic tradition of stout combat for good causes founded a mighty and beneficent empire and they have done all this notwithstanding their deficiencies of imagination their lands have been the home of great and forlorn causes though they could not always follow the transcendental flights of their foreign allies and champions if englishmen were not strong in imagination they were what is better and surer strong in their hold of the great emancipating principles what great political cause her own or anothers is england befriending today to say that no great cause is left is to tell us that we have reached the final stage of human progress and turned over the last leaf in the volume of human improvements the day when this is said and believed marks the end of a nations life is it possible that after all our old protestant spirit with its rationality its austerity its steady political energy has been struck with something of the mortal fatigue that seizes catholic societies after their fits of revolution  we need not forget either the atrocities or the imbecilities which mark the course of modern politics on the continent i am as keenly alive as any one to the levity of france and the greek hubris of germany it may be true that the ordinary frenchman is in some respects the victim of as poor an egoism as that of the ordinary englishman and that the american has no advantage over us in certain kinds of magnanimous sentiment what is important is the mind and attitude not of the ordinary man but of those who should be extraordinary the decisive sign of the elevation of a nations life is to be sought among those who lead or ought to lead the test of the health of a people is to be found in the utterances of those who are its spokesmen and in the action of those whom it accepts or chooses to be its chiefs we have to look to the magnitude of the issues and the height of the interests which engage its foremost spirits what are the best men in a country striving for and is the struggle pursued intrepidly and with a sense of its size and amplitude or with creeping foot and blinking eye the answer to these questions is the answer to the other question whether the best men in the country are small or great it is a commonplace that the manner of doing things is often as important as the things done and it has been pointed out more than once that englands most creditable national action constantly shows itself so poor and mean in expression that the rest of europe can discern nothing in it but craft and sinister interest our public opinion is often rich in wisdom but we lack the courage of our wisdom we execute noble achievements and then are best pleased to find shabby reasons for them  there is a certain quality attaching alike to thought and expression and action for which we may borrow the name of grandeur it has been noticed for instance that bacon strikes and impresses us not merely by the substantial merit of what he achieved but still more by a certain greatness of scheme and conception this quality is not a mere idle decoration it is not a theatrical artifice of mask or buskin to impose upon us unreal impressions of height and dignity the added greatness is real height of aim and nobility of expression are true forces they grow to be an obligation upon us a lofty sense of personal worth is one of the surest elements of greatness that the lion should love to masquerade in the asss skin is not modesty and reserve but imbecility and degradation and that england should wrap herself in the robe of small causes and mean reasons is the more deplorable because there is no nation in the world the substantial elements of whose power are so majestic and imperial as our own our language is the most widely spoken of all tongues its literature is second to none in variety and power our people whether english or american have long ago superseded the barbarous device of dictator and caesar by the manly arts of selfgovernment we understand that peace and industry are the two most indispensable conditions of modern civilisation and we draw the lines of our policy in accordance with such a conviction we have had imposed upon us by the unlucky prowess of our ancestors the task of ruling a vast number of millions of alien dependents we undertake it with a disinterestedness and execute it with a skill of administration to which history supplies no parallel and which even if time should show that the conditions of the problem were insoluble will still remain for ever admirable all these are elements of true preeminence they are calculated to inspire us with the loftiest consciousness of national life they ought to clothe our voice with authority to nerve our action by generous resolution and to fill our counsels with weightiness and power  within the last forty years england has lost one by one each of those enthusiasms which may have been illusionssome of them undoubtedly were sobut which at least testified to the existence among us in a very considerable degree of a vivid belief in the possibility of certain broad general theories being true and right as well as in the obligation of making them lights to practical conduct and desire people a generation ago had eager sympathy with hungary with italy with poland because they were deeply impressed by the doctrine of nationalities they had again a generous and energetic hatred of such an institution as the negro slavery of america because justice and humanity and religion were too real and potent forces within their breasts to allow them to listen to those political considerations by which american statesmen used to justify temporising and compromise they had strong feelings about parliamentary reform because they were penetrated by the principle that the possession of political power by the bulk of a society is the only effective security against sinister government or else by the principle that participation in public activity even in the modest form of an exercise of the elective franchise is an elevating and instructing agency or perhaps by the principle that justice demands that those who are compelled to obey laws and pay national taxes should have a voice in making the one and imposing the other  it may be said that the very fate of these aspirations has had a blighting effect on public enthusiasm and the capacity of feeling it not only have most of them now been fulfilled and so passed from aspiration to actuality but the results of their fulfilment have been so disappointing as to make us wonder whether it is really worth while to pray when to have our prayers granted carries the world so very slight a way forward the austrian is no longer in italy the pope has ceased to be master in rome the patriots of hungary are now in possession of their rights and have become friends of their old oppressors the negro slave has been transformed into an american citizen at home again the gods have listened to our vows parliament has been reformed and the longdesired mechanical security provided for the voters freedom we no longer aspire after all these things you may say because our hopes have been realised and our dreams have come true it is possible that the comparatively prosaic results before our eyes at the end of all have thrown a chill over our political imagination what seemed so glorious when it was far off seems perhaps a little poor now that it is near and this has damped the wing of political fancy the old aspirations have vanished and no new ones have arisen in their place be the cause what it may i should express the change in this way that the existing order of facts whatever it may be now takes a hardly disputed precedence with us over ideas and that the coarsest political standard is undoubtingly and finally applied over the whole realm of human thought  the line taken up by the press and the governing classes of england during the american civil war may serve to illustrate the kind of mood which we conceive to be gaining firmer hold than ever of the national mind those who sympathised with the southern states listened only to political arguments and very narrow and inefficient political arguments as it happened when they ought to have seen that here was an issue which involved not only political ideas but moral and religious ideas as well that is to say the ordinary political tests were not enough to reveal the entire significance of the crisis nor were the political standards proper for measuring the whole of the expediencies hanging in the balance the conflict could not be adequately gauged by such questions as whether the slave states had or had not a constitutional right to establish an independent government whether the free states were animated by philanthropy or by love of empire whether it was to the political advantage of england that the american union should be divided and consequently weakened such questions were not necessarily improper in themselves and we can imagine circumstances in which they might be not only proper but decisive but the circumstances being what they were the narrower expediencies of ordinary politics were outweighed by one of those supreme and indefeasible expediencies which are classified as moral these are in other words the higher wider more binding and transcendent part of the master art of social wellbeing  here was only one illustration of the growing tendency to substitute the narrowest political point of view for all the other ways of regarding the course of human affairs and to raise the limitations which practical exigencies may happen to set to the application of general principles into the very place of the principles themselves nor is the process of deteriorating conviction confined to the greater or noisier transactions of nations it is impossible that it should be so that process is due to causes which affect the mental temper an a whole and pour round us an atmosphere that enervates our judgment from end to end not more in politics than in morality and not more in morality than in philosophy in art and in religion perhaps this tendency never showed itself more offensively than when the most important newspaper in the country criticised our great naturalists scientific speculations as to the descent of man from the point of view of property intelligence and a stake in the country and severely censured him for revealing his particular zoological conclusions to the general public at a moment when the sky of paris was red with the incendiary flames of the commune it would be hard to reduce the transformation of all truth into a subordinate department of daily politics to a more gross and unseemly absurdity  the consequences of such a transformation of putting immediate social convenience in the first place and respect for truth in the second are seen as we have said in a distinct and unmistakable lowering of the level of national life a slack and lethargic quality about public opinion a growing predominance of material temporary and selfish aims over those which are generous farreaching and spiritual a deadly weakening of intellectual conclusiveness and clearshining moral illumination and lastly of a certain stoutness of selfrespect for which england was once especially famous a plain categorical proposition is becoming less and less credible to average minds or at least the slovenly willingness to hold two directly contradictory propositions at one and the same time is becoming more and more common in religion morals and politics the suppression of your true opinion if not the positive profession of what you hold to be a false opinion is hardly ever counted a vice and not seldom even goes for virtue and solid wisdom one is conjured to respect the beliefs of others but forbidden to claim the same respect for ones own  this dread of the categorical proposition might be creditable if it sprang from attachment to a very high standard of evidence or from a deep sense of the relative and provisional quality of truth there might even be a plausible defence set up for it if it sprang from that formulated distrust of the energetic rational judgment in comparison with the emotional affective contemplative parts of man which underlies the various forms of religious mysticism if you look closely into our present mood it is seen to be the product mainly and above all of a shrinking deference to the status quo not merely as having a claim not to be lightly dealt with which every serious man concedes but as being the last word and final test of truth and justice physical science is allowed to be the sphere of accurate reasoning and distinct conclusions but in morals and politics instead of admitting that these subjects have equally a logic of their own we silently suspect all first principles and practically deny the strict inferences from demonstrated premisses faith in the soundness of given general theories of right and wrong melts away before the first momentary triumph of wrong or the first passing discouragement in enforcing right  our robust political sense which has discovered so many of the secrets of good government which has given us freedom with order and popular administration without corruption and unalterable respect for law along with indelible respect for individual right this which has so long been our strong point is fast becoming our weakness and undoing for the extension of the ways of thinking which are proper in politics to other than political matter means at the same time the depravation of the political sense itself not only is social expediency effacing the many other points of view that men ought to take of the various facts of life and thought the idea of social expediency itself is becoming a dwarfed and pinched idea ours is the country where love of constant improvement ought to be greater than anywhere else because fear of revolution is less yet the art of politics is growing to be as meanly conceived as all the rest at elections the national candidate has not often a chance against the local candidate nor the man of a principle against the man of a class in parliament we are admonished on high authority that the policy of a party is not the carrying out of the opinion of any section of it but the general consensus of the whole which seems to be a hierophantic manner of saying that the policy of a party is one thing and the principle which makes it a party is another thing and that men who care very strongly about anything are to surrender that and the hope of it for the sake of succeeding in something about which they care very little or not at all this is our modern way of giving politicians heart for their voyage of inspiring them with resoluteness and selfrespect with confidence in the worth of their cause and enthusiasm for its success thoroughness is a mistake and nailing your flag to the mast a bit of delusive heroics think wholly of today and not at all of tomorrow beware of the high and hold fast to the safe dismiss conviction and study general consensus no zeal no faith no intellectual trenchancy but as much lowminded geniality and trivial complaisance as you please  of course all these characteristics of our own society mark tendencies that are common enough in all societies they often spring from an indolence and enervation that besets a certain number of people however invigorating the general mental climate may be what we are now saying is that the general mental climate itself has outside of the domain of physical science ceased to be invigorating that on the contrary it fosters the more inglorious predispositions of men and encourages a native willingness already so strong to acquiesce in a lazy accommodation with error an ignoble economy of truth and a vicious compromise of the permanent gains of adhering to a sound general principle for the sake of the temporary gains of departing from it   without attempting an elaborate analysis of the causes that have brought about this debilitation of mental tone we may shortly remind ourselves of one or two facts in the political history in the intellectual history and in the religious history of this generation which perhaps help us to understand a phenomenon that we have all so keen an interest both in understanding and in modifying  to begin with what lies nearest to the surface the most obvious agency at work in the present exaggeration of the political standard as the universal test of truth is to be found in some contemporary incidents the influence of france upon england since the revolution of 1848 has tended wholly to the discredit of abstract theory and general reasoning among us in all that relates to politics morals and religion in 1848 not in 1789 questions affecting the fundamental structure and organic condition of the social union came for the first time into formidable prominence for the first time those questions and the answers to them were stated in articulate formulas and distinct theories they were not merely written in books they so fascinated the imagination and inflamed the hopes of the time that thousands of men were willing actually to go down into the streets and to shed their blood for the realisation of their generous dream of a renovated society the same sight has been seen since and even when we do not see it we are perfectly aware that the same temper is smouldering those were premature attempts to convert a crude aspiration into a political reality and to found a new social order on a number of umcompromising deductions from abstract principles of the common weal they have had the natural effect of deepening the english dislike of a general theory even when such a theory did no more than profess to announce a remote object of desire and not the present goal of immediate effort  it is not only the socialists who are responsible for the low esteem into which a spirit of political generalisation has fallen in other countries in consequence of french experience mr mill has described in a wellknown passage the characteristic vice of the leaders of all french parties and not of the democratic party more than any other the commonplaces of politics in france he says are large and sweeping practical maxims from which as ultimate premisses men reason downwards to particular applications and this they call being logical and consistent for instance they are perpetually arguing that such and such a measure ought to be adopted because it is a consequence of the principle on which the form of government is founded of the principle of legitimacy or the principle of the sovereignty of the people to which it may be answered that if these be really practical principles they must rest on speculative grounds the sovereignty of the people for example must be a right foundation for government because a government thus constituted tends to produce certain beneficial effects inasmuch however as no government produces all possible beneficial effects but all are attended with more or fewer inconveniences and since these cannot be combated by means drawn from the very causes which produce them it would often be a much stronger recommendation of some practical arrangement that it does not follow from what is called the general principle of the government than that it does2  the english feeling for compromise is on its better side the result of a shrewd and practical though informal recognition of a truth which the writer has here expressed in terms of method the disregard which the political action of france has repeatedly betrayed of a principle really so important has hitherto strengthened our own regard for it until it has not only made us look on its importance as exclusive and final but has extended our respect for the right kind of compromise to wrong and injurious kinds  a minor event which now looks much less important than it did not many years ago but which still had real influence in deteriorating moral judgment was the career of a late sovereign of france some apparent advantages followed for a season from a rule which had its origin in a violent and perfidious usurpation and which was upheld by all the arts of moral corruption political enervation and military repression the advantages lasted long enough to create in this country a steady and powerful opinion that napoleon the thirds early crime was redeemed by the seeming prosperity which followed the shocking prematureness of this shallow condonation is now too glaringly visible for any one to deny it not often in history has the great truth that morality is the nature of things received corroboration so prompt and timely we need not commit ourselves to the optimistic or sentimental hypothesis that wickedness always fares ill in the world or on the other hand that whoso hearkens diligently to the divine voice and observes all the commandments to do them shall be blessed in his basket and his store and all the work of his hand the claims of morality to our allegiance so far as its precepts are solidly established rest on the same positive base as our faith in the truth of physical laws moral principles when they are true are at bottom only registered generalisations from experience they record certain uniformities of antecedence and consequence in the region of human conduct want of faith in the persistency of these uniformities is only a little less fatuous in the moral order than a corresponding want of faith would instantly disclose itself to be in the purely physical order in both orders alike there is only too much of this kind of fatuousness this readiness to believe that for once in our favour the stream shall flow up hill that we may live in miasmatic air unpoisoned that a government may depress the energy the selfreliance the public spirit of its citizens and yet be able to count on these qualities whenever the government itself may have broken down and left the country to make the best of such resources as are left after so severe and prolonged a drain this is the sense in which morality is the nature of things the system of the second empire was in the same sense an immoral system unless all the lessons of human experience were futile and all the principles of political morality mere articles of pedantry such a system must inevitably bring disaster as we might have seen that it was sowing the seeds of disaster yet because the catastrophe lingered opinion in england began to admit the possibility of evil being for this once good and to treat any reference to the moral and political principles which condemned the imperial system and all systems like it beyond hope or appeal as simply the pretext of a mutinous or utopian impatience  this however is only one of the more superficial influences which have helped and fallen in with the working of profounder causes of weakened aspiration and impoverished moral energy and of the substitution of latitudinarian acquiescence and faltering conviction for the wholehearted assurance of better times of these deeper causes the most important in the intellectual development of the prevailing forms of thought and sentiment is the growth of the historic method let us consider very shortly how the abuse of this method and an unauthorised extension and interpretation of its conclusions are likely to have had something to do with the enervation of opinion  the historic method may be described as the comparison of the forms of an idea or a usage or a belief at any given time with the earlier forms from which they were evolved or the later forms into which they were developed and the establishment from such a comparison of an ascending and descending order among the facts it consists in the explanation of existing parts in the frame of society by connecting them with corresponding parts in some earlier frame in the identification of present forms in the past and past forms in the present its main process is the detection of corresponding customs opinions laws beliefs among different communities and a grouping of them into general classes with reference to some one common feature it is a certain way of seeking answers to various questions of origin resting on the same general doctrine of evolution applied to moral and social forms as that which is being applied with so much ingenuity to the series of organic matter the historic conception is a reference of every state of society to a particular stage in the evolution of its general conditions ideas of law of virtue of religion of the physical universe of history of the social union itself all march in a harmonious and interdependent order  curiosity with reference to origins is for various reasons the most marked element among modern scientific tendencies it covers the whole field moral intellectual and physical from the smile or the frown on a mans face up to the most complex of the ideas in his mind from the expression of his emotions to their root and relations with one another in his inmost organisation as an ingenious writer too soon lost to our political literature has put itif we wanted to describe one of the most marked results perhaps the most marked result of late thought we should say that by it everything is made an antiquity when in former times our ancestors thought of an antiquarian they described him as occupied with coins and medals and druids stones but now there are other relics indeed all matter is become such man himself has to the eye of science become an antiquity she tries to read is beginning to read knows she ought to read in the frame of each man the result of a whole history of all his life and what he is and what makes him so3 character is considered less with reference to its absolute qualities than as an interesting scene strewn with scattered rudiments survivals inherited predispositions opinions are counted rather as phenomena to be explained than as matters of truth and falsehood of usages we are beginning first of all to think where they came from and secondarily whether they are the most fitting and convenient that men could be got to accept in the last century men asked of a belief or a story is it true we now ask how did men come to take it for true in short the relations among social phenomena which now engage most attention are relations of original source rather than those of actual consistency in theory and actual fitness in practice the devotees of the current method are more concerned with the pedigree and genealogical connections of a custom or an idea than with its own proper goodness or badness its strength or its weakness  though there is no necessary or truly logical association between systematic use of this method rightly limited and a slack and slipshod preference of vague general forms over definite ideas yet every one can see its tendency if uncorrected to make men shrink from importing anything like absolute quality into their propositions we can see also what is still worse its tendency to place individual robustness and initiative in the light of superfluities with which a world that goes by evolution can very well dispense men easily come to consider clearness and positiveness in their opinions staunchness in holding and defending them and fervour in carrying them into action as equivocal virtues of very doubtful perfection in a state of things where every abuse has after all had a defensible origin where every error has we must confess once been true relatively to other parts of belief in those who held the error and where all parts of life are so bound up with one another that it is of no avail to attack one evil unless you attack many more at the same time this is a caricature of the real teaching of the historic method of which we shall have to speak presently but it is one of those caricatures which the natural sloth in such matters and the indigenous intellectual haziness of the majority of men make them very willing to take for the true philosophy of things   then there is the newspaper press that huge engine for keeping discussion on a low level and making the political test final to take off the taxes on knowledge was to place a heavy tax on broad and independent opinion the multiplication of journals delivering brawling judgments unashamed on all things all day long has done much to deaden the small stock of individuality in public verdicts it has done much to make vulgar ways of looking at things and vulgar ways of speaking of them stronger and stronger by formulating and repeating and stereotyping them incessantly from morning until afternoon and from years end to years end for a newspaper must live and to live it must please and its conductors suppose perhaps not altogether rightly that it can only please by being very cheerful towards prejudices very chilly to general theories loftily disdainful to the men of a principle their one cry to an advocate of improvement is some sagacious silliness about recognising the limits of the practicable in politics and seeing the necessity of adapting theories to facts as if the fact of taking a broader and wiser view than the common crowd disqualifies a man from knowing what the view of the common crowd happens to be and from estimating it at the proper value for practical purposes why are the men who despair of improvement to be the only persons endowed with the gift of discerning the practicable it is however only too easy to understand how a journal existing for a day should limit its view to the possibilities of the day and how being most closely affected by the particular it should coldly turn its back upon all that is general and it is easy too to understand the reaction of this intellectual timorousness upon the minds of ordinary readers who have too little natural force and too little cultivation to be able to resist the narrowing and deadly effect of the daily iteration of shortsighted commonplaces   far the most penetrating of all the influences that are impairing the moral and intellectual nerve of our generation remain still to be mentioned the first of these is the immense increase of material prosperity and the second is the immense decline in sincerity of spiritual interest the evil wrought by the one fills up the measure of the evil wrought by the other we have been in spite of momentary declensions on a flood tide of high profits and a roaring trade and there is nothing like a roaring trade for engendering latitudinarians the effect of many possessions especially if they be newly acquired in slackening moral vigour is a proverb our new wealth is hardly leavened by any tradition of public duty such as lingers among the english nobles nor as yet by any common custom of devotion to public causes such as seems to live and grow in the united states under such conditions with new wealth come luxury and love of ease and that fatal readiness to believe that god has placed us in the best of possible worlds which so lowers mens aims and unstrings their firmness of purpose pleasure saps high interests and the weakening of high interests leaves more undisputed room for pleasure management and compromise appear among the permitted arts because they tend to comfort and comfort is the end of ends comprehending all ends not truth is the standard but the politic and the reputable are we to suppose that it is firm persuasion of the greater scripturalness of episcopacy that turns the second generation of dissenting manufacturers in our busy lancashire into churchmen certainly such conversions do no violence to the conscience of the proselyte for he is intellectually indifferent a spiritual neuter  that brings us to the root of the matter the serious side of a revolution that in this social consequence is so unspeakably ignoble this root of the matter is the slow transformation now at work of the whole spiritual basis of thought every age is in some sort an age of transition but our own is characteristically and cardinally an epoch of transition in the very foundations of belief and conduct the old hopes have grown pale the old fears dim strong sanctions are become weak and once vivid faiths very numb religion whatever destinies may be in store for it is at least for the present hardly any longer an organic power it is not that supreme penetrating controlling decisive part of a mans life which it has been and will be again the work of destruction is all the more perturbing to timorous spirits and more harassing even to doughtier spirits for being done impalpably indirectly almost silently and as if by unseen hands those who dwell in the tower of ancient faiths look about them in constant apprehension misgiving and wonder with the hurried uneasy mien of people living amid earthquakes the air seems to their alarms to be full of missiles and all is doubt hesitation and shivering expectancy hence a decisive reluctance to commit ones self conscience has lost its strong and onpressing energy and the sense of personal responsibility lacks sharpness of edge the native hue of spiritual resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of distracted wavering confused thought the souls of men have become void into the void have entered in triumph the seven devils of secularity  and all this hesitancy this tampering with conviction for fear of its consequences this want of faithful dealing in the highest matters is being intensified aggravated driven inwards like a fatal disorder toward the vital parts by the existence of a state church while thought stirs and knowledge extends she remains fast moored by ancient formularies while the spirit of man expands in search after new light and feels energetically for new truth the spirit of the church is eternally entombed within the four corners of acts of parliament her ministers vow almost before they have crossed the threshold of manhood that they will search no more they virtually swear that they will to the end of their days believe what they believe then before they have had time either to think or to know the thoughts of others they take oath in other words to lead mutilated lives if they cannot keep this solemn promise they have at least every inducement that ordinary human motives can supply to conceal their breach of it the same system which begins by making mental indolence a virtue and intellectual narrowness a part of sanctity ends by putting a premium on something too like hypocrisy consider the seriousness of fastening up in these bonds some thousands of the most instructed and intelligent classes in the country the very men who would otherwise be best fitted from position and opportunities for aiding a little in the long difficult and plainly inevitable work of transforming opinion consider the waste of intelligence and what is assuredly not less grave the positive deadweight and thick obstruction by which an official hierarchy so organised must paralyse mental independence in a community  we know the kind of man whom this system delights to honour he was described for us five and thirty years ago by a master hand mistiness is the mother of wisdom a man who can set down half a dozen general propositions which escape from destroying one another only by being diluted into truisms who can hold the balance between opposites so skilfully as to do without fulcrum or beam who never enunciates a truth without guarding himself against being supposed to exclude the contradictorywho holds that scripture is the only authority yet that the church is to be deferred to that faith only justifies yet that it does not justify without works that grace does not depend upon the sacraments yet is not given without them that bishops are a divine ordinance yet that those who have them not are in the same religious condition as those who havethis is your safe man and the hope of the church this is what the church is said to want not party men but sensible temperate sober welljudging persons to guide it through the channel of no meaning between the scylla and charybdis of aye and no4 the writer then thought that such a type could not endure and that the church must become more real on the contrary her reality is more phantomlike now than it was then she is the sovereign pattern and exemplar of management of the triumph of the political method in spiritual things and of the subordination of ideas to the status quo  it is true that all other organised priesthoods are also bodies which move within formularies even more inelastic than those of the establishment but then they have not the same immense social power nor the same temptations to make all sacrifices to preserve it they affect the intellectual temper of large numbers of people but the people whom they affect are not so strongly identified with the greater organs of the national life the state church is bound up in the minds of the most powerful classes with a given ordering of social arrangements and the consequence of this is that the teachers of the church have reflected back upon thorn a sense of responsibility for these arrangements which obscures their spirituality clogs their intellectual energy and mental openness and turns them into a political army of obstruction to new ideas they feel themselves to a certain extent discharged from the necessity of recognising the tremendous conflict in the region of belief that goes on around them just as if they were purely civil administrators concerned only with the maintenance of the present order none of this is true of the private churches their teachers and members regard belief as something wholly independent of the civil ordering of things however little enlightened in some respects however hostile to certain of the ideas by which it is sought to replace their own they are at least representatives of the momentous principle of our individual responsibility for the truth of our opinions they may bring their judgments to conclusions that are less in accord with modern tendencies than those of one or two schools that still see their way to subscribing anglican articles and administering anglican rites at any rate they admit that the use of his judgment is a duty incumbent on the individual and a duty to be discharged without reference to any external considerations whatever political or otherwise this is an elevating an exhilarating principle however deficiencies of culture may have narrowed the sphere of its operations it is because a state church is by its very conception hostile to such a principle that we are justified in counting it apart from the private churches with all their faults and placing it among the agencies that weaken the vigour of a national conscience and check the free play and access of intellectual light  here we may leave the conditions that have made an inquiry as to some of the limits of compromise which must always be an interesting and important subject one of especial interest and importance to ourselves at present is any renovation of the sacredness of principle a possible remedy for some of these elements of national deterioration they will not disappear until the world has grown into possession of a new doctrine when that comes all other good things will follow what we have to remember is that the new doctrine itself will never come except to spirits predisposed to their own liberation our day of small calculations and petty utilities must first pass away our vision of the true expediencies must reach further and deeper our resolution to search for the highest verities to give up all and follow them must first become the supreme part of ourselves

utility of error    das wahre fördert aus dem irrthum entwickelt         sich nichts er verwickeltuns nur         goethe  at the outset of an inquiry how far existing facts ought to be allowed to overrule ideas and principles that are at variance with them a preliminary question lies in our way about which it may be well to say something this is the question of a dual doctrine in plainer words the question whether it is expedient that the more enlightened classes in a community should upon system not only possess their light in silence but whether they should openly encourage a doctrine for the less enlightened classes which they do not believe to be true for themselves while they regard it as indispensably useful in the case of less fortunate people an eminent teacher tells us how after he had once succeeded in presenting the principle of necessity to his own mind in a shape which seemed to bring with it all the advantages of the principle of free will he no longer suffered under the burden so heavy to one who aims at being a reformer in opinions of thinking one doctrine true and the contrary doctrine morally beneficial5 the discrepancy which this writer thought a heavy burden has struck others as the basis of a satisfactory solution        nil dulcius est bene quam munita tenere   edita doctrina sapientum templa serena   despicere unde queas alios passimque videre   errare atque viam palantes quaerere vitae  the learned are to hold the true doctrine the unlearned are to be taught its morally beneficial contrary let the church it has been said admit two descriptions of believers those who are for the letter and those who hold by the spirit at a certain point in rational culture belief in the supernatural becomes for many an impossibility do not force such persons to wear a cowl of lead do not you meddle with what we teach or write and then we will not dispute the common people with you do not contest our place in the school and the academy and then we will surrender to your hands the country school6 this is only a very courageous and definite way of saying what a great many less accomplished persons than m renan have silently in their hearts and in england quite as extensively as in france they do not believe in hell for instance but they think hell a useful fiction for the lower classes they would deeply regret any change in the spirit or the machinery of public instruction which would release the lower classes from so wholesome an error and as with hell so with other articles of the supernatural system the existence of a being who will distribute rewards and penalties in a future state the permanent sentience of each human personality the vigilant supervision of our conduct as well as our inmost thoughts and desires by the heavenly powers and so forth  let us discuss this matter impersonally without reference to our own opinions and without reference to the evidence for or against their truth i am not speaking now of those who hold all these ideas to be certainly true or highly probable and who at the same time incidentally insist on the great usefulness of such ideas in confirming morality and producing virtuous types of character with such persons of course there is no question of a dual doctrine they entertain certain convictions themselves and naturally desire to have their influence extended over others the proposition which we have to consider is of another kind it expresses the notions of those whoto take the most important kind of illustrationthink untrue the popular ideas of supernatural interference in our obscure human affairs who think untrue the notion of the prolongation of our existence after death to fulfil the purpose of the supernatural powers or at least who think them so extremely improbable that no reasonable man or woman once awakened to a conviction of this improbability would thenceforth be capable of receiving effective check or guidance from beliefs that would have sunk slowly down to the level of doubtful guesses we have now to deal with those who while taking this view of certain doctrines still declare them to be indispensable for restraining from antisocial conduct all who are not acute or instructed enough to see through them in other words they think error useful and that it may be the best thing for society that masses of men should cheat and deceive themselves in their most fervent aspirations and their deepest assurances this is the furthest extreme to which the empire of existing facts over principles can well be imagined to go it lies at the root of every discussion upon the limits which separate lawful compromise or accommodation from palpable hypocrisy  it will probably be said that according to the theory of the school of which m renan is the most eloquent representative the common people are not really cheating themselves or being cheated indeed m renan himself has expatiated on the charm of seeing figures of the ideal in the cottages of the poor images representing no reality and so forth what a delight he cries for the man who is borne down by six days of toil to come on the seventh to rest upon his knees to contemplate the tall columns a vault arches an altar to listen to the chanting to hear moral and consoling words7 the dogmas which criticism attacks are not for these poor people the object of an explicit affirmation and therefore there is no harm in them it is the privilege of pure sentiment to be invulnerable and to play with poison without being hurt by it in other words the dogmas are false but the liturgy as a performance stirring the senses of awe reverence susceptibility to beauty of various kinds appeals to and satisfies a sentiment that is both true and indispensable in the human mind more than this in the two or three supreme moments of life to which men look forward and on which they look backat birth at the passing of the threshold into fulness of life at marriage at deaththe church is present to invest the hour with a certain solemn and dignified charm that is the way in which the instructed are to look at the services of a church after they have themselves ceased to believe its faith us a true account of various matters which it professes to account for truly  it will be perceived that this is not exactly the ground of those who think a number of what they confess to be untruths wholesome for the common people for reasons of police and who would maintain churches on the same principle on which they maintain the county constabulary it is a psychological not a political ground it is on the whole a more true as well as a far more exalted position the human soul they say has these lovely and elevating aspirations not to satisfy them is to leave man a dwarfed creature why quarrel with a system that leaves you to satisfy them in the true way and does much to satisfy thorn in a false but not very harmful way among those who unfortunately have to sit in the darkness of the outer court  this is not a proper occasion for saying anything about the adequateness of the catholic or any other special manner of fostering and solacing the religious impulses of men we have to assume that the instructed class believe the catholic dogmas to be untrue and yet wishes the uninstructed to be handed over to a system that reposes on the theory that these dogmas are superlatively true what then is to be said of the tenableness of such a position to the plain man it looks like a deliberate connivance at a plan for the propagation of errorassuming as i say for the moment that these articles of belief are erroneous and contrary to fact and evidence ah but we are told the people make no explicit affirmation of dogma that does nothing for them they are indifferent to it a great variety of things might be said to this statement we might ask for instance whether the people ever made an explicit affirmation of dogma in the past or whether it was always the hazy indifferent matter which it is supposed to be now if so whether we shall not have to recast our most fundamental notions of the way in which christian civilisation has been evolved if not and if people did once explicitly affirm dogma when exactly was it that they ceased to do so  the answers to these questions would all go to show that at the time when religion was the great controlling and organising force in conduct the prime elemental dogmas were accepted with the most vivid conviction of reality i do not pretend that the common people followed all the inferences which the intellectual subtlety of the masterspirits of theology drew so industriously from the simple premisses of scripture and tradition but assuredly dogma was at the foundation of the whole structure when did it cease to be so how was the structure supported after you had altered this condition of things  apart from this historic issue the main question one would like to put to the upholder of duality of religion on this plea is the simple one whether the power of the ceremonial which charms him so much is not actually at this moment drawn wholly from dogma and the tradition of dogma whether its truth is not explicitly affirmed to the unlettered man and whether the inseparable connection between the dogma and the ceremonial is not constantly impressed upon him by the spiritual teachers to whom the dual system hands him and his order over for all time if any one of those philosophic critics will take the trouble to listen to a few courses of sermons at the present day and the remark applies not less to protestant than to catholic churches he will find that instead of that parole morale et consolante which is so soothing to think of the pulpit is now the home of fervid controversy and often exacerbated declamation in favour of ancient dogma against modern science we do not say whether this is or is not the wisest line for the clergy to follow we only press the fact against those who wish us to believe that dogma counts for nothing in the popular faith and that therefore we need not be uneasy as to its effects  next one would say to those who think that all will go well if you divide the community into two classes one privileged to use its own mind the other privileged to have its mind used by a priesthood that they overlook the momentous circumstance of these professional upholders of dogmatic systems being also possessed of a vast social influence in questions that naturally belong to another sphere there is hardly a single great controversy in modern politics where the statesman does not find himself in immediate contact with the real or supposed interests and with the active or passive sentiment of one of these religious systems therefore if the instructed or intellectually privileged class cheerfully leave the field open to men who ex hypothesi are presumed to be less instructed narrower more impenetrable by reason and the partisans of the letter against the spirit then this result follows they are deliberately strengthening the hands of the persons least fitted by judgment experience and temper for using such power rightly and they are strengthening them not merely in dealing with religious matters but what is of more importance in dealing with an endless variety of the gravest social and political matters it is impossible to map out the exact dimensions of the field in which a man shall exercise his influence and to which he is to be rigorously confined give men influence in one matter especially if that be such a matter as religious belief and ceremonial and it is simply impossible that this influence shall not extend with more or less effect over as much of the whole sphere of conduct as they may choose surrendering the common people without dispute or effort to organised priesthoods for religious purposes you would be inevitably including a vast number of other purposes in the selfsame destination this does not in the least prejudice practical ways of dealing with certain existing circumstances such as the propriety or justice of allowing a catholic people to have a catholic university it is only an argument against erecting into a complete and definite formula the division of a society into two great castes the one with a religion of the spirit the other with a creed of the letter  again supposing that the enlightened caste were to consent to abandon the common people to what are assumed to be lower and narrower forms of truthwhich is after all little more than a fine phrase for forms of falsehoodwhat can be more futile than to suppose that such a compromise will be listened to for a single moment by a caste whose first principle is that they are the possessors and ministers not of an inferior or superior form of truth but of the very truth itself absolute final complete divinely sent infallibly interpreted the disciples of the relative may afford to compromise the disciples of the absolute never  we shall see other objections as we go on to this state of things in which a minority holds true opinions and abandons the majority to false ones at the bottom of the advocacy of a dual doctrine slumbers the idea that there is no harm in men being mistaken or at least only so little harm as is more than compensated for by the marked tranquillity in which their mistake may wrap them this is not an idea merely that intellectual error is a pathological necessity of the mind no more to be escaped than the pathological necessities which afflict and finally dissolve the body that is historically true it is an idea that error somehow in certain stages where there is enough of it actually does good like vaccination well the thesis of the present chapter is that erroneous opinion or belief in itself and as such can never be useful this may seem a truism which everybody is willing to accept without demur but it is one of those truisms which persons habitually forget and repudiate in practice just because they have never made it real to themselves by considering and answering the objections that may be brought against it we see this repudiation before our eyes every day thus for instance parents theoretically take it for granted that error cannot be useful while they are teaching or allowing others to teach their children what they the parents believe to be untrue thus husbands who think the common theology baseless and unmeaning are found to prefer that their wives shall not question this theology nor neglect its rites these are only two out of a hundred examples of the daily admission that error may be very useful to other people i need hardly say that to deny this as the commonplace to which this chapter is devoted denies it is a different thing from denying the expediency of letting errors alone at a given time that is another question to be discussed afterwards you may have a thoroughly vicious and dangerous enemy and yet it may be expedient to choose your own hour and occasion for attacking him the passage from error to truth in the words of condorcet may be accompanied by certain evils every great change necessarily brings some of these in its train and though they may be always far below the evil you are for destroying yet it ought to do what is possible to diminish them it is not enough to do good one must do it in a good way no doubt we should destroy all errors but as it is impossible to destroy them all in an instant we should imitate a prudent architect who when obliged to destroy a building and knowing how its parts are united together sets about its demolition in such a way as to prevent its fall from being dangerous8  those let us note by the way who are accustomed to think the moral tone of the eighteenth century low and gross compared with that of the nineteenth may usefully contrast these just and prudent word of caution in extirpating error with m renans invitation to men whom he considers wrong in their interpretation of religion to plant their error as widely and deeply as they can and who are moreover themselves supposed to be demoralised or else they would not be likely to acquiesce in a previous surrender of the universities to men whom they think in mortal error apart however from m renan condorcets words merely assert the duty of setting to work to help on the change from false to true opinions with prudence and this every sensible man admits our position is that in estimating the situation in counting up and balancing the expediencies of an attack upon error at this or that point nothing is to be set to the credit of error as such nor is there anything in its own operations or effects to entitle it to a moments respite every one would admit this at once in the case of physical truths though there are those who say that some of the time spent in the investigation of physical truths might be more advantageously devoted to social problems but in the case of moral and religious truths or errors people if they admit that nothing is to be set to the credit of error as such still constantly have a subtle and practically mischievous confusion in their minds between the possible usefulness of error and the possible expediency of leaving it temporarily undisturbed what happens in consequence of such a confusion is this men leave error undisturbed because they accept in a loose way the proposition that a belief may be morally useful without being intellectually sustainable they disguise their own dissent from popular opinions because they regard such opinions as useful to other people we are not now discussing the case of those who embrace a creed for themselves on the ground that though they cannot demonstrate its truth to the understanding yet they find it pregnant with moralising and elevating characteristics we are thinking of a very different attitudethat namely of persons who believe a creed to be not more morally useful than it is intellectually sustainable so far as they themselves are concerned to them it is pure and uncompensated error yet from a vague and general idea that what is useless error to them may be useful to others they insist on doing their best to perpetuate the system which spreads and consecrates the error and how do they settle the question they reckon up the advantages and forget the drawbacks they detect and dwell on one or two elements of utility in the false belief or the wornout institution and leave out of all account the elements that make in the other direction  considering how much influence this vague persuasion has in encouraging a wellmeaning hypocrisy in individuals and a profound stagnation in societies it may be well to examine the matter somewhat generally let us try to measure the force of some of the most usual pleas for error  i a false opinion it may be said is frequently found to have clustering around it a multitude of excellent associations which do far more good than the false opinion that supports them does harm in the middle ages for instance there was a belief that a holy man had the gift of routing demons of healing the sick and of working divers other miracles supposing that this belief was untrue supposing that it was an error to attribute the sudden death of an incredible multitude of troublesome flies in a church to the fact of saint bernard having excommunicated them what then the mistaken opinion was still associated with a deep reverence for virtue and sanctity and this was more valuable than the error of the explanation of the death of the flies was noxious or degrading  the answer to this seems to be as follows first in making false notions the proofs or close associates of true ones you are exposing the latter to the ruin which awaits the former for example if you have in the minds of children or servants associated honesty industry truthfulness with the fear of hellfire then supposing this fear to become extinct in their mindswhich being unfounded in truth it is in constant risk of doingthe virtues associated with it are likely to be weakened exactly in proportion as that association was strong  second for all good habits in thought or conduct there are good and real reasons in the nature of things to leave such habits attached to false opinions is to lessen the weight of these natural or spontaneous reasons and so to do more harm in the long run than effacement of them seems for a time to do good most excellences in human character have a spontaneous root in our nature moreover if they had not and where they have not there is always a valid and real external defence for them the unreal defence must be weaker than the real one and the substitution of a weak for a strong defence where both are to be had is not useful but the very opposite  ii it is true the objector would probably continue that there is a rational defence for all excellences of conduct as there is for all that is worthy and fitting in institutions but the force of a rational defence lies in the rationality of the man to whom it is proffered the arguments which persuade one trained in scientific habits of thought only touch persons of the same kind character is not all pure reason that fitness of things which you pronounce to be the foundation of good habits may be borne in upon men and may speak to them through other channels than the syllogism you assume a community of highlytrained wranglers and proficient sophisters the plain fact is that for the mass of men use and wont rude or gracious symbols blind custom prejudices superstitionshowever erroneous in themselves however inadequate to the conveyance of the best truthare the only safe guardians of the common virtues in this sense then error may have its usefulness  a hundred years ago this apology for error was met by those highminded and interesting men the french believers in human perfectibility with their characteristic dogmaof which rousseau was the ardent expounderthat man is born with a clear and unsophisticated spirit perfectly able to discern all the simple truths necessary for common conduct by its own unaided light his motives are all pure and unselfish and his intelligence is unclouded until priests and tyrants mutilate the one and corrupt the other we who have the benefit of the historic method and have to take into account the medium that surrounds a human creature the moment it comes into the world to say nothing of all the inheritance from the past which it brings within it into the world at the same moment cannot take up this ground we cannot maintain that everybody is born with light enough to see the rational defences of things for himself without the education of institutions what we do maintain isand this is the answer to the plea for error at present under considerationthat whatever impairs the brightness of such light as a man has is not useful but hurtful our reply to those who contend for the usefulness of error on the ground of the comparative impotence of rationality over ordinary minds is something of this kind superstition blind obedience to custom and the other substitutes for a right and independent use of the mind may accidentally and in some few respects impress good ideas upon persons who are too darkened to accept those ideas on their real merits but then superstition itself is the main cause of this very darkness to hold error is in so far to foster erroneous ways of thinking on all subjects is to make the intelligence less and less ready to receive truth in all matters whatever men are made incapable of perceiving the rational defences and of feeling rational motives for good habitsso far as they are thus incapableby the very errors which we are asked silently to countenance as useful substitutes for right reason erroneous motives as condorcet has expressed this matter have an additional drawback attached to them the habit which they strengthen of reasoning ill the more important the subject on which you reason ill and the more you busy yourself about it by so much the more dangerous do the influences of such a habit become it is especially on subjects analogous to that on which you reason wrongly or which you connect with it by habit that such a defect extends most powerfully and most rapidly hence it is extremely hard for the man who believes himself obliged to conform in his conduct to what he considers truths useful to men but who attributes the obligation to erroneous motives to reason very correctly on the truths themselves the more attention he pays to such motives and the more importance he comes to attach to them the more likely he will be to go wrong9 so in short superstition does an immense harm by enfeebling rational ways of thinking it does a little good by accidentally endorsing rational conclusions in one or two matters and yet though the evil which it is said to repair is a trifle beside the evil which it is admitted to inflict the balance of expediencies is after all declared to be such as to warrant us in calling errors useful  iii a third objection now presents itself to me which i wish to state as strongly as possible even if a false opinion cannot in itself be more useful than a true one whatever good habits may seem to be connected with it yet it may be contended relatively to the general mental attitude of a set of men to their other notions and maxims the false opinion may entail less harm than would be wrought by its mere demolition there are false opinions so intimately bound up with the whole way of thinking and feeling that to introduce one or two detached true opinions in their stead would even if it were possible only serve to break up that coherency of character and conduct which it is one of the chief objects of moralists and the great art of living to produce for a true opinion does not necessarily bring in its train all the other true opinions that are logically connected with it on the contrary it is only too notorious a fact in the history of belief that not merely individuals but whole societies are capable of holding at one and the same time contradictory opinions and mutually destructive principles on the other hand neither does a false opinion involve practically all the evil consequences deducible from it for the results of human inconsistency are not all unhappy and if we do not always act up to virtuous principle no more do we always work out to its remotest inference every vicious principle not insincerity but inconsistency has constantly turned the adherents of persecuting precepts into friends of tolerant practice  it is a comparatively small thing to persuade a superstitious person to abandon this or that article of his superstition you have no security that the rejection of the one article which you have displaced will lead to the rejection of any other and it is quite possible that it may lead to all the more fervid an adhesion to what remains behind error therefore in view of such considerations may surely be allowed to have at least a provisional utility  now undoubtedly the repudiation of error is not at all the same thing as embracing truth people are often able to see the force of arguments that destroy a given opinion without being able to see the force of arguments for the positive opinion that ought to replace it they can only be quite sure of seeing both when they have acquired not merely a conviction that one notion is false and another true but have furthermore exchanged a generally erroneous way of thinking for a generally correct way hence the truly important object with every one who holds opinions which he deems it of the highest moment that others should accept must obviously be to reach peoples general ways of thinking to stir their love of truth to penetrate them with a sense of the difference in the quality of evidence to make them willing to listen to criticism and new opinion and perhaps above all to teach them to take ungrudging and daily trouble to clear up in their minds the exact sense of the terms they use  if this be so a false opinion like an erroneous motive can hardly have even a provisional usefulness for how can you attack an erroneous way of thinking except in detail that is to say through the sides of this or that single wrong opinion each of these wrong opinions is an illustration and type as it is a standing support and abettor of some kind of wrong reasoning though they are not all on the same scale nor all of them equally instructive it is precisely by this method of gradual displacement of error step by step that the few stages of progress which the race has yet traversed have been actually achieved even if the place of the erroneous idea is not immediately taken by the corresponding true one or by the idea which is at least one or two degrees nearer to the true one still the removal of error in this purely negative way amounts to a positive gain why for the excellent reason that it is the removal of a bad element which otherwise tends to propagate itself or even if it fails to do that tends at the best to make the surrounding mass of error more inveterate all error is what physiologists term fissiparous and in exterminating one false opinion you may be hindering the growth of an uncounted brood of false opinions  then as to the maintenance of that coherency interdependence and systematisation of opinions and motives which is said to make character organic and is therefore so highly prized by some schools of thought no doubt the loosening of this or that part of the fabric of heterogeneous origin which constitutes the character of a man or woman tends to loosen the whole but do not let us feed ourselves upon phrases this organic coherency what does it come to it signifies in a general way to describe it briefly a harmony between the intellectual the moral and the practical parts of human nature an undisturbed cooperation between reason affection and will the reason prescribing nothing against which the affections revolt and proscribing nothing which they crave and the will obeying the joint impulses of these two directing forces without liability to capricious or extravagant disturbance of their direction well if the reason were perfect in information and method and the affections faultless in their impulse then organic unity of character would be the final consummation of all human improvement and it would be criminal even if it were possible to undermine a structure of such priceless value but short of this there can be no value in coherency and harmonious consistency as such so long as error is an element in it then for so long the whole product is vitiated undeniably and most fortunately social virtues are found side by side with speculative mistakes and the gravest intellectual imperfections we may apply to humanity the idea which as hebrew students tell us is imputed in the talmud to the supreme being god prays the talmud says and his prayer is thisbe it my will that my mercy overpower my justice and so with men with or without their will their mercifulness overpowers their logic and not their mercifulness only but all their good impulses overpower their logic to repeat the words which i have put into the objectors mouth we do not always work out every vicious principle to its remotest inference what however is this but to say that in such cases character is saved not by its coherency but by the opposite to say not that error is useful but what is a very different thing that its mischievousness is sometimes capable of being averted or minimised  the apologist may retort that he did not mean answer to the argument from coherency of conduct in measuring utility you have to take into account not merely the service rendered to the objects of the present hour but the contribution to growth progress and the future from this point of view most of the talk about unity of character is not much more than a glorifying of stagnation it leaves out of sight the conditions necessary for the continuance of the unending task of human improvement now whatever ease may be given to an individual or a generation by social or religious error such error at any rate can conduce nothing to further advancement that at least is not one of its possible utilities  this is also one of the answers to the following plea though the knowledge of every positive truth is an useful acquisition this doctrine cannot without reservation he applied to negative truth when the only truth ascertainable is that nothing can be known we do not by this knowledge gain any new fact by which to guide ourselves10 but logical coherency but a kind of practical everyday coherency which may be open to a thousand abstract objections yet which still secures both to the individual and to society a number of advantages that might be endangered by any disturbance of opinion or motive no doubt and the method and season of chasing erroneous opinions and motives out of the mind must always be a matter of much careful and farseeing consideration only in the course of such consideration let us not admit the notion in any form that error can have even provisional utility for it is not the error which confers the advantages that we desire to preserve but some true opinion or just motive or high or honest sentiment which exists and thrives and operates in spite of the error and in face of it springing from mans spontaneous and unformulated recognition of the real relations of things this recognition is very faint in the beginnings of society it grows clearer and firmer with each step forward and in a tolerably civilised age it has become a force on which you can fairly lean with a considerable degree of assurance  and this leads to the central point of the the negative truth that nothing can be known is in fact a truth that guides us transcribers note sic it leads us away from sterile and irreclaimable tracts of thought and emotion and so inevitably compels the energies which would otherwise have been wasted to feel after a more profitable direction by leaving the old guidemarks undisturbed you may give ease to an existing generation but the present ease is purchased at the cost of future growth to have been deprived of the faith of the old dispensation is the first condition of strenuous endeavour after the new  no doubt history abounds with cases in which a false opinion on moral or religious subjects or an erroneous motive in conduct has seemed to be a steppingstone to truth but this is in no sense a demonstration of the utility of error for in all such cases the erroneous opinion or motive was far from being wholly erroneous or wholly without elements of truth and reality if it helped to quicken the speed or mend the direction of progress that must have been by virtue of some such elements within it all that was error in it was pure waste or worse than waste it is true that the religious sentiment has clothed itself in a great number of unworthy inadequate depressing and otherwise misleading shapes dogmatic and liturgic yet on the whole the religious sentiment has conferred enormous benefits on civilisation this is no proof of the utility of the mistaken direction which these dogmatic or liturgic shapes imposed upon it on the contrary the effect of the false dogmas and enervating liturgies is so much that has to be deducted from the advantages conferred by a sentiment in itself valuable and of priceless capability11  yes it will be urged but from the historic conditions of the time truth could only be conveyed in erroneous forms and motives of permanent price for humanity could only be secured in these mistaken expressions here i would again press the point of this necessity for erroneous forms and mistaken expressions being in a great many of the most important instances itself derivative one among other ill consequences of previous moral and religious error it was gravely said bacon tells us by some of the prelates in the council of trent where the doctrines of the schoolmen have great sway that the schoolmen were like astronomers which did faigne eccentricks and epicycles and engines of orbs to save the phenomena though they know there were no such things and in like manner that the schoolmen had framed a number of subtile and intricate axioms and theorems to save the practice of the church this is true of much else besides scholastic axioms and theorems subordinate error was made necessary and invented by reason of some proexistent main stock of error and to save the practice of the church thus we are often referred to the consolation which this or that doctrine has brought to the human spirit but what if the same system had produced the terror which made absence of consolation intolerable how much of the necessity for expressing the enlarged humanity of the church in the doctrine of purgatory arose from the existence of the older unsoftened doctrine of eternal hell  again how much of this alleged necessity of error as alloy for the too pure metal of sterling truth is to be explained by the interest which powerful castes or corporations have had in preserving the erroneous forms even when they could not resist or did not wish to resist their impregnation by newer and better doctrine this interest was not deliberately sinister or malignant it may be more correctly as well as more charitably explained by that infirmity of human nature which makes us very ready to believe what it is on other grounds convenient to us to believe nobody attributes to pure malevolence the heartiness with which the great corporation of lawyers for example resist the removal of superfluous and obstructive forms in their practice they have come to look on such forms as indispensable safeguards hence powerful teachers and preachers of all kinds have been spontaneously inclined to suppose a necessity which had no real existence of preserving as much as was possible of what we know to be error even while introducing wholesome modification of it this is the honest though mischievous conservatism of the human mind we have no right to condemn our foregoers far less to lavish on them the evil names of impostor charlatan and brigand which the zealous unhistoric school of the last century used so profusely but we have a right to say of them as we say of those who imitate their policy now that their conservatism is no additional proof of the utility of error least of all is it any justification for those who wish to have impressed upon the people a complete system of religious opinion which men of culture have avowedly put away and moreover the very priests must i should think be supposed to have put it away also else they would hardly be invited deliberately to abdicate their teaching functions in the very seats where teaching is of the weightiest and most farspreading influence  meanwhile our point is that the reforms in opinion which have been effected on the plan of pouring the new wine of truth into the old bottles of superstitionthough not dishonourable to the sincerity of the reformersare no testimony to even the temporary usefulness of error those who think otherwise do not look far enough in front of the event they forget the evil wrought by the prolonged duration of the error to which the added particle of truth may have given new vitality they overlook the ultimate enervation that is so often the price paid for the temporary exaltation  nor finally can they know the truths which the error thus prolonged has hindered from coming to the birth a strenuous disputant has recently asserted against me that the region of the might have been lies beyond the limits of sane speculation12 it in surely extending optimism too far to insist on carrying it back right through the ages to me at any rate the history of mankind is a huge pisaller just as our present society is a prodigious wasteful experiment from which a certain number of precious results have been extracted but which is not now nor ever has been at any other time a final measure of all the possibilities of the time this is not inconsistent with the scientific conception of history it is not to deny the great law that society has a certain order of progress but only to urge that within that the only possible order there is always room for all kinds and degrees of invention improvement and happy or unhappy accident there is no discoverable law fixing precisely the more or the less of these nor how much of each of them a community shall meet with nor exactly when it shall meet with them we have to distinguish between possibility and necessity only certain steps in advance are possible at a given time but it is not inevitable that those potential advances should all be realised does anybody suppose that humanity has had the profit of all the inventive and improving capacity born into the world that turgot for example was the only man that ever lived who might have done more for society than he was allowed to do and spared society a cataclysm nohistory is a pisaller it has assuredly not moved without the relation of cause and effect it is a record of social growth and its conditions but it is also a record of interruption and misadventure and perturbation you trace the long chain which has made us what we are in this aspect and that but where are the dropped links that might have made all the difference ubi sunt eorum tabulae qui post vota nuncupate perierunt where is the fruit of those multitudinous gifts which came into the world in untimely seasons we accept the past for the same reason that we accept the laws of the solar system though as comte says we can easily conceive them improved in certain respects the past like the solar system is beyond reach of modification at our hands and we cannot help it but it is surely the mere midsummer madness of philosophic complacency to think that we have come by the shortest and easiest of all imaginable routes to our present point in the march to suppose that we have wasted nothing lost nothing cruelly destroyed nothing on the road what we have lost is all in the region of the might have been and we are justified in taking this into account and thinking much of it and in trying to find causes for the loss one of them has been want of liberty for the human intelligence and another to return to our proper subject has been the prolonged existence of superstition of false opinions and of attachment to gross symbols beyond the time when they might have been successfully attacked and would have fallen into decay but for the mistaken political notion of their utility in making a just estimate of this utility if we see reason to believe that these false opinions narrow superstitions gross symbols have been an impediment to the free exercise of the intelligence and a worthier culture of the emotions then we are justified in placing the unknown loss as a real and most weighty item in the account against them  in short then the utmost that can be said on behalf of errors in opinion and motive is that they are inevitable elements in human growth but the inevitable does not coincide with the useful pain can be avoided by none of the sons of men yet the horrible and uncompensated subtraction which it makes from the value and usefulness of human life is one of the most formidable obstacles to the smoother progress of the world and as with pain so with error the moral of our contention has reference to the temper in which practically we ought to regard false doctrine and illdirected motive it goes to show that if we have satisfied ourselves on good grounds that the doctrine is false or the motive ill directed then the only question that we need ask ourselves turns solely upon the possibility of breaking it up and dispersing it by methods compatible with the doctrine of liberty any embarrassment in dealing with it due to a semilatent notion that it may be useful to some one else is a weakness that hinders social progress  footnotes  footnote 5 mills autobiography p 170  footnote 6 m renans réforme intellectuelle et morale de la france p 98  footnote 7 etudes

position of those who would fain divide the community into two great castes the one of thoughtful and instructed persons using their minds freely but guarding their conclusions in strict reserve the other of the illiterate or unreflecting who should have certain opinions and practices taught them not because they are true or are really what their votaries are made to believe them to be but because the intellectual superiors of the community think the inculcation of such a belief useful in all cases save their own nor is this a mere theory on the contrary it is a fair description of an existing state of things we have the old disciplina arcani among us in as full force as in the primitive church but with an allimportant difference the christian fathers practised reserve for the sake of leading the acolyte the more surely to the fulness of truth the modern economiser keeps back his opinions or dissembles the grounds of them for the sake of leaving his neighbours the more at their ease in the peaceful sloughs of prejudice and superstition and low ideals we quote saint paul when he talked of making himself all things to all men and of becoming to the jews a jew and as without the law to the heathen but then we do so with a view to justifying ourselves for leaving the jew to remain a jew and the heathen to remain heathen we imitate the same apostle in accepting old timeworn altars dedicated to the unknown god we forget that he made the ancient symbol the startingpoint of a revolutionised doctrine there is as anybody can see a whole world of difference between the reserve of sagacious apostleship on the one hand dealing tenderly with scruple and tearfulness and fine sensibility of conscience and the reserve of intellectual cowardice on the other hand dealing hypocritically with narrow minds in the supposed interests of social peace and quietness the old disciplina arcani signified the disclosure of a little light with a view to the disclosure of more the new means the dissimulation of truth with a view to the perpetuation of error consider the difference between these two fashions of compromise in their effects upon the mind and character of the person compromising the one is fully compatible with fervour and hopefulness and devotion to great causes the other stamps a man with artifice and hinders the free eagerness of his vision and wraps him about with mediocritynot always of understanding but that still worse thing mediocrity of aspiration and purpose  the coarsest and most revolting shape which the doctrine of conformity can assume and its degrading consequences to the character of the conformer may be conveniently illustrated by a passage in the life of hume he looked at things in a more practical manner than would find favour with the sentimental champions of compromise in nearer times there is a wellknown letter of humes in which he recommends a young man to become a clergyman on the ground that it was very hard to got any tolerable civil employment and that as lord bute was then all powerful his friend would be certain of preferment in answer to the young mans scruples as to the articles and the rest hume says  it is putting too great a respect on the vulgar and their superstitions to pique ones self on sincerity with regard to them if the thing were worthy of being treated gravely i should tell him the young man that the pythian oracle with the approbation of xenophon advised every one to worship the godsgreek nhomô pholeôs i wish it were still in my power to be a hypocrite in this particular the common duties of society usually require it and the ecclesiastical profession only adds a little more to an innocent dissimulation or rather simulation without which it is impossible to pass through the world13  this is a singularly straightforward way of stating a view which silently influences a much greater number of men than it is pleasant to think of they would shrink from throwing their conduct into so gross a formula they will lift up their hands at this quotation so strangely blind are we to the hidingplaces of our own hearts even when others flash upon them the terrible illumination that comes of calling conduct and motives by plain names now it is not merely the moral improbity of these cases which revolts usthe improbity of making in solemn form a number of false statements for the sake of earning a livelihood of saying in order to get money or social position that you accept a number of propositions which in fact you utterly reject of declaring expressly that you trust you are inwardly moved to take upon you this office and ministration by the holy ghost when the real motive is a desire not to miss the chance of making something out of the earl of bute this side of such dissimulation is shocking enough and it is not any more shocking to the most devout believer than it is to people who doubt whether there be any holy ghost or not those who no longer place their highest faith in powers above and beyond men are for that very reason more deeply interested than others in cherishing the integrity and worthiness of man himself apart however from the immorality of such reasoned hypocrisy which no man with a particle of honesty will attempt to blink there is the intellectual improbity which it brings in its train the infidelity to truth the disloyalty to ones own intelligence gifts of understanding are numbed and enfeebled in a man who has once played such a trick with his own conscience as to persuade himself that because the vulgar are superstitious it is right for the learned to earn money by turning themselves into the ministers and accomplices of superstition if he is clever enough to see through the vulgar and their beliefs he is tolerably sure to be clever enough from time to time and in his better moments to see through himself he begins to suspect himself of being an impostor that suspicion gradually unmans him when he comes to use his mind in the sphere of his own enlightenment one of really superior power cannot escape these better moments and the remorse that they bring as he advances in life as his powers ought to be coming to fuller maturity and his intellectual productiveness to its prime just in the same degree the increasing seriousness of life multiplies such moments and deepens their remorse and so the light of intellectual promise slowly goes out in impotent endeavour or else in taking comfort that much goods are laid up or what is deadliest of all in a soulless cynicism  we do not find out until it is too late that the intellect too at least where it is capable of being exercised on the higher objects has its sensitiveness it loses its colour and potency and finer fragrance in an atmosphere of mean purpose and low conception of the sacredness of fact and reality who has not observed inferior original power achieving greater results even in the intellectual field itself where the superior understanding happens to have been unequally yoked with a selfseeking character over scenting the expedient if hume had been in the early productive part of his life the hypocrite which he wished it were in his power to show himself in its latter part we may be tolerably sure that european philosophy would have missed one of its foremost figures it has been often said that he who begins life by stifling his convictions is in a fair way for ending it without any convictions to stifle we may perhaps add that he who sets out with the notion that the difference between truth and falsehood is a thing of no concern to the vulgar is very likely sooner or later to come to the kindred notion that it is not a thing of any supreme concern to himself  let thus much have been said as to those who deliberately and knowingly sell their intellectual birthright for a mess of pottage making a brazen compromise with what they hold despicable lest they should have to win their bread honourably men need to expend no declamatory indignation upon them they have a hell of their own words can add no bitterness to it it is no light thing to have secured a livelihood on condition of going through life masked and gagged to be compelled week after week and year after year to recite the symbols of ancient faith and lift up his voice in the echoes of old hopes with the blighting thought in his soul that the faith is a lie and the hope no more than the folly of the crowd to read hundreds of times in a twelvemonth with solemn unction as the inspired word of the supreme what to him are meaningless as the abracadabras of the conjuror in a booth to go on to the end of his days administering to simple folk holy rites of commemoration and solace when he has in his mind at each phrase what dupes are those simple folk and how wearisomely counterfeit their rites and to know through all that this is really to be the one business of his prostituted life that so dreary and hateful a piece of playacting will make the desperate retrospect of his last hoursof a truth here is the very greek bdhelygma tês erêmhôseôs the abomination of desolation of the human spirit indeed  no one will suppose that this is designed for the normal type of priest but it is well to study tendencies in their extreme catastrophe this is only the catastrophe in one of its many shapes of the fatal doctrine that money position power philanthropy or any of the thousand seductive masks of the pseudoexpedient may carry a man away from love of truth and yet leave him internally unharmed the depravation that follows the trucking for money of intellectual freedom and selfrespect attends in its degree each other departure from disinterested following of truth and each other substitution of convenience whether public or private in its place and both parties to such a compromise are losers the world which offers gifts and tacitly undertakes to ask no questions as to the real state of the timeservers inner mind loses no less than the timeserver himself who receives the gifts and promises to hold his peace it is as though a society placed penalties on mechanical inventions and the exploration of new material resources and offered bounties for the steadiest adherence to all ancient processes in culture and production the injury to wealth in the one case would not be any deeper than the injury to morality is in the other   to pass on to less sinister forms of this abnegation of intellectual responsibility in the opening sentences of the first chapter we spoke of a wise suspense in forming opinions a wise reserve in expressing them and a wise tardiness in trying to realise them thus we meant to mark out the three independent provinces of compromise each of them being the subject of considerations that either do not apply at all to the other two or else apply in a different degree disingenuousness or selfillusion arising from a depressing deference to the existing state of things or to what is immediately practicable or to what other people would think of us if they knew our thoughts is the result of compromising truth in the matter of forming and holding opinions secondly positive simulation is what comes of an unlawful willingness to compromise in the matter of avowing and publishing them finally pusillanimity or want of faith is the vice that belongs to unlawful compromise in the department of action and realisation this is not merely a division arranged for convenience of discussion it goes to the root of conduct and character and is the key to the present mood of our society it is always a hardy thing to attempt to throw a complex matter into very simple form but we should say that the want of energy and definiteness in contemporary opinions of which we first complained is due mainly to the following notion that if a subject is not ripe for practical treatment you and i are therefore entirely relieved from the duty of having clear ideas about it if the majority cling to an opinion why should we ask whether that is the sound and right opinion or the reverse now this notion which springs from a confusion of the three fields of compromise with one another quietly reigns almost without dispute the devotion to the practical aspect of truth is in such excess as to make people habitually deny that it can be worth while to form an opinion when it happens at the moment to be incapable of realisation for the reason that there is no direct prospect of inducing a sufficient number of persons to share it we are quite willing to think that your view is the right one and would produce all the improvements for which you hope but then there is not the smallest chance of persuading the only persons able to carry out such a view why therefore discuss it no talk is more familiar to us than this as if the mere possibility of the view being a right one did not obviously entitle it to discussion discussion being the only process by which people are likely to be induced to accept it or else to find good grounds for finally dismissing it  it is precisely because we believe that opinion and nothing but opinion can effect great permanent changes that we ought to be careful to keep this most potent force honest wholesome fearless and independent take the political field politicians and newspapers almost systematically refuse to talk about a new idea which is not capable of being at once embodied in a bill and receiving the royal assent before the following august there is something rather contemptible seen from the ordinary standards of intellectual integrity in the position of a minister who waits to make up his mind whether a given measure say the disestablishment of the irish church is in itself and on the merits desirable until the official who runs diligently up and down the backstairs of the party tells him that the measure is practicable and required in the interests of the band on the one hand a leader is lavishly panegyrised for his highmindedness in suffering himself to be driven into his convictions by his party on the other a party is extolled for its political tact in suffering itself to be forced out of its convictions by its leader it is hard to decide which is the more discreditable and demoralising sight the education of chiefs by followers and of followers by chiefs into the abandonment in a month of the traditions of centuries or the principles of a lifetime may conduce to the rapid and easy working of the machine it certainly marks a triumph of the political spirit which the author of the prince might have admired it is assuredly mortal to habits of intellectual selfrespect in the society which allows itself to be amused by the cajolery and legerdemain and selfsophistication of its rulers  of course there are excellent reasons why a statesman immersed in the actual conduct of affairs should confine his attention to the work which his hands find to do but the fact that leading statesmen are of necessity so absorbed in the tasks of the hour furnishes all the better reason why as many other people as possible should busy themselves in helping to prepare opinion for the practical application of unfamiliar but weighty and promising suggestions by constant and ready discussion of them upon their merits as a matter of fact it is not the men most occupied who are usually most deaf to new ideas it is the loungers of politics the quidnuncs gossips bustling idlers who are most industrious in stifling discussion by protests against the waste of time and the loss of force involved in talking about proposals which are not exactly ready to be voted on as it is everybody knows that questions are inadequately discussed or often not discussed at all on the ground that the time is not yet come for their solution then when some unforeseen perturbation or the natural course of things forces on the time for their resolution they are settled in a slovenly imperfect and often downright vicious manner from the fact that opinion has not been prepared for solving them in an efficient and perfect manner the socalled settlement of the question of national education is the most recent and most deplorable illustration of what comes of refusing to examine ideas alleged to be impracticable perhaps we may venture to prophesy that the disendowment of the national church will supply the next illustration on an imposing scale gratuitous primary instruction and the redistribution of electoral power are other matters of signal importance which comparatively few men will consent to discuss seriously and patiently and for our indifference to which we shall one day surely smart a judicious and cool writer has said that an opinion gravely professed by a man of sense and education demands always respectful considerationdemands and actually receives it from those whose own sense and education give them a correlative right and whoever offends against this sort of courtesy may fairly be deemed to have forfeited the privileges it secures14 that is the least part of the matter the serious mischief is the eventual miscarriage and loss and prodigal waste of good ideas  the evil of which we have been speaking comes of not seeing the great truth that it is worth while to take pains to find out the best way of doing a given task even if you have strong grounds for suspecting that it will ultimately be done in a worse way and so also in spheres of thought away from the political sphere it is worth while to scorn delights and live laborious days in order to make as sure as we can of having the best opinion even if we know that this opinion has an infinitely small chance of being speedily or ever accepted by the majority or by anybody but ourselves truth and wisdom have to bide their time and then take their chance after all the most that the individual can do is to seek them for himself even if he seek alone and if it is the most it is also the least yet in our present mood we seem not to feel this we misunderstand the considerations which should rightly lead us in practice to surrender some of what we desire in order to secure the rest and rightly make us acquiesce in a secondbest course of action in order to avoid stagnation or retrogression we misunderstand all this and go on to suppose that there are the same grounds why we should in our own minds acquiesce in secondbest opinions why we should mix a little alloy of conventional expression with the too fine ore of conviction why we should adopt beliefs that we suspect in our hearts to be of more than equivocal authenticity but into whose antecedents we do not greatly care to inquire because they stand so well with the general public this is compromise or economy or management of the first of the three kinds of which we are talking it is economy applied to the formation of opinion compromise or management in making up ones mind  the lawfulness or expediency of it turns mainly as with the other two kinds of compromise upon the relative rights of the majority and the minority and upon the respect which is owing from the latter to the former it is a very easy thing for people endowed with the fanatical temperament or demoralised by the habit of looking at society exclusively from the juridical point of view to insist that no respect at all except the respect that arises from being too weak to have your own way is due from either to the other this shallow and mischievous notion rests either on a misinterpretation of the experience of civilised societies or else on nothing more creditable than an arbitrary and unreflecting temper those who have thought most carefully and disinterestedly about the matter are agreed that in advanced societies the expedient course is that no portion of the community should insist on imposing its own will upon any other portion except in matters which are vitally connected with the maintenance of the social union the question where this vital connection begins is open to much discussion the line defining the sphere of legitimate interference may be drawn variously whether at selfregarding acts or in some other condition and element of conduct wherever this line may be best taken not only abstract speculation but the practical and spontaneous tact of the world has decided that there are limits alike in the interest of majority and minority to the rights of either to disturb the other in other words it is expedient in certain affairs that the will of the majority should be absolutely binding while in affairs of a different order it should count for nothing or as nearly nothing as the sociable dependence of a man on his fellows will permit  our thesis is this in the positive endeavour to realise an opinion to convert a theory into practice it may be and very often is highly expedient to defer to the prejudices of the majority to move very slowly to bow to the conditions of the status quo to practise the very utmost sobriety selfrestraint and conciliatoriness the mere expression of opinion in the next place the avowal of dissent from received notions the refusal to conform to language which implies the acceptance of such notionsthis rests on a different footing here the reasons for respecting the wishes and sentiments of the majority are far less strong though as we shall presently see such reasons certainly exist and will weigh with all wellconsidering men finally in the formation of an opinion as to the abstract preferableness of one course of action over another or as to the truth or falsehood or right significance of a proposition the fact that the majority of ones contemporaries lean in the other direction is naught and no more than dust in the balance in making up our minds as to what would be the wisest line of policy if it were practicable we have nothing to do with the circumstance that it is not practicable and in settling with ourselves whether propositions purporting to state matters of fact are trim or not we have to consider how far they are conformable to the evidence we have nothing to do with the comfort and solace which they would be likely to bring to others or ourselves if they were taken as true  a nominal assent to this truth will be instantly given even by those who in practice systematically disregard it the difficulty of transforming that nominal assent into a reality is enormous in such a community as ours of all societies since the roman republic and not even excepting the roman republic england has been the most emphatically and essentially political she has passed through military phases and through religious phases but they have been transitory and the great central stream of national life has flowed in political channels the political life has been stronger than any other deeper wider more persistent more successful the wars which built up our farspreading empire were not waged with designs of military conquest they were mostly wars for a market the great spiritual emancipation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries figures in our history partly as an accident partly as an intrigue partly as a raid of nobles in search of spoil it was hardly until the reformed doctrine became associated with analogous ideas and corresponding precepts in government that people felt at home with it and became really interested in it  one great taproot of our national increase has been the growth of selfgovernment or government by deliberative bodies representing opposed principles and conflicting interests with the system of selfgovernment has grown the habitnot of tolerance precisely for englishmen when in earnest are as little in love with tolerance as frenchmen or any other people butof giving way to the will of the majority so long as they remain a majority this has come to pass for the simple reason that on any other terms the participation of large numbers of people in the control and arrangement of public affairs immediately becomes unworkable the gradual concentration of power in the hands of a supreme deliberative body the active share of so many thousands of persons in choosing and controlling its members the close attention with which the proceedings of parliament are followed and watched the kind of dignity that has been lent to parliamentary methods by the great importance of the transactions have all tended in the same direction they have all helped both to fix our strongest and most constant interests upon politics and to ingrain the mental habits proper to politics far more deeply than any other into our general constitution and inmost character  thus the political spirit has grown to be the strongest element in our national life the dominant force extending its influence over all our ways of thinking in matters that have least to do with politics or even nothing at all to do with them there has thus been engendered among us the real sense of political responsibility in a corresponding degree has been discouraged what it is the object of the present chapter to urge the sense of intellectual responsibility if it were inevitable that one of these two should always enfeeble or exclude the other if the price of the mental alacrity and openmindedness of the age of pericles must always be paid in the political incompetence of the age of demosthenes it would be hard to settle which quality ought to be most eagerly encouraged by those who have most to do with the spiritual direction of a community no doubt the tone of a longenduring and imperial society such as rome was must be conservative drastic positive hostile to the death to every speculative novelty but then after all the permanence of roman power was only valuable to mankind because it ensured the spread of certain civilising ideas and these ideas had originated among people so characteristically devoid of the sovereign faculty of political coherency as were the greeks and the jews in the greeks it is true we find not only ideas of the highest speculative fertility but actual political institutions still we should hardly point to greek history for the most favourable examples of their stable working practically and as a matter of history a society is seldom at the same time successfully energetic both in temporals and spirituals seldom prosperous alike in seeking abstract truth and nursing the political spirit there is a decisive preponderance in one direction or the other and the equal balance between free and active thinking and coherent practical energy in a community seems too hard to sustain the vast military and political strength of germany for instance did not exist and was scarcely anticipated in mens minds during the time of her most strenuous passion for abstract truth and deeper learning and new criticism in france never was political and national interest so debilitated so extinct as it was during the reign of lewis the fifteenth her intellectual interest was never so vivid so fruitful or so widely felt  yet it is at least well and more than that it is an indispensable condition of social wellbeing that the divorce between political responsibility and intellectual responsibility between respect for what is instantly practicable and search after what is only important in thought should not be too complete and universal even if there were no other objection the undisputed predominance of the political spirit has a plain tendency to limit the subjects in which the men animated by it can take a real interest all matters fall out of sight or at least fall into a secondary place which do not bear more or less directly and patently upon the material and structural welfare of the community in this way the members of the community miss the most bracing widening and elevated of the whole range of influences that create great characters first they lose sincere concern about the larger questions which the human mind has raised up for itself second they lose a fearless desire to reach the true answers to them or if no certain answers should prove to be within reach then at any rate to be satisfied on good grounds that this is so such questions are not immediately discerned by commonplace minds to be of social import consequently they and all else that is not obviously connected with the machinery of society give way in the public consideration to what is so connected with it in a manner that cannot be mistaken  again even minds that are not commonplace are affected for the worse by the same spirit they are aware of the existence of the great speculative subjects and of their importance but the pressure of the political spirit on such men makes them afraid of the conclusions to which free inquiry might bring them accordingly they abstain from inquiry and dread nothing so much as making up their minds they see reasons for thinking that if they applied themselves seriously to the formation of true opinions in this or that department they would come to conclusions which though likely to make their way in the course of some centuries are wholly unpopular now and which might ruin the influence of anybody suspected of accepting or even of so much as leaning towards them life they reflect is short missionaries do not pass for a very agreeable class nor martyrs for a very sensible class one can only do a trifling amount of good in the world at best it is moral suicide to throw away any chance of achieving even that trifle and therefore it is best not only not to express but not to take the trouble to acquire right views in this quarter or that and to draw clear away from such or such a region of thought for the sake of keeping peace on earth and superficial good will among men  it would be too harsh to stigmatise such a train of thought as selfseeking and hypocritical it is the natural product of the political spirit which is incessantly thinking of present consequences and the immediately feasible there is nothing in the mere dread of losing it to hinder influence from being well employed so far as it goes but one can hardly overrate the ill consequences of this particular kind of management this unspoken bargaining with the little circle of his fellows which constitutes the world of a man if he may retain his place among them as preacher or teacher he is willing to forego his birthright of free explanation he consents to be blind to the duty which attaches to every intelligent man of having some clear ideas even though only provisional ones upon the greatest subjects of human interest and of deliberately preferring these whatever they may be to their opposites either an individual or a community is fatally dwarfed by any such limitation of the field in which one is free to use his mind for it is a limitation not prescribed by absorption in one set of subjects rather than another nor by insufficient preparation for the discussion of certain subjects nor by indolence nor incuriousness but solely by apprehension of the conclusions to which such use of the mind might bring the too courageous seeker if there were no other ill effect this kind of limitation would at least have the radical disadvantage of dulling the edge of responsibility of deadening the sharp sense of personal answerableness either to a god or to society or to a mans own conscience and intellectual selfrespect  how momentous a disadvantage this is we can best know by contemplating the characters which have sometimes lighted up the old times men were then devoutly persuaded that their eternal salvation depended on their having true beliefs any slackness in finding out which beliefs are the true ones would have to be answered for before the throne of almighty god at the sure risk and peril of everlasting damnation to what quarter in the large historic firmament can we turn our eyes with such certainty of being stirred and elevated of thinking better of human life and the worth of those who have been most deeply penetrated by its seriousness as to the annals of the intrepid spirits whom the protestant doctrine of indefeasible personal responsibility brought to the front in germany in the sixteenth century and in england and scotland in the seventeenth it is not their fanaticism still less is it their theology which makes the great puritan chiefs of england and the stern covenanters of scotland so heroic in our sight it is the fact that they sought truth and ensued it not thinking of the practicable nor cautiously counting majorities and minorities but each man pondering and searching so as ever in the great taskmasters eye  it is no adequate answer to urge that this awful consciousness of a divine presence and supervision has ceased to be the living fact it once was that partly explains but it certainly does not justify our present lassitude for the everwakeful eye of celestial power is not the only conceivable stimulus to responsibility to pass from those grim heroes of protestantism to the french philosophers of the last century is a wide leap in a hundred respects yet they too were pricked by the oestrus of intellectual responsibility their doctrine was dismally insufficient and sometimes as the present writer has often pointed out it was directly vicious their daily lives were surrounded by much shabbiness and many meannesses but after all no temptation and no menace no pains or penalties for thinking about certain subjects and no rewards for turning to think about something else could divert such men as voltaire and diderot from their alert and strenuous search after such truth as could be vouchsafed to their imperfect lights a catastrophe followed it is true but the misfortunes which attended it were due more to the champions of tradition and authority than to the soldiers of emancipation even in the case of the latter they were due to an inadequate doctrine and not at all either to their sense of the necessity of free speculation and inquiry or to the intrepidity with which they obeyed the promptings of that ennobling sense  perhaps the latest attempt of a considerable kind to suppress the political spirit in nonpolitical concerns was the famous movement which had its birth a generation ago among the gray quadrangles and ancient gardens of oxford the sweet city with her dreaming spires where there has ever been so much detachment from the world alongside of the coarsest and fiercest hunt after the grosser prizes of the world no one has much less sympathy with the direction of the tractarian revival than the present writer in whose oxford days the star of newman had set and the sun of mill had risen in its stead and it is needful to distinguish the fervid and strong spirits with whom the revival began from the mimics of our later day no doubt the mere occasion of tractarianism was political its leaders were alarmed at the designs imputed to the newly reformed parliament of disestablishing the anglican church they asked themselves the question which i will put in their own words tract ishould the government of the country so far forget their god as to cut off the church to deprive it of its temporal honours and substance on what will you rest the claims to respect and attention which you make upon your flock in answering this question they speedily found themselves as might have been expected at the opposite pole of thought from things political the whole strength of their appeal to members of the church lay in mens weariness of the high and dry optimism which presents the existing order of things as the noblest possible and the undisturbed way of the majority as the way of salvation apostolical succession and sacramentalism may not have been in themselves progressive ideas the spirit which welcomed them had at least the virtue of taking away from caesar the things that are not caesars  glaring as were the intellectual faults of the oxford movement it was at any rate a recognition in a very forcible way of the doctrine that spiritual matters are not to be settled by the dicta of a political council it acknowledged that a man is answerable at his own peril for having found or lost the truth it was a warning that he must reckon with a judge who will not account the status quo nor the convenience of a cabinet a good plea for indolent acquiescence in theological error it ended in the case of its most vigorous champions in a final and deliberate putting out of the eyes of the understanding the last act of assertion of personal responsibility was a headlong acceptance of the responsibility of tradition and the church this was deplorable enough but apart from other advantages incidental to the tractarian movement such as the attention which it was the means of drawing to history and the organic connection between present and past it had we repeat the merit of being an effective protest against what may be called the house of commons view of human lifea view excellent in its place but most blighting and dwarfing out of it it was what every sincere uprising of the better spirit in men and women must always be an effective protest against the leaden tyranny of the man of the world and the socalled practical person the man of the world despises catholics for taking their religious opinions on trust and being the slaves of tradition as if he had himself formed his own most important opinions either in religion or anything else he laughs at them for their superstitious awe of the church as if his own inward awe of the greater number were one whit less of a superstition he mocks their deference for the past as if his own absorbing deference to the present were one tittle better bottomed or a jot more respectable the modern emancipation will profit us very little if the status quo is to be fastened round our necks with the despotic authority of a heavenly dispensation and if in the stead of ancient scriptures we are to accept the plenary inspiration of majorities   it may be urged that if as it is the object of the present chapter to state there are opinions which a man should form for himself and which it may yet be expedient that he should not only be slow to attempt to realise in practical life but sometimes even slow to expressthen we are demanding from him the performance of a troublesome duty while we are taking from him the only motives which could really induce him to perform it if it may be asked i am not to carry my notions into practice nor try to induce others to accept them nor even boldly publish them why in the name of all economy of force should i take so much pains in forming opinions which are after all on these conditions so very likely to come to naught the answer to this is that opinions do not come to naught even if the man who holds them should never think fit to publish them for one thing as we shall see in our next division the conditions which make against frank declaration of our convictions are of rare occurrence and apart from this convictions may well exert a most decisive influence over our conduct even if reasons exist or seem to exist for not pressing them on others though themselves invisible to the outer world they may yet operate with magnetic force both upon other parts of our belief which the outer world does see and upon the whole of our dealings with it whether we are good or bad it is only a broken and incoherent fragment of our whole personality that even those who are intimate with us much less the common world can ever come into contact with the important thing is that the personality itself should be as little as possible broken incoherent and fragmentary that reasoned and consistent opinions should back a firm will and independent convictions inspire the intellectual selfrespect and strenuous selfpossession which the clamour of majorities and the silent yet everpressing force of the status quo are equally powerless to shake  character is doubtless of far more importance than mere intellectual opinion we only too often see highly rationalised convictions in persons of weak purpose or low motives but while fully recognising this and the sort of possible reality which lies at the root of such a phrase as godless intellect or intellectual devilsthough the phrase has no reality when it is used by selfseeking politicians or prelatesyet it is well to remember the very obvious truth that opinions are at least an extremely important part of character as it is sometimes put what we think has a prodigiously close connection with what we are the consciousness of having reflected seriously and conclusively on important questions whether social or spiritual augments dignity while it does not lessen humility in this sense taking thought can and does add a cubit to our stature opinions which we may not feel bound or even permitted to press on other people are not the less forces for being latent they shape ideals and it is ideals that inspire conduct they do this though from afar and though he who possesses them may not presume to take the world into his confidence finally unless a man follows out ideas to their full conclusion without fear what the conclusion may be whether he thinks it expedient to make his thought and its goal fully known or not it is impossible that he should acquire a commanding grasp of principles and a commanding grasp of principles whether they are public or not is at the very root of coherency of character it raises mediocrity near to a level with the highest talents if those talents are in company with a disposition that allows the little prudences of the hour incessantly to obscure the persistent laws of things these persistencies if a man has once satisfied himself of their direction and mastered their bearings and application are just as cogent and valuable a guide to conduct whether he publishes them ad urbem et orbem or esteems them too strong meat for people who have through indurated use and wont lost the courage of facing unexpected truths  one conspicuous result of the failure to see that our opinions have roots to them independently of the feelings which either majorities or other portions of the people around us may entertain about them is that neither political matters nor any other serious branches of opinion engage us in their loftiest or most deepreaching forms the advocate of a given theory of government or society is so misled by a wrong understanding of the practice of just and wise compromise in applying it as to forget the noblest and most inspiring shape which his theory can be made to assume it is the worst of political blunders to insist on carrying an ideal set of principles into execution where others have rights of dissent and those others persons whose assent is as indispensable to success as it is impossible to attain but to be afraid or ashamed of holding such an ideal set of principles in ones mind in their highest and most abstract expression does more than any one other cause to stunt or petrify those elements in character to which life should owe most of its savour  if a man happens to be a conservative for instance it is pitiful that he should think so much more of what other people on his side or the other think than of the widest and highest of the ideas on which a conservative philosophy of life and human society reposes such ideas are thesethat the social union is the express creation and ordering of the deity that its movements follow his mysterious and fixed dispensation that the church and the state are convertible terms and each citizen of the latter is an incorporated member of the former that conscience if perversely and misguidedly selfasserting has no rights against the decrees of the conscience of the nation that it is the most detestable of crimes to perturb the pacific order of society either by active agitation or speculative restlessness that descent from a long line of ancestors in great station adds an element of dignity to life and imposes many high obligations we do not say that these and the rest of the propositions which make up the true theoretic basis of a conservative creed are proper for the hustings or expedient in an election address or a speech in parliament we do say that if these high and not unintelligible principles which alone can give to reactionary professions any worth or significance were present in the minds of men who speak reactionary language the country would be spared the ignominy of seeing certain real truths of society degraded at the hands of aristocratic adventurers and plutocratic parasites into some miserable process of dishing whigs  this impoverishment of aims and depravation of principles by the triumph of the political spirit outside of its proper sphere cannot unfortunately be restricted to any one set of people in the state it is something in the very atmosphere which no sanitary cordon can limit liberalism too would be something more generous more attractiveyes and more practically effective if its professors and champions could allow their sense of what is feasible to be refreshed and widened by a more free recognition however private and undemonstrative of the theoretic ideas which give their social creed whatever life and consistency it may have such ideas are these that the conditions of the social union are not a mystery only to be touched by miracle but the results of explicable causes and susceptible of constant modification that the thoughts of wise and patriotic men should be perpetually turned towards the improvement of these conditions in every direction that contented acquiescence in the ordering that has come down to us from the past is selfish and antisocial because amid the ceaseless change that is inevitable in a growing organism the institutions of the past demand progressive readaptations that such improvements are most likely to be secured in the greatest abundance by limiting the sphere of authority extending that of free individuality and steadily striving after the bestowal so far as the nature of things will ever permit it of equality of opportunity that while there is dignity in ancestry a modern society is only safe in proportion as it summons capacity to its public counsels and enterprises that such a society to endure must progress that progress on its political side means more than anything else the substitution of justice as a governing idea instead of privilege and that the best guarantee for justice in public dealings is the participation in their own government of the people most likely to suffer from injustice this is not an exhaustive account of the progressive doctrine and we have here nothing to say as to its soundness we only submit that if those who use the watchwords of liberalism were to return upon its principles instead of dwelling exclusively on practical compromises the tone of public life would be immeasurably raised the cause of social improvement would be less systematically balked of the victories that are best worth gaining progress would mean something more than mere entrances and exits on the theatre of office we should not see in the mass of parliamentary candidatesand they are important people because nearly every englishman with any ambition is a parliamentary candidate actual or potentialthat grave anxiety that sober rigour that immense caution which are all so really laughable because so many of those men are only anxious lest they should make a mistake in finding out what the majority of their constituents would like them to think only rigorous against those who are indiscreet enough to press a principle against the beck of a whip or a wirepuller and only very cautious not so much lest their opinion should be wrong as lest it should not pay   indolence and timidity have united to popularise among us a flaccid latitudinarianism which thinks itself a benign tolerance for the opinions of others it is in truth only a pretentious form of being without settled opinions of our own and without any desire to settle them no one can complain of the want of speculative activity at the present time in a certain way the air at a certain social elevation is as full as it has ever been of ideas theories problems possible solutions suggested questions and proffered answers but then they are at large without cohesion and very apt to be the objects even in the more instructed minds of not much more than dilettante interest we see in solution an immense number of notions which people think it quite unnecessary to precipitate in the form of convictions we constantly hear the age lauded for its tolerance for its candour for its openness of mind for the readiness with which a hearing is given to ideas that forty years ago or even less than that would have excluded persons suspected of holding them from decent society and in fact did so exclude them before however we congratulate ourselves too warmly on this let us be quite sure that we are not mistaking for tolerance what is really nothing more creditable than indifference these two attitudes of mind which are so vitally unlike in their real quality are so hard to distinguish in their outer seeming  one is led to suspect that carelessness is the right name for what looks like reasoned toleration by such a line of consideration as the following it is justly said that at the bottom of all the great discussions of modern society lie the two momentous questions first whether there is a god and second whether the soul is immortal in other words whether our fellowcreatures are the highest beings who take an interest in us or in whom we need take an interest and then whether life in this world is the only life of which we shall ever be conscious it is true of most people that when they are talking of evolution and the origin of species and the experiential or intuitional source of ideas and the utilitarian or transcendental basis of moral obligation these are the questions which they really have in their minds now in spite of the scientific activity of the day nobody is likely to contend that men are pressed keenly in their souls by any poignant stress of spiritual tribulation in the face of the two supreme enigmas nobody will say that there is much of that striving and wrestling and bitter agonising which whole societies of men have felt before now on questions of far less tremendous import ours as has been truly said is a time of loud disputes and weak convictions in a generation deeply impressed by a sense of intellectual responsibility this could not be as it is even superior men are better pleased to play about the height of these great arguments to fly in busy intellectual sport from side to side from aspect to aspect than they are intent on resolving what it is after all that the discussion comes to and to which solution when everything has been said and heard the balance of truth really to incline there are too many giggling epigrams people are too willing to look on collections of mutually hostile opinions with the same kind of curiosity which they bestow on a collection of mutually hostile beasts in a menagerie they have very faint predilections for one rather than another if they were truly alive to the duty of conclusiveness or to the inexpressible magnitude of the subjects which nominally occupy their minds but really only exercise their tongues this elegant pyrrhonism would be impossible and this lighthearted neutrality most unendurable  well has the illustrious pascal said with reference to one of the two great issues of the modern controversythe immortality of the soul is a thing that concerns us so closely and touches us so profoundly that one must have lost all feeling to be indifferent as to knowing how the matter is all our actions and all our thoughts must follow such different paths according as there are eternal goods to hope for or are not that it is impossible to take a step with sense and judgment without regulating it in view of this point which ought to be our first object i can have nothing but compassion for those who groan and travail in this doubt with all sincerity who look on it as the worst of misfortunes and who sparing no pains to escape from it make of this search their chief and most serious employment but he who doubts and searches not is at the same time a grievous wrongdoer and a grievously unfortunate man if along with this he is tranquil and selfsatisfied if he publishes his contentment to the world and plumes himself upon it and if it is this very state of doubt which he makes the subject of his joy and vanityi have no terms in which to describe so extravagant a creature15 who except a member of the school of extravagant creatures themselves would deny that pascals irritation is most wholesome and righteous  perhaps in reply to this we may be confronted by our own doctrine of intellectual responsibility interpreted in a directly opposite sense we may be reminded of the long array of difficulties that interfere between us and knowledge in that tremendous matter and of objections that rise in such perplexing force to an answer either one way or the other and finally we may be despatched with a eulogy of caution and a censure of too great heat after certainty the answer is that there is a kind of doubt not without search but after and at the end of search which is not open to pascals just reproaches against the more ignoble and frivolous kind and this too has been described for us by a subtle doctor of pascals communion are there pleasures of doubt as well as of inference and assent in one sense there are not indeed if doubt means ignorance uncertainty or hopeless suspense but there is a certain grave acquiescence in ignorance a recognition of our impotence to solve momentous and urgent questions which has a satisfaction of its own after high aspirations after renewed endeavours after bootless toil after long wanderings after hope effort weariness failure painfully alternating and recurring it is an immense relief to the exhausted mind to be able to say at length i know that i can know nothing about anything  ignorance remains the evil which it ever was but something of the peace of certitude is gained in knowing the worst and in having reconciled the mind to the endurance of it16 precisely and what one would say of our own age is that it will not deliberately face this knowledge of the worst so it misses the peace of certitude and not only its peace but the strength and coherency that follow strict acceptance of the worst when the worst is after all the best within reach  those who are in earnest when they blame too great haste after certainty do in reality mean us to embrace certainty but in favour of the vulgar opinions they only see the prodigious difficulties of the controversy when you do not incline to their own side in it they only panegyrise caution and the strictly provisional when they suspect that intrepidity and love of the conclusive would lead them to unwelcome shores these persons however whether fortunately or unfortunately have no longer much influence over the most active part of the national intelligence whether permanently or not resolute orthodoxy however prosperous it may seem among many of the uncultivated rich has lost its hold upon thought for thought has become dispersive and the centrifugal forces of the human mind among those who think seriously have for the time become dominant and supreme no one i suppose imagines that the singular ecclesiastical revival which is now going on is accompanied by any revival of real and reasoned belief or that the opulent manufacturers who subscribe so generously for restored cathedral fabrics and the like have been moved by the apologetics of aids to faith and the christian evidence society  obviously only three ways of dealing with the great problems of which we have spoken are compatible with a strong and wellbottomed character we may affirm that there is a deity with definable attributes and that there is a conscious state and continued personality after the dissolution of the body or we may deny or we may assure ourselves that we have no faculties enabling us on good evidence either to deny or affirm intellectual selfrespect and all the qualities that are derived from that may well go with any one of these three courses decisively followed and consistently applied in framing a rule of life and a settled scheme of its aims and motives why do we say that intellectual selfrespect is not vigorous nor the sense of intellectual responsibility and truthfulness and coherency quick and wakeful among us because so many people even among those who might be expected to know better insist on the futile attempt to reconcile all those courses instead of fixing on one and steadily abiding in it they speak as if they affirmed and they act as if they denied and in their hearts they cherish a slovenly sort of suspicion that we can neither deny nor affirm it may be said that this comes to much the same thing as if they had formally decided in the last or neutral sense it is not so this illegitimate union of three contradictories fritters character away breaks it up into discordant parts and dissolves into mercurial fluidity that leavening sincerity and free and cheerful boldness which come of harmonious principles of faith and action and without which men can never walk as confident lovers of justice and truth   ambroses famous saying that it hath not pleased the lord to give his people salvation in dialectic has a profound meaning far beyond its application to theology it is deeply true that our ruling convictions are less the product of ratiocination than of sympathy imagination usage tradition but from this it does not follow that the reasoning faculties are to be further discouraged on the contrary just because the other elements are so strong that they can be trusted to take care of themselves it is expedient to give special countenance to the intellectual habits which alone can check and rectify the constantly aberrating tendencies of sentiment on the one side and custom on the other this remark brings us to another type of whom it is not irrelevant to speak shortly in this place the consequences of the strength of the political spirit are not all direct nor does its strength by any means spring solely from its indulgence to the less respectable elements of character such as languor extreme pliableness superficiality on the contrary it has an indirect influence in removing the only effective restraint on the excesses of some qualities which when duly directed and limited are among the most precious parts of our mental constitution the political spirit is the great force in throwing love of truth and accurate reasoning into a secondary place the evil does not stop here this achievement has indirectly countenanced the postponement of intellectual methods and the diminution of the sense of intellectual responsibility by a school that is anything rather than political  theology has borrowed and coloured for her own use the principles which were first brought into vogue in politics if in the one field it is the fashion to consider convenience first and truth second in the other there is a corresponding fashion of placing truth second and emotional comfort first if there are some who compromise their real opinions or the chance of reaching truth for the sake of gain there are far more who shrink from giving their intelligence free play for the sake of keeping undisturbed certain luxurious spiritual sensibilities this choice of emotional gratification before truth and upright dealing with ones own understanding creates a character that is certainly far less unlovely than those who sacrifice their intellectual integrity to more material convenience the moral flaw is less palpable and less gross yet here too there is the stain of intellectual improbity and it is perhaps all the more mischievous for being partly hidden under the mien of spiritual exaltation  there is in literature no more seductive illustration of this seductive type than rousseaus renowned character of the savoyard vicarpenetrated with scepticism as to the attributes of the deity the meaning of the holy rites the authenticity of the sacred documents yet full of reverence and ever respecting in silence what he could neither reject nor understand the essential worship he says is the worship of the heart god never rejects this homage under whatever form it be offered to him in old days i used to say mass with the levity which in time infects even the gravest things when we do them too often since acquiring my new principles of reverential scepticism i celebrate it with more veneration i am overcome by the majesty of the supreme being by his presence by the insufficiency of the human mind which conceives so ill what pertains to its author when i approach the moment of consecration i collect myself for performing the act with all the feelings required by the church and the majesty of the sacrament i strive to annihilate my reason before the supreme intelligence saying who art thou that thou shouldst measure infinite power17  the savoyard vicar is not imaginary the acquiescence in indefinite ideas for the sake of comforted emotions and the abnegation of strong convictions in order to make room for free and plenteous effusion have for us all the marks of a too familiar reality such a doctrine is an everyday plea for selfdeception and a current justification for illusion even among some of the finer spirits they have persuaded themselves not only that the life of the religious emotions is the highest life but that it is independent of the intellectual forms with which history happens to have associated it and so they refine and sophisticate and make havoc with plain and honest interpretation in order to preserve a soft serenity of soul unperturbed  now we are not at all concerned to dispute such positions as that feeling is the right startingpoint of moral education that in forming character appeal should be to the heart rather than to the understanding that the only basis on which our faculties can be harmoniously ordered is the preponderance of affection over reason these propositions open much grave and complex discussion and they are not to our present purpose we only desire to state the evil of the notion that a man is warranted in comforting himself with dogmas and formularies which he has first to empty of all definite precise and clearly determinable significance before he can get them out of the way of his religious sensibilities whether reason or affection is to have the empire in the society of the future when reason may possibly have no more to discover for us in the region of morals and religion and so will have become emeritus and taken a lower place as of a tutor whose services the human family being now grown up no longer requireshowever this may be it is at least certain that in the meantime the spiritual life of man needs direction quite as much as it needs impulse and light quite as much as force this direction and light can only be safely procured by the free and vigorous use of the intelligence but the intelligence is not free in the presence of a mortal fear lest its conclusions should trouble soft tranquillity of spirit there is always hope of a man so long as he dwells in the region of the direct categorical proposition and the unambiguous term so long as he does not deny the rightly drawn conclusion after accepting the major and minor premisses this may seem a scanty virtue and very easy grace yet experience shows it to be too hard of attainment for those who tamper with disinterestedness of conviction for the sake of luxuriating in the softness of spiritual transport without interruption from a syllogism it is true that there are now and then in life as in history noble and fair natures that by the silent teaching and unconscious example of their inborn purity starlike constancy and great devotion do carry the world about them to further heights of living than can be attained by ratiocination but these the blameless and loved saints of the earth rise too rarely on our dull horizons to make a rule for the world the law of things is that they who tamper with veracity from whatever motive are tampering with the vital force of human progress our comfort and the delight of the religious imagination are no better than forms of selfindulgence when they are secured at the cost of that love of truth on which more than on anything else the increase of light and happiness among men must depend we have to fight and do lifelong battle against the forces of darkness and anything that turns the edge of reason blunts the surest and most potent of our weapons  footnotes  footnote 13 burtons lift of hume ii 186188  footnote 14

main field of discussion touching compromise in expression and avowal lies in the region of religious belief in politics no one seriously contends that respect for the feelings and prejudices of other people requires us to be silent about our opinions a republican for instance is at perfect liberty to declare himself so nobody will say that he is not within his rights if he should think it worth while to practise this liberty though of course he will have to face the obloquy which attends all opinion that is not shared by the more demonstrative and vocal portions of the public it is true that in every stable society a general conviction prevails of the extreme undesirableness of constantly laying bare the foundations of government incessant discussion of the theoretical bases of the social union is naturally considered worse than idle it is felt by many wise men that the chief business of the political thinker is to interest himself in generalisations of such a sort as leads with tolerable straightness to practical improvements of a farreaching and durable kind even among those however who thus feel it not to be worth while to be for ever handling the abstract principles which are after all only clumsy expressions of the real conditions that bring and keep men together in society yet nobody of any consideration pretends to silence or limit the free discussion of these principles although a man is not likely to be thanked who calls attention to the vast discrepancies between the theory and practice of the constitution yet nobody now would countenance the notion of an inner doctrine in politics we smile at the line that hume took in speaking of the doctrine of nonresistance he did not deny that the right of resistance to a tyrannical sovereign does actually belong to a nation but he said if ever on any occasion it were laudable to conceal truth from the populace it must be confessed that the doctrine of resistance affords such an example and that all speculative reasoners ought to observe with regard to this principle the same cautious silence which the laws in every species of government have ever prescribed to themselves as if the cautious silence of the political writer could prevent a populace from feeling the heaviness of an oppressors hand and striving to find relief from unjust burdens as if any nation endowed with enough of the spirit of independence to assent to the right of resistance when offered to them as a speculative theorem would not infallibly be led by the same spirit to assert the right without the speculative theorem that so acute a head as humes should have failed to perceive these very plain considerations and that he should moreover have perpetrated the absurdity of declaring the right of resistance in the same breath in which he declares the laudableness of keeping it a secret only allows how carefully a man need steer after he has once involved himself in the labyrinths of economy18  in religion the unreasonableness of imposing a similar cautious silence is not yet fully established nor the vicious effects of practising it clearly recognised in these high matters an amount of economy and management is held praiseworthy which in any other subject would be universally condemned as cowardly and ignoble indeed the preliminary stage has scarcely been reachedthe stage in which public opinion grants to every one the unrestricted right of shaping his own beliefs independently of those of the people who surround him any woman for instance suspected of having cast behind her the bible and all practices of devotion and the elementary articles of the common creed would be distrustfully regarded even by those who wink at the same kind of mental boldness in men nay she would be so regarded even by some of the very men who have themselves discarded as superstition what they still wish women to retain for law and gospel so long as any class of adults are effectually discouraged in the free use of their minds upon the most important subjects we are warranted in saying that the era of free thought which naturally precedes the era of free speech is still imperfectly developed  the duties and rights of free speech are by no means identical with those of independent thought one general reason for this is tolerably plain the expression of opinion directly affects other people while its mere formation directly affects no one but ourselves therefore the limits of compromise in expression are less widely and freely placed because the rights and interests of all who may be made listeners to our spoken or written words are immediately concerned in forming opinions a man or woman owes no consideration to any person or persons whatever truth is the single object it is truth that in the forum of conscience claims an undivided allegiance the publication of opinion stands on another footing that is an external act with possible consequences like all other external acts both to the doer and to every one within the sphere of his influence and besides these it has possible consequences to the prosperity of the opinion itself19  a hundred questions of fitness of seasonableness of conflicting expediencies present themselves in this connection and nothing gives more anxiety to a sensible man who holds notions opposed to the current prejudices than to hit the right mark where intellectual integrity and prudence firmness and wise reserve are in exact accord when we come to declaring opinions that are however foolishly and unreasonably associated with pain and even a kind of turpitude in the minds of those who strongly object to them then some of our most powerful sympathies are naturally engaged we wonder whether duty to truth can possibly require us to inflict keen distress on those to whom we are bound by the tenderest and most consecrated ties this is so wholly honourable a sentiment that no one who has not made himself drunk with the thin sour wine of a crude and absolute logic will refuse to consider it before however attempting to illustrate cases of conscience in this order we venture to make a short digression into the region of the matter as distinct from the manner of free speech one or two changes of great importance in the way in which men think about religion bear directly upon the conditions on which they may permit themselves and others to speak about it   the peculiar character of all the best kinds of dissent from the nominal creed of the time makes it rather less difficult for us to try to reconcile unflinching honesty with a just and becoming regard for the feelings of those who have claims upon our forbearance than would have been the case a hundred years ago it is not now with a polite sneer as a high ecclesiastical authority lately admitted still less with a rude buffet or coarse words that christianity is assailed before churchmen congratulate themselves too warmly on this improvement in the nature of the attack perhaps they ought to ask themselves how far it is due to the change in the position of the defending party the truth is that the coarse and realistic criticism of which voltaire was the consummate master has done its work it has driven the defenders of the old faith into the milder and more genial climate of nonnatural interpretations and the historic sense and a certain elastic relativity of dogma the old criticism was victorious but after victory it vanished one reason of this was that the coarse and realistic forms of belief had either vanished before it or else they forsook their ancient pretensions and clothed themselves in more modest robes the consequence of this and of other causes which might be named is that the modern attack while fully as serious and much more radical has a certain gravity decorum and worthiness of form no one of any sense or knowledge now thinks the christian religion had its origin in deliberate imposture the modern freethinker does not attack it he explains it and what is more he explains it by referring its growth to the better and not to the worse part of human nature he traces it to mens cravings for a higher morality he finds its source in their aspirations after nobler expression of that feeling for the incommensurable things which is in truth under so many varieties of inwoven pattern the common universal web of religious faith  the result of this way of looking at a creed which a man no longer accepts is that he is able to speak of it with patience and historic respect he can openly mark his dissent from it without exacerbating the orthodox sentiment by galling pleasantries or bitter animadversion upon details we are now awake to the allimportant truth that belief in this or that detail of superstition is the result of an irrational state of mind and flows logically from superstitious premisses we see that it is to begin at the wrong end to assail the deductions as impossible instead of sedulously building up a state of mind in which their impossibility would become spontaneously visible  besides the great change which such a point of view makes in mens way of speaking of a religion whose dogmas and documents they reject there is this further consideration leaning in the same direction the tendency of modern free thought is more and more visibly towards the extraction of the first and more permanent elements of the old faith to make the purified material of the new when dr congreve met the famous epigram about comtes system being catholicism minus christianity by the reply that it is catholicism plus science he gave an ingenious expression to the direction which is almost necessarily taken by all who attempt in however informal a manner to construct for themselves some working system of faith in place of the faith which science and criticism have sapped in what ultimate form acceptable to great multitudes of men these attempts will at last issue no one can now tell for we like the hebrews of old shall all have to live and die in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and being persuaded of them and embracing them and confessing that we are strangers and pilgrims on the earth meanwhile after the first great glow and passion of the just and necessary revolt of reason against superstition have slowly lost the exciting splendour of the dawn and become diffused in the colourless space of a rather bleak noonday the mind gradually collects again some of the ideas of the old religion of the west and willingly or even joyfully suffers itself to be once more breathed upon by something of its spirit christianity was the last great religious synthesis it is the one nearest to us nothing is more natural than that those who cannot rest content with intellectual analysis while awaiting the advent of the saint paul of the humanitarian faith of the future should gather up provisionally such fragmentary illustrations of this new faith as are to be found in the records of the old whatever form may be ultimately imposed on our vague religious aspirations by some prophet to come who shall unite sublime depth of feeling and lofty purity of life with strong intellectual grasp and the gift of a noble eloquence we may at least be sure of this that it will stand as closely related to christianity as christianity stood closely related to the old judaic dispensation it is commonly assumed that the rejecters of the popular religion stand in face of it as the christians stood in face of the pagan belief and pagan rites in the empire the analogy is inexact the modern denier if he is anything better than that or entertains hopes of a creed to come is nearer to the position of the christianising jew20 science when she has accomplished all her triumphs in her own order will still have to go back when the time comes to assist in the building up of a new creed by which men can live the builders will have to seek material in the purified and sublimated ideas of which the confessions and rites of the christian churches have been the grosser expression just as what was once the new dispensation was preached a judaeos ad judaeos apud judaeos so must the new that is to be find a christian teacher and christian hearers it can hardly be other than an expansion a development a readaptation of all the moral and spiritual truth that lay hidden under the wornout forms it must be such a harmonising of the truth with our intellectual conceptions as shall fit it to be an active guide to conduct in a world where men sit and hear each other groan where but to think is to be full of sorrow it is hard to imagine a time when we shall be indifferent to that sovereign legend of pity we have to incorporate it in some wider gospel of justice and progress  i shall not i hope be suspected of any desire to prophesy too smooth things it is no object of ours to bridge over the gulf between belief in the vulgar theology and disbelief nor for a single moment do we pretend that when all the points of contact between virtuous belief and virtuous disbelief are made the most of that good faith will allow there will not still and after all remain a terrible controversy between those who cling passionately to all the consolations mysteries personalities of the orthodox faith and us who have made up our minds to face the worst and to shape as best we can a life in which the cardinal verities of the common creed shall have no place the future faith like the faith of the past brings not peace but a sword it is a tale not of concord but of households divided against themselves those who are incessantly striving to make the old bottles hold the new wine to reconcile the irreconcilable to bring the bible and the dogmas of the churches to be good friends with history and criticism are prompted by the humanest intention21 one sympathises with this amiable anxiety to soften shocks and break the rudeness of a vital transition in this essay at any rate there is no such attempt we know that it is the son against the father and the motherinlaw against the daughterinlaw no softness of speech will disguise the portentous differences between those who admit a supernatural revelation and those who deny it no charity nor goodwill can narrow the intellectual breach between those who declare that a world without an everpresent creator with intelligible attributes would be to them empty and void and those who insist that none of the attributes of a creator can ever be grasped by the finite intelligence of men22 our object in urging the historic semiconservative and almost sympathetic quality which distinguishes the unbelief of today from the unbelief of a hundred years ago is only to show that the most strenuous and upright of plainspeakers is less likely to shock and wound the lawful sensibilities of devout persons than he would have been so long as unbelief went no further than bitter attack on small details in short all save the purely negative and purely destructive school of freethinkers are now able to deal with the beliefs from which they dissent in a way which makes patient and disinterested controversy not wholly impossible  one more point of much importance ought to be mentioned the belief that heresy is the result of wilful depravity is fast dying out people no longer seriously think that speculative error is bound up with moral iniquity or that mistaken thinking is either the result or the cause of wicked living even the official mouthpieces of established beliefs now usually represent a bad heart as only one among other possible causes of unbelief it divides the curse with ignorance intellectual shallowness the unfortunate influence of plausible heresiarchs and other alternative roots of evil they thus leave a way of escape by which the person who does not share their own convictions may still be credited with a good moral character some persons it is true cannot see how a man who deliberately rejects the roman catholic religion can in the eyes of those who earnestly believe it be other than a rebel against god they assure us that as opinions become better marked and more distinctly connected with action the truth that decided dissent from them implies more or less of a reproach upon those who hold them decidedly becomes so obvious that every one perceives it no doubt a protestant or a sceptic regards the beliefs of a catholic as a reproach upon the believers understanding so the man whose whole faith rests on the miraculous and on acts of special intervention regards the strictly positive and scientific thinker as the dupe of a crude and narrow logic but this now carries with it no implication of moral obliquity de maistres rather grotesque conviction that infidels always die of horrible diseases with special names could now only be held among the very dregs of the ecclesiastical world  nor is it correct to say that when religious differences come to be and are regarded as mere differences of opinion it is because the controversy is really decided in the sceptical sense those who agree with the present writer for example are not sceptics they positively absolutely and without reserve reject as false the whole system of objective propositions which make up the popular belief of the day in one and all of its theological expressions they look upon that system as mischievous in its consequences to society for many reasonsamong others because it tends to divert and misdirect the most energetic faculties of human nature this however does not make them suspect the motives or the habitual morality of those who remain in the creed in which they were nurtured the difference is a difference of opinion as purely as if we refused to accept the undulatory theory of light and we treat it as such then reverse this why is it any more impossible for those who remain in the theological stage who are not in the smallest degree sceptical who in their heart of hearts embrace without a shadow of misgiving all the mysteries of the faith why is it any more impossible for them than for us whose convictions are as strong as theirs to treat the most radical dissidence as that and nothing other or worse logically it perhaps might not be hard to convict them of inconsistency but then as has been so often said inconsistency is a totally different thing from insincerity or doubting adherence or silent scepticism the beliefs of an ordinary man are a complex structure of very subtle materials all compacted into a whole not by logic but by lack of logic not by syllogism or sorites but by the vague  as a plain matter of fact and observation we may all perceive that dissent from religious opinion less and less implies reproach in any serious sense we all of us know in the flesh liberal catholics and latitudinarian protestants who hold the very considerable number of beliefs that remain to them quite as firmly and undoubtingly as believers who are neither liberal nor latitudinarian the compatibility of error in faith with virtue in conduct is to them only a mystery the more a branch of the insoluble problem of evil permitted by a being at once allpowerful and allbenevolent stringent logic may make short work of either facta benevolent author of evil or a virtuous despiser of divine truth but in an atmosphere of mystery logical contradictions melt away faith gives a sanction to that tolerant and charitable judgment of the character of heretics which has its real springs partly in common human sympathy whereby we are all bound to one another and partly in experience which teaches us that practical righteousness and speculative orthodoxy do not always have their roots in the same soil the world is every day growing larger the range of the facts of the human race is being enormously extended by naturalists by historians by philologists by travellers by critics the manifold past experiences of humanity are daily opening out to us in vaster and at the same time more ordered proportions and so even those who hold fast to christianity as the noblest strongest and only final conclusion of these experiences are yet constrained to admit that it is no more than a single term in a very long and intricate series   the object of the foregoing digression is to show some cause for thinking that dissent from the current beliefs is less and less likely to inflict upon those who retain them any very intolerable kind or degree of mental pain therefore it is in so far all the plainer as well as easier a duty not to conceal such dissent what we have been saying comes to this if a believer finds that his son for instance has ceased to believe he no longer has this disbelief thrust upon him in gross and irreverent forms nor does he any longer suppose that the unbelieving son must necessarily be a profligate and moreover in ninetynine cases out of a hundred he no longer supposes that infidels of his own family or acquaintance at any rate will consume for eternal ages in lakes of burning marl  let us add another consideration one reason why so many persons are really shocked and pained by the avowal of heretical opinions is the very fact that such avowal is uncommon if unbelievers and doubters were more courageous believers would be less timorous it is because they live in an enervating fools paradise of seeming assent and conformity that the breath of an honest and outspoken word strikes so eager and nipping on their sensibilities if they were not encouraged to suppose that all the world is of their own mind if they were forced out of that atmosphere of selfindulgent silences and hypocritical reserves which is systematically poured round them they would acquire a robuster mental habit they would learn to take dissents for what they are worth they would be led either to strengthen or to discard their own opinions if the dissents happened to be weighty or instructive either to refute or neglect such dissents as should be illfounded or insignificant they will remain valetudinarians so long as a curtain of compromise shelters them from the real belief of those of their neighbours who have ventured to use their minds with some measure of independence a very brief contact with people who when the occasion comes do not shrink from saying what they think is enough to modify that excessive liability to be shocked at truthspeaking which is only so common because truthspeaking itself is so unfamiliar  now however great the pain inflicted by the avowal of unbelief it seems to the present writer that one relationship in life and one only justifies us in being silent where otherwise it would be right to speak this relationship is that between child and parents those parents are wisest who train their sons and daughters in the utmost liberty both of thought and speech who do not instill dogmas into them but inculcate upon them the sovereign importance of correct ways of forming opinions who while never dissembling the great fact that if one opinion is true its contradictory cannot be true also but must be a lie and must partake of all the evil qualities of a lie yet always set them the example of listening to unwelcome opinions with patience and candour still all parents are not wise they cannot all endure to hear of any religious opinions except their own where it would give them sincere and deep pain to hear a son or daughter avow disbelief in the inspiration of the bible and so forth then it seems that the younger person is warranted in refraining from saying that he or she does not accept such and such doctrines this of course only where the son or daughter feels a tender and genuine attachment to the parent where the parent has not earned this attachment has been selfish indifferent or cruel the title to the special kind of forbearance of which we are speaking can hardly exist in an ordinary way however a parent has a claim on us which no other person in the world can have and a mans selfrespect ought scarcely to be injured if he finds himself shrinking from playing the apostle to his own father and mother  one can indeed imagine circumstances where this would not be true if you are persuaded that you have had revealed to you a glorious gospel of light and blessedness it is impossible not to thirst to impart such tidings most eagerly to those who are closest about your heart we are not in that position we have as yet no magnificent vision so definite so touching so clothed with the beauty of a thousand stars as to make us eager for the sake of it to murder all the sweetnesses of filial piety in an aggressive eristic this much one concedes yet let us ever remember that those elders are of nobler type who have kept their minds in a generous freedom and have made themselves strong with that magnanimous confidence in truth which the hebrew expressed in old phrase that if counsel or work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it  even in the case of parents and even though our new creed is but rudimentary there can be no good reason why we should go further in the way of economy than mere silence neither they nor any other human being can possibly have a right to expect us not merely to abstain from the open expression of dissents but positively to profess unreal and feigned assents no fear of giving pain no wish to soothe the alarms of those to whom we owe much no respect for the natural clinging of the old to the faith which has accompanied them through honourable lives can warrant us in saying that we believe to be true what we are convinced is false the most lax moralist counts a lie wrong even when the motive is unselfish and springs from the desire to give pleasure to those whom it is our duty to please a deliberate lie avowedly does not cease to be one because it concerns spiritual things nor is it the less wrong because it is uttered by one to whom all spiritual things have become indifferent filial affection is a motive which would if any motive could remove some of the taint of meanness with which pious lying like every other kind of lying tends to infect character the motive may no doubt ennoble the act though the act remains in the category of forbidden things but the motive of these complaisant assents and false affirmations taken at their very best is still comparatively a poor motive no real elevation of spirit is possible for a man who is willing to subordinate his convictions to his domestic affections and to bring himself to a habit of viewing falsehood lightly lest the truth should shock the illegitimate and overexacting sensibilities either of his parents or any one else we may understand what is meant by the logic of the feelings and accept it as the proper corrective for a too intense egoism but when the logic of the feelings is invoked to substitute the egoism of the family for the slightly narrower egoism of the individual it can hardly be more than a fine name for selfindulgence and a callous indifference to all the largest human interests   this brings us to consider the case of another no less momentous relationship and the kind of compromise in the matter of religious conformity which it justifies or imposes it constantly happens that the husband has wholly ceased to believe the religion to which his wife clings with unshaken faith we need not enter into the causes why women remain in bondage to opinions which so many cultivated men either reject or else hold in a transcendental and nonnatural sense the only question with which we are concerned is the amount of free assertion of his own convictions which a man should claim and practise when he knows that such convictions are distasteful to his wife is it lawful as it seems to be in dealing with parents to hold his conviction silently is it lawful either positively or by implication to lead his wife to suppose that he shares her opinions when in truth he rejects them  if it were not for the maxims and practice in daily use among men otherwise honourable one would not suppose it possible that two answers could be given to these questions by any one with the smallest pretence of principle or selfrespect as it is we all of us know men who deliberately reject the entire christian system and still think it compatible with uprightness to summon their whole establishments round them at morning and evening and on their knees to offer up elaborately formulated prayers which have just as much meaning to them as the entrails of the sacrificial victim had to an infidel haruspex we see the same men diligently attending religious services uttering assents to confessions of which they really reject every syllable kneeling rising bowing with deceptive solemnity even partaking of the sacrament with a consummate devoutness that is very edifying to all who are not in the secret and who do not know that they are acting a part and making a mock both of their own reason and their own probity merely to please persons whose delusions they pity and despise from the bottom of their hearts  on the surface there is certainly nothing to distinguish this kind of conduct from the grossest hypocrisy is there anything under the surface to relieve it from this complexion is there any weight in the sort of answer which such men make to the accusation that their conformity is a very degrading form of deceit and a singularly mischievous kind of treachery is the plea of a wish to spare mental discomfort to others an admissible and valid plea it seems to us to be none of these things and for the following among other reasons  if a man drew his wife by lot or by any other method over which neither he nor she has any control as in the case of parents perhaps he might with some plausibleness contend that he owed her certain limited deferences and reserves just as we admit that he may owe them to his parents but this is not the case marriage in this country at least is the result of mutual choice if men and women do as a matter of fact usually make this choice hastily and on wofully imperfect information of one anothers characters that is no warrant for a resort to unlawful expedients to remedy the blunder if a woman cares ardently enough about religion to feel keen distress at the idea of dissent from it on the part of those closely connected with her she surely may be expected to take reasonable pains to ascertain beforehand the religious attitude of one with whom she is about to unite herself for life on the other hand if a man sets any value on his own opinions if they are in any real sense a part of himself he must be guilty of something like deliberate and systematic duplicity during the acquaintance preceding marriage if his dissent has remained unsuspected certainly if men go through society before marriage under false colours and feign beliefs which they do not hold they have only themselves to thank for the degradation of having to keep up the imposture afterwards suppose a protestant were to pass himself off for a catholic because he happened to meet a catholic lady whom he desired to marry everybody would agree in calling such a man by a very harsh name it is hard to see why a freethinker who by reticence and conformity passes himself off for a believer should be more leniently judged the differences between a catholic and a protestant are assuredly not any greater than those between a believer and an unbeliever we all admit the baseness of dissimulation in the former case why is it any less base in the latter  marriages however are often made in haste or heedlessly or early in life before either man or woman has come to feel very deeply about religion either one way or another the woman does not know how much she will need religion nor what comfort it may bring to her the man does not know all the objections to it which may disclose themselves to his understanding as the years ripen there is always at work that most unfortunate maxim tacitly held and acted upon in ninetynine marriages out of a hundred that money is of importance and social position is of importance and good connections are of importance and health and manners and comely looks and that the only thing which is of no importance whatever is opinion and intellectual quality and temper now granting that both man and woman are indifferent at the time of their union is that any reason why upon either of them acquiring serious convictions the other should be expected out of mere complaisance to make a false and hypocritical pretence of sharing them to see how flimsy is this plea of fearing to give pain to the religious sensitiveness of women we have only to imagine one or two cases which go beyond the common experience yet which ought not to strain the plea if it be valid  thus if my wife turns catholic am i to pretend to turn catholic too to save her the horrible distress of thinking that i am doomed to eternal perdition or if she chooses to embrace the doctrine of direct illumination from heaven and to hear voices bidding her to go or come to do or abstain from doing am i too to shape my conduct after these fancied monitions or if it comes into her mind to serve tables and to listen in all faith to the miracles of spiritualism am i lest i should pain her to feign a surrender of all my notions of evidence to pretend a transformation of all my ideas of worthiness in life and beyond life and to go to séances with the same regularity and seriousness with which you go to church of course in each of these cases everybody who does not happen to share the given peculiarity of belief will agree that however severely a husbands dissent might pain the wife whatever distress and discomfort it might inflict upon her yet he would be bound to let her suffer rather than sacrifice his veracity and selfrespect why then is it any less discreditable to practise an insincere conformity in more ordinary circumstances if the principle of such conformity is good for anything at all it ought to cover these less usual cases as completely as the others which are more usual indeed there would be more to be said on behalf of conformity for politeness sake where the woman had gone through some great process of change for then one might suppose that her heart was deeply set on the matter even then the plea would be worthless but it is more indisputably worthless still where the sentiment which we are bidden to respect at the cost of our own freedom of speech is nothing more laudable than a fear of moving out of the common groove of religious opinion or an intolerant and unreasoned bigotry or mere stupidity and silliness of the vulgarest type23  ah it is said you forget that women cannot live without religion the present writer is equally of this opinion that women cannot be happy without a religion nor men either that is not the question it does not follow because a woman cannot be happy without a religion that therefore she cannot be happy unless her husband is of the same religion still less that she would be made happy by his insincerely pretending to be of the same religion and least of all is it true if both these propositions were credible that even then for the sake of her happiness he is bound not merely to live a life of imposture but in so doing to augment the general forces of imposture in the world and to make the chances of truth light and human improvement more and more unfavourable women are at present far less likely than men to possess a sound intelligence and a habit of correct judgment they will remain so while they have less ready access than men to the best kinds of literary and scientific training andwhat is far more importantwhile social arrangements exclude them from all those kinds of public activity which are such powerful agents both in fitting men to judge soundly and in forming in them the sense of responsibility for their judgments being sound  it may be contended that this alleged stronger religiosity of women however coarse and poor in its formulae is yet of constant value as a protest in favour of the maintenance of the religious element in human character and life and that this is a far more important thing for us all than the greater or less truth of the dogmas with which such religiosity happens to be associated in reply to this without tediously labouring the argument i venture to make the following observations in the first place it is an untenable idea that religiosity or devoutness of spirit is valuable in itself without reference to the goodness or badness of the dogmatic forms and the practices in which it clothes itself a fakir would hardly be an estimable figure in our society merely because his way of living happens to be a manifestation of the religious spirit if the religious spirit leads to a worthy and beautiful life if it shows itself in cheerfulness in pity in charity and tolerance in forgiveness in a sense of the largeness and the mystery of things in a lifting up of the soul in gratitude and awe to some supreme power and sovereign force then whatever drawback there may be in the way of superstitious dogma still such a spirit is on the whole a good thing if not not it would be better without the superstition even with the superstition it is good but if the religious spirit is only a fine name for narrowness of understanding for stubborn intolerance for mere social formality for a dread of losing that poor respectability which means thinking and doing exactly as the people around us think and do then the religious spirit is not a good thing but a thoroughly bad and hateful thing to that we owe no management of any kind any one who suppresses his real opinions and feigns others out of deference to such a spirit as this in his household ought to say plainly both to himself and to us that he cares more for his own ease and undisturbed comfort than he cares for truth and uprightness for it is that and not any tenderness for holy things which is the real ground of his hypocrisy  now with reference to the religious spirit in its nobler form it is difficult to believe that any one genuinely animated by it would be soothed by the knowledge that her dearest companion is going through life with a mask on quietly playing a part uttering untrue professions doing his best to cheat her and the rest of the world by a monstrous spiritual makebelieve one would suppose that instead of having her religious feeling gratified by conformity on these terms nothing could wound it so bitterly nor outrage it so unpardonably to know that her sensibility is destroying the entireness of the mans nature its loyalty alike to herself and to truth its freedom and singleness and couragesurely this can hardly be less distressing to a fine spirit than the suspicion that his heresies may bring him to the pit or than the void of going through life without even the semblance of religious sympathy between them if it be urged that the woman would never discover the piety of the man to be a counterfeit we reply that unless her own piety were of the merely formal kind she would be sure to make the discovery the congregation in the old story were untouched by the disguised devils eloquence on behalf of religion it lacked unction the verbal conformity of the unbeliever lacks unction and its hollowness is speedily revealed to the quick apprehension of true faith24  let us not be supposed to be arguing in favour of incessant battle of high dialectic in the household nothing could be more destructive of the gracious composure and mental harmony of which household life ought to be but perhaps seldom is the great organ and instrument still less are we pleading for the freethinkers right at every hour of day or night to mock sneer and gibe at the sincere beliefs and conscientiously performed rites of those whether men or women whether strangers or kinsfolk from whose religion he disagrees it is not ancient impressions only said pascal which are capable of abusing us the charm of novelty has the same power the prate of newborn scepticism may be as tiresome and as odious as the cant of gray orthodoxy religious discussion is not to be foisted upon us at every turn either by defenders or assailants all we plead for is that when the opportunity meets the freethinker full in front he is called upon to speak as freely as he thinks not more than this a plain man has no trouble in acquiring this tact of reasonableness we may all write what we please because it is in the discretion of the rest of the world whether they will hearken or not but in the family this is not so if a man systematically intrudes disrespectful and unwelcome criticism upon a woman who retains the ancient belief he is only showing that freethinker may be no more than bigot differently writ it ought to be essential to no ones selfrespect that he cannot consent to live with people who do not think as he thinks we may be sure that there is something shallow and convulsive about the beliefs of a man who cannot allow his housemates to possess their own beliefs in peace  on the other hand it is essential to the selfrespect of every one with the least love of truth that he should be free to express his opinions on every occasion where silence would be taken for an assent which he does not really give still more unquestionably he should be free from any obligation to forswear himself either directly as by false professions or by implication as when he attend services public or private which are to him the symbol of superstition and mere spiritual phantasmagoria the vindication of this simple right of living ones life honestly can hardly demand any heroic virtue a little of the straightforwardness which men are accustomed to call manly is the only quality that is needed a little of that frank courage and determination in spiritual things which men are usually so ready to practise towards their wives in temporal things it must be a keen delight to a cynic to see a man who owns that he cannot bear to pain his wife by not going to church and saying prayers yet insisting on having his own way fearlessly thwarting her wishes and contradicting her opinions in every other detail small and great of the domestic economy  the truth of the matter is that the painful element in companionship is not difference of opinion but discord of temperament the important thing is not that two people should be inspired by the same convictions but rather that each of them should hold his and her own convictions in a high and worthy spirit harmony of aim not identity of conclusion is the secret of the sympathetic life to stand on the same moral plane and that if possible a high one to find satisfaction in different explanations of the purpose and significance of life and the universe and yet the same satisfaction it is certainly not less possible to disbelieve religiously than to believe religiously this accord of mind this emulation in freedom and loftiness of soul this kindred sense of the awful depth of the enigma which the one believes to be answered and the other suspects to be for ever unanswerablehere and not in a degrading and hypocritical conformity is the true gratification of those spiritual sensibilities which are alleged to be so much higher in women than in men where such an accord exists there may still be solicitude left in the mind of either at the superstition or the incredulity of the other but it will be solicitude of that magnanimous sort which is in some shape or other the inevitable and not unfruitful portion of every better nature  if there are women who petulantly or sourly insist on more than this kind of harmony it is probable that their system of divinity is little better than a special manifestation of shrewishness the man is as much bound to resist that as he is bound to resist extravagance in spending money or any other vice of character if he does not resist it if he suppresses his opinions and practices a hypocritical conformity it must be from weakness of will and principle against this we have nothing to say a considerable proportion of people men no less than women are born invertebrate and they must got on as they best can but let us at least bargain that they shall not erect the maxims of their own feebleness into a rule for those who are braver and of stronger principle than themselves and do not let the accidental exigencies of a personal mistake be made the foundation of a general doctrine it is a poor saying that the world is to become void of spiritual sincerity because xanthippe has a turn for respectable theology   one or two words should perhaps be said in this place as to conformity to common religious belief in the education of children where the parents differ the one being an unbeliever the other a believer it is almost impossible for anybody to lay down a general rule the present writer certainly has no ambition to attempt the thorny task of compiling a manual for mixed marriages it is perhaps enough to say that all would depend upon the nature of the beliefs which the religious person wished to inculcate considering that the woman has an absolutely equal moral right with the man to decide in what faith the child shall be brought up and considering how important it is that the mother should take an active part in the development of the childs affections and impulses the most resolute of deniers may perhaps think that the advantages of leaving the matter to her outweigh the disadvantages of having a superstitious bias given to the young mind in these complex cases an honest and fairminded mans own instincts are more likely to lead him right than any hard and fast rule two reserves in assenting to the wifes control of early teaching will probably suggest themselves to everybody who is in earnest about religion first if the theology which the woman desires to instill contains any of those wicked and depraving doctrines which neither catholicism nor calvinism is without in the hands of some professors the husband is as much justified in pressing his legal rights over the child to the uttermost as he would be if the proposed religion demanded physical mutilation secondly he will not himself take part in baptismal or other ceremonies which are to him no better than mere mummeries nor will he ever do anything to lead his children at any age to suppose that he believes what he does not believe such limitations as these are commanded by all considerations alike of morality and good sense  to turn to the more normal case where either the man has had the wise forethought not to yoke himself unequally with a person of ardent belief which he does not share or where both parents dissent from the popular creed here whatever difficulties may attend its application the principle is surely as clear as the sun at noonday there can be no good plea for the deliberate and formal inculcation upon the young of a number of propositions which you believe to be false to do this is to sow tares not in your enemys field but in the very ground which is most precious of all others to you and most full of hope for the future to allow it to be done merely that children may grow up in the stereotyped mould is simply to perpetuate in new generations the present thicksighted and deadheavy state of our spirits it is to do ones best to keep society for an indefinite time sapped by hollow and void professions instead of being nourished by sincerity and wholeheartedness25  nor here more than elsewhere in this chapter are we trying to turn the family into a field of ceaseless polemic no one who knows the stuff of which life is made the pressure of material cares the play of passion the busy energising of the affections the anxieties of health and all the other solicitudes generous or ignoble which naturally absorb the days of the common multitude of menis likely to think such an ideal either desirable or attainable least of all is it desirable to give character a strong set in this polemical direction in its most plastic days the controversial and denying humour is a different thing from the habit of being careful to know what we mean by the words we use and what evidence there is for the beliefs we hold it is possible to foster the latter habit without creating the former and it is possible to bring up the young in dissent from the common beliefs around them or in indifference to them without engendering any of that pride in eccentricity for its own sake which is so little likeable a quality in either young or old there is however little risk of an excess in this direction the young tremble even more than the old at the penalties of nonconformity there is more excuse for them in this such penalties in their case usually come closer and in more stringent forms neither have they had time to find out as their elders have or ought to have found out what a very moderate degree of fortitude enables us to bear up against social disapproval when we know that it is nothing more than the common form of convention  the great object is to keep the minds of the young as open as possible in the matter of religion to breed in them a certain simplicity and freedom from selfconsciousness in finding themselves without the religious beliefs and customs of those around them to make them regard differences in these respects as very natural and ordinary matters susceptible of an easy explanation it is of course inevitable unless they are brought up in cloistered seclusion that they should hear much of the various articles of belief which we are anxious that they should not share they will ask you whether the story of the creation of the universe is true whether such and such miracles really happened whether this person or that actually lived and actually did all that he is said to have done plainly the right course is to tell them without any agitation or excess or vehemence or too much elaboration the simple truth in such matters exactly as it appears to ones own mind there is no reason why they should not know the best parts of the bible as well as they know the iliad or herodotus there are many reasons why they should know them better but one most important condition of this is constantly overlooked by people who like to satisfy their intellectual vanity by scepticism and at the same time to make their comfort safe by external conformity if the bible is to be taught only because it is a noble and most majestic monument of literature it should be taught as that and no more that a man who regards it solely us supreme literature should impress it upon the young as the supernaturally inspired word of god and the accurate record of objective occurrences is a piece of the plainest and most shocking dishonesty let a youth be trained in simple and straightforward recognition of the truth that we can know and can conjecture nothing with any assurance as to the ultimate mysteries of things let his imagination and his sense of awe be fed from those springs which are none the less bounteous because they flow in natural rather than supernatural channels let him be taught the historic place and source of the religions which he is not bound to accept unless the evidence for their authority by and by brings him to another mind a boy or girl trained in this way has an infinitely better chance of growing up with the true spirit and leanings of religion implanted in the character than if they had been educated in formulae which they could not understand by people who do not believe them  the most common illustration of a personal mistake being made the base of a general doctrine is found in the case of those who after committing themselves for life to the profession of a given creed awake to the shocking discovery that the creed has ceased to be true for them the action of a popular modern story mrs gaskells north and south turns upon the case of a clergyman whoso faith is overthrown and who in consequence abandons his calling to his own serious material detriment and under circumstances of severe suffering to his family i am afraid that current opinion especially among the cultivated class would condemn such a sacrifice as a piece of misplaced scrupulosity no man it would be said is called upon to proclaim his opinions when to do so will cost him the means of subsistence this will depend upon the value which he sets upon the opinions that be has to proclaim if such a proposition is true the world must efface its habit of admiration for the martyrs and heroes of the past who embraced violent death rather than defile themselves by a lying confession or is present heroism ridiculous and only past heroism admirable however nobody has a right to demand the heroic from all the world and if to publish his dissent from the opinions which he nominally holds would reduce a man to beggary human charity bids us say as little as may be we may leave such men to their unfortunate destiny hoping that they will make what good use of it may be possible non ragioniam di lor these cases only show the essential and profound immorality of the priestly professionin all its forms and no matter in connection with what church or what dogmawhich makes a mans living depend on his abstaining from using his mind or concealing the conclusions to which use of his mind has brought him the time will come when society will look back on the doctrine that they who serve the altar should live by the altar as a doctrine of barbarism and degradation  but if one by refusing to offer a pinch of incense to the elder gods should thus strip himself of a marked opportunity of exerting an undoubtedly useful influence over public opinion or over a certain section of society is he not justified in compromising to the extent necessary to preserve this influence instead of answering this directly we would make the following remarks first it can seldom be clear in times like our own that religious heterodoxy must involve the loss of influence in other than religious spheres the apprehension that it will do so is due rather to timorousness and a desire to find a fair reason for the comforts of silence and reserve if a teacher has anything to tell the world in science philosophy history the world will not be deterred from listening to him by knowing that he does not walk in the paths of conventional theology second what influence can a man exert that should seem to him more useful than that of a protester against what he counts false opinions in the most decisive and important of all regions of thought surely if any one is persuaded whether rightly or wrongly that his fellows are expending the best part of their imaginations and feelings on a dream and a delusion and that by so doing moreover they are retarding to an indefinite degree the wider spread of light and happiness then nothing that he can tell them about chemistry or psychology or history can in his eyes be comparable in importance to the duty of telling them this there is no advantage nor honest delight in influence if it is only to be exerted in the sphere of secondary objects and at the cost of the objects which ought to be foremost in the eyes of serious people in truth the men who have done most for the world have taken very little heed of influence they have sought light and left their influence to fare as it might list can we not imagine the mingled mystification and disdain with which a spinosa or a descartes a luther or a pascal would have listened to an exhortation in our persuasive modern manner on the niceties of the politic and the social obligation of pious fraud it is not given to many to perform the achievements of such giants as these but every one may help to keep the standard of intellectual honesty at a lofty pitch and what better service can a man render than to furnish the world with an example of faithful dealing with his own conscience and with his fellows this at least is the one talent that is placed in the hands of the obscurest of us all26  and what is this smile of the world to win which we are bidden to sacrifice our moral manhood this frown of the world whose terrors are more awful than the withering up of truth and the slow going out of light within the souls of us consider the triviality of life and conversation and purpose in the bulk of those whose approval is held out for our prize and the mark of our high calling measure if you can the empire over them of prejudice unadulterated by a single element of rationality and weigh if you can the huge burden of custom unrelieved by a single leavening particle of fresh thought ponder the share which selfishness and love of ease have in the vitality and the maintenance of the opinions that we are forbidden to dispute then how pitiful a thing seems the approval or disapproval of these creatures of the conventions of the hour as one figures the merciless vastness of the universe of matter sweeping us headlong through viewless space as one hears the wail of misery that is for ever ascending to the deaf gods as one counts the little tale of the years that separate us from eternal silence in the light of these things a man should surely dare to live his small span of life with little heed of the common speech upon him or his life only caring that his days may be full of reality and his conversation of truthspeaking and wholeness  those who think conformity in the matters of which we have been speaking harmless and unimportant must do so either from indifference or else from despair it is difficult to convince any one who is possessed by either one or other of these two evil spirits men who have once accepted them do not easily relinquish philosophies that relieve their professors from disagreeable obligations of courage and endeavour to the indifferent person one can say nothing we can only acquiesce in that deep and terrible scripture he that is filthy let him be filthy still to those who despair of human improvement or the spread of light in the face of the huge mass of brute prejudice we can only urge that the enormous weight and the firm hold of baseless prejudice and false commonplace are the very reasons which make it so important that those who are not of the night nor of the darkness should the more strenuously insist on living their own lives in the daylight to those finally who do not despair but think that the new faith will come so slowly that it is not worth while for the poor mortal of a day to make himself a martyr we may suggest that the new faith when it comes will be of little worth unless it has been shaped by generations of honest and fearless men and unless it finds in those who are to receive it an honest and fearless temper our plea is not for a life of perverse disputings or busy proselytising but only that we should learn to look at one another with a clear and steadfast eye and march forward along the paths we choose with firm step and erect front the first advance towards either the renovation of one faith or the growth of another must be the abandonment of those habits of hypocritical conformity and compliance which have filled the air of the england of today with gross and obscuring mists  footnotes  footnote 18 it may be said that hume meant no more than this that of two equally oppressed nations the one which had been taught to assent to the doctrine of resistance would be more likely to practise the sacred duty of insurrection than the other from whom the doctrine had been concealed or in other words that the first would rise against oppression when the oppression had reached a pitch which to the second would still seem bearable the answer to humes proposition interpreted in this way would be that if the doctrine of resistance be presented to the populace in its true shapeif it be truth as he admitsthen the application of it in practice should be as little likely to prove mischievous as that of any other truth if the gist of the remark be that this is a truth which the populace is especially likely to apply wrongly in consequence of its ignorance passion and heedlessness we may answer by appealing to history which is rather a record of excessive patience in the various nations of the earth than of excessive petulance  footnote 19 there is another ground for the distinction between the conditions of holding and those of expressing opinion this depends upon the psychological proposition that belief is independent of the will though this or any other state of the understanding may be involuntary the manifestation of such a state is not so but is a voluntary act and being neutral in itself may be commendable or reprehensible according to the circumstances in which it takes place baileys essay on formation of opinion § 7  footnote 20 the following words illustrating the continuity between the christian and jewish churches are not without instruction to those who meditate on the possible continuity between the christian church and that which is one day to grow into the place of itnot only do forms and ordinances remain under the gospel equally as before but what was in use before is not so much superseded by the gospel ordinances as changed into them what took

itself of the old testament as a great gift to christian as well as to jew it does not dispense with it but it dispenses it persons sometimes urge that there is no code of duty in the new testament no ceremonial no rules for church polity certainly not they are unnecessary they are already given in the old why should the old testament remain in the christian church but to be used there we are to look for our forms our rites our polity only illustrated tempered spiritualised by the gospel the preempts remain the observance of them is changeddr jh newman sermon on subjects of the day p 205  footnote 21 there is a set of most acute and searching criticisms on this matter in mr leslie stephens essays on freethinking and plainspeaking longmans 1873 the last essay in the volume an apology for plainspeaking is a decisive and remarkable exposition of the treacherous playing with words which underlies even the most vigorous efforts to make the phrases and formula of the old creed hold the reality of new faith  footnote 22 upon this sentence the following criticism has been madesurely both of these socalled contradictions are deliberately affirmed by the vast majority of all thinkers upon the subject what orthodox asserter of the omnipresence of a creator with intelligible attributes ever maintained that these attributes could be grasped by menthe orthodox asserter no doubt says that he does not maintain that the divine attributes can be grasped by men but his habitual treatment of them as intelligible and as the subjects of propositions made in languages that is designed to be intelligible shows that his first reservation is merely nominal as it is certainly inconsistent with his general position religious people who warn you most solemnly that man who is a worm and the son of a worm cannot possibly compass in his puny understanding the attributes of the divine being will yetas an eminent divine not in holy orders has truly saidtell you all about him as if he were the man who lives in the next street  footnote 23 that able man the late je cairnes suggested the following objection to this paragraph when two persons marry there is a reasonable expectation almost amounting to an understanding that they will both of them adhere to their religion just as both of them tacitly agree to follow the ways of the world in the host of minor social matters if therefore either of them turns to some other creed the person so turning has so to speak broken the contract the utmost he or she can contend for is forbearance if a woman embraces catholicism she may seek tolerance but she has no right to exact conformity if the man becomes an unbeliever he in like manner breaks the bargain and may be justly asked not to flaunt his misdemeanour  my answer to this would turn upon the absolute inexpediency of such silent bargains being assumed by public opinion in the present state of opinion where the whole air is alive with the spirit of change nobody who takes his life or her life seriously could allow an assumption which means reduction of one of the most important parts of character the love of truth to a nullity  footnote 24 the reader remembers how wolmar the atheistic husband of julie in rousseaus new heloïsa is distressed by the chagrin which his unbelief inflicts on the piety of his wife he told me that he had been frequently tempted to make a feint of yielding to her arguments and to pretend for the sake of calming her sentiments that he did not really hold but such baseness of soul is too far from him without for a moment imposing on julie such dissimulation would only have been a new torment to her the good faith the frankness the union of heart that console for so many troubles would have been eclipsed between them was it by lessening his wifes esteem for him that he could reassure her instead of using any disguise he tells her sincerely what he thinks but he says it in so simple a tone etcv v 126  footnote 25 the common reason alleged by freethinkers for having their children brought up in the orthodox ways is that if they were not so brought up they would be looked on as contaminating agents whom other parents would take care to keep away from the companionship of their children this excuse may have had some force at another time at the present day when belief is so weak we doubt whether the young would be excluded from the companionship of their equals in age merely because they had not been trained in some of the conventional shibboleths even if it were so there are certainly some ways of compensating for the disadvantages of exclusion from orthodox circles  i have heard of a more interesting reason namely that the historic position of the young relatively to the time in which they are placed is in some sort falsified unless they have gone through a training in the current beliefs of their age unless they have undergone that they miss as it were some of the normal antecedents i do not think this plea will hold good however desirable it may be that the young should know all sorts of erroneous beliefs and opinions as products of the past it can hardly be in any degree desirable that they should take them for truths if there were no other objection there would be this that the disturbance and waste of force involved in shaking off in their riper years the erroneous opinions which had been instilled into them in childhood would more than counterbalance any advantages whatever their precise nature may be to be derived from having shared in their own proper persons the ungrounded notions of others  footnote 26 miss martineau has an excellent protest against the dereliction of principle shown in supposing that any cause can be of so much importance as fidelity to truth or can be important at all otherwise than in its relation to truth which wants vindicating it reminds me of an incident which happened when i was in america at the time of the severest trials of the abolitionists a pastor from the southern states lamented to a brother clergyman in the north the introduction of the antislavery question because the views of their sect were getting on so well before getting on cried the northern minister what is the use of getting your vessel on when you have thrown both captain and cargo overboard thus what signifies the pursuit of any one reform like those specifiedantislavery and the woman questionwhen the freedom which is the very soul of the controversy the very principle of the movementis mourned over in any other of its many manifestations the only effectual advocates of such reforms as those are people who follow truth wherever it leadsautobiography ii 442     chapter v   the realisation of opinion  a person who takes the trouble to form his own opinions and beliefs will feel that he owes no responsibility to the majority for his conclusions if he is a genuine lover of truth if he is inspired by the divine passion for seeing things as they are and a divine abhorrence of holding ideas which do not conform to the facts he will be wholly independent of the approval or assent of the persons around him when he proceeds to apply his beliefs in the practical conduct of life the position is different there are now good reasons why his attitude should be in some ways less inflexible the society in which he is placed is a very ancient and composite growth the people from whom he dissents have not come by their opinions customs and institutions by a process of mere haphazard these opinions and customs all had their origin in a certain real or supposed fitness they have a certain depth of root in the lives of a proportion of the existing generation their fitness for satisfying human needs may have vanished and their congruity with one another may have come to an end that is only one side of the truth the most zealous propagandism cannot penetrate to them the quality of bearing to be transplanted from one kind of soil and climate to another is not very common and it is far from being inexhaustible even where it exists  in common language we speak of a generation as something possessed of a kind of exact unity with all its parts and members one and homogeneous yet very plainly it is not this it is a whole but a whole in a state of constant flux its factors and elements are eternally shifting it is not one but many generations each of the seven ages of man is neighbour to all the rest the column of the veterans is already staggering over into the last abyss while the column of the newest recruits is forming with all its nameless and uncounted hopes to each its tradition its tendency its possibilities only a proportion of each in one society can have nerve enough to grasp the banner of a new truth and endurance enough to bear it along rugged and untrodden ways  and then as we have said one must remember the stuff of which life is made one must consider what an overwhelming preponderance of the most tenacious energies and most concentrated interests of a society must be absorbed between material cares and the solicitude of the affections it is obviously unreasonable to lose patience and quarrel with ones time because it is tardy in throwing off its institutions and beliefs and slow to achieve the transformation which is the problem in front of it men and women have to live the task for most of them is arduous enough to make them well pleased with even such imperfect shelter as they find in the use and wont of daily existence to insist on a whole community being made at once to submit to the reign of new practices and new ideas which have just begun to commend themselves to the most advanced speculative intelligence of the timethis even if it were a possible process would do much to make life impracticable and to hurry on social dissolution  it cannot be too emphatically asserted as has been said by one of the most influential of modern thinkers that this policy of compromise alike in institutions in actions and in beliefs which especially characterises english life is a policy essential to a society going through the transitions caused by continued growth and development ideas and institutions proper to a past social state but incongruous with the new social state that has grown out of it surviving into this new social state they have made possible and disappearing only as this new social state establishes its own ideas and institutions are necessarily during their survival in conflict with these new ideas and institutionsnecessarily furnish elements of contradiction in mens thoughts and deeds and yet as for the carrying on of social life the old must continue so long as the new is not ready this perpetual compromise is an indispensable accompaniment of a normal development27  yet we must not press this argument and the state of feeling that belongs to it further than they may be fairly made to go the danger in most natures lies on this side for on this side our love of ease works and our prejudices the writer in the passage we have just quoted is describing compromise as a natural state of things the resultant of divergent forces he is not professing to define its conditions or limits as a practical duty nor is there anything in his words or in the doctrine of social evolution of which he is the most elaborate and systematic expounder to favour that deliberate sacrifice of truth either in search or in expression against which our two previous chapters were meant to protest28 when mr spencer talks of a new social state establishing its own ideas of course he means and can only mean that men and women establish their own ideas and to do that it is obvious that they must at one time or another have conceived them without any special friendliness of reference to the old ideas which they were in the fulness of time to supersede still less of course can a new social state ever establish its ideas unless the persons who hold them confess them openly and give to them an honest and effective adherence  every discussion of the more fundamental principles of conduct must contain expressly or by implication some general theory of the nature and constitution of the social union let us state in a few words that which seems to command the greatest amount both of direct and analogical evidence in our time it is perhaps all the more important to discuss our subject with immediate and express reference to this theory because it has become in some minds a plea for a kind of philosophic indifference towards any policy of thorough as well as an excuse for systematic abstention from vigorous and downright courses of action  a progressive society is now constantly and justly compared to a growing organism its vitality in this aspect consists of a series of changes in ideas and institutions these changes arise spontaneously from the operation of the whole body of social conditions external and internal the understanding and the affections and desires are always acting on the domestic political and economic ordering they influence the religious sentiment they touch relations with societies outside in turn they are constantly being acted on by all these elements in a society progressing in a normal and uninterrupted course this play and interaction is the sign and essence of life it is as we are so often told a long process of new adaptations and readaptations of the modification of tradition and usage by truer ideas and improved institutions there may be and there are epochs of rest when this modification in its active and demonstrative shape slackens or ceases to be visible but even then the modifying forces are only latent further progress depends on the revival of their energy before there has been time for the social structure to become ossified and inelastic the history of civilisation is the history of the displacement of old conceptions by new ones more conformable to the facts it is the record of the removal of old institutions and ways of living in favour of others of greater convenience and ampler capacity at once multiplying and satisfying human requirements  now compromise in view of the foregoing theory of social advance may be of two kinds and of these two kinds one is legitimate and the other not it may stand for two distinct attitudes of mind one of them obstructive and the other not it may mean the deliberate suppression or mutilation of an idea in order to make it congruous with the traditional idea or the current prejudice on the given subject whatever that may be or else it may mean a rational acquiescence in the fact that the bulk of your contemporaries are not yet prepared either to embrace the new idea or to change their ways of living in conformity to it in the one case the compromiser rejects the highest truth or dissembles his own acceptance of it in the other he holds it courageously for his ensign and device but neither forces nor expects the whole world straightway to follow the first prolongs the duration of the empire of prejudice and retards the arrival of improvement the second does his best to abbreviate the one and to hasten and make definite the other yet he does not insist on hurrying changes which to be effective would require the active support of numbers of persons not yet ripe for them it is legitimate compromise to sayi do not expect you to execute this improvement or to surrender that prejudice in my time but at any rate it shall not be my fault if the improvement remains unknown or rejected there shall be one man at least who has surrendered the prejudice and who does not hide that fact it is illegitimate compromise to sayi cannot persuade you to accept my truth therefore i will pretend to accept your falsehood  that this distinction is as sound on the evolutional theory of society as on any other is quite evident it would be odd if the theory which makes progress depend on modification forbade us to attempt to modify when it is said that the various successive changes in thought and institution present and consummate themselves spontaneously no one means by spontaneity that they come to pass independently of human effort and volition on the contrary this energy of the members of the society is one of the spontaneous elements it is quite as indispensable as any other of them if indeed it be not more so progress depends upon tendencies and forces in a community but of these tendencies and forces the organs and representatives must plainly be found among the men and women of the community and cannot possibly be found anywhere else progress is not automatic in the sense that if we were all to be cast into a deep slumber for the space of a generation we should awake to find ourselves in a greatly improved social state the world only grows better even in the moderate degree in which it does grow better because people wish that it should and take the right steps to make it better evolution is not a force but a process not a cause but a law it explains the source and marks the immovable limitations of social energy but social energy itself can never be superseded either by evolution or by anything else  the reproach of being impracticable and artificial attaches by rights not to those who insist on resolute persistent and uncompromising efforts to remove abuses but to a very different classto those namely who are credulous enough to suppose that abuses and bad customs and wasteful ways of doing things will remove themselves this credulity which is a cloak for indolence or ignorance or stupidity overlooks the fact that there are bodies of men more or less numerous attached by every selfish interest they have to the maintenance of these abusive customs a plan says bentham may be said to be too good to be practicable where without adequate inducement in the shape of personal interest it requires for its accomplishment that some individual or class of individuals shall have made a sacrifice of his or their personal interest to the interest of the whole when it is on the part of a body of men or a multitude of individuals taken at random that any such sacrifice is reckoned upon then it is that in speaking of the plan the term utopian may without impropriety be applied and this is the very kind of sacrifice which must be anticipated by those who so misunderstand the doctrine of evolution as to believe that the world is improved by some mystic and selfacting social discipline which dispenses with the necessity of pertinacious attack upon institutions that have outlived their time and interests that have lost their justification  we are thus brought to the positionto which indeed bare observation of actual occurrences might well bring us if it were not for the clouding disturbances of selfishness or of a true philosophy of society wrongly appliedthat a society can only pursue its normal course by means of a certain progression of changes and that these changes can only be initiated by individuals or very small groups of individuals the progressive tendency can only be a tendency it can only work its way through the inevitable obstructions around it by means of persons who are possessed by the special progressive idea such ideas do not spring up uncaused and unconditioned in vacant space they have had a definite origin and ordered antecedents they are in direct relation with the past they present themselves to one person or little group of persons rather than to another because circumstances or the accident of a superior faculty of penetration have placed the person or group in the way of such ideas in matters of social improvement the most common reason why one hits upon a point of progress and not another is that the one happens to be more directly touched than the other by the unimproved practice or he is one of those rare intelligences active alert inventive which by constitution or training find their chief happiness in thinking in a disciplined and serious manner how things can be better done in all cases the possession of a new idea whether practical or speculative only raises into definite speech what others have needed without being able to make their need articulate this is the principle on which experience shows us that fame and popularity are distributed a man does not become celebrated in proportion to his general capacity but because he does or says something which happened to need doing or saying at the moment  this brings us directly to our immediate subject for such a man is the holder of a trust it is upon him and those who are like him that the advance of a community depends if he is silent then repair is checked and the hurtful elements of wornout beliefs and waste institutions remain to enfeeble the society just as the retention of waste products enfeebles or poisons the body if in a spirit of modesty which is often genuine though it is often only a veil for love of ease he asks why he rather than another should speak why he before others should refuse compliance and abstain from conformity the answer is that though the many are ultimately moved it is always one who is first to leave the old encampment if the maxim of the compromiser were sound it ought to be capable of universal application nobody has a right to make an apology for himself in this matter which he will not allow to be valid for others if one has a right to conceal his true opinions and to practice equivocal conformities then all have a right one plea for exemption is in this case as good as another and no better that he has married a wife that he has bought a yoke of oxen and must prove them that he has bidden guests to a feastone excuse lies on the same level as the rest all are equally worthless as answers to the generous solicitation of enlightened conscience suppose then that each man on whom in turn the new ideas dawned wore to borrow the compromisers plea and imitate his example we know what would happen the exploit in which no one will consent to go first remains unachieved you wait until there are persons enough agreeing with you to form an effective party but how are the members of the band to know one another if all are to keep their dissent from the old and their adherence to the new rigorously private and how many members constitute the innovating band an effective force when onehalf of the attendants at a church are unbelievers will that warrant us in ceasing to attend or shall we tarry until the dissemblers number twothirds conceive the additions which your caution has made to the moral integrity of the community in the meantime measure the enormous hindrances that will have been placed in the way of truth and improvement when the day at last arrives on which you and your twothirds take heart to say that falsehood and abuse have now reached their final term and must at length be swept away into the outer darkness consider how much more terrible the shock of change will be when it does come and how much less able will men be to meet it and to emerge successfully from it  perhaps the compromiser shrinks not because he fears to march alone but because he thinks that the time has not yet come for the progressive idea which he has made his own and for whose triumph one day he confidently hopes this plea may mean two wholly different states of the case the time has not yet come for what for making those positive changes in life or institution which the change in idea must ultimately involve that is one thing or for propagating elaborating enforcing the new idea and strenuously doing all that one can to bring as many people as possible to a state of theory which will at last permit the requisite change in practice to be made with safety and success this is another and entirely different thing the time may not have come for the first of these two courses the season may not be advanced enough for us to push on to active conquest but the time has always come and the season is never unripe for the announcement of the fruitful idea  we must go further than that in so far as it can be done by one man without harming his neighbours the time has always come for the realisation of an idea when the change in way of living or in institution is one which requires the assent and cooperation of numbers of people it may clearly be a matter for question whether men enough are ready to yield assent and cooperation but the expression of the necessity of the change and the grounds of it though it may not always be appropriate can never be premature and for these reasons the fact of a new idea having come to one man is a sign that it is in the air the innovator is as much the son of his generation as the conservative heretics have as direct a relation to antecedent conditions as the orthodox truth said bacon has been rightly named the daughter of time the new idea does not spring up uncaused and by miracle if it has come to me there must be others to whom it has only just missed coming if i have found my way to the light there must be others groping after it very close in my neighbourhood my discovery is their goal they are prepared to receive the new truth which they were not prepared to find for themselves the fact that the mass are not yet ready to receive any more than to find is no reason why the possessor of the new truth should run to hide under a bushel the candle which has been lighted for him if the time has not come for them at least it has come for him no man can ever know whether his neighbours are ready for change or not he has all the following certainties at leastthat he himself is ready for the change that he believes it would be a good and beneficent one that unless some one begins the work of preparation assuredly there will be no consummation and that if he declines to take a part in the matter there can be no reason why every one else in turn should not decline in like manner and so the work remain for ever unperformed the compromiser who blinds himself to all those points and acts just as if the truth were not in him does for ideas with which he agrees the very thing which the acute persecutor does for ideas which he dislikeshe extinguishes beginnings and kills the germs   the consideration on which so many persons rely that an existing institution though destined to be replaced by a better performs useful functions provisionally is really not to the point it is an excellent reason why the institution should not be removed or fundamentally modified until public opinion is ripe for the given piece of improvement but it is no reason at all why those who are anxious for the improvement should speak and act just as they would do if they thought the change perfectly needless and undesirable it is no reason why those who allow the provisional utility of a belief or an institution or a custom of living should think solely of the utility and forget the equally important element of its provisionalness for the fact of its being provisional is the very ground why every one who perceives this element should set himself to act accordingly it is the ground why he should set himself in other words to draw opinion in every way open to himby speech by voting by manner of life and conductin the direction of new truth and the better practice let us not because we deem a thing to be useful for the hour act as if it were to be useful for ever the people who selfishly seek to enjoy as much comfort and ease as they can in an existing state of things with the desperate maxim after us the deluge are not any worse than those who cherish present comfort and case and take the world as it comes in the fatuous and selfdeluding hope after us the millennium those who make no sacrifice to avert the deluge and those who make none to hasten their millennium are on the same moral level and the former have at least the quality of being no worse than their avowed principle while the latter nullify their pretended hopes by conformities which are only proper either to profound social contentment or to profound social despair nay they seem to think that there is some merit in this merely speculative hopefulness they act as if they supposed that to be very sanguine about the general improvement of mankind is a virtue that relieves them from taking trouble about any improvement in particular  if those who defend a given institution are doing their work well that furnishes the better reason why those who disapprove of it and disbelieve in its enduring efficacy should do their work well also take the christian churches for instance assume if you will that they are serving a variety of useful functions if that were all it would be a reason for conforming but we are speaking of those for whom the matter does not end here if you are convinced that the dogma is not true that a steadily increasing number of persons are becoming aware that it is not true that its efficacy as a basis of spiritual life is being lowered in the same degree as its credibility that both dogma and church must be slowly replaced by higher forms of faith if not also by more effective organisations then all who hold such views as these have as distinctly a function in the community as the ministers and upholders of the churches and the zeal of the latter is simply the most monstrously untenable apology that could be invented for dereliction of duty by the former  if the orthodox to some extent satisfy certain of the necessities of the present there are other necessities of the future which can only be satisfied by those who now pass for heretical the plea which we are examining if it is good for the purpose for which it is urged would have to be expressed in this waythe institution is working as perfectly as it can be made to do or as any other in its place would be likely to do and therefore i will do nothing by word or deed towards meddling with it those who think this and act accordingly are the consistent conservatives of the community if a man takes up any position short of this his conformity acquiescence and inertia at once become inconsistent and culpable for unless the institution or belief is entirely adequate it must be the duty of all who have satisfied themselves that it is not so to recognise its deficiences and at least to call attention to them even if they lack opportunity or capacity to suggest remedies now we are dealing with persons who from the hypothesis do not admit that this or that factor in an existing social state secures all the advantages which might be secured if instead of that factor there were some other we are speaking of all the various kinds of dissidents who think that the current theology or an established church or a monarchy or an oligarchic republic is a bad thing and a lower form even at the moment while they attribute provisional merit to it they can mean nothing by classing each of these as bad things except that they either bring with them certain serious drawbacks or exclude certain valuable advantages the fact that they perform their functions well such as they are leaves the fundamental vice or defect of these functions just where it was if any one really thinks that the current theology involves depraved notions of the supreme impersonation of good restricts and narrows the intelligence misdirects the religious imagination and has become powerless to guide conduct then how does the circumstance that it happens not to be wholly and unredeemedly bad in its influence relieve our dissident from all care or anxiety as to the points in which as we have seen he does count it inadequate and mischievous even if he thinks it does more good than harma position which must be very difficult for one who believes the common supernatural conception of it to be entirely falseeven then how is he discharged from the duty of stigmatising the harm which he admits that it does  again take the case of the english monarchy grant if you will that this institution has a certain function and that by the present chief magistrate this function is estimably performed yet if we are of those who believe that in the stage of civilisation which england has reached in other matters the monarchy must be either obstructive and injurious or else merely decorative and that a merely decorative monarchy tends in divers ways to engender habits of abasement to nourish lower social ideals to lessen a high civil selfrespect in the community then it must surely be our duty not to lose any opportunity of pressing these convictions to do this is not necessarily to act as if one were anxious for the immediate removal of the throne and the crown into the museum of political antiquities we may have no urgent practical solicitude in this direction on the intelligible principle that a free people always gets as good a kind of government as it deserves our conviction is not on the present hypothesis that monarchy ought to be swept away in england but that monarchy produces certain mischievous consequences to the public spirit of the community and so what we are bound to do is to take care not to conceal this conviction to abstain scrupulously from all kinds of action and observance public or private which tend ever so remotely to foster the ignoble and degrading elements that exist in a court and spread from it outwards and to use all the influence we have however slight it may be in loading public opinion to a right attitude of contempt and dislike for these ignoble and degrading elements and the conduct engendered by them a policy like this does not interfere with the advantages of the monarchy such as they are asserted to be and it has the effect of making what are supposed to be its disadvantages as little noxious as possible the question whether we can get others to agree with us is not relevant if we were eager for instant overthrow it would be the most relevant of all questions but we are in the preliminary stage the stage for acting on opinion the fact that others do not yet share our opinion is the very reason for our action we can only bring them to agree with us if it be possible on any terms by persistency in our principles this persistency in all but either very timid or very vulgar natures always has been and always will be independent of external assent or cooperation the history of success as we can never too often repeat to ourselves is the history of minorities and what is more it is for the most part the history of insurrection exactly against what the worldly spirits of the time whenever it may have been deemed mere trifles and accidents with which sensible men should on no account dream of taking the trouble to quarrel  halifax says macaulay was in speculation a strong republican and did not conceal it he often made hereditary monarchy and aristocracy the subjects of his keen pleasantry while he was fighting the battles of the court and obtaining for himself step after step in the peerage we are perfectly familiar with this type both in men who have and men who have not such brilliant parts as halifax such men profess to nourish high ideals of life of character of social institutions yet they never think of these ideals when they are deciding what is practically attainable one would like to ask them what purpose is served by an ideal if it is not to make a guide for practice and a landmark in dealing with the real a mans loftiest and most ideal notions must be of a singularly ethereal and shall we not say senseless kind if he can never see how to take a single step that may tend in the slightest degree towards making them more real if an ideal has no point of contact with what exists it is probably not much more than the vapid outcome of intellectual or spiritual selfindulgence if it has such a point of contact then there is sure to be something which a man can do towards the fulfilment of his hopes he cannot substitute a new national religion for the old but he can at least do something to prevent people from supposing that the adherents of the old are more numerous than they really are and something to show them that good ideas are not all exhausted by the ancient forms he cannot transform a monarchy into a republic but he can make sure that one citizen at least shall aim at republican virtues and abstain from the debasing complaisance of the crowd   it is a very great mistake said burke many years before the french revolution is alleged and most unreasonably alleged to have alienated him from liberalism it is a very great mistake to imagine that mankind follow up practically any speculative principle either of government or of freedom as far as it will go in argument and logical illation all government indeed every human benefit and enjoyment every virtue and every prudent act is founded on compromise and barter we balance inconveniences we give and takewe remit some rights that we may enjoy others man acts from motives relative to his interests and not on metaphysical speculations29 these are the words of wisdom and truth if we can be sure that men will interpret them in all the fulness of their meaning and not be content to take only that part of the meaning which falls in with the dictates of their own love of ease in france such words ought to be printed in capitals on the front of every newspaper and written up in letters of burnished gold over each faction of the assembly and on the door of every bureau in the administration in england they need a commentary which shall bring out the very simple truth that compromise and barter do not mean the undisputed triumph of one set of principles nor on the other hand do they mean the mutilation of both sets of principles with a view to producing a tertium quid that shall involve the disadvantages of each without securing the advantages of either what burke means is that we ought never to press our ideas up to their remotest logical issues without reference to the conditions in which we are applying them in politics we have an art success in politics as in every other art obviously before all else implies both knowledge of the material with which we have to deal and also such concession as is necessary to the qualities of the material above all in politics we have an art in which development depends upon small modifications that is the true side of the conservative theory to hurry on after logical perfection is to show ones self ignorant of the material of that social structure with which the politician has to deal to disdain anything short of an organic change in thought or institution in infatuation to be willing to make such changes too frequently even when they are possible is foolhardiness that fatal french saying about small reforms being the worst enemies of great reforms is in the sense in which it is commonly used a formula of social ruin  on the other hand let us not forget that there is a sense in which this very saying is profoundly true a small and temporary improvement may really be the worst enemy of a great and permanent improvement unless the first is made on the lines and in the direction of the second and so it may if it be successfully palmed off upon a society as actually being the second in such a case as this and our legislation presents instances of the kind the small reform if it be not made with reference to some large progressive principle and with a view to further extension of its scope makes it all the more difficult to return to the right line and direction when improvement is again demanded to take an example which is now very familiar to us all the education act of 1870 was of the nature of a small reform no one pretends that it is anything approaching to a final solution of a complex problem but the government insisted whether rightly or wrongly that their act was as large a measure as public opinion was at that moment ready to support at the same time it was clearly agreed among the government and the whole of the party at their backs that at some time or other near or remote if public instruction was to be made genuinely effective the private voluntary or denominational system would have to be replaced by a national system to prepare for this ultimate replacement was one of the points to be most steadily borne in mind however slowly and tentatively the process might be conducted instead of that the authors of the act deliberately introduced provisions for extending and strengthening the very system which will have eventually to be superseded they thus by their small reform made the future great reform the more difficult of achievement assuredly this is not the compromise and barter the give and take which burke intended what burke means by compromise and what every true statesman understands by it is that it may be most inexpedient to meddle with an institution merely because it does not harmonise with argument and logical illation this is a very different thing from giving new comfort and strength with one hand to an institution whose deathwarrant you pretend to be signing with the other  in a different way the second possible evil of a small reform may be equally mischievouswhere the small reform is represented as settling the question the mischief here is not that it takes us out of the progressive course as in the case we have just been considering but that it sets mens minds in a posture of contentment which is not justified by the amount of what has been done and which makes it all the harder to arouse them to new effort when the inevitable time arrives  in these ways then compromise may mean not acquiescence in an instalment on the ground that the time is not ripe to yield us more than an instalment but either the acceptance of the instalment as final followed by the virtual abandonment of hope and effort or else it may mean a mistaken reversal of direction which augments the distance that has ultimately to be traversed in either of these senses the small reform may become the enemy of the great one but a right conception of political method based on a rightly interpreted experience of the conditions on which societies unite progress with order leads the wise conservative to accept the small change lest a worse thing befall him and the wise innovator to seize the chance of a small improvement while incessantly working in the direction of great ones the important thing is that throughout the process neither of them should lose sight of his ultimate ideal nor fail to look at the detail from the point of view of the whole nor allow the near particular to bulk so unduly large as to obscure the general and distant  if the process seems intolerably slow we may correct our impatience by looking back upon the past people seldom realise the enormous period of time which each change in mens ideas requires for its full accomplishment we speak of these changes with a peremptory kind of definiteness as if they had covered no more than the space of a few years thus we talk of the time of the reformation as we might talk of the reform bill or the repeal of the corn duties yet the reformation is the name for a movement of the mind of northern europe which went on for three centuries then if we turn to that still more momentous set of events the rise and establishment of christianity one might suppose from current speech that we could fix that within a space of half a century or so yet it was at least four hundred years before all the foundations of that great superstructure of doctrine and organisation were completely laid again to descend to less imposing occurrences the transition in the eastern empire from the old roman system of national organisation to that other system to which we give the specific name of byzantinethis transition so infinitely less important as it was than either of the two other movements yet occupied no less than a couple of hundred years the conditions of speech make it indispensable for us to use definite and compendious names for movements that were both tardy and complex we are forced to name a long series of events as if they were a single event but we lose the reality of history we fail to recognise one of the most striking aspects of human affairs and above all we miss that most invaluable practical lesson the lesson of patience unless we remember that the great changes of history took up long periods of time which when measured by the little life of a man are almost colossal like the vast changes of geology we know how long it takes before a species of plant or animal disappears in face of a better adapted species ideas and customs beliefs and institutions have always lingered just as long in face of their successors and the competition is not less keen nor less prolonged because it is for one or other inevitably destined to be hopeless history like geology demands the use of the imagination and in proportion as the exercise of the historic imagination is vigorously performed in thinking of the past will be the breadth of our conception of the changes which the future has in store for us as well as of the length of time and the magnitude of effort required for their perfect achievement30  this much concerning moderation in political practice no such considerations present themselves in the matters which concern the shaping of our own lives or the publications of our social opinions in this region we are not imposing charges upon others either by law or otherwise we therefore owe nothing to the prejudices or habits of others if any one sets serious value upon the point of difference between his own ideal and that which is current if he thinks that his experiment in living has promise of real worth and that if more persons could be induced to imitate it some portion of mankind would be thus put in possession of a better kind of happiness then it is selling a birthright for a mess of pottage to abandon hopes so rich and generous merely in order to avoid the passing and casual penalties of social disapproval and there is a double evil in this kind of flinching from obedience to the voice of our better selves whether it takes the form of absolute suppression of what we think and hope or only of timorous and mutilated presentation we lose not only the possible advantage of the given change besides that we lose also the certain advantage of maintaining or increasing the amount of conscientiousness in the world and everybody can perceive the loss incurred in a society where diminution of the latter sort takes place the advance of the community depends not merely on the improvement and elevation of its moral maxima but also on the quickening of moral sensibility the latter work has mostly been effected when it has been effected on a large scale by teachers of a certain singular personal quality they do nothing to improve the theory of conduct but they have the art of stimulating men to a more enthusiastic willingness to rise in daily practice to the requirements of whatever theory they may accept the love of virtue of duty of holiness or by whatever name we call this powerful sentiment exists in the majority of men where it exists at all independently of argument it is a matter of affection sympathy association aspiration hence even while in quality sense of duty is a stationary factor it is constantly changing in quantity the amount of conscience in different communities or in the same community at different times varies infinitely the immediate cause of the decline of a society in the order of morals is a decline in the quantity of its conscience a deadening of its moral sensitiveness and not a depravation of its theoretical ethics the greeks became corrupt and enfeebled not for lack of ethical science but through the decay in the numbers of those who were actually alive to the reality and force of ethical obligations mahometans triumphed over christians in the east and in spainif we may for a moment isolate moral conditions from the rest of the total circumstancesnot because their scheme of duty was more elevated or comprehensive but because their respect for duty was more strenuous and fervid  the great importance of leaving this priceless element in a community as free as keen and as active as possible is overlooked by the thinkers who uphold coercion against liberty as a saving social principle every act of coercion directed against an opinion or a way of living is in so far calculated to lessen the quantity of conscience in the society where such acts are practised of course where ways of living interfere with the lawful rights of others where they are not strictly selfregarding in all their details it is necessary to force the dissidents however strong may be their conscientious sentiment the evil of attenuating that sentiment is smaller than the evil of allowing one set of persons to realise their own notions of happiness at the expense of all the rest of the world but where these notions can be realised without unlawful interference of that kind then the forcible hindrance of such realisation is a direct weakening of the force and amount of conscience on which the community may count there is one memorable historic case to illustrate this lewis xiv in revoking the edict of nantes and the author of the still more cruel law of 1724 not only violently drove out multitudes of the most scrupulous part of the french nation they virtually offered the most tremendous bribes to those of less stern resolution to feign conversion to the orthodox faith this was to treat conscience as a thing of mean value it was to scatter to the wind with both hands the moral resources of the community and who can fail to see the strength which would have been given to france in her hour of storm a hundred years after the revocation of the edict of nantes if her protestant sons fortified by the training in the habits of individual responsibility which protestantism involves had only been there to aid   this consideration brings us to a new side of the discussion we may seem to have been unconsciously arguing as strongly in favour of a vigorous social conservatism as of a selfasserting spirit of social improvement all that we have been saying may appear to cut both ways if the innovator should decline to practise silence or reserve why should the possessor of power be less uncompromising and why should he not impose silence by force if the heretic ought to be uncompromising in expressing his opinions and in acting upon them in the fulness of his conviction that they are right why should not the orthodox be equally uncompromising in his resolution to stamp out the heretical notions and unusual ways of living in the fulness of his conviction that they are thoroughly wrong to this question the answer is that the hollow kinds of compromise are as bad in the orthodox as in the heretical truth has as much to gain from sincerity and thoroughness in one as in the other but the issue between the partisans of the two opposed schools turns upon the sense which we design to give to the process of stamping out those who cling to the tenets of liberty limit the action of the majority as of the minority strictly to persuasion those who dislike liberty insist that earnestness of conviction justifies either a majority or a minority in using not persuasion only but force i do not propose here to enter into the great question which mr mill pressed anew upon the minds of this generation his arguments are familiar to every reader and the conclusion at which he arrived is almost taken for a postulate in the present essay31 the object of these chapters is to reiterate the importance of selfassertion tenacity and positiveness of principle the partisan of coercion will argue that this thesis is on one side of it a justification of persecution and other modes of interfering with new opinions and new ways of living by force and the strong arm of the law and whatever other energetic means of repression may be at command if the minority are to be uncompromising alike in seeking and realising what they take for truth why not the majority now this implies two propositions it is the same as to say first that earnestness of conviction is not to be distinguished from a belief in our own infallibility second that faith in our infallibility is necessarily bound up with intolerance  neither of these propositions is true let us take them in turn earnestness of conviction is perfectly compatible with a sense of liability to error this has been so excellently put by a former writer that we need not attempt to better his exposition every one must of course think his own opinions right for if he thought them wrong they would no longer be his opinions but there is a wide difference between regarding ourselves as infallible and being firmly convinced of the truth of our creed when a man reflects on any particular doctrine he may be impressed with a thorough conviction of the improbability or even impossibility of its being false and so he may feel with regard to all his other opinions when he makes them objects of separate contemplation and yet when he views them in the aggregate when he reflects that not a single being on the earth holds collectively the same when he looks at the past history and present state of mankind and observes the various creeds of different ages and nations the peculiar modes of thinking of sects and bodies and individuals the notions once firmly held which have been exploded the prejudices once universally prevalent which have been removed and the endless controversies which have distracted those who have made it the business of their lives to arrive at the truth and when he further dwells on the consideration that many of these his fellowcreatures have had a conviction of the justness of their respective sentiments equal to his own he cannot help the obvious inference that in his own opinion it is next to impossible that there is not an admixture of error that there is an infinitely greater probability of his being wrong in some than right in all32  of course this is not an account of the actual frame of mind of ordinary men they never do think of their opinions in the aggregate in comparison with the collective opinions of others nor ever draw the conclusions which such reflections would suggest but such a frame of mind is perfectly attainable and has often been attained by persons of far lower than firstrate capacity and if this is so there is no reason why it should not be held up for the admiration and imitation of all those classes of society which profess to have opinions it would thus become an established element in the temper of the age nor need we fear that the result of this would be any flaccidity of conviction or lethargy in act a man would still be penetrated with the rightness of his own opinion on a given issue and would still do all that he could to make it prevail in practice but among the things which he would no longer permit himself to do would be the forcible repression in others of any opinions however hostile to his own or of any kind of conduct however widely it diverged from his own and provided that it concerned themselves only this widening of his tolerance would be the natural result of a rational and realised consciousness of his own general fallibility  next even belief in ones own infallibility does not necessarily lead to intolerance for it may be said that though no man in his senses would claim to be incapable of error yet in every given case he is quite sure that he is not in error and therefore this assurance in particular is tantamount by process of cumulation to a sense of infallibility in general now even if this were so it would not of necessity either produce or justify intolerance the certainty of the truth of your own opinions is independent of any special idea as to the means by which others may best be brought to share them the question between persuasion and force remains apartunless indeed we may say that in societies where habits of free discussion have once begun to take root those who are least really sure about their opinions are often most unwilling to trust to persuasion to bring them converts and most disposed to grasp the rude implements of coercion whether legal or merely social the cry be my brother or i slay thee was the sign of a very weak though very fiery faith in the worth of fraternity he whose faith is most assured has the best reason for relying on persuasion and the strongest motive to thrust from him all temptations to use angry force the substitution of force for persuasion among its other disadvantages has this further drawback from our present point of view that it lessens the conscience of a society and breeds hypocrisy you have not converted a man because you have silenced him opinion and force belong to different elements to think that you are able by social disapproval or other coercive means to crush a mans opinion is as one who should fire a blunderbuss to put out a star the acquiescence in current notions which is secured by law or by petulant social disapproval is as worthless and as essentially hypocritical as the conversion of an irish pauper to protestantism by means of souptickets or that of a savage to christianity by the gift of a string of beads here is the radical fallacy of those who urge that people must use promises and threats in order to encourage opinions thoughts and feelings which they think good and to prevent others which they think bad promises and threats can influence acts opinions and thoughts on morals politics and the rest after they have once grown in a mans mind can no more be influenced by promises and threats than can my knowledge that snow is white or that ice is cold you may impose penalties on me by statute for saying that snow is white or acting as if i thought ice cold and the penalties may affect my conduct they will not because they cannot modify my beliefs in the matter by a single iota one result therefore of intolerance is to make hypocrites on this as on the rest of the grounds which vindicate the doctrine of liberty a man who thought himself infallible either in particular or in general from the pope of rome down to the editor of the daily newspaper might still be inclined to abstain from any form of compulsion the only reason to the contrary is that a man who is so silly as to think himself incapable of going wrong is very likely to be too silly to perceive that coercion may be one way of going wrong  the currency of the notion that earnest sincerity about ones opinions and ideals of conduct is inseparably connected with intolerance is indirectly due to the predominance of legal or juristic analogies in social discussion for one thing the lawyer has to deal mainly with acts and to deal with them by way of repression his attention is primarily fixed on the deed and only secondarily on the mind of the doer and so a habit of thought is created which treats opinion as something equally in the sphere of coercion with actions at the same time it favours coercive ways of affecting opinion then what is still more important the jurists conception of society has its root in the relation between sovereign and subject between lawmaker and those whom law restrains exertion of power on one hand and compliance on the otherthis is his type of the conditions of the social union the fertility and advance of discussion on social issues depends on the substitution of the evolutional for the legal conception the lawyers type of proposition is absolute it is also for various reasons which need not be given here inspired by involuntary reference to the lower rather than to the more highly developed social states in the lower states law penalties coercion compulsion the strong hand a sternly repressive public opinion were the conditions on which the community was united and held together but the line of thought which these analogies suggest becomes less and less generally appropriate in social discussion in proportion as the community becomes more complex more various in resource more special in its organisation in a word more elaborately civilised the evolutionists idea of society concedes to law its historic place and its actual part but then this idea leads directly to a way of looking at society which makes the replacement of law by liberty a condition of reaching the higher stages of social development  the doctrine of liberty belongs to the subject of this chapter because it is only another way of expressing the want of connection between earnestness in realising our opinions and anything like coercion in their favour if it were true that aversion from compromise in carrying out our ideas implied the rightfulness of using all the means in our power to hinder others from carrying out ideas hostile to them then we should have been preaching in a spirit unfavourable to the principle of liberty our main text has been that men should refuse to sacrifice their opinions and ways of living in the selfregarding sphere out of regard to the status quo or the prejudices of others and this as a matter of course excludes the right of forcing or wishing any one else to make such a sacrifice to us well the first foundationstone for the doctrine of liberty is to be sought in the conception of society as a growing and developing organism this is its true base apart from the numerous minor expediencies which may be adduced to complete the structure of the argument it is fundamentally advantageous that in societies which have reached our degree of complex and intricate organisation unfettered liberty should be conceded to ideas and within the selfregarding sphere to conduct also the reasons for this are of some such kind as the following new ideas and new experiments in living would not arise if there were not a certain inadequateness in existing ideas and ways of living they may not point to the right mode of meeting inadequateness but they do point to the existence and consciousness of it they originate in the social capability of growth society can only develop itself on condition that all such novelties within the limit laid down for good and valid reasons at self regarding conduct are allowed to present themselves first because neither the legislature nor any one else can ever know for certain what novelties will prove of enduring value second because even if we did know for certain that given novelties were pathological growths and not normal developments and that they never would be of any value still the repression necessary to extirpate them would involve too serious a risk both of keeping back social growth at some other point and of giving the direction of that growth an irreparable warp and let us repeat once more in proportion as a community grows more complex in its classes divisions and subdivisions more intricate in its productive commercial or material arrangements so does this risk very obviously wax more grave  in the sense in which we are speaking of it liberty is not a positive force any more than the smoothness of a railroad is a positive force33 it is a condition as a force there is a sense in which it is true to call liberty a negation as a condition though it may still be a negation yet it may be indispensable for the production of certain positive results the vacuity of an exhausted receiver is not a force but it is the indispensable condition of certain positive operations liberty as a force may be as impotent as its opponents allege this does not affect its value as a preliminary or accompanying condition the absence of a straitwaistcoat is a negation but it is a useful condition for the activity of sane men no doubt there must be a definite limit to this absence of external interference with conduct and that limit will be fixed at various points by different thinkers we are now only urging that it cannot be wisely fixed for the more complex societies by any one who has not grasped this fundamental preconception that liberty or the absence of coercion or the leaving people to think speak and act as they please is in itself a good thing it is the object of a favourable presumption the burden of proving it inexpedient always lies and wholly lies on those who wish to abridge it by coercion whether direct or indirect  one reason why this truth is so reluctantly admitted is mens irrational want of faith in the selfprotective quality of a highly developed and healthy community the timid compromiser on the one hand and the advocate of coercive restriction on the other are equally the victims of a superfluous apprehension the one fears to use his liberty for the same reason that makes the other fearful of permitting liberty this common reason is the want of a sensible confidence that in a free western community which has reached our stage of development religious moral and social noveltiesprovided they are tainted by no element of compulsion or interference with the just rights of others may be trusted to find their own level moral and intellectual conditions are not the only motive forces in a community nor are they even the most decisive political and material conditions fix the limits at which speculation can do either good or harm let us take an illustration of the impotence of moral ideas to override material circumstances and we shall venture to place this illustration somewhat fully before the reader  there is no more important distinction between modern civilised communities and the ancient communities than the fact that the latter rested on slavery while the former have abolished it hence there can hardly be a more interesting question than thisby what agencies so prodigious a transformation of one of the fundamental conditions of society was brought about the popular answer is of a very ready kind and it passes quite satisfactorily this answer is that the first great step towards free labour the transformation of personal slavery into serfdom was the result of the spiritual change which was wrought in mens minds by the teaching of the church it is unquestionable that the influence of the church tended to mitigate the evils of slavery to humanise the relations between master and slave between the lord and the serf but this is a very different thing from the radical transformation of those relations if we think of society as an organism we instantly understand that so immense a change as this could not possibly have been effected without the cooperation of the other great parts of the social system any more than a critical evolution could take place in the nutritive apparatus of an animal without a change in the whole series of its organs thus in order that serfage should be evolved from slavery and free labour again from serfage it could not be enough that an alteration should have been wrought in mens ideas as to their common brotherhood and the connected ideas as to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of certain human relations there must have been an alteration also of the economic and material conditions history confirms the expectations which we should thus have been led to entertain the impotence of spiritual and moral agencies alone in bringing about this great metamorphosis is shown by such facts as these for centuries after the new faith had consolidated itself slavery was regarded without a particle of that deep abhorrence which the possession of man by man excites in us now in the ninth and tenth centuries the slave trade was the most profitable branch of the commerce that was carried on in the mediterranean the historian tells us that even so late as this slaves were the principal article of european export to africa syria and egypt in payment for the produce of the east which was brought from those countries it was the crumbling of the old social system which by reducing the population lessening the wealth and lowering the standard of living among the free masters tended to extinguish slavery by diminishing the differences between the masters and their bondsmen again it was certain laws enacted by the roman government for the benefit of the imperial fisc which first conferred rights on the slave the same laws brought the free farmer whose position was less satisfactory for the purposes of the revenue down nearer and nearer to a servile condition again in the ninth and tenth centuries pestilence and famine accelerated the extinction of predial slavery by weakening the numbers of the free population history we are told by that thoroughly competent authority mr finlay affords its testimony that neither the doctrines of christianity nor the sentiments of humanity have ever yet succeeded in extinguishing slavery where the soil could be cultivated with profit by slave labour no christian community of slaveholders has yet voluntarily abolished slavery in no country where it prevailed has rural slavery ceased until the price of productions raised by slave labour has fallen so low as to leave no profit to the slaveowner  the moral of all this is the tolerably obvious truth that the prosperity of an abstract idea depends as much on the medium into which it is launched as upon any quality of its own stable societies are amply furnished with force enough to resist all effort in a destructive direction there is seldom much fear and in our own country there is hardly any fear at all of hasty reformers making too much way against the spontaneous conservatism which belongs to a healthy and wellorganised community if dissolvent ideas do make their way it is because the society was already ripe for dissolution new ideas however ardently preached will dissolve no society which was not already in a condition of profound disorganisation we may be allowed just to point to two memorable instances by way of illustration though a long and elaborate discussion would be needed to bring out their full force it has often been thought since as it was thought by timorous reactionaries at the time that christianity in various ways sapped the strength of the roman empire and opened the way for the barbarians in truth the most careful and competent students know now that the empire slowly fell to pieces partly because the political arrangements were vicious and inadequate but mainly because the fiscal and economic system impoverished and depopulated one district of the vast empire after another it was the breakup of the empire that gave the church its chance not the church that broke up the empire it is a mistake of the same kind to suppose that the destructive criticism of the french philosophers a hundred years ago was the great operative cause of the catastrophe which befel the old social régime if voltaire diderot rousseau had never lived or if their works had all been suppressed as soon as they were printed their absence would have given no new life to agriculture would not have stimulated trade nor replenished the bankrupt fisc nor incorporated the privileged classes with the bulk of the nation nor done anything else to repair an organisation of which every single part had become incompetent for its proper function it was the material misery and the political despair engendered by the reigning system which brought willing listeners to the feet of the teachers who framed beneficent governments on the simple principles of reason and the natural law and these teachers only busied themselves with abstract politics because the real situation was desperate they had no alternative but to evolve social improvements out of their own consciousness there was not a single sound organ in the body politic which they could have made the startingpoint of a reconstitution of a society on the base of its actual or historic structure the mischiefs which resulted from their method are patent and undeniable but the method was made inevitable by the curse of the old régime34  nor is there any instance in history of mere opinion making a breach in the essential constitution of a community so long as the political conditions were stable and the economic or nutritive conditions sound if some absolute monarch were to be seized by a philanthropic resolution to transform the ordering of a society which seemed to be at his disposal he might possibly by the perseverance of a lifetime succeed in throwing the community into permanent confusion joseph ii perhaps did as much as a modern sovereign can do in this direction yet little came of his efforts either for good or harm but a man without the whole political machinery in his power need hardly labour under any apprehension that he may by the mere force of speculative opinion involuntarily work a corresponding mischief if it is true that the most fervent apostles of progress usually do very little of the good on which they congratulate themselves they ought surely on the same ground to be acquitted of much of the harm for which they are sometimes reviled in a country of unchecked and abundant discussion a new idea is not at all likely to make much way against the objection of its novelty unless it is really commended by some quality of temporary or permanent value so far therefore as the mere publication of new principles is concerned and so far also as merely selfregarding action goes one who has the keenest sense of social responsibility and is most scrupulously afraid of doing anything to slacken or perturb the process of social growth may still consistently give to the world whatever ideas he has gravely embraced he may safely trust if the society be in a normal condition to its justice of assimilation and rejection there are a few individuals for whom newness is a recommendation but what are these few among the many to whom newness is a stumblingblock old ideas may survive merely because they are old a new one will certainly not among a considerable body of men in a healthy social state gain any acceptance worth speaking of merely because it is new  the recognition of the selfprotecting quality of society is something more than a point of speculative importance it has a direct practical influence for it would add to the courage and intrepidity of the men who are most attached to the reigning order of things if such men could only divest themselves of a futile and nervous apprehension that things as they are have no root in their essential fitness and harmony and that order consequently is ever hanging on a trembling and doubtful balance they would not only gain by the selfrespect which would be added to them and the rest of the community but all discussion would become more robust and real if they had a larger faith in the stability for which they profess so great an anxiety they would be more free alike in understanding and temper to deal generously honestly and effectively with those whom they count imprudent innovators there is nothing more amusing or more instructive than to turn to the debates in parliament or the press upon some innovating proposal after an interval since the proposal was accepted by the legislature the flaming hopes of its friends the wild and desperate prophecies of its antagonists are found to be each as illfounded as the other the measure which was to do such vast good according to the one such portentous evil according to the other has done only a part of the promised good and has done none of the threatened evil the true lesson from this is one of perseverance and thoroughness for the improver and one of faith in the selfprotectiveness of a healthy society for the conservative the master error of the latter is to suppose that men are moved mainly by their passions rather than their interests that all their passions are presumably selfish and destructive and that their own interests can seldom be adequately understood by the persons most directly concerned how many fallacies are involved in this group of propositions the reader may well be left to judge for himself  we have in this chapter considered some of the limitations which are set by the conditions of society on the duty of trying to realise our principles in action the general conclusion is in perfect harmony with that of the previous chapters a principle if it be sound represents one of the larger expediencies to abandon that for the sake of some seeming expediency of the hour is to sacrifice the greater good for the less on no more creditable ground than that the less is nearer it is better to wait and to defer the realisation of our ideas until we can realise them fully than to defraud the future by truncating them if truncate them we must in order to secure a partial triumph for them in the immediate present it is better to bear the burden of impracticableness than to stifle conviction and to pare away principle until it becomes more hollowness and triviality what is the sense and what is the morality of postponing the wider utility to the narrower nothing

france p 129 etc     note to page 242   the doctrine of liberty  mr mills memorable plea for social liberty was little more than an enlargement though a very important enlargement of the principles of the still more famous speech for liberty of unlicensed printing with which milton ennobled english literature two centuries before milton contended for free publication of opinion mainly on these grounds first that the opposite system implied the grace of infallibility and incorruptibleness in the licensers second that the prohibition of bold books led to mental indolence and stagnant formalism both in teachers and congregations producing the laziness of a licensing church third that it hinders and retards the importation of our richest merchandise truth for the commission of the licenser enjoins him to let nothing pass which is not vulgarly received already and if it come to prohibiting there is not aught more likely to be prohibited than truth itself whose first appearance to our eyes bleared and dimmed with prejudice and custom is more unsightly and unplausible than many errors even as the person is of many a great man slight and contemptible to see to fourth that freedom is in itself an ingredient of true virtue and they are not skilful considerers of human things who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin that virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evil and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers and rejects it is but a blank virtue not a pure her virtue is but an excremental virtue which was the reason why our sage and serious poet spenser whom i dare be known to think a better teacher than scotus or aquinas describing true temperance under the form of guion brings him in with his palmer through the cave of mammon and the tower of earthly bliss that he might see and know and yet abstain  the four grounds on which mr mill contends for the necessity of freedom in the expression of opinion to the mental wellbeing of mankind are virtually contained in these his four grounds are 1 that the silenced opinion may be true 2 it may contain a portion of truth essential to supplement the prevailing opinion 3 vigorous contesting of opinions that are even wholly true is the only way of preventing them from sinking to the level of uncomprehended prejudices 4 without such contesting the doctrine will lose its vital effect on character and conduct  but milton drew the line of liberty at what he calls neighbouring differences or rather indifferences the arminian controversy had loosened the bonds with which the newly liberated churches of the reformation had made haste to bind themselves again and weakened that authority of confessions which had replaced the older but not more intolerant authority of the universal church other controversies which raged during the first half of the seventeenth centurythose between catholics and protestants between prelatists and presbyterians between socinians and trinitarians between latitudinarians puritans and sacramentalistsall tended to weaken theological exclusiveness this slackening however was no more than partial roger williams indeed the welsh founder of rhode island preached as early as 1631 the principles of an unlimited toleration extending to catholics jews and even infidels milton stopped a long way short of this he did not mean tolerated popery and open superstition which as it extirpates all religious and civil supremacies so itself should be extirpate provided first that all charitable and compassionate means be used to win and regain the weak and the misled that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or manners no law can possibly permit that intends not to unlaw itself   locke writing fiveandforty years later somewhat widened these limitations his question was not merely whether there should be free expression of opinion but whether there should furthermore be freedom of worship and of religious union he answered both questions affirmativelynot on the semisceptical ground of jeremy taylor which is also one of the grounds taken by mr mill that we cannot be sure that our own opinion is the true onebut on the strength of his definition of the province of the civil magistrate locke held that the magistrates whole jurisdiction reached only to civil concernments and that all civil power right and dominion is bounded to that only care of promoting these things and that it neither can nor ought in any manner to be extended to the saving of souls this chiefly because the power of the civil magistrate consists only in outward force while true and saving religion consists in the inward persuasion of the mind without which nothing can be acceptable to god and such is the nature of the understanding that it cannot he compelled to the belief of anything by outward force it is only light and evidence that can work a change in mens opinions and that light can in no manner proceed from corporal sufferings or any other outward penalties i may grow rich by an art that i take not delight in i may be cured of some disease by remedies that i have not faith in but i cannot be saved by a religion that at i distrust and a ritual that i abhor first letter concerning toleration and much more in the same excellent vein but locke fixed limits to toleration 1 no opinions contrary to human society or to those moral rules which are necessary to the preservation of civil society are to be tolerated by the magistrate thus to take examples from our own day a conservative minister would think himself right on this principle in suppressing the land and labour league a catholic minister in dissolving the education league and any minister in making mere membership of the mormon sect a penal offence 2 no tolerance ought to be extended to those who attribute unto the faithful religious and orthodox that is in plain terms unto themselves any peculiar privilege or power above other mortals in civil concernments or who upon pretence of religion do challenge any manner of authority over such as are not associated with them in their ecclesiastical communion as i have seldom heard of any sect except the friends who did not challenge as much authority as it could possibly get over persons not associated with it this would amount to a universal proscription of religion but lockes principle might at any rate be invoked against ultramontanism in some circumstances 3 those are not at all to be tolerated who deny the being of god the taking away of god though but even in thought dissolves all society and promises covenants and oaths which are the bonds of human society have no hold on such thus the police ought to close mr bradlaughs hall of science and perhaps on some occasions the positivist school  lockes principles depended on a distinction between civil concernments which he tries to define and all other concernments warburtons arguments on the alliance between church and state turned on the same point as did the oncefamous bangorian controversy this distinction would fit into mr mills cardinal position which consists in a distinction between the things that only affect the doer or thinker of them and the things that affect other persons as well lockes attempt to divide civil affairs from affairs of salvation was satisfactory enough for the comparatively narrow object with which he opened his discussion mr mills account of civil affairs is both wider and more definite naturally so as he had to maintain the cause of tolerance in a much more complex set of social conditions and amid a far greater diversity of speculative energy than any one dreamed of in lockes time mr mill limits the province of the civil magistrate to the repression of acts that directly and immediately injure others than the doer of them so long as acts including the expression of opinions are purely selfregarding it seems to him expedient in the long run that they should not be interfered with by the magistrate he goes much further than this selfregarding acts should not be interfered with by the magistrate not only selfregarding acts but all opinions whatever should moreover be as little interfered with as possible by public opinion except in the way of vigorous argumentation and earnest persuasion in a contrary direction the silent but most impressive solicitation of virtuous example the wise and careful upbringing of the young so that when they enter life they may be most nobly fitted to choose the right opinions and obey the right motives  the consideration by which he supports this rigorous confinement of external interference on the part of government or the unorganised members of the community whose opinion is called public opinion to cases of selfprotection are these some of which have been already stated  1 by interfering to suppress opinions or experiments in living you may resist truths and improvements in a greater or less degree  2 constant discussion is the only certain means of preserving the freshness of truth in mens minds and the vitality of its influence upon their conduct and motives  3 individuality is one of the most valuable elements of wellbeing and you can only be sure of making the most of individuality if you have an atmosphere of freedom encouraging free development and expansion  4 habitual resort to repressive means of influencing conduct tends more than anything else to discredit and frustrate the better means such as education good example and the like liberty 148  the principle which he deduces from these considerations isthat the sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is selfprotection the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community is to prevent harm to others his own good either physical or moral is not a sufficient warrant he cannot be rightfully compelled to do or forbear because it will make him happier because in the opinion of others to do so would be wise or even right these are good reasons for remonstrating with him or reasoning with him or persuading him or entreating him but not for compelling him or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise to justify that the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to others liberty 22   two disputable points in the above doctrine are likely at once to reveal themselves to the least critical eye first that doctrine would seem to check the free expression of disapproval one of the most wholesome and indispensable duties which anybody with interest in serious questions has to perform and the nonperformance of which would remove the most proper and natural penalty from frivolous or perverse opinions and obnoxious conduct mr mill deals with this difficulty as followswe have a right in various ways to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one not to the oppression of his individuality but in the exercise of ours we are not bound for example to seek his society we have a right to avoid it though not to parade the avoidance for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us we have a right and it may be our duty to caution others against him if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates we may give others a preference over him in optional good offices except those which tend to his improvement in these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others for faults which directly concern only himself but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural and as it were the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment liberty 139 this appears to be a satisfactory way of meeting the objection for though the penalties of disapproval may be just the same whether deliberately inflicted or naturally and spontaneously falling on the object of such disapproval yet there is a very intelligible difference between the two processes in their effect on the two parties concerned a person imbued with mr mills principle would feel the responsibility of censorship much more seriously would reflect more carefully and candidly about the conduct or opinion of which he thought ill would be more on his guard against pharisaic censoriousness and that desire to be ever judging one another which milton well called the stronghold of our hypocrisy the disapproval of such a person would have an austere colour a gravity a selfrespecting reserve which could never belong to an equal degree of disapproval in a person who had started from the officious principle that if we are sure we are right it is straightway our business to make the person whom we think wrong smart for his error and in the same way such disapproval would be much more impressive to the person whom it affected if it was justified he would be like a froward child who is always less effectively reformedif reformable at allby angry chidings and passionate punishments than by the sight of a cool and austere displeasure which lets him persist in his frowardness if he chooses   the second weak point in the doctrine lies in the extreme vagueness of the terms protective and selfregarding the practical difficulty begins with the definition of these terms can any opinion or any serious part of conduct be looked upon as truly and exclusively selfregarding this central ingredient in the discussion seems insufficiently laboured in the essay on liberty yet it is here more than anywhere else that controversy is needed to clear up what is in just as much need of elucidation whatever view we may take of the inherent virtue of freedomwhether we look on freedom as a mere negation or as one of the most powerful positive conditions of attaining the highest kind of human excellence  to some persons the analysis of conduct on which the whole doctrine of liberty rests seems metaphysical and arbitrary they are reluctant to admit there are any selfregarding acts at all this reluctance implies a perfectly tenable proposition a proposition which has been maintained by nearly all religious bodies in the worlds history in their nonlatitudinarian stages to distinguish the selfregarding from the other parts of conduct strikes them not only as unscientific but as morally and socially mischievous they insist that there is a social as well as a personal element in every human act though in very different proportions there is no gain they contend and there may be much harm in trying to mark off actions in which the personal element decisively preponderates from actions of another sort mr mill did so distinguish actions nor was his distinction either metaphysical or arbitrary in its source as a matter of observation and for the practical purposes of morality there are kinds of action whose consequences do not go beyond the doer of them no doubt you may say that by engaging in these kinds in any given moment the doer is neglecting the actions in which the social element preponderates and therefore even acts that seem purely selfregarding have indirect and negative consequences to the rest of the world but to allow considerations of this sort to prevent us from using a commonsense classification of acts by the proportion of the personal element in them is as unreasonable as if we allowed the doctrine of the conservation of physical force or the evolution of one mode of force into another to prevent us from classifying the affections of matter independently as light heat motion and the rest there is one objection obviously to be made to most of the illustrations which are designed to show the public element in all private conduct the connection between the act and its influence on others is so remote using the word in a legal sense though quite certain distinct and traceable that you can only take the act out of the selfregarding category by a process which virtually denies the existence of any such category you must set a limit to this indirect and atadistance argument as locke called a similar plea and the setting of this limit is the natural supplement to mr mills simple principle  the division between selfregarding acts and others then rests on observation of their actual consequences and why was mr mill so anxious to erect selfregarding acts into a distinct and important class so important as to be carefully and diligently secured by a special principle of liberty because observation of the recorded experience of mankind teaches us that the recognition of this independent provision is essential to the richest expansion of human faculty to narrow or to repudiate such a province and to insist exclusively on the social bearing of each part of conduct is to limit the play of motives and to thwart the doctrine that mankind obtain a greater sum of happiness when each pursues his own under the rules and conditions required by the rest than when each makes the good of the rest his only object to narrow or to repudiate such a province is to tighten the power of the majority over the minority and to augment the authority of whatever sacerdotal or legislative body may represent the majority whether the lawmakers be laymen in parliament or priests of humanity exercising the spiritual power it matters not   we may best estimate the worth and the significance of the doctrine of liberty by considering the line of thought and observation which led to it to begin with it is in mr mills hands something quite different from the same doctrine as preached by the french revolutionary school indeed one might even call it reactionary in respect of the french theory of a hundred years back it reposes on no principle of abstract right but like the rest of its authors opinions on principles of utility and experience dr arnold used to divide reformers into two classes popular and liberal the first he defined as seekers of liberty the second as seekers of improvement the first were the goats and the second were the sheep mr mills doctrine denied the mutual exclusiveness of the two parts of this classification for it made improvement the end and the test while it proclaimed liberty to be the means every thinker now perceives that the strongest and most durable influences in every western society lead in the direction of democracy and tend with more or less rapidity to throw the control of social organisation into the hands of numerical majorities there are many people who believe that if you only make the ruling body big enough it is sure to be either very wise itself or very eager to choose wise leaders mr mill as any one who is familiar with his writings is well aware did not hold this opinion he had no more partiality for mob rule than de maistre or goethe or mr carlyle he saw its evils more clearly than any of these eminent men because he had a more scientific eye and because he had had the invaluable training of a political administrator on a large scale and in a very responsible post but he did not content himself with seeing these evils and he wasted no energy in passionate denunciation of them which he knew must prove futile guizot said of de tocqueville that he was an aristocrat who accepted his defeat mr mill was too penetrated by popular sympathies to be an aristocrat in de tocquevilles sense but he likewise was full of ideas and hopes which the unchecked or undirected course of democracy would defeat without chance of reparation this fact he accepted and from this he started mr carlyle and one or two rhetorical imitators poured malediction on the manyheaded populace and with a rather pitiful impatience insisted that the only hope for men lay in their finding and obeying a strong man a king a hero a dictator how he was to be found neither the master nor his still angrier and more impatient mimics could ever tell us  now mr mills doctrine laid down the main condition of finding your hero namely that all ways should be left open to him because no man nor majority of men could possibly tell by which of these ways their deliverers were from time to time destined to present themselves wits have caricatured all this by asking us whether by encouraging the tares to grow you give the wheat a better chance this is as misleading as such metaphors usually are the doctrine of liberty rests on a faith drawn from the observation of human progress that though we know wheat to be serviceable and tares to be worthless yet there are in the great seedplot of human nature a thousand rudimentary germs not wheat and not tares of whose properties we have not had a fair opportunity of assuring ourselves if you are too eager to pluck up the tares you are very likely to pluck up with them these untried possibilities of human excellence and you are moreover very likely to injure the growing wheat as well the demonstration of this lies in the recorded experience of mankind   nor is this all mr mills doctrine does not lend the least countenance to the cardinal opinion of some writers in the last century that the only need of human character and of social institutions is to be let alone he never said that we were to leave the ground uncultivated to bring up whatever might chance to grow on the contrary the ground was to be cultivated with the utmost care and knowledge with a view to prevent the growth of taresbut cultivated in a certain manner you may take the method of the inquisition of the more cruel of the puritans of de maistre of mr carlyle or you may take mr mills method of cultivation according to the doctrine of liberty we are to devote ourselves to prevention as the surest and most wholesome mode of extirpation persuade argue cherish virtuous example bring up the young in habits of right opinion and right motive shape your social arrangements so as to stimulate the best parts of character by these means you will gain all the advantages that could possibly have come of heroes and legislative dragooning as well as a great many more which neither heroes nor legislative dragooning could ever have secured  it is well with men mr mill said moreover in proportion as they respect truth now they at once prove and strengthen their respect for truth by having an open mind to all its possibilities while at the same time they hold firmly to their own proved convictions until they hear better evidence to the contrary there is no anarchy nor uncertainty nor paralysing air of provisionalness in such a frame of mind so far is it from being fatal to loyalty or reverence that it is an indispensable part of the groundwork of the only loyalty that a wise ruler or teacher would care to inspirethe loyalty springing from a rational conviction that in a field open to all comers he is the best man they can find only on condition of liberty without limit is the ablest and most helpful of heroes sure to be found and only on condition of liberty without limit are his followers sure to be worthy of him you must have authority and yet must have obedience the noblest and deepest and most beneficent kind of authority is that which rests on an obedience that is rational and spontaneous   the same futile impatience which animates the political utterances of mr carlyle and his more weakvoiced imitators takes another form in men of a different training or temperament they insist that if the majority has the means of preventing vice by law it is folly and weakness not to resort to those means the superficial attractiveness of such a doctrine is obvious the doctrine of liberty implies a broader and a more patient view it sayseven if you could be sure that what you take for vice is soand the history of persecution shows how careful you should be in this preliminary pointeven then it is an undoubted and indeed a necessary tendency of this facile repressive legislation to make those who resort to it neglect the more effective humane and durable kinds of preventive legislation you pass a law if you can putting down drunkenness there is a neatness in such a method very attractive to fervid and impatient natures would you not have done better to leave that law unpassed and apply yourselves sedulously instead to the improvement of the dwellings of the more drunken class to the provision of amusements that might compete with the alehouse to the extension and elevation of instruction and so on you may say that this should be done and yet the other should not be left undone but as matter of fact and history the doing of the one has always gone with the neglect of the other and ascetic lawmaking in the interests of virtue has never been accompanied either by lawmaking or any other kinds of activity for making virtue easier or more attractive it is the recognition how little punishment can do that leaves men free to see how much social prevention can do i believe then that what seems to the criminal lawyers and passionate philanthropists selfevident is in truth an illusion springing from a very shallow kind of impatience
