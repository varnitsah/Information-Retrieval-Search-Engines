83183756	the man who would be king            by        rudyard kipling     published by brentano’s at 31 union square new york    the man who would                be king  “brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy”  the law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to follow i have been fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other was worthy i have still to be brother to a prince though i once came near to kinship with what might have been a veritable king and was promised the reversion of a kingdom —army lawcourts revenue and policy all complete but today i greatly fear that my king is dead and if i want a crown i must go and hunt it for myself  the beginning of everything was in a railway train upon the road to mhow from ajmir there had been a deficit in the budget which necessitated travelling not secondclass which is only half as dear as firstclass but by intermediate which is very awful indeed there are no cushions in the intermediate class and the population are either intermediate which is eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty or loafer which is amusing though intoxicated intermediates do not patronize refreshmentrooms they carry their food in bundles and pots and buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside water that is why in the hot weather intermediates are taken out of the carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon  my particular intermediate happened to be empty till i reached nasirabad when a huge gentleman in shirtsleeves entered and following the custom of intermediates passed the time of day he was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated taste for whiskey he told tales of things he had seen and done of outoftheway corners of the empire into which he had penetrated and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days’ food “if india was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than the crows where they’d get their next day’s rations it isn’t seventy millions of revenue the land would be paying—it’s seven hundred million” said he and as i looked at his mouth and chin i was disposed to agree with him we talked politics—the politics of loaferdom that sees things from the underside where the lath and plaster is not smoothed off—and we talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram back from the next station to ajmir which is the turningoff place from the bombay to the mhow line as you travel westward my friend had no money beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and i had no money at all owing to the hitch in the budget before mentioned further i was going into a wilderness where though i should resume touch with the treasury there were no telegraph offices i was therefore unable to help him in any way  “we might threaten a stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick” said my friend “but that’d mean inquiries for you and for me and i’ve got my hands full these days did you say you are travelling back along this line within any days”  “within ten” i said  “can’t you make it eight” said he “mine is rather urgent business”  “i can send your telegram within ten days if that will serve you” i said  “i couldn’t trust the wire to fetch him now i think of it it’s this way he leaves delhi on the 23d for bombay that means he’ll be running through ajmir about the night of the 23d”  “but i’m going into the indian desert” i explained  “well and good” said he “you’ll be changing at marwar junction to get into jodhpore territory—you must do that—and he’ll be coming through marwar junction in the early morning of the 24th by the bombay mail can you be at marwar junction on that time ’twon’t be inconveniencing you because i know that there’s precious few pickings to be got out of these central india states—even though you pretend to be correspondent of the backwoodsman”  “have you ever tried that trick” i asked  “again and again but the residents find you out and then you get escorted to the border before you’ve time to get your knife into them but about my friend here i must give him a word o’ mouth to tell him what’s come to me or else he won’t know where to go i would take it more than kind of you if you was to come out of central india in time to catch him at marwar junction and say to him—‘he has gone south for the week’ he’ll know what that means he’s a big man with a red beard and a great swell he is you’ll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him in a secondclass compartment but don’t you be afraid slip down the window and say—‘he has gone south for the week’ and he’ll tumble it’s only cutting your time of stay in those parts by two days i ask you as a stranger—going to the west” he said with emphasis  “where have you come from” said i  “from the east” said he “and i am hoping that you will give him the message on the square—for the sake of my mother as well as your own”  englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent  i saw fit to agree  “it’s more than a little matter” said he “and that’s why i ask you to do it—and now i know that i can depend on you doing it a secondclass carriage at marwar junction and a redhaired man asleep in it you’ll be sure to remember i get out at the next station and i must hold on there till he comes or sends me what i want”  “i’ll give the message if i catch him” i said “and for the sake of your mother as well as mine i’ll give you a word of advice don’t try to run the central india states just now as the correspondent of the backwoodsman there’s a real one knocking about here and it might lead to trouble”  “thank you” said he simply “and when will the swine be gone i can’t starve because he’s ruining my work i wanted to get hold of the degumber rajah down here about his father’s widow and give him a jump”  “what did he do to his father’s widow then”  “filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung from a beam i found that out myself and i’m the only man that would dare going into the state to get hushmoney for it they’ll try to poison me same as they did in chortumna when i went on the loot there but you’ll give the man at marwar junction my message”  he got out at a little roadside station and i reflected i had heard more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and bleeding small native states with threats of exposure but i had never met any of the caste before they lead a hard life and generally die with great suddenness the native states have a wholesome horror of english newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne or drive them out of their mind with fourinhand barouches they do not understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration of native states so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end of the year to the other native states were created by providence in order to supply picturesque scenery tigers and tallwriting they are the dark places of the earth full of unimaginable cruelty touching the railway and the telegraph on one side and on the other the days of harunalraschid when i left the train i did business with divers kings and in eight days passed through many changes of life sometimes i wore dressclothes and consorted with princes and politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver sometimes i lay out upon the ground and devoured what i could get from a plate made of a flapjack and drank the running water and slept under the same rug as my servant it was all in a day’s work  then i headed for the great indian desert upon the proper date as i had promised and the night mail set me down at marwar junction where a funny little happygolucky native managed railway runs to jodhpore the bombay mail from delhi makes a short halt at marwar she arrived as i got in and i had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the carriages there was only one secondclass on the train i slipped the window and looked down upon a flaming red beard half covered by a railway rug that was my man fast asleep and i dug him gently in the ribs he woke with a grunt and i saw his face in the light of the lamps it was a great and shining face  “tickets again” said he  “no” said i “i am to tell you that he is gone south for the week he is gone south for the week”  the train had begun to move out the red man rubbed his eyes “he has gone south for the week” he repeated “now that’s just like his impudence did he say that i was to give you anything—’cause i won’t”  “he didn’t” i said and dropped away and watched the red lights die out in the dark it was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off the sands i climbed into my own train—not an intermediate carriage this time—and went to sleep  if the man with the beard had given me a rupee i should have kept it as a memento of a rather curious affair but the consciousness of having done my duty was my only reward  later on i reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers and might if they “stuck up” one of the little rattrap states of central india or southern rajputana get themselves into serious difficulties i therefore took some trouble to describe them as accurately as i could remember to people who would be interested in deporting them and succeeded so i was later informed in having them headed back from the degumber borders  then i became respectable and returned to an office where there were no kings and no incidents except the daily manufacture of a newspaper a newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to the prejudice of discipline zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that the editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a christian prizegiving in a backslum of a perfectly inaccessible village colonels who have been overpassed for commands sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten twelve or twentyfour leading articles on

punkahpulling machines carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal teacompanies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens secretaries of ballcommittees clamor to have the glories of their last dance more fully expounded strange ladies rustle in and say—“i want a hundred lady’s cards printed at once please” which is manifestly part of an editor’s duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the grand trunk road makes it his business to ask for employment as a proofreader and all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly and kings are being killed on the continent and empires are saying “you’re another” and mister gladstone is calling down brimstone upon the british dominions and the little black copyboys are whining “kaapi chayhayeh” copy wanted like tired bees and most of the paper is as blank as modred’s shield  but that is the amusing part of the year there are other six months wherein none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above reading light and the press machines are redhot of touch and nobody writes anything but accounts of amusements in the hillstations or obituary notices then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew intimately and the pricklyheat covers you as with a garment and you sit down and write—“a slight increase of sickness is reported from the khuda janta khan district the outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the district authorities is now almost at an end it is however with deep regret we record the death etc”  then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers but the empires and the kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and the foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twentyfour hours and all the people at the hillstations in the middle of their amusements say—“good gracious why can’t the paper be sparkling i’m sure there’s plenty going on up here”  that is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say “must be experienced to be appreciated”  it was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper began running the last issue of the week on saturday night which is to say sunday morning after the custom of a london paper this was a great convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn would lower the thermometer from 96° to almost 84° for almost half an hour and in that chill—you have no idea how cold is 84° on the grass until you begin to pray for it—a very tired man could set off to sleep ere the heat roused him  one saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone a king or courtier or a courtesan or a community was going to die or get a new constitution or do something that was important on the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram it was a pitchy black night as stifling as a june night can be and the loo the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence it was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so i sat there while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their foreheads and called for water the thing that was keeping us back whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat with its finger on its lip to wait the event i drowsed and wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or struggling people was aware of the inconvenience the delay was causing there was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension but as the clockhands crept up to three o’clock and the machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was in order before i said the word that would set them off i could have shrieked aloud  then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little bits i rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front of me the first one said—“it’s him” the second said —“so it is” and they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped their foreheads “we see there was a light burning across the road and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and i said to my friend here the office is open let’s come along and speak to him as turned us back from the degumber state” said the smaller of the two he was the man i had met in the mhow train and his fellow was the redbearded man of marwar junction there was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one or the beard of the other  i was not pleased because i wished to go to sleep not to squabble with loafers “what do you want” i asked  “half an hour’s talk with you cool and comfortable in the office” said the redbearded man “we’d like some drink—the contrack doesn’t begin yet peachey so you needn’t look—but what we really want is advice we don’t want money we ask you as a favor because you did us a bad turn about degumber”  i led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands “that’s something like” said he “this was the proper shop to come to now sir let me introduce to you brother peachey carnehan that’s him and brother daniel dravot that is me and the less said about our professions the better for we have been most things in our time soldier sailor compositor photographer proofreader streetpreacher and correspondents of the backwoodsman when we thought the paper wanted one carnehan is sober and so am i look at us first and see that’s sure it will save you cutting into my talk we’ll take one of your cigars apiece and you shall see us light” i watched the test the men were absolutely sober so i gave them each a tepid peg  “well and good” said carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth from his mustache “let me talk now dan we have been all over india mostly on foot we have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty contractors and all that and we have decided that india isn’t big enough for such as us”  they certainly were too big for the office dravot’s beard seemed to fill half the room and carnehan’s shoulders the other half as they sat on the big table carnehan continued —“the country isn’t half worked out because they that governs it won’t let you touch it they spend all their blessed time in governing it and you can’t lift a spade nor chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the government saying—‘leave it alone and let us govern’ therefore such as it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where a man isn’t crowded and can come to his own we are not little men and there is nothing that we are afraid of except drink and we have signed a contrack on that therefore we are going away to be kings”  “kings in our own right” muttered dravot  “yes of course” i said “you’ve been tramping in the sun and it’s a very warm night and hadn’t you better sleep over the notion come tomorrow”  “neither drunk nor sunstruck” said dravot “we have slept over the notion half a year and require to see books and atlases and we have decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong men can sarawhack they call it kafiristan by my reckoning its the top righthand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred miles from peshawar they have two and thirty heathen idols there and we’ll be the thirtythird it’s a mountainous country and the women of those parts are very beautiful”  “but that is provided against in the contrack” said carnehan “neither women nor liquor daniel”  “and that’s all we know except that no one has gone there and they fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king we shall go to those parts and say to any king we find—‘d’ you want to vanquish your foes’ and we will show him how to drill men for that we know better than anything else then we will subvert that king and seize his throne and establish a dynasty”  “you’ll be cut to pieces before you’re fifty miles across the border” i said “you have to travel through afghanistan to get to that country it’s one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no englishman has been through it the people are utter brutes and even if you reached them you couldn’t do anything”  “that’s more like” said carnehan “if you could think us a little more mad we would be more pleased we have come to you to know about this country to read a book about it and to be shown maps we want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books” he turned to the bookcases  “are you at all in earnest” i said  “a little” said dravot sweetly “as big a map as you have got even if it’s all blank where kafiristan is and any books you’ve got we can read though we aren’t very educated”  i uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of india and two smaller frontier maps hauled down volume infkan of the encyclopædia britannica and the men consulted them  “see here” said dravot his thumb on the map “up to jagdallak peachey and me know the road we was there with roberts’s army we’ll have to turn off to the right at jagdallak through laghmann territory then we get among the hills— fourteen thousand feet—fifteen thousand— it will be cold work there but it don’t look very far on the map”  i handed him wood on the sources of the oxus carnehan was deep in the encyclopædia  “they’re a mixed lot” said dravot reflectively “and it won’t help us to know the names of their tribes the more tribes the more they’ll fight and the better for us from jagdallak to ashang h’mm”  “but all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate as can be” i protested “no one knows anything about it really here’s the file of the united services’ institute read what bellew says”  “blow bellew” said carnehan “dan they’re an allfired lot of heathens but this book here says they think they’re related to us english”  i smoked while the men pored over raverty wood the maps and the encyclopædia  “there is no use your waiting” said dravot politely “it’s about four o’clock now we’ll go before six o’clock if you want to sleep and we won’t steal any of the papers don’t you sit up we’re two harmless lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the serai we’ll say goodby to you”  “you are two fools” i answered “you’ll be turned back at the frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in afghanistan do you want any money or a recommendation downcountry i can help you to the chance of work next week”  “next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you” said dravot “it isn’t so easy being a king as it looks when we’ve got our kingdom in going order we’ll let you know and you can come up and help us to govern it”  “would two lunatics make a contrack like that” said carnehan with subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was written the following i copied it then and there as a curiosity—  this contract between me and you persuing witnesseth in the name of god—amen and so forth   one that me and you will settle this matter together           ie to be kings of kafiristan   two that you and me will not while this matter is           being settled look at any liquor nor any           woman black white or brown so as to get           mixed up with one or the other harmful   three that we conduct ourselves with dignity and           discretion and if one of us gets into trouble           the other will stay by him    signed by you and me this day           peachey taliaferro carnehan           daniel dravot           both gentlemen at large  “there was no need for the last article” said carnehan blushing modestly “but it looks regular now you know the sort of men that loafers are—we are loafers dan until we get out of india—and do you think that we could sign a contrack like that unless we was in earnest we have kept away from the two things that make life worth having”  “you won’t enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this idiotic adventure don’t set the office on fire” i said “and go away before nine o’clock”  i left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of the “contrack” “be sure to come down to the serai tomorrow” were their parting words  the kumharsen serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the strings of camels and horses from the north load and unload all the nationalities of central asia may be found there and most of the folk of india proper balkh and bokhara there meet bengal and bombay and try to draw eyeteeth you can buy ponies turquoises persian pussycats saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the kumharsen serai and get many strange things for nothing in the afternoon i went down there to see whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying about drunk  a priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me gravely twisting a child’s paper whirligig behind him was his servant bending under the load of a crate of mud toys the two were loading up two camels and the inhabitants of the serai watched them with shrieks of laughter  “the priest is mad” said a horsedealer to me “he is going up to kabul to sell toys to the amir he will either be raised to honor or have his head cut off he came in here this morning and has been behaving madly ever since”  “the witless are under the protection of god” stammered a flatcheeked usbeg in broken hindi “they foretell future events”  “would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up by the shinwaris almost within shadow of the pass” grunted the eusufzai agent of a rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been feloniously diverted into the hands of other robbers just across the border and whose misfortunes were the laughingstock of the bazar “ohé priest whence come you and whither do you go”  “from roum have i come” shouted the priest waving his whirligig “from roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea o thieves robbers liars the blessing of pir khan on pigs dogs and perjurers who will take the protected of god to the north to sell charms that are never still to the amir the camels shall not gall the sons shall not fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away of the men who give me place in their caravan who will assist me to slipper the king of the roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel the protection of pir kahn be upon his labors” he spread out the skirts of his gaberdine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered horses  “there starts a caravan from peshawar to kabul in twenty days huzrut” said the eusufzai trader “my camels go therewith do thou also go and bring us good luck”  “i will go even now” shouted the priest “i will depart upon my winged camels and be at peshawar in a day ho hazar mir khan” he yelled to his servant “drive out the camels but let me first mount my own”  he leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to me cried—  “come thou also sahib a little along the road and i will sell thee a charm—an amulet that shall make thee king of kafiristan”  then the light broke upon me and i followed the two camels out of the serai till we reached open road and the priest halted  “what d’ you think o’ that” said he in english “carnehan can’t talk their patter so i’ve made him my servant he makes a handsome servant ’tisn’t for nothing that i’ve been knocking about the country for fourteen years didn’t i do that talk neat we’ll hitch on to a caravan at peshawar till we get to jagdallak and then we’ll see if we can get donkeys for our camels and strike into kafiristan whirligigs for the amir o lor put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you feel”  i felt the butt of a martini and another and another  “twenty of ’em” said dravot placidly  “twenty of ’em and ammunition to correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls”  “heaven help you if you are caught with those things” i said “a martini is worth her weight in silver among the pathans”  “fifteen hundred rupees of capital—every rupee we could beg borrow or steal—are invested on these two camels” said dravot “we won’t get caught we’re going through the khaiber with a regular caravan who’d touch a poor mad priest”  “have you got everything you want” i asked overcome with astonishment  “not yet but we shall soon give us a momento of your kindness brother you did me a service yesterday and that time in marwar half my kingdom shall you have as the saying is” i slipped a small charm compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest  “goodby” said dravot giving me his hand cautiously “it’s the last time we’ll shake hands with an englishman these many days shake hands with him carnehan” he cried as the second camel passed me  carnehan leaned down and shook hands then the camels passed away along the dusty road and i was left alone to wonder my eye could detect no failure in the disguises the scene in the serai attested that they were complete to the native mind there was just the chance therefore that carnehan and dravot would be able to wander through afghanistan without detection but beyond they would find death certain and awful death  ten days later a native friend of mine giving me the news of the day from peshawar wound up his letter with—“there has been much laughter here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as great charms to h h the amir of bokhara he passed through peshawar and associated himself to the second summer caravan that goes to kabul the merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellows bring goodfortune”  the two then were beyond the border i would have prayed for them but that night a real king died in europe and demanded an obituary notice                                            the wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again the daily paper continued and i with it and upon the third summer there fell a hot night a nightissue and a strained waiting for something to be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened before a few great men had died in the past two years the machines worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller but that was all the difference  i passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as i have already described the nervous tension was stronger than it had been two years before and i felt the heat more acutely at three o’clock i cried “print off” and turned to go when there crept to my chair what was left of a man he was bent into a circle his head was sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other like a bear i could hardly see whether he walked or crawled—this ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he was come back “can you give me a drink” he whimpered “for the lord’s sake give me a drink”  i went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and i turned up the lamp  “don’t you know me” he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his drawn face surmounted by a shock of gray hair to the light  i looked at him intently once before had i seen eyebrows that met over the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me i could not tell where  “i don’t know you” i said handing him the whiskey “what can i do for you”  he took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the suffocating heat  “i’ve come back” he repeated “and i was the king of kafiristan—me and dravot —crowned kings we was in this office we settled it—you setting there and giving us the books i am peachey—peachey taliaferro carnehan and you’ve been setting here ever since—o lord”  i was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings accordingly  “it’s true” said carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which were wrapped in rags “true as gospel kings we were with crowns upon our heads—me and dravot —poor dan—oh poor poor dan that would never take advice not though i begged of him”  “take the whiskey” i said “and take your own time tell me all you can recollect of everything from beginning to end you got across the border on your camels dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant do you remember that”  “i ain’t mad—yet but i will be that way soon of course i remember keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces keep looking at me in my eyes and don’t say anything”  i leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as i could he dropped one hand upon the table and i grasped it by the wrist it was twisted like a bird’s claw and upon the back was a ragged red diamondshaped scar  “no don’t look there look at me” said carnehan  “that comes afterwards but for the lord’s sake don’t distrack me we left with that caravan me and dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinners—cooking their dinners and … what did they do then they lit little fires with sparks that went into dravot’s beard and we all laughed—fit to die little red fires they was going into dravot’s big red beard—so funny” his eyes left mine and he smiled foolishly  “you went as far as jagdallak with that caravan” i said at a venture “after you had lit those fires to jagdallak where you turned off to try to get into kafiristan”  “no we didn’t neither what are you talking about we turned off before jagdallak because we heard the roads was good but they wasn’t good enough for our two camels—mine and dravot’s when we left the caravan dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would be heathen because the kafirs didn’t allow mohammedans to talk to them so we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravot i never saw yet nor expect to see again he burned half his beard and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns he shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like a heathen that was in a most mountaineous country and our camels couldn’t go along any more because of the mountains they were tall and black and coming home i saw them fight like wild goats—there are lots of goats in kafiristan and these mountains they never keep still no more than the goats always fighting they are and don’t let you sleep at night”  “take some more whiskey” i said very slowly “what did you and daniel dravot do when the camels could go no further because of the rough roads that led into kafiristan”  “what did which do there was a party called peachey taliaferro carnehan that was with dravot shall i tell you about him he died out there in the cold slap from the bridge fell old peachey turning and twisting in the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amir—no they was two for three ha’pence those whirligigs or i am much mistaken and woful sore and then these camels were no use and peachey said to dravot—‘for the lord’s sake let’s get out of this before our heads are chopped off’ and with that they killed the camels all among the mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along driving four mules dravot up and dances in front of them singing—‘sell me four mules’ says the first man—‘if you are rich enough to buy you are rich enough to rob’ but before ever he could put his hand to his knife dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party runs away so carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the camels and together we starts forward into those bitter cold mountainous parts and never a road broader than the back of your hand”  he paused for a moment while i asked him if he could remember the nature of the country through which he had journeyed  “i am telling you as straight as i can but my head isn’t as good as it might be they drove nails through it to make me hear better how dravot died the country was mountainous and the mules were most contrary and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary they went up and up and down and down and that other party carnehan was imploring of dravot not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus avalanches but dravot says that if a king couldn’t sing it wasn’t worth being king and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no heed for ten cold days we came to a big level valley all among the mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having anything in special for them or us to eat we sat upon the boxes and played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out  “then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus they was fair men—fairer than you or me—with yellow hair and remarkable well built says dravot unpacking the guns—‘this is the beginning of the business we’ll fight for the ten men’ and with that he fires two rifles at the twenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock where we was sitting the other men began to run but carnehan and dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down the valley then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too and they fires a footy little arrow at us dravot he shoots above their heads and they all falls down flat then he walks over them and kicks them and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all around to make them friendly like he calls them and gives them the boxes to carry and waves his hand for all the world as though he was king already they takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols dravot he goes to the biggest—a fellow they call imbra—and lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectful with his own nose patting him on the head and saluting in front of it he turns round to the men and nods his head and says—‘that’s all right i’m in the know too and these old jimjams are my friends’ then he opens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings him food he says—‘no’ and when the second man brings him food he says— ‘no’ but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food he says—‘yes’ very haughty and eats it slow that was how we came to our first village without any trouble just as though we had tumbled from the skies but we tumbled from one of those damned ropebridges you see and you couldn’t expect a man to laugh much after that”  “take some more whiskey and go on” i said “that was the first village you came into how did you get to be king”  “i wasn’t king” said carnehan “dravot he was the king and a handsome man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all him and the other party stayed in that village and every morning dravot sat by the side of old imbra and the people came and worshipped that was dravot’s order then a lot of men came into the valley and carnehan and dravot picks them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their faces and dravot says— ‘now what is the trouble between you two villages’ and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that was carried off and dravot takes her back to the first village and counts up the dead—eight there was for each dead man dravot pours a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and ‘that’s all right’ says he then he and carnehan takes the big boss of each village by the arm and walks them down into the valley and shows them how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each a sod of turf from both sides o’ the line then all the people comes down and shouts like the devil and all and dravot says—‘go and dig the land and be fruitful and multiply’ which they did though they didn’t understand then we asks the names of things in their lingo—bread and water and fire and idols and such and dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot  “next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and told dravot in dumb show what it was about ‘that’s just the beginning’ says dravot ‘they think we’re gods’ he and carnehan picks out twenty good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see the hang of it then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to see what was to be done in the next valley that was all rock and there was a little village there and carnehan says— ‘send ’em to the old valley to plant’ and takes ’em there and gives ’em some land that wasn’t took before they were a poor lot and we blooded ’em with a kid before letting ’em into the new kingdom that was to impress the people and then they settled down quiet and carnehan went back to dravot who had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountainous there was no people there and the army got afraid so dravot shoots one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks we makes friends with the priest and i stays there alone with two of the army teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was a new god kicking about carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of them then he sends a message to the chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind the chief comes alone first and carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as dravot used and very much surprised that chief was and strokes my eyebrows then carnehan goes alone to the chief and asks him in dumb show if he had an enemy he hated ‘i have’ says the chief so carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the army to show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manœuvre about as well as volunteers so he marches with the chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain and the chiefs men rushes into a village and takes it we three martinis firing into the brown of the enemy so we took that village too and i gives the chief a rag from my coat and says ‘occupy till i come’ which was scriptural by way of a reminder when me and the army was eighteen hundred yards away i drops a bullet near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their faces then i sends a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or by sea”  at the risk of throwing the creature out of train i interrupted—“how could you write a letter up yonder”  “the letter—oh — the letter keep looking at me between the eyes please it was a stringtalk letter that we’d learned the way of it from a blind beggar in the punjab”  i remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig according to some cypher of his own he could after the lapse of days or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up he had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his method but failed  “i sent that letter to dravot” said carnehan “and told him to come back because this kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then i struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working they called the village we took along with the chief bashkai and the first village we took erheb the priest at erheb was doing all right but they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night i went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards that used all the cartridges i cared to spend and i waited for dravot who had been away two or three months and i kept my people quiet  “one morning i heard the devil’s own noise of drums and horns and dan dravot marches down the hill with his army and a tail of hundreds of men and which was the most amazing—a great gold crown on his head ‘my gord carnehan’ says daniel ‘this is a tremenjus business and we’ve got the whole country as far as it’s worth having i am the son of alexander by queen semiramis and you’re my younger brother and a god too it’s the biggest thing we’ve ever seen i’ve been marching and fighting for six weeks with the army and every footy little village for fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that i’ve got the key of the whole show as you’ll see and i’ve got a crown for you i told ’em to make two of ’em at a place called shu where the gold lies in the rock like suet in mutton gold i’ve seen and turquoise i’ve kicked out of the cliffs and there’s garnets in the sands of the river and here’s a chunk of amber that a man brought me call up all the priests and here take your crown’  “one of the men opens a black hair bag and i slips the crown on it was too small and too heavy but i wore it for the glory hammered gold it was—five pound weight like a hoop of a barrel  “‘peachey’ says dravot ‘we don’t want to fight no more the craft’s the trick so help me’ and he brings forward that same chief that i left at bashkai—billy fish we called him afterwards because he was so like billy fish that drove the big tankengine at mach on the bolan in the old days ‘shake hands with him’ says dravot and i shook hands and nearly dropped for billy fish gave me the grip i said nothing but tried him with the fellow craft grip he answers all right and i tried the master’s grip but that was a slip ‘a fellow craft he is’ i says to dan ‘does he know the word’ ‘he does’ says dan ‘and all the priests know it’s a miracle the chiefs and the priest can work a fellow craft lodge in a way that’s very like ours and they’ve cut the marks on the rocks but they don’t know the third degree and they’ve come to find out it’s gord’s truth i’ve known these long years that the afghans knew up to the fellow craft degree but this is a miracle a god and a grandmaster of the craft am i and a lodge in the third degree i will open and we’ll raise the head priests and the chiefs of the villages’  “‘it’s against all the law’ i says ‘holding a lodge without warrant from any one and we never held office in any lodge’  “‘it’s a masterstroke of policy’ says dravot ‘it means running the country as easy as a fourwheeled bogy on a down grade we can’t stop to inquire now or they’ll turn against us i’ve forty chiefs at my heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a lodge of some kind the temple of imbra will do for the lodgeroom the women must make aprons as you show them i’ll hold a levee of chiefs tonight and lodge tomorrow’  “i was fair rim off my legs but i wasn’t such a fool as not to see what a pull this craft business gave us i showed the priests’ families how to make aprons of the degrees but for dravot’s apron the blue border and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth we took a great square stone in the temple for the master’s chair and little stones for the officers’ chairs and painted the black pavement with white squares and did what we could to make things regular  “at the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big bonfires dravot gives out that him and me were gods and sons of alexander and past grandmasters in the craft and was come to make kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet and specially obey us then the chiefs come round to shake hands and they was so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends we gave them names according as they was like men we had known in india—billy fish holly dilworth pikky kergan that was bazarmaster when i was at mhow and so on and so on  “the most amazing miracle was at lodge next night one of the old priests was watching us continuous and i felt uneasy for i knew we’d have to fudge the ritual and i didn’t know what the men knew the old priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of bashkai the minute dravot puts on the master’s apron that the girls had made for him the priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the stone that dravot was sitting on ‘it’s all up now’ i says ‘that comes of meddling with the craft without warrant’ dravot never winked an eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the grandmaster’s chair —which was to say the stone of imbra the priest begins rubbing the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he shows all the other priests the master’s mark same as was on dravot’s apron cut into the stone not even the priests of the temple of imbra knew it was there the old chap falls flat on his face at dravot’s feet and kisses ’em ‘luck again’ says dravot across the lodge to me ‘they say it’s the missing mark that no one could understand the why of we’re more than safe now’ then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel and says—‘by virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right hand and the help of peachey i declare myself grandmaster of all freemasonry in kafiristan in this the mother lodge o’ the country and king of kafiristan equally with peachey’ at that he puts on his crown and i puts on mine—i was doing senior warden—and we opens the lodge in most ample form it was a amazing miracle the priests moved in lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the memory was coming back to them after that peachey and dravot raised such as was worthy— high priests and chiefs of faroff villages billy fish was the first and i can tell you we scared the soul out of him it was not in any way according to ritual but it served our turn we didn’t raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didn’t want to make the degree common and they was clamoring to be raised  “‘in another six months’ says dravot ‘we’ll hold another communication and see how you are working’ then he asks them about their villages and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were fair sick and tired of it and when they wasn’t doing that they was fighting with the mohammedans ‘you can fight those when they come into our country’ says dravot ‘tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a frontier guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well and i know that you won’t cheat me because you’re white people—sons of alexander—and not like common black mohammedans you are my people and by god’ says he running off into english at the end—‘i’ll make a damned fine nation of you or i’ll die in the making’  “i can’t tell all we did for the next six months because dravot did a lot i couldn’t see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way i never could my work was to help the people plough and now and again to go out with some of the army and see what the other villages were doing and make ’em throw ropebridges across the ravines which cut up the country horrid dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both fists i knew he was thinking plans i could not advise him about and i just waited for orders  “but dravot never showed me disrespect before the people they were afraid of me and the army but they loved dan he was the best of friends with the priests and the chiefs but any one could come across the hills with a complaint and dravot would hear him out fair and call four priests together and say what was to be done he used to call in billy fish from bashkai and pikky kergan from shu and an old chief we called kafuzelum—it was like enough to his real name—and hold councils with ’em when there was any fighting to be done in small villages that was his council of war and the four priests of bashkai shu khawak and madora was his privy council between the lot of ’em they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men carrying turquoises into the ghorband country to buy those handmade martini rifles that come out of the amir’s workshops at kabul from one of the amir’s herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their mouths for turquoises  “i stayed in ghorband a month and gave the governor the pick of my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the colonel of the regiment some more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a hundred handmade martinis a hundred good kohat jezails that’ll throw to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for the rifles i came back with what i had and distributed ’em among the men that the chiefs sent in to me to drill dravot was too busy to attend to those things but the old army that we first made helped me and we turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred that knew how to hold arms pretty straight even those corkscrewed handmade guns was a miracle to them dravot talked big about powdershops and factories walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was coming on  “‘i won’t make a nation’ says he ‘i’ll make an empire these men aren’t niggers they’re english look at their eyes— look at their mouths look at the way they stand up they sit on chairs in their own houses they’re the lost tribes or something like it and they’ve grown to be english i’ll take a census in the spring if the priests don’t get frightened there must be a fair two million of ’em in these hills the villages are full o’ little children two million people—two hundred and fifty thousand fighting men—and all english  they only want the rifles and a little drilling two hundred and fifty thousand men ready to cut in on russia’s right flank when she tries for india peachey man’ he says chewing his beard in great hunks ‘we shall be emperors —emperors of the earth  rajah brooke will be a suckling to us i’ll treat with the viceroy on equal terms i’ll ask him to send me twelve picked english— twelve that i know of—to help us govern a bit there’s mackray sergeantpensioner at segowli—many’s the good dinner he’s given me and his wife a pair of trousers there’s donkin the warder of tounghoo jail there’s hundreds that i could lay my hand on if i was in india the viceroy shall do it for me i’ll send a man through in the spring for those men and i’ll write for a dispensation from the grand lodge for what i’ve done as grandmaster that—and all the sniders that’ll be thrown out when the native troops in india take up the martini they’ll be worn smooth but they’ll do for fighting in these hills twelve english a hundred thousand sniders run through the amir’s country in driblets—i’d be content with twenty thousand in one year—and we’d be an empire when everything was shipshape i’d hand over the crown—this crown i’m wearing now—to queen victoria on my knees and she’d say—“rise up sir daniel dravot” oh its big it’s big i tell you but there’s so much to be done in every place—bashkai khawak shu and everywhere else’  “‘what is it’ i says ‘there are no more men coming in to be drilled this autumn look at those fat black clouds they’re bringing the snow’  “‘it isn’t that’ says daniel putting his hand very hard on my shoulder ‘and i don’t wish to say anything that’s against you for no other living man would have followed me and made me what i am as you have done you’re a firstclass commanderinchief and the people know you but—it’s a big country and somehow you can’t help me peachey in the way i want to be helped’  “‘go to your blasted priests then’ i said and i was sorry when i made that remark but it did hurt me sore to find daniel talking so superior when i’d drilled all the men and done all he told me  “‘don’t let’s quarrel peachey’ says daniel without cursing ‘you’re a king too and the half of this kingdom is yours but can’t you see peachey we want cleverer men than us now—three or four of ‘em that we can scatter about for our deputies it’s a hugeous great state and i can’t always tell the right thing to do and i haven’t time for all i want to do and here’s the winter coming on and all’ he put half his beard into his mouth and it was as red as the gold of his crown  “‘i’m sorry daniel’ says i ‘i’ve done all i could i’ve drilled the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and i’ve brought in those tinware rifles from ghorband—but i know what you’re driving at i take it kings always feel oppressed that way’  “‘there’s another thing too’ says dravot walking up and down ‘the winter’s coming and these people won’t be giving much trouble and if they do we can’t move about i want a wife’  “‘for gord’s sake leave the women alone’ i says ‘we’ve both got all the work we can though i am a fool remember the contrack and keep clear o’ women’  “‘the contrack only lasted till such time as we was kings and kings we have been these months past’ says dravot weighing his crown in his hand ‘you go get a wife too peachey—a nice strappin’ plump girl that’ll keep you warm in the winter they’re prettier than english girls and we can take the pick of ’em boil ’em once or twice in hot water and they’ll come as fair as chicken and ham’  “‘don’t tempt me’ i says ‘i will not have any dealings with a woman not till we are a dam’ side more settled than we are now i’ve been doing the work o’ two men and you’ve been doing the work o’ three let’s lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from afghan country and run in some good liquor but no women’  “‘who’s talking o’ women’ says dravot ‘i said wife—a queen to breed a king’s son for the king a queen out of the strongest tribe that’ll make them your bloodbrothers and that’ll lie by your side and tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs that’s what i want’  “‘do you remember that bengali woman i kept at mogul serai when i was platelayer’ says i ‘a fat lot o’ good she was to me she taught me the lingo and one or two other things but what happened she ran away with the station master’s servant and half my month’s pay then she turned up at dadur junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the impidence to say i was her husband —all among the drivers of the runningshed’  “‘we’ve done with that’ says dravot ‘these women are whiter than you or me and a queen i will have for the winter months’  “‘for the last time o’ asking dan do not’ i says ‘it’ll only bring us harm the bible says that kings ain’t to waste their strength on women ’specially when they’ve got a new raw kingdom to work over’  “‘for the last time of answering i will’ said dravot and he went away through the pinetrees looking like a big red devil the low sun hit his crown and beard on one side and the two blazed like hot coals  “but getting a wife was not as easy as dan thought he put it before the council and there was no answer till billy fish said that he’d better ask the girls dravot damned them all round ‘what’s wrong with me’ he shouts standing by the idol imbra ‘am i a dog or am i not enough of a man for your wenches haven’t i put the shadow of my hand over this country who stopped the last afghan raid’ it was me really but dravot was too angry to remember ‘who bought your guns who repaired the bridges who’s the grandmaster of the sign cut in the stone’ and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in lodge and at council which opened like lodge always billy fish said nothing and no more did the others ‘keep your hair on dan’ said i ‘and ask the girls that’s how it’s done at home and these people are quite english’  “‘the marriage of a king is a matter of state’ says dan in a whitehot rage for he could feel i hope that he was going against his better mind he walked out of the councilroom and the others sat still looking at the ground  “‘billy fish’ says i to the chief of bashkai ‘what’s the difficulty here a straight answer to a true friend’ ‘you know’ says billy fish ‘how should a man tell you who know everything how can daughters of men marry gods or devils it’s not proper’  “i remembered something like that in the bible but if after seeing us as long as they had they still believed we were gods it wasn’t for me to undeceive them  “‘a god can do anything’ says i ‘if the king is fond of a girl he’ll not let her die’ ‘she’ll have to’ said billy fish ‘there are all sorts of gods and devils in these mountains and now and again a girl marries one of them and isn’t seen any more besides you two know the mark cut in the stone only the gods know that we thought you were men till you showed the sign of the master’  “‘i wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine secrets of a mastermason at the first gooff but i said nothing all that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway down the hill and i heard a girl crying fit to die one of the priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the king  “‘i’ll have no nonsense of that kind’ says dan ‘i don’t want to interfere with your customs but i’ll take my own wife ‘the girl’s a little bit afraid’ says the priest ‘she thinks she’s going to die and they are aheartening of her up down in the temple’  “‘hearten her very tender then’ says dravot ‘or i’ll hearten you with the butt of a gun so that you’ll never want to be heartened again’ he licked his lips did dan and stayed up walking about more than half the night thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning i wasn’t any means comfortable for i knew that dealings with a woman in foreign parts though you was a crowned king twenty times over could not but be risky i got up very early in the morning while dravot was asleep and i saw the priests talking together in whispers and the chiefs talking together too and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes  “‘what is up fish’ i says to the bashkai man who was wrapped up in his furs and looking splendid to behold  “‘i can’t rightly say’ says he ‘but if you can induce the king to drop all this nonsense about marriage you’ll be doing him and me and yourself a great service’  “‘that i do believe’ says i ‘but sure you know billy as well as me having fought against and for us that the king and me are nothing more than two of the finest men that god almighty ever made nothing more i do assure you’  “‘that may be’ says billy fish ‘and yet i should be sorry if it was’ he sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks ‘king’ says he ‘be you man or god or devil i’ll stick by you today i have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me we’ll go to bashkai until the storm blows over’  “a little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north dravot came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his feet and looking more pleased than punch  “‘for the last time drop it dan’ says i in a whisper ‘billy fish here says that there will be a row’  “‘a row among my people’ says dravot ‘not much peachy you’re a fool not to get a wife too where’s the girl’ says he with a voice as loud as the braying of a jackass ‘call up all the chiefs and priests and let the emperor see if his wife suits him’  “there was no need to call any one they were all there leaning on their guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood a deputation of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the horns blew up fit to wake the dead billy fish saunters round and gets as close to daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with matchlocks not a man of them under six feet i was next to dravot and behind me was twenty men of the regular army up comes the girl and a strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white as death and looking back every minute at the priests  “‘she’ll do’ said dan looking her over ‘what’s to be afraid of lass come and kiss me’ he puts his arm round her she shuts her eyes gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of dan’s flaming red beard  “‘the slut’s bitten me’ says he clapping his hand to his neck and sure enough his hand was red with blood billy fish and two of his matchlockmen catches hold of dan by the shoulders and drags him into the bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingo—‘neither god nor devil but a man’ i was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in front and the army behind began firing into the bashkai men  “‘god amighty’ says dan ‘what is the meaning o’ this’  “‘come back come away’ says billy fish ‘ruin and mutiny is the matter we’ll break for bashkai if we can’  “i tried to give some sort of orders to my men—the men o’ the regular army—but it was no use so i fired into the brown of ’em with an english martini and drilled three beggars in a line the valley was full of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking ‘not a god nor a devil but only a man’ the bashkai troops stuck to billy fish all they were worth but their matchlocks wasn’t half as good as the kabul breechloaders and four of them dropped dan was bellowing like a bull for he was very wrathy and billy fish had a hard job to prevent him running out at the crowd  “‘we can’t stand’ says billy fish ‘make a run for it down the valley the whole place is against us’ the matchlockmen ran and we went down the valley in spite of dravot’s protestations he was swearing horribly and crying out that he was a king the priests rolled great stones on us and the regular army fired hard and there wasn’t more than six men not counting dan billy fish and me that came down to the bottom of the valley alive  “‘then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again ‘come away— for gord’s sake come away’ says billy fish ‘they’ll send runners out to all the villages before ever we get to bashkai i can protect you there but i can’t do anything now’  “my own notion is that dan began to go mad in his head from that hour he stared up and down like a stuck pig then he was all for walking back alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have done ‘an emperor am i’ says daniel ‘and next year i shall be a knight of the queen  “‘all right dan’ says i ‘but come along now while there’s time’  “‘it’s your fault’ says he ‘for not looking after your army better there was mutiny in the midst and you didn’t know —you damned enginedriving platelaying missionary’spasshunting hound’ he sat upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to i was too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought the smash  “‘i’m sorry dan’ says i ‘but there’s no accounting for natives this business is our fiftyseven maybe we’ll make something out of it yet when we’ve got to bashkai’  “‘let’s get to bashkai then’ says dan ‘and by god when i come back here again i’ll sweep the valley so there isn’t a bug in a blanket left’  “‘we walked all that day and all that night dan was stumping up and down on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself  “‘there’s no hope o’ getting clear’ said billy fish ‘the priests will have sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men why didn’t you stick on as gods till things was more settled i’m a dead man’ says billy fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to his gods  “next morning we was in a cruel bad country—all up and down no level ground at all and no food either the six bashkai men looked at billy fish hungrywise as if they wanted to ask something but they said never a word at noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an army in position waiting in the middle  “‘the runners have been very quick’ says billy fish with a little bit of a laugh ‘they are waiting for us’  “three or four men began to fire from the enemy’s side and a chance shot took daniel in the calf of the leg that brought him to his senses he looks across the snow at the army and sees the rifles that we had brought into the country  “‘we’re done for’ says he ‘they are englishmen these people—and it’s my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this get back billy fish and take your men away you’ve done what you could and now cut for it carnehan’ says he ‘shake hands with me and go along with billy maybe they won’t kill you i’ll go and meet ’em alone it’s me that did it me the king’  “‘go’ says i ‘go to hell dan i’m with you here billy fish you clear out and we two will meet those folk’  “‘i’m a chief’ says billy fish quite quiet ‘i stay with you my men can go’  “the bashkai fellows didn’t wait for a second word but ran off and dan and me and billy fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and the horns were horning it was coldawful cold i’ve got that cold in the back of my head now there’s a lump of it there”  the punkahcoolies had gone to sleep two kerosene lamps were blazing in the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the blotter as i leaned forward carnehan was shivering and i feared that his mind might go i wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands and said—“what happened after that”  the momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current  “what was you pleased to say” whined carnehan “they took them without any sound not a little whisper all along the snow not though the king knocked down the first man that set hand on him—not though old peachey fired his last cartridge into the brown of ’em not a single solitary sound did those swines make they just closed up tight and i tell you their furs stunk there was a man called billy fish a good friend of us all and they cut his throat sir then and there like a pig and the king kicks up the bloody snow and says—‘we’ve had a dashed fine run for our money what’s coming next’ but peachey peachey taliaferro i tell you sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head sir no he didn’t neither the king lost his head so he did all along o’ one of those cunning ropebridges kindly let me have the papercutter sir it tilted this way they marched him a mile across that snow to a ropebridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom you may have seen such  they prodded him behind like an ox ‘damn your eyes’ says the king ‘d’you suppose i can’t die like a gentleman’ he turns to peachey—peachey that was crying like a child ‘i’ve brought you to this peachey’ says he ‘brought you out of your happy life to be killed in kafiristan where you was late commanderinchief of the emperor’s forces say you forgive me peachey’ ‘i do’ says peachey ‘fully and freely do i forgive you dan’ ‘shake hands peachey’ says he ‘i’m going now’ out he goes looking neither right nor left and when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes ‘cut you beggars’ he shouts and they cut and old dan fell turning round and round and round twenty thousand miles for he took half an hour to fall till he struck the water and i could see his body caught on a rock with the gold crown close beside  “but do you know what they did to peachey between two pinetrees they crucified him sir as peachey’s hands will show they used wooden pegs for his hands and his feet and he didn’t die he hung there and screamed and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he wasn’t dead they took him down —poor old peachey that hadn’t done them any harm—that hadn’t done them any…”  he rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes  “they was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said he was more of a god than old daniel that was a man then they turned him out on the snow and told him to go home and peachey came home in about a year begging along the roads quite safe for daniel dravot he walked before and said—‘come along peachey it’s a big thing we’re doing’ the mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried to fall on peachey’s head but dan he held up his hand and peachey came along bent double he never let go of dan’s hand and he never let go of dan’s head they gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and peachey was starving never would peachey sell the same you knew dravot sir you knew right worshipful brother dravot look at him now”  he fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to my table—the dried withered head of daniel dravot the morning sun that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw turquoises that carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples  “you behold now” said carnehan “the emperor in his habit as he lived—the king of kafiristan with his crown upon his head poor old daniel that was a monarch once”  i shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold i recognized the head of the man of marwar junction carnehan rose to go i attempted to stop him he was not fit to walk abroad “let me take away the whiskey and give me a little money” he gasped “i was a king once i’ll go to the deputy commissioner and ask to set in the poorhouse till i get my health no thank you i can’t wait till you get a carriage for me i’ve urgent private affairs—in the south—at marwar”  he shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the deputy commissioner’s house that day at noon i had occasion to go down the blinding hot mall and i saw a crooked man crawling along the white dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after the fashion of streetsingers at home there was not a soul in sight and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses and he sang through his nose turning his head from right to left—     “the son of man goes forth to war       a golden crown to gain     his bloodred banner streams afar—       who follows in his train”  i waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the asylum he repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not in the least recognize and i left him singing to the missionary  two days later i inquired after his welfare of the superintendent of the asylum  “he was admitted suffering from sunstroke he died early yesterday morning” said the superintendent “is it true that he was half an hour bareheaded in the sun at midday”  “yes” said i “but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by any chance when he died”  “not to my knowledge” said the superintendent  and there the matter rests
