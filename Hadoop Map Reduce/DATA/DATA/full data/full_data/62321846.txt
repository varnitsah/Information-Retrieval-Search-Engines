preface and notes                           by julian hawthorne                                      to                 mr and mrs george parsons lathrop                     the soninlaw and daughter

editor     preface   a preface generally begins with a truism and i may set out with the admission that it is not always expedient to bring to light the posthumous work of great writers a man generally contrives to publish during his lifetime quite as much as the public has time or inclination to read and his surviving friends are apt to show more zeal than discretion in dragging forth from his closed desk such undeveloped offspring of his mind as he himself had left to silence literature has never been redundant with authors who sincerely undervalue their own productions and the sagacious critics who maintain that what of his own an author condemns must be doubly damnable are to say the least of it as often likely to be right as wrong  beyond these general remarks however it does not seem necessary to adopt an apologetic attitude there is nothing in the present volume which any one possessed of brains and cultivation will not be thankful to read the appreciation of nathaniel hawthornes writings is more intelligent and widespread than it used to be and the later development of our national literature has not perhaps so entirely exhausted our resources of admiration as to leave no welcome for even the less elaborate work of a contemporary of dickens and thackeray as regards doctor grimshawes secretthe title which for lack of a better has been given to this romanceit can scarcely be pronounced deficient in either elaboration or profundity had mr hawthorne written out the story in every part to its full dimensions it could not have failed to rank among the greatest of his productions he had looked forward to it as to the crowning achievement of his literary career in the preface to our old home he alludes to it as a work into which he proposed to convey more of various modes of truth than he could have grasped by a direct effort but circumstances prevented him from perfecting the design which had been before his mind for seven years and upon the shaping of which he bestowed more thought and labor than upon anything else he had undertaken the successive and consecutive series of notes or studies footnote these studies extracts from which will be published in one of our magazines are hereafter to be added in their complete form to the appendix of this volume which he wrote for this romance would of themselves make a small volume and one of autobiographical as well as literary interest there is no other instance that i happen to have met with in which a writers thought reflects itself upon paper so immediately and sensitively as in these studies to read them is to look into the mans mind and see its quality and action the penetration the subtlety the tenacity the stubborn gripe which he lays upon his subject like that of hercules upon the slippery old man of the sea the clear and cool commonsense controlling the audacity of a rich and ardent imagination the humorous gibes and strange expletives wherewith he ridicules to himself his own failure to reach his goal the immense patience with whichagain and again and yet againhe tries back throwing the topic into fresh attitudes and searching it to the marrow with a gaze so piercing as to be terribleall this gives an impression of power of resource of energy of mastery that exhilarates the reader so many inspired prophets of hawthorne have arisen of late that the present writer whose relation to the great romancer is a filial one merely may be excused for feeling some embarrassment in submitting his own uninstructed judgments to competition with theirs it has occurred to him however that these undress rehearsals of the author of the scarlet letter might afford entertaining and even profitable reading to the later generation of writers whose pleasant fortune it is to charm one another and the public it would appear that this author in his preparatory work at least has ventured in some manner to disregard the modern canons which debar writers from betraying towards their creations any warmer feeling than a cultured and critical indifference nor was his interest in human nature such as to confine him to the dissection of the moral epidermis of shopgirls and hotelboarders on the contrary we are presented with the spectacle of a titan baring his arms and plunging heart and soul into the arena there to struggle for death or victory with the superb phantoms summoned to the conflict by his own genius the men of new times and new conditions will achieve their triumphs in new ways but it may still be worth while to consider the methods and materials of one who also in his own fashion won and wore the laurel of those who know and can portray the human heart  but let us return to the romance in whose clear though shadowy atmosphere the thunders and throes of the preparatory struggle are inaudible and invisible save as they are implied in the fineness of substance and beauty of form of the artistic structure the story is divided into two parts the scene of the first being laid in america that of the second in england internal evidence of various kinds goes to show that the second part was the first written or in other words that the present first part is a rewriting of an original first part afterwards discarded and of which the existing second part is the continuation the two parts overlap and it shall be left to the ingenuity of critics to detect the precise point of junction in rewriting the first part the author made sundry minor alterations in the plot and characters of the story which alterations were not carried into the second part it results from this that the manuscript presents various apparent inconsistencies in transcribing the work for the press these inconsistent sentences and passages have been withdrawn from the text and inserted in the appendix or in a few unimportant instances omitted altogether in other respects the text is printed as the author left it with the exception of the names of the characters in the manuscript each personage figures in the course of the narrative under from three to six different names this difficulty has been met by bestowing upon each of the dramatis person√¶ the name which last identified him to the authors mind and keeping him to it throughout the volume  the story as a story is complete as it stands it has a beginning a middle and an end there is no break in the narrative and the legitimate conclusion is reached to say that the story is complete as a work of art would be quite another matter it lacks balance and proportion some characters and incidents are portrayed with minute elaboration others perhaps not less important are merely sketched in outline beyond a doubt it was the authors purpose to rewrite the entire work from the first page to the last enlarging it deepening it adorning it with every kind of spiritual and physical beauty and rounding out a moral worthy of the noble materials but these last transfiguring touches to aladdins tower were never to be given and he has departed taking with him his wonderful lamp nevertheless there is great splendor in the structure as we behold it the character of old doctor grimshawe and the picture of his surroundings are hardly surpassed in vigor by anything their author has produced and the dusky vision of the secret chamber which sends a mysterious shiver through the tale seems to be unique even in hawthorne  there have been included in this volume photographic reproductions of certain pages of the original manuscript of doctor grimshawe selected at random upon which those ingenious persons whose convictions are in advance of their instruction are cordially invited to try their teeth for it has been maintained that mr hawthornes handwriting was singularly legible the present writer possesses specimens of mr hawthornes chirography at various ages from boyhood until a day or two before his death like the handwriting of most men it was at its best between the twentyfifth and the fortieth years of life and in some instances it is a remarkably beautiful type of penmanship but as time went on it deteriorated and while of course retaining its elementary characteristics it became less and less easy to read especially in those writings which were intended solely for his own perusal as with other men of sensitive organization the mood of the hour a good or a bad pen a ready or an obstructed flow of thought would all be reflected in the formation of the written letters and words in the manuscript of the fragmentary sketch which has just been published in a magazine which is written in an ordinary commonplace book with ruled pages and in which the author had not yet become possessed with the spirit of the story and characters the handwriting is deliberate and clear in the manuscript of doctor grimshawes secret on the other hand which was written almost immediately after the other but on unruled paper and when the writers imagination was warm and eager the chirography is for the most part a compact mass of minute cramped hieroglyphics hardly to be deciphered save by flashes of inspiration the matter is not in itself of importance and is alluded to here only as having been brought forward in connection with other insinuations with the notice of which it seems unnecessary to soil these pages indeed were i otherwise disposed doctor grimshawe himself would take the words out of my mouth his speech is far more poignant and eloquent than mine in dismissing this episode i will take the liberty to observe that it appears to indicate a spirit in our age less sceptical than is commonly supposedbelief in miracles being still possible provided only the miracle be a scandalous one  it remains to tell how this romance came to be published it came into my possession in the ordinary course of events about eight years ago i had at that time no intention of publishing it and when soon after i left england to travel on the continent the manuscript together with the bulk of my library was packed and stored at a london repository and was not again seen by me until last summer when i unpacked it in this city i then finished the perusal of it and finding it to be practically complete i reresolved to print it in connection with a biography of mr hawthorne which i had in preparation but upon further consideration it was decided to publish the romance separately and i herewith present it to the public with my best wishes for their edification                                                  julian hawthorne new york november 21 1882     doctor grimshawes secret    chapter i   a long time ago endnote 1 in a town with which i used to be familiarly acquainted there dwelt an elderly person of grim aspect known by the name and title of doctor grimshaweendnote 2 whose household consisted of a remarkably pretty and vivacious boy and a perfect rosebud of a girl two or three years younger than he and an old maidofallwork of strangely mixed breed crusty in temper and wonderfully sluttish in attire endnote 3 it might be partly owing to this handmaidens characteristic lack of neatness though primarily no doubt to the grim doctors antipathy to broom brush and dusting cloths that the houseat least in such portions of it as any casual visitor caught a glimpse ofwas so overlaid with dust that in lack of a visiting card you might write your name with your forefinger upon the tables and so hung with cobwebs that they assumed the appearance of dusky upholstery  it grieves me to add an additional touch or two to the readers disagreeable impression of doctor grimshawes residence by confessing that it stood in a shabby bystreet and cornered on a graveyard with which the house communicated by a back door so that with a hop skip and jump from the threshold across a flat tombstone the two children endnote 4 were in the daily habit of using the dismal cemetery as their playground in their graver moods they spelled out the names and learned by heart doleful verses on the headstones and in their merrier ones which were much the more frequent they chased butterflies and gathered dandelions played hideandseek among the slate and marble and tumbled laughing over the grassy mounds which were too eminent for the short legs to bestride on the whole they were the better for the graveyard and its legitimate inmates slept none the worse for the two childrens gambols and shrill merriment overhead here were old brick tombs with curious sculptures on them and quaint gravestones some of which bore puffy little cherubs and one or two others the effigies of eminent puritans wrought out to a button a fold of the ruff and a wrinkle of the skullcap and these frowned upon the two children as if death had not made them a whit more genial than they were in life but the children were of a temper to be more encouraged by the goodnatured smiles of the puffy cherubs than frightened or disturbed by the sour puritans  this graveyard about which we shall say not a word more than may sooner or later be needful was the most ancient in the town the clay of the original settlers had been incorporated with the soil those stalwart englishmen of the puritan epoch whose immediate ancestors had been planted forth with succulent grass and daisies for the sustenance of the parsons cow round the lowbattlemented norman church towers in the villages of the fatherland had here contributed their rich saxon mould to tame and christianize the wild forest earth of the new world in this point of viewas holding the bones and dust of the primeval ancestorthe cemetery was more english than anything else in the neighborhood and might probably have nourished english oaks and english elms and whatever else is of english growth without that tendency to spindle upwards and lose their sturdy breadth which is said to be the ordinary characteristic both of human and vegetable productions when transplanted hither here at all events used to be some specimens of common english garden flowers which could not be accounted forunless perhaps they had sprung from some english maidens heart where the intense love of those homely things and regret of them in the foreign land had conspired together to keep their vivifying principle and cause its growth after the poor girl was buried be that as it might in this grave had been hidden from sight many a broad bluff visage of husbandman who had been taught to plough among the hereditary furrows that had been ameliorated by the crumble of ages much had these sturdy laborers grumbled at the great roots that obstructed their toil in these fresh acres here too the sods had covered the faces of men known to history and reverenced when not a piece of distinguishable dust remained of them personages whom tradition told about and here mixed up with successive crops of nativeborn americans had been ministers captains matrons virgins good and evil tough and tender turned up and battened down by the sextons spade over and over again until every blade of grass had its relations with the human brotherhood of the old town a hundred and fifty years was sufficient to do this and so much time at least had elapsed since the first hole was dug among the difficult roots of the forest trees and the first little hillock of all these green beds was piled up  thus rippled and surged with its hundreds of little billows the old graveyard about the house which cornered upon it it made the street gloomy so that people did not altogether like to pass along the high wooden fence that shut it in and the old house itself covering ground which else had been sown thickly with buried bodies partook of its dreariness because it seemed hardly possible that the dead people should not get up out of their graves and steal in to warm themselves at this convenient fireside but i never heard that any of them did so nor were the children ever startled by spectacles of dim horror in the nighttime but were as cheerful and fearless as if no grave had ever been dug they were of that class of children whose material seems fresh not taken at second hand full of disease conceits whims and weaknesses that have already served many peoples turns and been moulded up with some little change of combination to serve the turn of some poor spirit that could not get a better case  so far as ever came to the present writers knowledge there was no whisper of doctor grimshawes house being haunted a fact on which both writer and reader may congratulate themselves the ghostly chord having been played upon in these days until it has become wearisome and nauseous as the familiar tune of a barrelorgan the house itself moreover except for the convenience of its position close to the seldomdisturbed cemetery was hardly worthy to be haunted as i remember it and for aught i know it still exists in the same guise it did not appear to be an ancient structure nor one that would ever have been the abode of a very wealthy or prominent familya three story wooden house perhaps a century old lowstudded with a square front standing right upon the street and a small enclosed porch containing the main entrance affording a glimpse up and down the street through an oval window on each side its characteristic was decent respectability not sinking below the boundary of the genteel it has often perplexed my mind to conjecture what sort of man he could have been who having the means to build a pretty spacious and comfortable residence should have chosen to lay its foundation on the brink of so many graves each tenant of these narrow houses crying out as it were against the absurdity of bestowing much time or pains in preparing any earthly tabernacle save such as theirs but deceased people see matters from an erroneousat least too exclusivepoint of view a comfortable grave is an excellent possession for those who need it but a comfortable house has likewise its merits and temporary advantages endnote 5  the founder of the house in question seemed sensible of this truth and had therefore been careful to lay out a sufficient number of rooms and chambers low illlighted ugly but not unsusceptible of warmth and comfort the sunniest and cheerfulest of which were on the side that looked into the graveyard of these the one most spacious and convenient had been selected by doctor grimshawe as a study and fitted up with bookshelves and various machines and contrivances electrical chemical and distillatory wherewith he might pursue such researches as were wont to engage his attention the great result of the grim doctors labors so far as known to the public was a certain preparation or extract of cobwebs which out of a great abundance of material he was able to produce in any desirable quantity and by the administration of which he professed to cure diseases of the inflammatory class and to work very wonderful effects upon the human system it is a great pity for the good of mankind and the advantage of his own fortunes that he did not put forth this medicine in pill boxes or bottles and then as it were by some captivating title inveigle the public into his spiders web and suck out its gold substance and himself wax fat as he sat in the central intricacy  but grim doctor grimshawe though his aim in life might be no very exalted one seemed singularly destitute of the impulse to better his fortunes by the exercise of his wits it might even have been supposed indeed that he had a conscientious principle or religious scruple only he was by no means a religious managainst reaping profit from this particular nostrum which he was said to have invented he never sold it never prescribed it unless in cases selected on some principle that nobody could detect or explain the grim doctor it must be observed was not generally acknowledged by the profession with whom in truth he had never claimed a fellowship nor had he ever assumed of his own accord the medical title by which the public chose to know him his professional practice seemed in a sort forced upon him it grew pretty extensive partly because it was understood to be a matter of favor and difficulty dependent on a capricious will to obtain his services at all there was unquestionably an odor of quackery about him but by no means of an ordinary kind a sort of mysteryyet which perhaps need not have been a mystery had any one thought it worth while to make systematic inquiry in reference to his previous life his education even his native landassisted the impression which his peculiarities were calculated to make he was evidently not a newenglander nor a native of any part of these western shores his speech was apt to be oddly and uncouthly idiomatic and even when classical in its form was emitted with a strange rough depth of utterance that came from recesses of the lungs which we yankees seldom put to any use in person he did not look like one of us a broad rather short personage with a projecting forehead a red irregular face and a squab nose eyes that looked dull enough in their ordinary state but had a faculty in conjunction with the other features which those who had ever seen it described as especially ugly and awful as regarded dress doctor grimshawe had a rough and careless exterior and altogether a shaggy kind of aspect the effect of which was much increased by a reddish beard which contrary to the usual custom of the day he allowed to grow profusely and the wiry perversity of which seemed to know as little of the comb as of the razor  we began with calling the grim doctor an elderly personage but in so doing we looked at him through the eyes of the two children who were his intimates and who had not learnt to decipher the purport and value of his wrinkles and furrows and corrugations whether as indicating age or a different kind of wear and tear possiblyhe seemed so aggressive and had such latent heat and force to throw out when occasion calledhe might scarcely have seemed middleaged though here again we hesitate finding him so stiffened in his own way so little fluid so encrusted with passions and humors that he must have left his youth very far behind him if indeed he ever had any  the patients or whatever other visitors were ever admitted into the doctors study carried abroad strange accounts of the squalor of dust and cobwebs in which the learned and scientific person lived and the dust they averred was all the more disagreeable because it could not well be other than dead mens almost intangible atoms resurrected from the adjoining graveyard as for the cobwebs they were no signs of housewifely neglect on the part of crusty hannah the handmaiden but the doctors scientific material carefully encouraged and preserved each filmy thread more valuable to him than so much golden wire of all barbarous haunts in christendom or elsewhere this study was the one most overrun with spiders they dangled from the ceiling crept upon the tables lurked in the corners and wove the intricacy of their webs wherever they could hitch the end from point to point across the windowpanes and even across the upper part of the doorway and in the chimneyplace it seemed impossible to move without breaking some of these mystic threads spiders crept familiarly towards you and walked leisurely across your hands these were their precincts and you only an intruder if you had none about your person yet you had an odious sense of one crawling up your spine or spinning cobwebs in your brainso pervaded was the atmosphere of the place with spiderlife what they fed upon for all the flies for miles about would not have sufficed them was a secret known only to the doctor whence they came was another riddle though from certain inquiries and transactions of doctor grimshawes with some of the shipmasters of the port who followed the east and west indian the african and the south american trade it was supposed that this odd philosopher was in the habit of importing choice monstrosities in the spider kind from all those tropic regions endnote 6  all the above description exaggerated as it may seem is merely preliminary to the introduction of one single enormous spider the biggest and ugliest ever seen the pride of the grim doctors heart his treasure his glory the pearl of his soul and as many people said the demon to whom he had sold his salvation on condition of possessing the web of the foul creature for a certain number of years the grim doctor according to this theory was but a great fly which this spider had subtly entangled in his web but in truth naturalists are acquainted with this spider though it is a rare one the british museum has a specimen and doubtless so have many other scientific institutions it is found in south america its most hideous spread of legs covers a space nearly as large as a dinnerplate and radiates from a body as big as a doorknob which one conceives to be an agglomeration of suckedup poison which the creature treasures through life probably to expend it all and life itself on some worthy foe its colors variegated in a sort of ugly and inauspicious splendor were distributed over its vast bulb in great spots some of which glistened like gems it was a horror to think of this thing living still more horrible to think of the foul catastrophe the crushedout and wasted poison that would follow the casual setting foot upon it  no doubt the lapse of time since the doctor and his spider lived has already been sufficient to cause a traditionary wonderment to gather over them both and especially this image of the spider dangles down to us from the dusky ceiling of the past swollen into somewhat uglier and huger monstrosity than he actually possessed nevertheless the creature had a real existence and has left kindred like himself but as for the doctor nothing could exceed the value which he seemed to put upon him the sacrifices he made for the creatures convenience or the readiness with which he adapted his whole mode of life apparently so that the spider might enjoy the conditions best suited to his tastes habits and health and yet there were sometimes tokens that made people imagine that he hated the infernal creature as much as everybody else who caught a glimpse of him endnote 7     chapter ii   considering that doctor grimshawe when we first look upon him had dwelt only a few years in the house by the graveyard it is wonderful what an appearance he and his furniture and his cobwebs and their unweariable spinners and crusty old hannah all had of having permanently attached themselves to the locality for a century at least it might be fancied that the study in particular had existed just as it was now with those dusky festoons of spidersilk hanging along the walls those bookcases with volumes turning their parchment or blackleather backs upon you those machines and engines that table and at it the doctor in a very faded and shabby dressinggown smoking a long clay pipe the powerful fumes of which dwelt continually in his reddish and grisly beard and made him fragrant wherever he went this sense of fixednessstony intractabilityseems to belong to people who instead of hope which exalts everything into an airy gaseous exhilaration have a fixed and dogged purpose around which everything congeals and crystallizes endnote 1 even the sunshine dim through the dustiness of the two casements that looked upon the graveyard and the smoke as it came warm out of doctor grimshawes mouth seemed already stale but if the two children or either of them happened to be in the studyif they ran to open the door at the knock if they came scampering and peeped down over the banistersthe sordid and rusty gloom was apt to vanish quite away the sunbeam itself looked like a golden rule that had been flung down long ago and had lain there till it was dusty and tarnished they were cheery little imps who sucked up fragrance and pleasantness out of their surroundings dreary as these looked even as a flower can find its proper perfume in any soil where its seed happens to fall the great spider hanging by his cordage over the doctors head and waving slowly like a pendulum in a blast from the crack of the door must have made millions and millions of precisely such vibrations as these but the children were new and made over every day with yesterdays weariness left out  the little girl however was the merrier of the two it was quite unintelligible in view of the little care that crusty hannah took of her and moreover since she was none of your prim fastidious children how daintily she kept herself amid all this dust how the spiders webs never clung to her and how whenwithout being solicitedshe clambered into the doctors arms and kissed him she bore away no smoky reminiscences of the pipe that he kissed continually she had a free mellow natural laughter that seemed the ripened fruit of the smile that was generally on her little face to be shaken off and scattered abroad by any breeze that came along little elsie made playthings of everything even of the grim doctor though against his will and though moreover there were tokens now and then that the sight of this bright little creature was not a pleasure to him but on the contrary a positive pain a pain nevertheless indicating a profound interest hardly less deep than though elsie had been his daughter  elsie did not play with the great spider but she moved among the whole brood of spiders as if she saw them not and being endowed with other senses than those allied to these things might coexist with them and not be sensible of their presence yet the child i suppose had her crying fits and her pouting fits and naughtiness enough to entitle her to live on earth at least crusty hannah often said so and often made grievous complaint of disobedience mischief or breakage attributable to little elsie to which the grim doctor seldom responded by anything more intelligible than a puff of tobaccosmoke and sometimes an imprecation which however hit crusty hannah instead of the child where the child got the tenderness that a child needs to live upon is a mystery to me perhaps from some aged or dead mother or in her dreams perhaps from some small modicum of it such as boys have from the little boy or perhaps it was from a persian kitten which had grown to be a cat in her arms and slept in her little bed and now assumed grave and protective airs towards her former playmate endnote 2  the boy endnote 3 as we have said was two or three years elsies elder and might now be about six years old he was a healthy and cheerful child yet of a graver mood than the little girl appearing to lay a more forcible grasp on the circumstances about him and to tread with a heavier footstep on the solid earth yet perhaps not more so than was the necessary difference between a manblossom dimly conscious of coming things and a mere baby with whom there was neither past nor future ned as he was named was subject very early to fits of musing the subject of whichif they had any definite subject or were more than vague reveriesit was impossible to guess they were of those states of mind probably which are beyond the sphere of human language and would necessarily lose their essence in the attempt to communicate or record them the little girl perhaps had some mode of sympathy with these unuttered thoughts or reveries which grown people had ceased to have at all events she early learned to respect them and at other times as free and playful as her persian kitten she never in such circumstances ventured on any greater freedom than to sit down quietly beside him and endeavor to look as thoughtful as the boy himself  once slowly emerging from one of these waking reveries little ned gazed about him and saw elsie sitting with this pretty pretence of thoughtfulness and dreaminess in her little chair close beside him now and then peeping under her eyelashes to note what changes might come over his face after looking at her a moment or two he quietly took her willing and warm little hand in his own and led her up to the doctor  the group methinks must have been a picturesque one made up as it was of several apparently discordant elements each of which happened to be so combined as to make a more effective whole the beautiful grave boy with a little sword by his side and a feather in his hat of a brown complexion slender with his white brow and dark thoughtful eyes so earnest upon some mysterious theme the prettier little girl a blonde round rosy so truly sympathetic with her companions mood yet unconsciously turning all to sport by her attempt to assume one similarthese two standing at the grim doctors footstool he meanwhile black wildbearded heavybrowed redeyed wrapped in his faded dressinggown puffing out volumes of vapor from his long pipe and making just at that instant application to a tumbler which we regret to say was generally at his elbow with some darkcolored potation in it that required to be frequently replenished from a neighboring black bottle half at least of the fluids in the grim doctors system must have been derived from that same black bottle so constant was his familiarity with its contents and yet his eyes were never redder at one time than another nor his utterance thicker nor his mood perceptibly the brighter or the duller for all his conviviality it is true when once the bottle happened to be empty for a whole day together doctor grimshawe was observed by crusty hannah and by the children to be considerably fiercer than usual so that probably by some maladjustment of consequences his intemperance was only to be found in refraining from brandy  nor must we forgetin attempting to conceive the effect of these two beautiful children in such a sombre room looking on the graveyard and contrasted with the grim doctors aspect of heavy and smouldering fiercenessthat over his head at this very moment dangled the portentous spider who seemed to have come down from his web aloft for the purpose of hearing what the two young people could have to say to his patron and what reference it might have to certain mysterious documents which the doctor kept locked up in a secret cupboard behind the door  grim doctor said ned after looking up into the doctors face as a sensitive child inevitably does to see whether the occasion was favorable yet determined to proceed with his purpose whether so or notgrim doctor i want you to answer me a question  heres to your good health ned quoth the doctor eying the pair intently as he often did when they were unconscious so you want to ask me a question as many as you please my fine fellow and i shall answer as many and as much and as truly as may please myself  ah grim doctor said the little girl now letting go of neds hand and climbing upon the doctors knee ou shall answer as many as ned please to ask because to please him and me  well child said doctor grimshawe little ned will have his rights at least at my hands if not other peoples rights likewise and if it be right i shall answer his question only let him ask it at once for i want to be busy thinking about something else  then doctor grim said little ned tell me in the first place where i came from and how you came to have me  the doctor looked at the little man so seriously and earnestly putting this demand with a perplexed and at first it might almost seem a startled aspect  that is a question indeed my friend ned ejaculated he putting forth a whiff of smoke and imbibing a nip from his tumbler before he spoke and perhaps framing his answer as many thoughtful and secret people do in such a way as to let out his secret mood to the child because knowing he could not understand it whence did you come whence did any of us come out of the darkness and mystery out of nothingness out of a kingdom of shadows out of dust clay mud i think and to return to it again out of a former state of being whence we have brought a good many shadowy revelations purporting that it was no very pleasant one out of a former life of which the present one is the helland why are you come faith ned he must be a wiser man than doctor grim who can tell why you or any other mortal came hither only one thing i am well aware ofit was not to be happy to toil and moil and hope and fear and to love in a shadowy doubtful sort of way and to hate in bitter earnestthat is what you came for  ah doctor grim this is very naughty said little elsie you are making fun of little ned when he is in earnest  fun quoth doctor grim bursting into a laugh peculiar to him very loud and obstreperous i am glad you find it so my little woman well and so you bid me tell absolutely where he came from  elsie nodded her bright little head  and you friend ned insist upon knowing  that i do doctor grim answered ned his white childish brow had gathered into a frown such was the earnestness of his determination and he stamped his foot on the floor as if ready to follow up his demand by an appeal to the little tin sword which hung by his side the doctor looked at him with a kind of smilenot a very pleasant one for it was an unamiable characteristic of his temper that a display of spirit even in a child was apt to arouse his immense combativeness and make him aim a blow without much consideration how heavily it might fall or on how unequal an antagonist  if you insist upon an answer master ned you shall have it replied he you were taken by me boy a foundling from an almshouse and if ever hereafter you desire to know your kindred you must take your chance of the first man you meet he is as likely to be your father as another  the childs eyes flashed and his brow grew as red as fire it was but a momentary fierceness the next instant he clasped his hands over his face and wept in a violent convulsion of grief and shame little elsie clasped her arms about him kissing his brow and chin which were all that her lips could touch under his clasped hands but ned turned away uncomforted and was blindly making his way towards the door  ned my little fellow come back said doctor grim who had very attentively watched the cruel effect of his communication  as the boy did not reply and was still tending towards the door the grim doctor vouchsafed to lay aside his pipe get up from his armchair a thing he seldom did between supper and bedtime and shuffle after the two children in his slippers he caught them on the threshold brought little ned back by main forcefor he was a rough man even in his tendernessand sitting down again and taking him on his knee pulled away his hands from before his face never was a more pitiful sight than that pale countenance so infantile still yet looking old and experienced already with a sense of disgrace with a feeling of loneliness so beautiful nevertheless that it seemed to possess all the characteristics which fine hereditary traits and culture or many forefathers could do in refining a human stock and this was a nameless weed sprouting from some chance seed by the dusty wayside  ned my dear old boy said doctor grimand he kissed that pale tearful facethe first and last time to the best of my belief that he was ever betrayed into that tenderness forget what i have said yes remember if you like that you came from an almshouse but remember toowhat your friend doctor grim is ready to affirm and make oath ofthat he can trace your kindred and race through that sordid experience and back back for a hundred and fifty years into an old english line come little ned and look at this picture  he led the boy by the hand to a corner of the room where hung upon the wall a portrait which ned had often looked at it seemed an old picture but the doctor had had it cleaned and varnished so that it looked dim and dark and yet it seemed to be the representation of a man of no mark not at least of such mark as would naturally leave his features to be transmitted for the interest of another generation for he was clad in a mean dress of old fashiona leather jerkin it appeared to beand round his neck moreover was a noose of rope as if he might have been on the point of being hanged but the face of the portrait nevertheless was beautiful noble though sad with a great development of sensibility a look of suffering and endurance amounting to triumpha peace through all  look at this continued the doctor if you must go on dreaming about your race dream that you are of the blood of this being for mean as his station looks he comes of an ancient and noble race and was the noblest of them all let me alone ned and i shall spin out the web that shall link you to that man the grim doctor can do it  the grim doctors face looked fierce with the earnestness with which he said these words you would have said that he was taking an oath to overthrow and annihilate a race rather than to build one up by bringing forward the infant heir out of obscurity and making plain the linksthe filamentswhich cemented this feeble childish life in a far country with the great tide of a noble life which had come down like a chain from antiquity in old england  having said the words however the grim doctor appeared ashamed both of the heat and of the tenderness into which he had been betrayed for rude and rough as his nature was there was a kind of decorum in it too that kept him within limits of his own so he went back to his chair his pipe and his tumbler and was gruffer and more taciturn than ever for the rest of the evening and after the children went to bed he leaned back in his chair and looked up at the vast tropic spider who was particularly busy in adding to the intricacies of his web until he fell asleep with his eyes fixed in that direction and the extinguished pipe in one hand and the empty tumbler in the other     chapter iii   doctor grimshawe after the foregone scene began a practice of conversing more with the children than formerly directing his discourse chiefly to ned although elsies vivacity and more outspoken and demonstrative character made her take quite as large a share in the conversation as he  the doctors communications referred chiefly to a village or neighborhood or locality in england which he chose to call newnham although he told the children that this was not the real name which for reasons best known to himself he wished to conceal whatever the name were he seemed to know the place so intimately that the children as a matter of course adopted the conclusion that it was his birthplace and the spot where he had spent his schoolboy days and had lived until some inscrutable reason had impelled him to quit its ivy grown antiquity and all the aged beauty and strength that he spoke of and to cross the sea  he used to tell of an old church far unlike the brick and pinebuilt meetinghouses with which the children were familiar a church the stones of which were laid every one of them before the world knew of the country in which he was then speaking and how it had a spire the lower part of which was mantled with ivy and up which towards its very spire the ivy was still creeping and how there was a tradition that if the ivy ever reached the top the spire would fall upon the roof of the old gray church and crush it all down among its surrounding tombstones endnote 1 and so as this misfortune would be so heavy a one there seemed to be a miracle wrought from year to year by which the ivy though always flourishing could never grow beyond a certain point so that the spire and church had stood unharmed for thirty years though the wise old people were constantly foretelling that the passing year must be the very last one that it could stand  he told too of a place that made little ned blush and cast down his eyes to hide the tears of anger and shame at he knew not what which would irresistibly spring into them for it reminded him of the almshouse where as the cruel doctor said ned himself had had his earliest home and yet after all it had scarcely a feature of resemblance and there was this great point of differencethat whereas in neds wretched abode a large unsightly brick house there were many wretched infants like himself as well as helpless people of all ages widows decayed drunkards people of feeble wits and all kinds of imbecility it being a haven for those who could not contend in the hard eager pitiless struggle of life in the place the doctor spoke of a noble gothic mossy structure there were none but aged men who had drifted into this quiet harbor to end their days in a sort of humble yet stately ease and decorous abundance and this shelter the grim doctor said was the gift of a man who had died ages ago and having been a great sinner in his lifetime and having drawn lands manors and a great mass of wealth into his clutches by violent and unfair means had thought to get his pardon by founding this hospital as it was called in which thirteen old men should always reside and he hoped that they would spend their time in praying for the welfare of his soul endnote 2  said little elsie i am glad he did it and i hope the poor old men never forgot to pray for him and that it did good to the poor wicked mans soul  well child said doctor grimshawe with a scowl into vacancy and a sort of wicked leer of merriment at the same time as if he saw before him the face of the dead man of past centuries i happen to be no lover of this mans race and i hate him for the sake of one of his descendants i dont think he succeeded in bribing the devil to let him go or god to save him  doctor grim you are very naughty said elsie looking shocked  it is fair enough said ned to hate your enemies to the very brink of the grave but then to leave him to get what mercy he can  after shoving him in quoth the doctor and made no further response to either of these criticisms which seemed indeed to affect him very littleif he even listened to them for he was a man of singularly imperfect moral culture insomuch that nothing else was so remarkable about him as thatpossessing a good deal of intellectual ability made available by much reading and experiencehe was so very dark on the moral side as if he needed the natural perceptions that should have enabled him to acquire that better wisdom such a phenomenon often meets us in life oftener than we recognize because a certain tact and exterior decency generally hide the moral deficiency but often there is a mind well polished married to a conscience and natural impulses left as they were in childhood except that they have sprouted up into evil and poisonous weeds richly blossoming with strongsmelling flowers or seeds which the plant scatters by a sort of impulse even as the doctor was now halfconsciously throwing seeds of his evil passions into the minds of these children he was himself a grownup child without tact simplicity and innocence and with ripened evil all the ranker for a native heat that was in him and still active which might have nourished good things as well as evil indeed it did cherish by chance a root or two of good the fragrance of which was sometimes perceptible among all this rank growth of poisonous weeds a grownup child he wasthat was all  the doctor now went on to describe an old countryseat which stood near this village and the ancient hospital that he had been telling about and which was formerly the residence of the wicked man a knight and a brave one well known in the lancastrian wars who had founded the latter it was a venerable old mansion which a saxon thane had begun to build more than a thousand years ago the old english oak that he built into the frame being still visible in the ancient skeleton of its roof sturdy and strong as if put up yesterday and the descendants of the man who built it through the french line for a norman baron wedded the daughter and heiress of the saxon dwelt there yet and in each century they had done something for the old hallbuilding a tower adding a suite of rooms strengthening what was already built putting in a painted window making it more spacious and convenient till it seemed as if time employed himself in thinking what could be done for the old house as fast as any part decayed it was renewed with such simple art that the new completed as it were and fitted itself to the old so that it seemed as if the house never had been finished until just that thing was added for many an age the possessors had gone on adding strength to strength digging out the moat to a greater depth piercing the walls with holes for archers to shoot through or building a turret to keep watch upon but at last all necessity for these precautions passed away and then they thought of convenience and comfort adding something in every generation to these and by and by they thought of beauty too and in this time helped them with its weatherstains and the ivy that grew over the walls and the grassy depth of the driedup moat and the abundant shade that grew up everywhere where naked strength would have been ugly  one curious thing in the house said the doctor lowering his voice but with a mysterious look of triumph and that old scowl too at the children was that they built a secret chambera very secret one  a secret chamber cried little ned who lived in it a ghost  there was often use for it said doctor grim hiding people who had fought on the wrong side or catholic priests or criminals or perhapswho knowsenemies that they wanted put out of the way troublesome folks ah it was often of use that secret chamber and is so still  here the doctor paused a long while and leaned back in his chair slowly puffing long whiffs from his pipe looking up at the great spiderdemon that hung over his head and as it seemed to the children by the expression of his face looking into the dim secret chamber which he had spoken of and which by something in his mode of alluding to it assumed such a weird spectral aspect to their imaginations that they never wished to hear of it again coming back at length out of his reveriereturning perhaps out of some weird ghostly secret chamber of his memory whereof the one in the old house was but the less horrible emblemhe resumed his tale he said that a long time ago a war broke out in the old country between king and parliament at that period there were several brothers of the old family which had adhered to the catholic religion and these chose the side of the king instead of that of the puritan parliament all but one whom the family hated because he took the parliament side and he became a soldier and fought against his own brothers and it was said among them that so inveterate was he he went on the scaffold masked and was the very man who struck off the kings head and that his foot trod in the kings blood and that always afterwards he made a bloody track wherever he went and there was a legend that his brethren once caught the renegade and imprisoned him in his own birthplace  in the secret chamber interrupted ned  no doubt said the doctor nodding though i never heard so  they imprisoned him but he made his escape and fled and in the morning his prisonplace wherever it was was empty but on the threshold of the door of the old manorhouse there was the print of a bloody footstep and no trouble that the housemaids took no rain of all the years that have since passed no sunshine has made it fade nor have all the wear and tramp of feet passing over it since then availed to erase it  i have seen it myself quoth the doctor and know this to be true  doctor grim now you are laughing at us said ned trying to look grave but elsie hid her face on the doctors knee there being something that affected the vivid little girl with peculiar horror in the idea of this red footstep always glistening on the doorstep and wetting as she fancied every innocent foot of child or grown person that had since passed over it endnote 3  it is true reiterated the grim doctor for man and boy i have seen it a thousand times  he continued the family history or tradition or fantastic legend whichever it might be telling his young auditors that the puritan the renegade son of the family was afterwards by the contrivances of his brethren sent to virginia and sold as a bond slave and how he had vanished from that quarter and come to new england where he was supposed to have left children and by and by two elder brothers died and this missing brother became the heir to the old estate and to a title then the family tried to track his bloody footstep and sought it far and near through green country paths and old streets of london but in vain then they sent messengers to see whether any traces of one stepping in blood could be found on the forest leaves of america but still in vain the idea nevertheless prevailed that he would come back and it was said they kept a bedchamber ready for him yet in the old house but much as they pretended to regret the loss of him and his children it would make them curse their stars were a descendant of his to return now for the child of a younger son was in possession of the old estate and was doing as much evil as his forefathers did and if the true heir were to appear on the threshold he would if he might but do it secretly stain the whole doorstep as red as the bloody footstep had stained one little portion of it  do you think he will ever come back asked little ned  stranger things have happened my little man said doctor grimshawe than that the posterity of this man should come back and turn these usurpers out of his rightful inheritance and sometimes as i sit here smoking my pipe and drinking my glass and looking up at the cunning plot that the spider is weaving yonder above my head and thinking of this fine old family and some little matters that have been between them and me i fancy that it may be so we shall see stranger things have happened  and doctor grimshawe drank off his tumbler winking at little ned in a strange way that seemed to be a kind of playfulness but which did not affect the children pleasantly insomuch that little elsie put both her hands on doctor grims knees and begged him not to do so any more endnote 4     chapter iv endnote 1   the children after this conversation often introduced the old english mansion into their dreams and little romances which all imaginative children are continually mixing up with their lives making the commonplace day of grown people a rich misty glancing orb of fairy land to themselves ned forgetting or not realizing the long lapse of time used to fancy the true heir wandering all this while in america and leaving a long track of bloody footsteps behind him until the period when his sins being expiated whatever they might be he should turn back upon his steps and return to his old native home and sometimes the child used to look along the streets of the town where he dwelt bending his thoughtful eyes on the ground and think that perhaps some time he should see the bloody footsteps there betraying that the wanderer had just gone that way  as for little elsie it was her fancy that the hero of the legend still remained imprisoned in that dreadful secret chamber which had made a most dread impression on her mind and that there he was forgotten all this time waiting like a naughty child shut up in a closet until some one should come to unlock the door in the pitifulness of her disposition she once proposed to little ned that as soon as they grew big enough they should set out in quest of the old house and find their way into it and find the secret chamber and let the poor prisoner out so they lived a good deal of the time in a halfwaking dream partly conscious of the fantastic nature of their ideas yet with these ideas almost as real to them as the facts of the natural world which to children are at first transparent and unsubstantial  the doctor appeared to have a pleasure or a purpose in keeping his legend forcibly in their memories he often recurred to the subject of the old english family and was continually giving new details about its history the scenery in its neighborhood the aspect of the mansionhouse indicating a very intense interest in the subject on his own part of which this much talk seemed the involuntary overflowing  there was however an affection mingled with this sentiment it appeared to be his unfortunate necessity to let his thoughts dwell very constantly upon a subject that was hateful to him with which this old english estate and manorhouse and family were somehow connected and moreover had he spoken thus to older and more experienced auditors they might have detected in the manner and matter of his talk a certain hereditary reverence and awe the growth of ages mixed up with a newer hatred impelling him to deface and destroy what at the same time it was his deepest impulse to bow before the love belonged to his race the hatred to himself individually it was the feeling of a man lowly born when he contracts a hostility to his hereditary superior in one way being of a powerful passionate nature gifted with force and ability far superior to that of the aristocrat he might scorn him and feel able to trample on him in another he had the same awe that a country boy feels of the magistrate who flings him a sixpence and shakes his horsewhip at him  had the grim doctor been an american he might have had the vast antipathy to rank without the trace of awe that made it so much more malignant it required a lowborn englishman to feel the two together what made the hatred so fiendish was a something that in the natural course of things would have been loyalty inherited affection devoted selfsacrifice to a superior whatever it might be it seemed at times when his potations took deeper effect than ordinary almost to drive the grim doctor mad for he would burst forth in wild diatribes and anathemas having a strange rough force of expression and a depth of utterance as if his words came from a bottomless pit within himself where burned an everlasting fire and where the furies had their home and plans of dire revenge were welded into shape as in the heat of a furnace after the two poor children had been affrighted by paroxysms of this kind the strange being would break out into one of his roars of laughter that seemed to shake the house and at all events caused the cobwebs and spiders suspended from the ceiling to swing and vibrate with the motion of the volumes of reverberating breath which he thus expelled from his capacious lungs then catching up little elsie upon one knee and ned upon the other he would become gentler than in his usual moods and by the powerful magnetism of his character cause them to think him as tender and sweet an old fellow as a child could desire for a playmate upon the whole strange as it may appear they loved the grim doctor dearly there was a loadstone within him that drew them close to him and kept them there in spite of the horror of many things that he said and did one thing that slight as it seemed wrought mightily towards their mutually petting each other was that no amount of racket hubbub shouting laughter or noisy mischief which the two children could perpetrate ever disturbed the doctors studies meditations or employments of whatever kind he had a hardy set of nerves not refined by careful treatment in himself or his ancestors but probably accustomed from of old to be drummed on by harsh voices rude sounds and the clatter and clamor of household life among homely uncultivated strongly animal people  as the two children grew apace it behooved their strange guardian to take some thought for their instruction so far as little elsie was concerned however he seemed utterly indifferent to her having any cultivation having imbibed no modern ideas respecting feminine capacities and privileges but regarding woman whether in the bud or in the blossom as the plaything of mans idler moments and the helpmeetbut in a humble capacityof his daily life he sometimes bade her go to the kitchen and take lessons of crusty hannah in bread making sweeping dusting washing the coarser needlework and such other things as she would require to know when she came to be a woman but carelessly allowed her to gather up the crumbs of such instruction as he bestowed on her playmate ned and thus learn to read write and cipher which to say the truth was about as far in the way of scholarship as little elsie cared to go  but towards little ned the grim doctor adopted a far different system no sooner had he reached the age when the soft and tender intellect of the child became capable of retaining impressions than he took him vigorously in hand assigning him such tasks as were fit for him and curiously investigating what were the force and character of the powers with which the child grasped them not that the doctor pressed him forward unduly indeed there was no need of it for the boy manifested a remarkable docility for instruction and a singular quickness in mastering the preliminary steps which lead to science a subtle instinct indeed which it seemed wonderful a child should possess for anything as artificial as systems of grammar and arithmetic a remarkable boy in truth he was to have been found by chance in an almshouse except that such being his origin we are at liberty to suppose for him whatever long cultivation and gentility we may think necessary in his parentage of either sidesuch as was indicated also by his graceful and refined beauty of person he showed indeed even before he began to read at all an instinctive attraction towards books and a love for and interest in even the material form of knowledgethe plates the print the binding of the doctors volumes and even in a bookworm which he once found in an old volume where it had eaten a circular furrow but the little boy had too quick a spirit of life to be in danger of becoming a bookworm himself he had this side of the intellect but his impulse would be to mix with men and catch something from their intercourse fresher than books could give him though these would give him what they might  in the grim doctor rough and uncultivated as he seemed this budding intelligence found no inadequate instructor doctor grimshawe proved himself a far more thorough scholar in the classics and mathematics than could easily have been found in our country he himself must have had rigid and faithful instruction at an early period of life though probably not in his boyhood for though the culture had been bestowed his mind had been left in so singularly rough a state that it seemed as if the refinement of classical study could not have been begun very early or possibly the mind and nature were incapable of polish or he may have had a coarse and sordid domestic life around him in his infancy and youth he was a gem of coarse texture just hewn out an american with a like education would more likely have gained a certain fineness and grace and it would have been difficult to distinguish him from one who had been born to culture and refinement this sturdy englishman after all that had been done for his mind and though it had been well done was still but another ploughman of a long race of such with a few scratchings of refinement on his hard exterior his son if he left one might be a little less of the ploughman his grandson provided the female element were well chosen might approach to refinement three generationsa century at leastwould be required for the slow toil of hewing chiselling and polishing a gentleman out of this ponderous block now rough from the quarry of human nature but in the mean time he evidently possessed in an unusual degree the sort of learning that refines other mindsthe critical acquaintance with the great poets and historians of antiquity and apparently an appreciation of their merits and power to teach their beauty so the boy had an able tutor capable it would seem of showing him the way to the graces he did not himself possess besides helping the growth of the strength without which refinement is but sickly and disgusting  another sort of culture which it seemed odd that this rude man should undertake was that of manners but in fact rude as the grim doctors own manners were he was one of the nicest and severest censors in that department that was ever known it is difficult to account for this although it is almost invariably found that persons in a low rank of life such as servants and laborers will detect the false pretender to the character of a gentleman with at least as sure an instinct as the class into which they seek to thrust themselves perhaps they recognize something akin to their own vulgarity rather than appreciate what is unlike themselves the doctor possessed a peculiar power of rich rough humor on this subject and used to deliver lectures as it were to little ned illustrated with sketches of living individuals in the town where they dwelt by an unscrupulous use of whom he sought to teach the boy what to avoid in manners if he sought to be a gentleman but it must be confessed he spared himself as little as other people and often wound up with this compendious injunctionbe everything in your behavior that doctor grim is not  his pupil very probably profited somewhat by these instructions for there are specialties and arbitrary rules of behavior which do not come by nature but these are few and beautiful noble and genial manners may almost be called a natural gift and these however he inherited them soon proved to be an inherent possession of little ned he had a kind of natural refinement which nothing could ever soil or offend it seemed by some magic or other absolutely to keep him from the knowledge of much of the grim doctors rude and sordid exterior and to render what was around him beautiful by a sort of affiliation or reflection from that quality in himself glancing its white light upon it the doctor himself was puzzled and apparently both startled and delighted at the perception of these characteristics sometimes he would make a low uncouth bow after his fashion to the little fellow saying allow me to kiss your hand my lord and little ned not quite knowing what the grim doctor meant yet allowed the favor he asked with a grave and gracious condescension that seemed much to delight the suitor this refusal to recognize or to suspect that the doctor might be laughing at him was a sure token at any rate of the lack of one vulgar characteristic in little ned  in order to afford little ned every advantage to these natural gifts doctor grim nevertheless failed not to provide the best attainable instructor for such positive points of a polite education as his own fierce criticism being destructive rather than generative would not suffice for there was a frenchman in the towna m le grand secretly calling himself a countwho taught the little people and indeed some of their elders the parisian pronunciation of his own language and likewise dancing in which he was more of an adept and more successful than in the former branch and fencing in which after looking at a lesson or two the grim doctor was satisfied of his skill under his instruction with the stimulus of the doctors praise and criticism ned soon grew to be the pride of the frenchmans school in both the active departments and the doctor himself added a further gymnastic acquirement not absolutely necessary he said to a gentlemans education but very desirable to a man perfect at all points by teaching him cudgelplaying and pugilism in short in everything that related to accomplishments whether of mind or body no pains were spared with little ned but of the utilitarian line of education then almost exclusively adopted and especially desirable for a fortuneless boy like ned dependent on a man not wealthy there was little given  at first too the doctor paid little attention to the moral and religious culture of his pupil nor did he ever make a system of it but by and by though with a singular reluctance and kind of bashfulness he began to extend his care to these matters being drawn into them unawares and possibly perceiving and learning what he taught as he went along one evening i know not how he was betrayed into speaking on this point and a sort of inspiration seized him a vista opened before him handling an immortal spirit he began to know its requisitions in a degree far beyond what he had conceived them to be when his great task was undertaken his voice grew deep and had a strange impressive pathos in it his talk became eloquent with depth of meaning and feeling as he told the boy of the moral dangers of the world for which he was seeking to educate him and which he said presented what looked like great triumphs and yet were the greatest and saddest of defeats he told him that many things that seemed nearest and dearest to the heart of man were destructive eating and gnawing away and corroding what was best in him and what a high noble recreating triumph it was when these dark impulses were resisted and overthrown and how from that epoch the soul took a new start he denounced the selfish greed of gold lawless passion revengeand here the grim doctor broke out into a strange passion and zeal of anathema against this deadly sin making a dreadful picture of the ruin that it creates in the heart where it establishes itself and how it makes a corrosive acid of those genial juices then he told the boy that the condition of all good was in the first place truth then courage then justice then mercy out of which principles operating upon one another would come all brave noble high unselfish actions and the scorn of all mean ones and how that from such a nature all hatred would fall away and all good affections would be ennobled  i know not at what point it was precisely in these ethical instructions that an insight seemed to strike the grim doctor that something morevastly morewas needed than all he had said and he began doubtfully to speak of mans spiritual nature and its demands and the emptiness of everything which a sense of these demands did not pervade and condense and weighten into realities and going on in this strain he soared out of himself and astonished the two children who stood gazing at him wondering whether it were the doctor who was speaking thus until some interrupting circumstance seemed to bring him back to himself and he burst into one of his great roars of laughter the inspiration the strange light whereby he had been transfigured passed out of his face and there was the uncouth wildbearded rough earthy passionate man whom they called doctor grim looking ashamed of himself and trying to turn the whole matter into a jest endnote 2  it was a sad pity that he should have been interrupted and brought into this mocking mood just when he seemed to have broken away from the sinfulness of his hot evil nature and to have soared into a region where with all his native characteristics transfigured he seemed to have become an angel in his own likeness crusty hannah who had been drawn to the door of the study by the unusual tones of his voicea kind of piercing sweetness in italways averred that she saw the gigantic spider swooping round his head in great crafty circles and clutching as it were at his brain with its great claws but it was the old womans absurd idea that this hideous insect was the devil in that ugly guisea superstition which deserves absolutely no countenance nevertheless though this paroxysm of devotional feeling and insight returned no more to the grim doctor it was ever after a memorable occasion to the two children it touched that religious chord in both their hearts which there was no mother to touch but now it vibrated long and never ceased to vibrate so long as they remained togethernor perhaps after they were parted from each other and from the grim doctor and even then in those after years the strange music that had been awakened was continued as it were the echo from harps on high now at all events they made little prayers for themselves and said them at bedtime generally in secret sometimes in unison and they read in an old dusty bible which lay among the grim doctors books and from little heathens they became christian children doctor grimshawe was perhaps conscious of this result of his involuntary preachment but he never directly noticed it and did nothing either to efface or deepen the impression  it was singular however that in both the childrens minds this one gush of irresistible religious sentiment breaking out of the grim doctors inner depths like a sort of holy lava from a volcano that usually emitted quite other matter such as hot melted wrath and hate quite threw out of sight then and always afterwards his darker characteristics they remembered him with faith and love as a religious man and forgotwhat perhaps had made no impression on their innocent heartsall the traits that other people might have called devilish to them the grim doctor was a saint even during his lifetime and constant intercourse with them and canonized forever afterwards there is almost always to be sure this profound faith with regard to those they love in childhood but perhaps in this instance the children really had a depth of insight that grown people lacked a profound recognition of the bottom of this strange mans nature which was of such stuff as martyrs and heroic saints might have been made of though here it had been wrought miserably amiss at any rate his face with the holy awe upon it was what they saw and remembered when they thought of their friend doctor grim  one effect of his zealous and analytic instruction of the boy was very perceptible heretofore though enduring him and occasionally making a plaything of him it may be doubted whether the grim doctor had really any strong affection for the child it rather seemed as if his strong will were forcing him to undertake and carry sedulously forward a selfimposed task all that he had donehis redeeming the bright child from poverty and nameless degradation ignorance and a sordid life hopeless of better fortune and opening to him the whole realm of mighty possibilities in an american lifedid not imply any love for the little individual whom he thus benefited it had some other motive  but now approaching the child in this close intimate and helpful way it was very evident that his interest took a tenderer character there was everything in the boy that a boy could possess to attract affection he would have been a fathers pride and joy doctor grimshawe indeed was not his father but to a person of his character this was perhaps no cause of lesser love than if there had been the whole of that holy claim of kindred between them we speak of the natural force of blood we speak of the paternal relation as if it were productive of more earnest affection than can exist between two persons one of whom is protective but unrelated but there are wild forcible unrestricted characters on whom the necessity and even duty of loving their own child is a sort of barrier to love they perhaps do not love their own traits which they recognize in their children they shrink from their own features in the reflection presented by these little mirrors a certain strangeness and unlikeness such as gives poignancy to the love between the sexes would excite a livelier affection be this as it may it is not probable that doctor grimshawe would have loved a child of his own blood with the coarse characteristics that he knew both in his race and himself with nearly such fervor as this beautiful slender yet strenuous intelligent refined boywith such a highbred air handling common things with so refined a touch yet grasping them so firmly throwing a natural grace on all he did was he not his fatherhe that took this fair blossom out of the sordid mud in which he must soon have withered and perished was not this beautiful strangeness which he so wondered at the result of his care  and little elsie did the grim doctor love her as well perhaps not for in the first place there was a natural tie though not the nearest between her and doctor grimshawe which made him feel that she was cast upon his love a burden which he acknowledged himself bound to undertake then too there were unutterably painful reminiscences and thoughts that made him gasp for breath that turned his blood sour that tormented his dreams with nightmares and hellish phantoms all of which were connected with this innocent and happy child so that cheerful and pleasant as she was there was to the grim doctor a little fiend playing about his floor and throwing a lurid light on the wall as the shadow of this sunflickering child it is certain that there was always a pain and horror mixed with his feelings towards elsie he had to forget himself as it were and all that was connected with the causes why she came to be before he could love her amid his fondness when he was caressing her upon his knee pressing her to his rough bosom as he never took the freedom to press ned came these hateful reminiscences compelling him to set her down and corrugating his heavy brows as with a pang of fiercely resented strongly borne pain still the child had no doubt contrived to make her way into the great gloomy cavern of the grim doctors heart and stole constantly further and further in carrying a ray of sunshine in her hand as a taper to light her way and illuminate the rude dark pit into which she so fearlessly went     chapter v   doctor grim endnote 1 had the english faith in open air and daily acquaintance with the weather whatever it might be and it was his habit not only to send the two children to play for lack of a better place in the graveyard but to take them himself on long rambles of which the vicinity of the town afforded a rich variety it may be that the doctors excursions had the wider scope because both he and the children were objects of curiosity in the town and very much the subject of its gossip so that always in its streets and lanes the people turned to gaze and came to their windows and to the doors of shops to see this grim bearded figure leading along the beautiful children each by a hand with a surly aspect like a bulldog their remarks were possibly not intended to reach the ears of the party but certainly were not so cautiously whispered but they occasionally did do so the male remarks indeed generally died away in the throats that uttered them a circumstance that doubtless saved the utterer from some very rough rejoinder at the hands of the doctor who had grown up in the habit of a very ready and free recourse to his fists which had a way of doubling themselves up seemingly of their own accord but the shrill feminine voices sometimes sent their observations from window to window without dread of any such repartee on the part of the subject of them  there he goes the old spiderwitch quoth one shrill woman with those two poor babes that he has caught in his cobweb and is going to feed upon poor little tender things the bloody englishman makes free with the dead bodies of our friends and the living ones of our children  how red his nose is quoth another he has pulled at the brandy bottle pretty stoutly today early as it is pretty habits those children will learn between the devil in the shape of a great spider and this devilish fellow in his own shape it were well that our townsmen tarred and feathered the old british wizard  and as he got further off two or three little blackguard barefoot boys shouted shrilly after him                        doctor grim doctor grim                        the devil wove a web for him  being a nonsensical couplet that had been made for the grim doctors benefit and was hooted in the streets and under his own windows hearing such remarks and insults the doctor would glare round at them with red eyes especially if the brandybottle had happened to be much in request that day  indeed poor doctor grim had met with a fortune which befalls many a man with less cause than drew the public attention on this odd humorist for dwelling in a town which was as yet but a larger village where everybody knew everybody and claimed the privilege to know and discuss their characters and where there were few topics of public interest to take off their attention a very considerable portion of town talk and criticism fell upon him the old town had a certain provincialism which is less the characteristic of towns in these days when society circulates so freely than then besides it was a very rude epoch just when the country had come through the war of the revolution and while the surges of that commotion were still seething and swelling and while the habits and morals of every individual in the community still felt its influence and especially the contest was too recent for an englishman to be in very good odor unless he should cease to be english and become more american than the americans themselves in repudiating british prejudices or principles habits mode of thought and everything that distinguishes britons at home or abroad as doctor grim did not see fit to do this and as moreover he was a very doubtful questionable morose unamiable old fellow not seeking to make himself liked nor deserving to be so he was a very unpopular person in the town where he had chosen to reside nobody thought very well of him the respectable people had heard of his pipe and brandybottle the religious community knew that he never showed himself at church or meeting so that he had not that very desirable strength in a society split up into many sects of being able to rely upon the party sympathies of any one of them the mob hated him with the blind sentiment that makes one surly cur hostile to another surly cur he was the most isolated individual to be found anywhere and being so unsupported everybody was his enemy  the town as it happened had been pleased to interest itself much in this matter of doctor grim and the two children insomuch as he never sent them to school nor came with them to meeting of any kind but was bringing them up ignorant heathen to all appearances and as many believed was devoting them in some way to the great spider to which he had bartered his own soul it had been mooted among the selectmen the fathers of the town whether their duty did not require them to put the children under more suitable guardianship a measure which it may be was chiefly hindered by the consideration that in that case the cost of supporting them would probably be transferred from the grim doctors shoulders to those of the community nevertheless they did what they could maidenly ladies prim and starched in one or two instances called upon the doctorthe two children meanwhile being in the graveyard at playto give him christian advice as to the management of his charge but to confess the truth the doctors reception of these fair missionaries was not extremely courteous they were perhaps partly instigated by a natural feminine desire to see the interior of a place about which they had heard much with its spiders webs its strange machines and confusing tools so much contrary to crusty hannahs advice they persisted in entering crusty hannah listened at the door and it was curious to see the delighted smile which came over her dry old visage as the doctors growling rough voice after an abrupt question or two and a reply in a thin voice on the part of the maiden ladies grew louder and louder till the door opened and forth came the benevolent pair in great discomposure crusty hannah averred that their caps were much rumpled but this view of the thing was questioned though it were certain that the doctor called after them downstairs that had they been younger and prettier they would have fared worse a male emissary who was admitted on the supposition of his being a patient did fare worse for the grim doctor having been particularly intimate with the black bottle that afternoon there was about ten minutes after the visitors entrance a sudden fierce upraising of the doctors growl then a struggle that shook the house and finally a terrible rumbling down the stairs which proved to be caused by the precipitate descent of the hapless visitor who if he needed no assistance of the grim doctor on his entrance certainly would have been the better for a plaster or two after his departure  such were the terms on which doctor grimshawe now stood with his adopted townspeople and if we consider the dull little town to be full of exaggerated stories about the doctors oddities many of them forged all retailed in an unfriendly spirit misconceptions of a character which in its best and most candidly interpreted aspects was sufficiently amenable to censure surmises taken for certainties superstitionsthe genuine hereditary offspring of the frame of public mind which produced the witchcraft delusionall fermenting together and all this evil and uncharitableness taking the delusive hue of benevolent interest in two helpless childrenwe may partly judge what was the odium in which the grim doctor dwelt and amid which he walked the horrid suspicion too countenanced by his abode in the corner of the graveyard affording the terrible doctor such facilities for making free like a ghoul as he was with the relics of mortality from the earliest progenitor to the man killed yesterday by the doctors own drugs was not likely to improve his reputation  he had heretofore contented himself with at most occasionally shaking his stick at his assailants but this day the black bottle had imparted it may be a little more fire than ordinary to his blood and besides an unlucky urchin happened to take particularly good aim with a mud ball which took effect right in the midst of the doctors bushy beard and being of a soft consistency forthwith became incorporated with it at this intolerable provocation the grim doctor pursued the little villain amid a shower of similar missiles from the boys playmates caught him as he was escaping into a back yard dragged him into the middle of the street and with his stick proceeded to give him his merited chastisement  but hereupon it was astonishing how sudden commotion flashed up like gunpowder along the street which except for the petty shrieks and laughter of a few children was just before so quiet forth out of every window in those dusky mean wooden houses were thrust heads of women old and young forth out of every door and other avenue and as if they started up from the middle of the street or out of the unpaved sidewalks rushed fierce avenging forms threatening at full yell to take vengeance on the grim doctor who still with that fierce dark face of hishis muddy beard all flying abroad dirty and foul his hat fallen off his red eyes flashing firewas belaboring the poor hinder end of the unhappy urchin paying off upon that one part of the boys frame the whole score which he had to settle with the rude boys of the town giving him at once the whole whipping which he had deserved every day of his life and not a stroke of which he had yet received need enough there was no doubt that somebody should interfere with such grim and immitigable justice and certainly the interference was prompt and promised to be effectual  down with the old tyrant thrash him hang him tar and feather the vipers fry the wizard the bodysnatcher bellowed the mob one member of which was raving with delirium tremens and another was a madman just escaped from bedlam  it is unaccountable where all this mischievous bloodthirsty multitude came fromhow they were born into that quietness in such a moment of time what had they been about heretofore were they waiting in readiness for this crisis and keeping themselves free from other employment till it should come to pass had they been created for the moment or were they fiends sent by satan in the likeness of a blackguard population there you might see the offscourings of the recently finished warold soldiers rusty woodenlegged there sailors ripe for any kind of mischief there the drunken population of a neighboring grogshop staggering helterskelter to the scene and tumbling over one another at the doctors feet there came the father of the punished urchin who had never shown heretofore any care for his streetbred progeny but who now came pale with rage armed with a pair of tongs and with him the mother flying like a fury with her cap awry and clutching a broomstick as if she were a witch just alighted up they rushed from cellar doors and dropped down from chamber windows all rushing upon the doctor but overturning and thwarting themselves by their very multitude for as good doctor grim levelled the first that came within reach of his fist two or three of the others tumbled over him and lay grovelling at his feet the doctor meanwhile having retreated into the angle between two houses little ned with a valor which did him the more credit inasmuch as it was exercised in spite of a good deal of childish trepidation as his pale face indicated brandished his fists by the doctors side and little elsie did what any woman maythat is screeched in doctor grims behalf with full stretch of lungs meanwhile the street boys kept up a shower of mud balls many of which hit the doctor while the rest were distributed upon his assailants heightening their ferocity  seize the old scoundrel the villain the tory the dastardly englishman hang him in the web of his own devilish spidert is long enough tar and feather him tar and feather him  it was certainly one of those crises that show a man how few real friends he has and the tendency of mankind to stand aside at least and let a poor devil fight his own troubles if not assist them in their attack here you might have seen a brother physician of the grim doctors greatly tickled at his plight or a decorous powdered ruffleshirted dignitary one of the weighty men of the town standing at a neighbors corner to see what would come of it  he is not a respectable man i understand this grimshawea quack intemperate always in these scuffles let him get out as he may  and then comes a deacon of one of the churches and several church members who hearing a noise set out gravely and decorously to see what was going forward in a christian community  ah it is that irreligious and profane grimshawe who never goes to meeting we wash our hands of him  and one of the selectmen said  surely this common brawler ought not to have the care of these nice sweet children something must be done about it and when the man is sober he must be talked to  alas it is a hard case with a man who lives upon his own bottom and responsibility making himself no allies sewing himself on to nobodys skirts insulating himselfhard when his trouble comes and so poor doctor grimshawe was like to find it  he had succeeded by dint of good skill and some previous practice at quarterstaff in keeping his assailants at bay though not without some danger on his own part but their number their fierceness and the more skilled assault of some among them must almost immediately have been successful when the doctors part was strengthened by an unexpected ally this was a person endnote 2 of tall slight figure who without lifting his hands to take part in the conflict thrust himself before the doctor and turned towards the assailants crying  christian men what would you do peacepeace  his so well intended exhortation took effect indeed in a certain way but not precisely as might have been wished for a blow aimed at doctor grim took effect on the head of this man who seemed to have no sort of skill or alacrity at defending himself any more than at making an assault for he never lifted his hands but took the blow as unresistingly as if it had been kindly meant and it levelled him senseless on the ground  had the mob really been enraged for any strenuous cause this incident would have operated merely as a preliminary whet to stimulate them to further bloodshed but as they were mostly actuated only by a natural desire for mischief they were about as well satisfied with what had been done as if the doctor himself were the victim and besides the fathers and respectabilities of the town who had seen this mishap from afar now began to put forward crying out keep the peace keep the peace a riot a riot and other such cries as suited the emergency and the crowd vanished more speedily than it had congregated leaving the doctor and the two children alone beside the fallen victim of a quarrel not his own not to dwell too long on this incident the doctor laying hold of the last of his enemies after the rest had taken to their heels ordered him sternly to stay and help him bear the man whom he had helped to murder to his house  it concerns you friend for if he dies you hang to a dead certainty  and this was done accordingly     chapter vi   about an hour thereafter there lay on a couch that had been hastily prepared in the study a person of singularly impressive presence a thin mildlooking man with a peculiar look of delicacy and natural refinement about him although he scarcely appeared to be technically and as to worldly position what we call a gentleman plain in dress and simple in manner not giving the idea of remarkable intellectual gifts but with a kind of spiritual aspect fair clear complexion gentle eyes still somewhat clouded and obscured by the syncope into which a blow on the head had thrown him he looked middleaged and yet there was a kind of childlike simple expression which unless you looked at him with the very purpose of seeing the traces of time in his face would make you suppose him much younger  and how do you find yourself now my good fellow asked doctor grimshawe putting forth his hand to grasp that of the stranger and giving it a good warm shake none the worse i should hope endnote 1  not much the worse answered the stranger not at all it may be there is a pleasant dimness and uncertainty in my mode of being i am taken off my feet as it were and float in air with a faint delight in my sensations the grossness the roughness the too great angularity of the actual is removed from me it is a state that i like well it may be this is the way that the dead feel when they awake in another state of being with a dim pleasure after passing through the brief darkness of death it is very pleasant  he answered dreamily and sluggishly reluctantly as if there were a sense of repose in him which he disliked to break by putting any of his sensations into words his voice had a remarkable sweetness and gentleness though lacking in depth of melody  here take this said the doctor who had been preparing some kind of potion in a teaspoon it may have been a dose of his famous preparation of spiders web for aught i know the operation of which was said to be of a soothing influence causing a delightful silkiness of sensation but i know not whether it was considered good for concussions of the brain such as it is to be supposed the present patient had undergone take this it will do you good and here i drink your very good health in something that will do me good  so saying the grim doctor quaffed off a tumbler of brandy and water  how sweet a contrast murmured the stranger between that scene of violence and this great peace that has come over me it is as when one can say i have fought the good fight  you are right said the doctor with what would have been one of his deep laughs but which he modified in consideration of his patients tenderness of brain we both of us fought a good fight for though you struck no actual stroke you took them as unflinchingly as ever i saw a man and so turned the fortune of the battle better than if you smote with a sledgehammer two things puzzle me in the affair first whence came my assailants all in that moment of time unless satan let loose out of the infernal regions a synod of fiends hoping thus to get a triumph over me and secondly whence came you my preserver unless you are an angel and dropped down from the sky  no answered the stranger with quiet simplicity i was passing through the street to my little school when i saw your peril and felt it my duty to expostulate with the people  well said the grim doctor come whence you will you did an angels office for me and i shall do what an earthly man may to requite it there we will talk no more for the present  he hushed up the children who were already of their own accord walking on tiptoe and whispering and he himself even went so far as to refrain from the usual incense of his pipe having observed that the stranger who seemed to be of a very delicate organization had seemed sensible of the disagreeable effect on the atmosphere of the room the restraint lasted however only till in the course of the day crusty hannah had fitted up a little bedroom on the opposite side of the entry to which she and the grim doctor moved the stranger who though tall they observed was of no great weight and substancethe lightest man the doctor averred for his size that ever he had handled  every possible care was taken of him and in a day or two he was able to walk into the study again where he sat gazing at the sordidness and unneatness of the apartment the strange festoons and drapery of spiders webs the gigantic spider himself and at the grim doctor so shaggy grizzly and uncouth in the midst of these surroundings with a perceptible sense of something very strange in it all his mild gentle regard dwelt too on the two beautiful children evidently with a sense of quiet wonder how they should be here and altogether a sense of their unfitness they meanwhile stood a little apart looking at him somewhat disturbed and awed as children usually are by a sense that the stranger was not perfectly well that he had been injured and so set apart from the rest of the world  will you come to me little one said he holding out a delicate hand to elsie  elsie came to his side without any hesitation though without any of the rush that accompanied her advent to those whom she affected and you my little man added the stranger quietly and looking to ned who likewise willingly approached and shaking him by the offered hand let it go again but continued standing by his side  do you know my little friends said the stranger that it is my business in life to instruct such little people as you  do they obey you well sir asked ned perhaps conscious of a want of force in the person whom he addressed  the stranger smiled faintly not too well said he that has been my difficulty for i have moral and religious objections and also a great horror to the use of the rod and i have not been gifted with a harsh voice and a stern brow so that after a while my little people sometimes get the better of me the present generation of men is too gross for gentle treatment  you are quite right quoth doctor grimshawe who had been observing this little scene and trying to make out from the mutual deportment of the stranger and the two children what sort of man this fair quiet stranger was with his gentleness and weaknesscharacteristics that were not attractive to himself yet in which he acknowledged as he saw them here a certain charm nor did he know scarcely whether to despise the one in whom he saw them or to yield to a strange sense of reverence so he watched the children with an indistinct idea of being guided by them you are quite right the world nowand always before as far as i ever heardrequires a great deal of brute force a great deal of animal food and brandy in the man that is to make an impression on it  the convalescence of the strangerhe gave his name as colcord proceeded favorably for the doctor remarked that delicate as his system was it had a certain puritya simple healthfulness that did not run into disease as stronger constitutions might it did not apparently require much to crush down such a being as thisnot much unkindly breath to blow out the taper of his lifeand yet if not absolutely killed there was a certain aptness to keep alive in him not readily to be overcome  no sooner was he in a condition so to do than he went forth to look after the little school that he had spoken of but soon came back announcing in a very quiet and undisturbed way that during his withdrawal from duty the scholars had been distributed to other instructors and consequently he was without place or occupation endnotes 2 3 4  a hard case said the doctor flinging a gruff curse at those who had so readily deserted the poor schoolmaster  not so hard replied colcord these little fellows are an unruly set born of parents who have led rough liveshere in battle time too with the spirit of battle in themtherefore rude and contentious beyond my power to cope with them i have been taught long ago he added with a peaceful smile that my business in life does not lie with grownup and consolidated men and women and so not to be useless in my day and to gain the little that my sustenance requires i have thought to deal with children but even for this i lack force  i dare say said the doctor with a modified laugh little devils they are harder to deal with than men well i am glad of your failure for one reason and of your being thrown out of business because we shall have the benefit of you the longer here is this boy to be instructed i have made some attempts myself but having no art of instructing no skill no temper i suppose i make but an indifferent hand at it and besides i have other business that occupies my thoughts take him in hand if you like and the girl for company no matter whether you teach her anything unless you happen to be acquainted with needlework  i will talk with the children said colcord and see if i am likely to do good with them the lad i see has a singular spirit of aspiration and prideno ungentle pridebut still hard to cope with i will see the little girl is a most comfortable child  you have read the boy as if you had his heart in your hand said the doctor rather surprised i could not have done it better myself though i have known him all but from the egg  accordingly the stranger who had been thrust so providentially into this odd and insulated little community abode with them without more words being spoken on the subject for it seemed to all concerned a natural arrangement although on both parts they were mutually sensible of something strange in the companionship thus brought about to say the truth it was not easy to imagine two persons apparently less adapted to each others society than the rough uncouth animal doctor whose faith was in his own right arm so full of the old adam as he was so sturdily a hater so hotly impulsive so deep subtle and crooked so obstructed by his animal nature so given to his pipe and black bottle so wrathful and pugnacious and wickedand this mild spiritual creature so milky with so unforceful a grasp and it was singular to see how they stood apart and eyed each other each tacitly acknowledging a certain merit and kind of power though not well able to appreciate its value the grim doctors kindness however and gratitude had been so thoroughly awakened that he did not feel the disgust that he probably otherwise might at what seemed the mawkishness of colcords character his want morally speaking of bone and muscle his fastidiousness of character the essence of which it seemed to be to bear no stain upon it otherwise it must die  on colcords part there was a good deal of evidence to be detected by a nice observer that he found it difficult to put up with the doctors coarse peculiarities whether physical or moral his animal indulgences of appetite struck him with wonder and horror his coarse expressions his free indulgence of wrath his sordid and unclean habits the dust the cobwebs the monster that dangled from the ceiling his pipe diffusing its fragrance through the house and showing by the plainest and simplest proof how we all breathe one anothers breath nice and proud as we may be kings and daintiest ladies breathing the air that has already served to inflate a beggars lungs he shrank too from the rude manhood of the doctors character with its human warmthan element which he seemed not to possess in his own character he was capable only of gentle and mild regardthat was his warmest affection and the warmest too that he was capable of exciting in others so that he was doomed as much apparently as the doctor himself to be a lonely creature without any very deep companionship in the world though not incapable when he by some rare chance met a soul distantly akin of holding a certain high spiritual communion with the children however he succeeded in establishing some good and available relations his simple and passionless character coincided with their simplicity and their as yet unawakened passions they appeared to understand him better than the doctor ever succeeded in doing he touched springs and elements in the nature of both that had never been touched till now and that sometimes made a sweet high music but this was rarely and as far as the general duties of an instructor went they did not seem to be very successfully performed something was cultivated the spiritual germ grew it might be but the children and especially ned were intuitively conscious of a certain want of substance in the instructora something of earthly bulk a too etherealness but his connection with our story does not lie in any excellence or lack of excellence that he showed as an instructor and we merely mention these things as illustrating more or less his characteristics  the grim doctors curiosity was somewhat piqued by what he could see of the schoolmasters character and he was desirous of finding out what sort of a life such a man could have led in a world which he himself had found so rough a one through what difficulties he had reached middle age without absolutely vanishing away in his contact with more positive substances than himself how the world had given him a subsistence if indeed he recognized anything more dense than fragrance like a certain people whom pliny mentioned in africaa point in fact which the grim doctor denied his performance at table being inappreciable and confined at least almost entirely to a dish of boiled rice which crusty hannah set before him preparing it it might be with a sympathy of her east indian part towards him  well doctor grimshawe easily got at what seemed to be all of the facts of colcords life how that he was a newenglander the descendant of an ancient race of settlers the last of them for once pretty numerous in their quarter of the country they seemed to have been dying outexhaling from the earth and passing to some other region  no wonder said the doctor bluffly you have been letting slip the vital principle if you are a fair specimen of the race you do not clothe yourself in substance your souls are not coated sufficiently beef and brandy would have saved you you have exhaled for lack of them  the schoolmaster shook his head and probably thought his earthly salvation and sustenance not worth buying at such a cost the remainder of his history was not tangible enough to afford a narrative there seemed from what he said to have always been a certain kind of refinement in his race a nicety of conscience a nicety of habit which either was in itself a want of force or was necessarily connected with it and which the doctor silently thought had culminated in the person before him  it was always in us continued colcord with a certain pride which people generally feel in their ancestral characteristics be they good or evil we had a tradition among us of our first emigrant and the causes that brought him to the new world and it was said that he had suffered so much before quitting his native shores so painful had been his track that always afterwards on the forest leaves of this land his foot left a print of blood wherever he trod endnote 5     chapter vii   a print of blood said the grim doctor breaking his pipestem by some sudden spasm in his gripe of it pooh the devil take the pipe a very strange story that pray how was it endnote 1  nay it is but a very dim legend answered the schoolmaster although there are old yellow papers and parchments i remember in my fathers possession that had some reference to this man too though there was nothing in them about the bloody footprints but our family legend is that this man was of a good race in the time of charles the first originally papists but one of themthe second you our legend sayswas of a milder sweeter cast than the rest who were fierce and bloody men of a hard strong nature but he partook most of his mothers character this son had been one of the earliest quakers converted by george fox and moreover there had been love between him and a young lady of great beauty and an heiress whom likewise the eldest son of the house had designed to make his wife and these brothers cruel men caught their innocent brother and kept him in confinement long in his own native home  how asked the doctor why did not he appeal to the laws  our legend says replied the schoolmaster only that he was kept in a chamber that was forgotten endnote 2  very strange that quoth the doctor he was sold by his brethren  the schoolmaster went on to tell with much shuddering how a jesuit priest had been mixed up with this wretched business and there had been a scheme at once religious and political to wrest the estate and the lovely lady from the fortunate heir and how this grim italian priest had instigated them to use a certain kind of torture with the poor heir and how he had suffered from this but one night when they left him senseless he contrived to make his escape from that cruel home bleeding as he went and how by some action of his imagination his sense of the cruelty and hideousness of such treatment at his brethrens hands and in the holy name of his religionhis foot which had been crushed by their cruelty bled as he went and that blood had never been stanched and thus he had come to america and after many wanderings and much track of blood along rough ways to new england endnote 3  and what became of his beloved asked the grim doctor who was puffing away at a fresh pipe with a very queer aspect  she died in england replied the schoolmaster and before her death by some means or other they say that she found means to send him a child the offspring of their marriage and from that child our race descended and they say too that she sent him a key to a coffin in which was locked up a great treasure but we have not the key but he never went back to his own country and being heartbroken and sick and weary of the world and its pomps and vanities he died here after suffering much persecution likewise from the puritans for his peaceful religion was accepted nowhere  of all legendsall foolish legends quoth the doctor wrathfully with a face of a dark bloodred color so much was his anger and contempt excited and of all absurd heroes of a legend i never heard the like of this have you the key  no nor have i ever heard of it answered the schoolmaster  but you have some papers  they existed once perhaps are still recoverable by search said the schoolmaster my father knew of them  a foolish legend reiterated the doctor it is strange how human folly strings itself on to human folly as a story originally false and foolish grows older  he got up and walked about the room with hasty and irregular strides and a prodigious swinging of his ragged dressinggown which swept away as many cobwebs as it would take a week to reproduce after a few turns as if to change the subject the doctor asked the schoolmaster if he had any taste for pictures and drew his attention to the portrait which has been already mentionedthe figure in antique sordid garb with a halter round his neck and the expression in his face which the doctor and the two children had interpreted so differently colcord who probably knew nothing about pictures looked at it at first merely from the gentle and cool complaisance of his character but becoming absorbed in the contemplation stood long without speaking until the doctor looking in his face perceived his eyes were streaming with tears  what are you crying about said he gruffly  i dont know said the schoolmaster quietly but there is something in this picture that affects me inexpressibly so that not being a man passionate by nature i have hardly ever been so moved as now  very foolish muttered the doctor resuming his strides about the room i am ashamed of a grown man that can cry at a picture and cant tell the reason why  after a few more turns he resumed his easychair and his tumbler and looking upward beckoned to his pet spider which came dangling downward great particolored monster that he was and swung about his masters head in hideous conference as it seemed a sight that so distressed the schoolmaster or shocked his delicate taste that he went out and called the two children to take a walk with him with the purpose of breathing air that was neither infected with spiders nor graves  after his departure doctor grimshawe seemed even more disturbed than during his presence again he strode about the study then sat down with his hands on his knees looking straight into the fire as if it imaged the seething element of his inner man where burned hot projects smoke heat blackness ashes a smouldering of old thoughts a blazing up of new casting in the gold of his mind as aaron did that of the israelites and waiting to see what sort of a thing would come out of the furnace the children coming in from their play he spoke harshly to them and eyed little ned with a sort of savageness as if he meant to eat him up or do some other dreadful deed and when little elsie came with her usual frankness to his knee he repelled her in such a way that she shook her little hand at him saying naughty doctor grim what has come to you  through all that day by some subtle means or other the whole household knew that something was amiss and nobody in it was comfortable it was like a spell of weather like the east wind like an epidemic in the air that would not let anything be comfortable or contentedthis pervading temper of the doctor crusty hannah knew it in the kitchen even those who passed the house must have known it somehow or other and have felt a chill an irritation an influence on the nerves as they passed the spiders knew it and acted as they were wont to do in stormy weather the schoolmaster when he returned from his walk seemed likewise to know it and made himself secure and secret keeping in his own room except at dinner when he ate his rice in silence without looking towards the doctor and appeared before him no more till evening when the grim doctor summoned him into the study after sending the two children to bed  sir began the doctor you have spoken of some old documents in your possession relating to the english descent of your ancestors i have a curiosity to see these documents where are they  endnote 4  i have them about my person said the schoolmaster and he produced from his pocket a bundle of old yellow papers done up in a parchment cover tied with a piece of white cord and presented them to doctor grimshawe who looked over them with interest they seemed to consist of letters genealogical lists certified copies of entries in registers things which must have been made out by somebody who knew more of business than this ethereal person in whose possession they now were the doctor looked at them with considerable attention and at last did them hastily up in the bundle again and returned them to the owner  have you any idea what is now the condition of the family to whom these papers refer asked he  none whatevernone for almost a hundred years said the schoolmaster about that time ago i have heard a vague story that one of my ancestors went to the old country and saw the place but you see the change of name has effectually covered us from view and i feel that our true name is that which my ancestor assumed when he was driven forth from the home of his fathers and that i have nothing to do with any other i have no views on the estatenone whatever i am not so foolish and dreamy  very right said the doctor nothing is more foolish than to follow up such a pursuit as this against all the vested interests of two hundred years which of themselves have built up an impenetrably strong allegation against you they harden into stone in england these years and become indestructible instead of melting away as they do in this happy country  it is not a matter of interest with me replied the schoolmaster  very rightvery right repeated the grim doctor  but something was evidently amiss with him this evening it was impossible to feel easy and comfortable in contact with him if you looked in his face there was the red lurid glare of his eyes meeting you fiercely and craftily as ever sometimes he bit his lip and frowned in an awful manner once he burst out into an awful fit of swearing for no good reason or any reason whatever that he explained or that anybody could tell again for no more suitable reason he uplifted his stalwart arm and smote a heavy blow with his fist upon the oak table making the tumbler and black bottle leap up and damaging one would think his own knuckles then he rose up and resumed his strides about the room he paused before the portrait before mentioned then resumed his heavy quick irregular tread swearing under his breath and you would imagine from what you heard that all his thoughts and the movement of his mind were a blasphemy then againbut this was only oncehe heaved a deep ponderous sigh that seemed to come up in spite of him out of his depths an exhalation of deep suffering as if some convulsion had given it a passage to upper air instead of its being hidden as it generally was by accumulated rubbish of later time heaped above it  this latter sound appealed to something within the simple schoolmaster who had been witnessing the demeanor of the doctor like a being looking from another sphere into the trouble of the mortal one a being incapable of passion observing the mute hard struggle of one in its grasp  friend said he at length thou hast something on thy mind  aye said the grim doctor coming to a stand before his chair you see that can you see as well what it is  some stir and writhe of something in the past that troubles you as if you had kept a snake for many years in your bosom and stupefied it with brandy and now it awakes again and troubles you with bites and stings  what sort of a man do you think me asked the doctor  i cannot tell said the schoolmaster the sympathies of my nature are not those that should give me knowledge of such men  am i think you continued the grim doctor a man capable of great crime  a great one if any said colcord a great good likewise it might be  what would i be likely to do asked doctor grim supposing i had a darling purpose to the accomplishment of which i had given my soul yes my soulmy success in life my days and nights of thought my years of time dwelling upon it pledging myself to it until at last i had grown to love the burden of it and not to regret my own degradation i a man of strongest will what would i do if this were to be resisted  i do not conceive of the force of will shaping out my ways said the schoolmaster i walk gently along and take the path that opens before me  ha ha ha shouted the grim doctor with one of his portentous laughs so do we all in spite of ourselves and sometimes the path comes to a sudden ending and he resumed his drinking  the schoolmaster looked at him with wonder and a kind of shuddering at something so unlike himself but probably he very imperfectly estimated the forces that were at work within this strange being and how dangerous they made him he imputed it a great deal to the brandy which he had kept drinking in such inordinate quantities whereas it is probable that this had a soothing emollient effect as far as it went on the doctors emotions a sort of like to like that he instinctively felt to be a remedy but in truth it was difficult to see these two human creatures together without feeling their incompatibility without having a sense that one must be hostile to the other the schoolmaster through his fine instincts doubtless had a sense of this and sat gazing at the lurid wrathful figure of the doctor in a sort of trance and fascination not able to stir bewildered by the sight of the great spider and other surroundings and this strange uncouth fiend who had always been abhorrent to himhe had a kind of curiosity in it waited to see what would come of it but felt it to be an unnatural state to him and again the grim doctor came and stood before him prepared to make another of those strange utterances with which he had already so perplexed him  that nightthat midnightit was rumored through the town that one of the inhabitants going home late along the street that led by the graveyard saw the grim doctor standing by the open window of the study behind the elm tree in his old dressinggown chill as was the night and flinging his arms abroad wildly into the darkness and muttering like the growling of a tempest with occasional vociferations that grew even shrill with passion the listener though affrighted could not resist an impulse to pause and attempt overhearing something that might let him into the secret counsels of this strange wild man whom the town held in such awe and antipathy to learn perhaps what was the great spider and whether he were summoning the dead out of their graves however he could make nothing out of what he overheard except it were fragmentary curses of a dreadful character which the doctor brought up with might and main out of the depths of his soul and flung them forth burning hot aimed at what and why and to what practical end it was impossible to say but as necessarily as a volcano in a state of eruption sends forth boiling lava sparkling and scintillating stones and a sulphurous atmosphere indicative of its inward state endnote 5  dreading lest some one of these ponderous anathemas should alight reason or none on his own head the man crept away and whispered the thing to his cronies from whom it was communicated to the townspeople at large and so became one of many stories circulating with reference to our grim hero which if not true to the fact had undoubtedly a degree of appositeness to his character of which they were the legitimate flowers and symbols if the anathemas took no other effect they seemed to have produced a very remarkable one on the unfortunate elm tree through the naked branches of which the doctor discharged this fiendish shot for the next spring when april came no tender leaves budded forth no life awakened there and never again on that old elm widely as its roots were imbedded among the dead of many years was there rustling bough in the summer time or the elms early golden boughs in september and after waiting till another spring to give it a fair chance of reviving it was cut down and made into coffins and burnt on the sextons hearth the general opinion was that the grim doctors awful profanity had blasted that tree fostered as it had been on gravemould of puritans in lancashire they tell of a similar anathema it had a very frightful effect it must be owned this idea of a man cherishing emotions in his breast of so horrible a nature that he could neither tell them to any human being nor keep them in their plenitude and intensity within the breast where they had their germ and so was forced to fling them forth upon the night to pollute and put fear into the atmosphere and that people should breathein somewhat of horror from an unknown source and be affected with nightmare and dreams in which they were startled at their own wickedness     chapter viii   at the breakfasttable the next morning however appeared doctor grimshawe wearing very much the same aspect of an uncombed unshorn unbrushed odd sort of a pagan as at other times and making no difference in his breakfast except that he poured a pretty large dose of brandy into his cup of tea a thing however by no means unexampled or very unusual in his history there were also the two children fresher than the morning itself rosy creatures with newly scrubbed cheeks made over again for the new day though the old one had left no dust upon themendnote 1 laughing with one another flinging their little jokes about the table and expecting that the doctor might as was often his wont set some ponderous old english joke trundling round among the breakfast cups eating the corncakes which crusty hannah with the aboriginal part of her had a knack of making in a peculiar and exquisite fashion but there was an empty chair at table one cup one little jug of milk and another of pure water with no guest to partake of them  where is the schoolmaster said ned pausing as he was going to take his seat  yes doctor grim said little elsie  he has overslept himself for once quoth doctor grim gruffly a strange thing too for a man whose victuals and drink are so light as the schoolmasters the fiend take me if i thought he had mortal mould enough in him ever to go to sleep at all though he is but a kind of dreamstuff in his widestawake state hannah you bronze jade call the schoolmaster to come to breakfast  hannah departed on her errand and was heard knocking at the door of the schoolmasters chamber several times till the doctor shouted to her wrathfully to cease her clatter and open the door at once which she appeared to do and speedily came back  he no there massa schoolmaster melted away  vanished like a bubble quoth the doctor  the great spider caught him like a fly quoth crusty hannah chuckling with a sense of mischief that seemed very pleasant to her strange combination  he has taken a morning walk said little ned dont you think so doctor grim  yes said the grim doctor go on with your breakfast little monkey the walk may be a long one or he is so slight a weight that the wind may blow him overboard  a very long walk it proved or it might be that some wind whether evil or good had blown him as the doctor suggested into parts unknown for from that time forth the yankee schoolmaster returned no more it was a singular disappearance  the bed did not appear to have been slept in there was a bundle in a clean handkerchief containing two shirts two pocket handkerchiefs two pairs of cotton socks a testament and that was all had he intended to go away why did he not take this little luggage in his hand being all he had and of a kind not easily dispensed with the doctor made small question about it however he had seemed surprised at first yet gave certainly no energetic token of it and when ned who began to have notions of things proposed to advertise him in the newspapers or send the town crier round the doctor ridiculed the idea unmercifully  lost a lank yankee schoolmaster quoth he uplifting his voice after the manner of the town crier supposed to have been blown out of doctor grims window or perhaps have ridden off astride of a humble bee  it is not pretty to laugh in that way doctor grim said little elsie looking into his face with a grave shake of her head  and why not you saucy little witch said the doctor  it is not the way to laugh doctor grim persisted the child but either could not or would not assign any reason for her disapprobation although what she said appeared to produce a noticeable effect on doctor grimshawe who lapsed into a rough harsh manner that seemed to satisfy elsie better crusty hannah meanwhile seemed to dance about the house with a certain singular alacrity a wonderful friskiness indeed as if the diabolical result of the mixture in her nature was particularly pleased with something so she went with queer gesticulations crossings contortions friskings evidently in a very mirthful state until being asked by her master what was the matter she replied massa me know what became of the schoolmaster great spider catch in his web and eat him  whether that was the mode of his disappearance or some other certainly the schoolmaster was gone and the children were left in great bewilderment at the sudden vacancy in his place they had not contracted a very yearning affection for him and yet his impression had been individual and real and they felt that something was gone out of their lives now that he was no longer there something strange in their circumstances made itself felt by them they were more sensible of the grim doctors uncouthness his strange reprehensible habits his dark mysterious lifein looking at these things and the spiders and the graveyard and their insulation from the world through the crystal medium of this strangers character in remembering him in connection with these things a certain seemly beauty in him showed strikingly the unfitness the sombre and tarnished color the outr√©ness of the rest of their lot little elsie perhaps felt the loss of him more than her playmate although both had been interested by him but now things returned pretty much to their old fashion although as is inevitably the case whenever persons or things have been taken suddenly or unaccountably out of our sphere without telling us whither and why they have disappeared the children could not for a long while bring themselves to feel that he had really gone perhaps in imitation of the custom in that old english house of which the doctor had told them little elsie insisted that his place should still be kept at the table and so whenever crusty hannah neglected to do so she herself would fetch a plate and a little pitcher of water and set it beside a vacant chair and sometimes so like a shadow had he been this pale slender creature it almost might have been thought that he was sitting with them but crusty hannah shook her head and grinned the spider know where he is we never see him more  his abode in the house had been of only two or three weeks and in the natural course of things had he come and gone in an ordinary way his recollection would have grown dim and faded out in two or three weeks more but the speculations the expectations the watchings for his reappearance served to cut and grave the recollection of him into the childrens hearts so that it remained a lifelong thing with thema sense that he was something that had been lost out of their life too soon and that was bound sooner or later to reappear and finish what business he had with them sometimes they prattled around the doctors chair about him and they could perceive sometimes that he appeared to be listening and would chime in with some remark but he never expressed either wonder or regret only telling ned once that he had no reason to be sorry for his disappearance  why doctor grim asked the boy  the doctor mused and smoked his pipe as if he himself were thinking why and at last he answered he was a dangerous fellow my old boy  why said ned again  he would have taken the beef out of you said the doctor  i know not how long it was before any other visitor except such as brought their shattered constitutions there in hopes that the doctor would make the wornout machinery as good as new came to the lonely little household on the corner of the graveyard the intercourse between themselves and the rest of the town remained as scanty as ever still the grim shaggy doctor was seen setting doggedly forth in all seasons and all weathers at a certain hour of the day with the two children going for long walks on the seashore or into the country miles away and coming back hours afterwards with plants and herbs that had perhaps virtue in them or flowers that had certainly beauty even in their season the fragrant magnolias leaving a trail of fragrance after them that grow only in spots the seeds having been apparently dropped by some happy accident when those proper to the climate were distributed shells there were also in the baskets that they carried minerals rare things that a magic touch seemed to have created out of the rude and common things that others find in a homely and ordinary region the boy was growing tall and had got out of the merely infantile age agile he was bright but still with a remarkable thoughtfulness or gravity or i know not what to call it but it was a shadow no doubt falling upon him from something sombre in his warp of life which the impressibility of his age and nature so far acknowledged as to be a little pale and grave without positive unhappiness and when a playful moment came as they often did to these two healthy children it seemed all a mistake that you had ever thought either of them too grave for their age but little elsie was still the merrier they were still children although they quarrelled seldomer than of yore and kissed seldomer and had ceased altogether to complain of one another to the doctor perhaps the time when nature saw these bickerings to be necessary to the growth of some of their faculties was nearly gone when they did have a quarrel the boy stood upon his dignity and visited elsie with a whole day sometimes of silent and stately displeasure which she was accustomed to bear sometimes with an assumption of cold indifference sometimes with liveliness mirth in double quantity laughter almost as good as real little arts which showed themselves in her as naturally as the gift of tears and smiles in fact having no advantage of female intercourse she could not well have learnt them unless from crusty hannah who was such an anomaly of a creature with all her mixtures of race that she struck you as having lost all sex as one result of it yet this little girl was truly feminine and had all the manners and preeminently uncriticisable tenets proper to women at her early age  she had made respectable advancement in study that is she had taught herself to write with even greater mechanical facility than ned and other knowledge had fallen upon her as it were by a reflected light from him or to use another simile had been spattered upon her by the full stream which the doctor poured into the vessel of the boys intellect so that she had even some knowledge of the rudiments of latin and geometry and algebra inaccurate enough but yet with such a briskness that she was sometimes able to assist ned in studies in which he was far more deeply grounded than herself all this however was more by sympathy than by any natural taste for such things being kindly and sympathetic and impressible she took the color of what was nearest to her and especially when it came from a beloved object so that it was difficult to discover that it was not really one of her native tastes the only thing perhaps altogether suited to her idiosyncrasy because it was truly feminine calculated for dainty fingers and a nice little subtlety was that kind of embroidery twisting needlework on textile fabric which as we have before said she learnt from crusty hannah and which was emblematic perhaps of that creatures strange mixture of races  elsie seemed not only to have caught this art in its original spirit but to have improved upon it creating strange fanciful and graceful devices which grew beneath her finger as naturally as the variegated hues grow in a flower as it opens so that the homeliest material assumed a grace and strangeness as she wove it whether it were grass twigs shells or what not never was anything seen that so combined a wild barbarian freedom with cultivated grace and the grim doctor himself little open to the impressions of the beautiful used to hold some of her productions in his hand gazing at them with deep intentness and at last perhaps breaking out into one of his deep roars of laughter for it seemed to suggest thoughts to him that the children could not penetrate this one feature of strangeness and wild faculty in the otherwise sweet and natural and homely character of elsie had a singular effect it was like a wreath of wildflowers in her hair like something that set her a little way apart from the rest of the world and had an even more striking effect than if she were altogether strange  thus were the little family going on the doctor i regret to say growing more morose selfinvolved and unattainable since the disappearance of the schoolmaster than before more given up to his one plaything the great spider less frequently even than before coming out of the grim seclusion of his moodiness to play with the children though they would often be sensible of his fierce eyes fixed upon them and start and feel incommoded by the intensity of his regardthus things were going on when one day there was really again a visitor and not a dilapidated patient to the grim doctors study crusty hannah brought up his name as mr hammond and the doctorfilling his everlasting pipe meanwhile and ordering hannah to give him a coal perhaps this was the circumstance that made people say he had imps to bring him coals from tophetordered him to be shown up endnote 2  a freshcolored rather young man endnote 3 entered the study a person of rather cold and ungraceful manners yet geniallooking enough at least not repulsive he was dressed in rather a rough serviceable travellingdress and except for a nicely brushed hat and unmistakably white linen was rather careless in attire you would have thought twice perhaps before deciding him to be a gentleman but finally would have decided that he was one great token being that the singular aspect of the room into which he was ushered the spider festoonery and other strange accompaniments the grim aspect of the doctor himself and the beauty and intelligence of his two companions and even that horrific weaver the great dangling spiderneither one nor all of these called any expression of surprise to the strangers face  your name is hammond begins the doctor with his usual sparseness of ornamental courtesy endnote 4  the stranger bowed  an englishman i perceive continued the doctor but nowise intimating that the fact of being a countryman was any recommendation in his eyes  yes an englishman replied hammond a briefless barrister endnote 5 in fact of lincolns inn who having little or nothing to detain him at home has come to spend a few idle months in seeing the new republic which has been made out of english substance  and what continued doctor grim not a whit relaxing the repulsiveness of his manner and scowling askance at the stranger what may have drawn on me the good fortune of being compelled to make my time idle because yours is so  the strangers cheek flushed a little but he smiled to himself as if saying that here was a grim rude kind of humorist who had lost the sense of his own peculiarity and had no idea that he was rude at all i came to america as i told you said he chiefly because i was idle and wanted to turn my enforced idleness to what profit i could in the way of seeing men manners governments and problems which i hope to have no time to study by and by but i also had an errand intrusted to me and of a singular nature and making inquiry in this little town where my mission must be performed if at all i have been directed to you by your townspeople as to a person not unlikely to be able to assist me in it  my townspeople since you choose to call them so answered the grim doctor ought to know by this time that i am not the sort of man likely to assist any person in any way  yet this is so singular an affair said the stranger still with mild courtesy that at least it may excite your curiosity i have come here to find a grave  to find a grave said doctor grim giving way to a grim sense of humor and relaxing just enough to let out a joke the tameness of which was a little redeemed to his taste by its grimness i might help you there to be sure since it is all in the way of business like others of my profession i have helped many people to find their graves no doubt and shall be happy to do the same for you you have hit upon the one thing in which my services are ready  i thank you my dear sir said the young stranger having tact enough to laugh at dr grims joke and thereby mollifying him a little but as far as i am personally concerned i prefer to wait a while before making the discovery of that little spot in mother earth which i am destined to occupy it is a grave which has been occupied as such for at least a century and a half which i am in quest of and it is as an antiquarian a genealogist a person who has had dealings with the dead of long ago not as a professional man engaged in adding to their number that i ask your aid  ah ahah said the doctor laying down his pipe and looking earnestly at the stranger not kindly nor genially but rather with a lurid glance of suspicion out of those red eyes of his but no longer with a desire to escape an intruder rather as one who meant to clutch him explain your meaning sir at once  then here it is said mr hammond there is an old english family one of the members of which very long ago emigrated to this part of america then a wilderness and long afterwards a british colony he was on ill terms with his family there is reason to believe that documents deeds titular proofs or some other thing valuable to the family were buried in the grave of this emigrant and there have been various attempts within a century to find this grave and if possible some living descendant of the man or both under the idea that either of these cases might influence the disputed descent of the property and enable the family to prove its claims to an ancient title now rather as a matter of curiosity than with any real hope of success and being slightly connected with the familyi have taken what seems to myself a wildgoose chase making it merely incidental you well understand not by any means the main purpose of my voyage to america  what is the name of this family asked the doctor abruptly  the man whose grave i seek said the stranger lived and died in this country under the assumed name of colcord  how do you expect to succeed in this ridiculous quest asked the doctor and what marks signs directions have you to guide your search and moreover how have you come to any knowledge whatever about the matter even that the emigrant ever assumed this name of colcord and that he was buried anywhere and that his place of burial after more than a century is of the slightest importance  all this was ascertained by a messenger on a similar errand with my own only undertaken nearly a century ago and more in earnest than i can pretend to be replied the englishman at that period however there was probably a desire to find nothing that might take the hereditary possessions of the family out of the branch which still held them and there is strong reason to suspect that the information acquired was purposely kept secret by the person in england into whose hands it came the thing is differently situated now the possessor of the estate is recently dead and the discovery of an american heir would not be unacceptable to many at all events any knowledge gained here would throw light on a somewhat doubtful matter  where as nearly as you can judge said the doctor after a turn or two through the study was this man buried  he spent the last years of his life certainly in this town said hammond and may be found if at all among the dead of that period  and theytheir miserable dust at least which is all that still exists of themwere buried in the graveyard under these windows said the doctor what marks i sayfor you might as well seek a vanished wave of the sea as a grave that surged upward so long ago  on the gravestone said hammond a slate one there was rudely sculptured the impress of a foot what it signifies i cannot conjecture except it had some reference to a certain legend of a bloody footstep which is currently told and some token of which yet remains on one of the thresholds of the ancient mansionhouse  ned and elsie had withdrawn themselves from the immediate vicinity of the fireside and were playing at fox and geese in a corner near the window but little elsie having very quick ears and a faculty of attending to more affairs than one now called out doctor grim ned and i know where that gravestone is  hush elsie whispered ned earnestly  come forward here both of you said doctor grimshawe     chapter ix   the two children approached and stood before the doctor and his guest the latter of whom had not hitherto taken particular notice of them he now looked from one to the other with the pleasant genial expression of a person gifted with a natural liking for children and the freemasonry requisite to bring him acquainted with them and it lighted up his face with a pleasant surprise to see two such beautiful specimens of boyhood and girlhood in this dismal spiderhaunted house and under the guardianship of such a savage lout as the grim doctor he seemed particularly struck by the intelligence and sensibility of neds face and met his eyes with a glance that ned long afterwards remembered but yet he seemed quite as much interested by elsie and gazed at her face with a perplexed inquiring glance  these are fine children said he may i ask if they are your own pardon me if i ask amiss added he seeing a frown on the doctors brow  ask nothing about the brats replied he grimly thank heaven they are not my children so your question is answered  i again ask pardon said mr hammond i am fond of children and the boy has a singularly fine countenance not in the least english the true american face no doubt as to this sweet little girl she impresses me with a vague resemblance to some person i have seen hers i should deem an english face  these children are not our topic said the grim doctor with gruff impatience if they are to be so our conversation is ended ned what do you know of this gravestone with the bloody foot on it  it is not a bloody foot doctor grim said ned and i am not sure that it is a foot at all only elsie and i chose to fancy so because of a story that we used to play at but we were children then the gravestone lies on the ground within a little bit of a walk of our door but this snow has covered it all over else we might go out and see it  we will go out at any rate said the doctor and if the englishman chooses to come to america he must take our snows as he finds them take your shovel ned and if necessary we will uncover the gravestone  they accordingly muffled themselves in their warmest and plunged forth through a back door into ned and elsies playground as the grim doctor was wont to call it the snow except in one spot close at hand lay deep like cold oblivion over the surging graves and piled itself in drifted heaps against every stone that raised itself above the level it filled enviously the letters of the inscriptions enveloping all the dead in one great windingsheet whiter and colder than those which they had individually worn the dreary space was pathless not a footstep had tracked through the heavy snow for it must be warm affection indeed that could so melt this wintry impression as to penetrate through the snow and frozen earth and establish any warm thrills with the dead beneath daisies grass genial earth these allow of the magnetism of such sentiments but winter sends them shivering back to the baffled heart  well ned said the doctor impatiently  ned looked about him somewhat bewildered and then pointed to a spot within not more than ten paces of the threshold which they had just crossed and there appeared not a gravestone but a new grave if any grave could be called new in that oftendug soil made up of old mortality an open hole with the freshlydug earth piled up beside it a little snow for there had been a gust or two since morning appeared as they peeped over the edge to have fallen into it but not enough to prevent a coffin from finding fit room and accommodation in it but it was evident that the grave had been dug that very day  the headstone with the foot on it was just here said ned in much perplexity and as far as i can judge the old sunken grave exactly marked out the space of this new one endnote 1  it is a shame said elsie much shocked at the indecorum that the new person should be thrust in here for the old one was a friend of ours  but what has become of the headstone exclaimed the young english stranger  during their perplexity a person had approached the group wading through the snow from the gateway giving entrance from the street a gaunt figure with stooping shoulders over one of which was a spade and some other tool fit for delving in the earth and in his face there was the sort of keen humorous twinkle that gravediggers somehow seem to get as if the dolorous character of their business necessitated something unlike itself by an inevitable reaction  well doctor said he with a shrewd wink in his face are you looking for one of your patients the man who is to be put to bed here was never caught in your spiders web  no said doctor grimshawe when my patients have done with me i leave them to you and the old nick and never trouble myself about them more what i want to know is why you have taken upon you to steal a mans grave after he has had immemorial possession of it by what right have you dug up this bed undoing the work of a predecessor of yours who has long since slept in one of his own furrows  why doctor said the gravedigger looking quietly into the cavernous pit which he had hollowed it is against common sense that a dead man should think to keep a grave to himself longer than till you can take up his substance in a shovel it would be a strange thing enough if when living families are turned out of their homes twice or thrice in a generation as they are likely to be in our new government a dead man should think he must sleep in one spot till the day of judgment no turn about i say to these old fellows as long as they can decently be called dead men i let them lie when they are nothing but dust i just take leave to stir them on occasion this is the way we do things under the republic whatever your customs be in the old country  matters are very much the same in any old english churchyard said the english stranger but my good friend i have come three thousand miles partly to find this grave and am a little disappointed to find my labor lost  ah and you are the man my father was looking for said the grave digger nodding his head at mr hammond my father who was a grave digger afore me died four and thirty years ago when we were under the king and says he ebenezer do not you turn up a sod in this spot till you have turned up every other in the ground and i have always obeyed him  and what was the reason of such a singular prohibition asked hammond  my father knew said the gravedigger and he told me the reason too but since we are under the republic we have given up remembering those oldworld legends as we used to the newspapers keep us from talking in the chimneycorner and so things go out of our minds an old man with his stories of what he has seen and what his great grandfather saw before him is of little account since newspapers came up stopi rememberno i forgetit was something about the grave holding a witness who had been sought before and might be again  and that is all you know about it said hammond  allevery mite said the old gravedigger but my father knew and would have been glad to tell you the whole story there was a great deal of wisdom and knowledge about graves especially buried out yonder where my old father was put away before the stamp act was thought of but it is no great matter i suppose people dont care about old graves in these times they just live and put the dead out of sight and out of mind  well but what have you done with the headstone said the doctor you cant have eaten it up  no no doctor said the gravedigger laughing it would crack better teeth than mine old and crumbly as it is and yet i meant to do something with it that is akin to eating for my oven needs a new floor and i thought to take this stone which would stand the fire well but here continued he scraping away the snow with his shovel a task in which little ned gave his assistancehere is the headstone just as i have always seen it and as my father saw it before me  the ancient memorial being cleared of snow proved to be a slab of freestone with some rude traces of carving in basrelief around the border now much effaced and an impression which seemed to be as much like a human foot as anything else sunk into the slab but this device was wrought in a much more clumsy way than the ornamented border and evidently by an unskilful hand beneath was an inscription over which the hard flat lichens had grown and done their best to obliterate it although the following words might be written endnote 2 or guessed  here lyeth the mortal part of thomas colcord an upright man of tender and devout soul who departed this troublous life september ye nineteenth 1667 aged 57 years and nine months happier in his death than in his lifetime let his bones be  the name colcord was somewhat defaced it was impossible in the general disintegration of the stone to tell whether wantonly or with a purpose of altering and correcting some error in the spelling or as occurred to hammond to change the name entirely  this is very unsatisfactory said hammond but very curious too but this certainly is the impress of what was meant for a human foot and coincides strangely with the legend of the bloody footstepthe mark of the foot that trod in the blessed king charless blood  for that matter said the gravedigger it comes into my mind that my father used to call it the stamp of satans foot because he claimed the dead man for his own it is plain to see that there was a deep deft between two of the toes  there are two ways of telling that legend remarked the doctor but did you find nothing in the grave hewen  o yesa bone or twoas much as could be expected after above a hundred years said the gravedigger i tossed them aside and if you are curious about them you will find them when the snow melts that was all and it would have been unreasonable in old colcordespecially in these republican timesto have wanted to keep his grave any longer when there was so little of him left  i must drop the matter here then said hammond with a sigh here my friend is a trifle for your trouble  no trouble said the gravedigger and in these republican times we cant take anything for nothing because it wont do for a poor man to take off his hat and say thank you  nevertheless he did take the silver and winked a sort of acknowledgment  the doctor with unwonted hospitality invited the english stranger to dine in his house and though there was no pretence of cordiality in the invitation mr hammond accepted it being probably influenced by curiosity to make out some definite idea of the strange household in which he found himself doctor grimshawe having taken it upon him to be hostfor up to this time the stranger stood upon his own responsibility and having voluntarily presented himself to the doctor had only himself to thank for any scant courtesy he might meetbut now the grim doctor became genial after his own fashion at dinner he produced a bottle of port which made the young englishman almost fancy himself on the other side of the water and he entered into a conversation which i fancy was the chief object which the grim doctor had in view in showing himself in so amiable a light endnote 3 for in the course of it the stranger was insensibly led to disclose many things as it were of his own accord relating to the part of england whence he came and especially to the estate and family which have been before mentionedthe present state of that family together with other things that he seemed to himself to pour out naturally for at last he drew himself up and attempted an excuse  your good wine said he or the unexpected accident of meeting a countryman has made me unusually talkative and on subjects i fear which have not a particular interest for you  i have not quite succeeded in shaking off my country as you see said doctor grimshawe though i neither expect nor wish ever to see it again  there was something rather ungracious in the grim doctors response and as they now adjourned to his study and the doctor betook himself to his pipe and tumbler the young englishman sought to increase his acquaintance with the two children both of whom showed themselves graciously inclined towards him more warmly so than they had been to the schoolmaster as he was the only other guest whom they had ever met  would you like to see england my little fellow he inquired of ned  oh very much more than anything else in the world replied the boy his eyes gleaming and his cheeks flushing with the earnestness of his response for indeed the question stirred up all the dreams and reveries which the child had cherished far back into the dim regions of his memory after what the doctor had told him of his origin he had never felt any home feeling here it seemed to him that he was wandering ned whom the wind had blown from afar somehow or other from many circumstances which he put together and seethed in his own childish imagination it seemed to him that he was to go back to that far old country and there wander among the green ivygrown venerable scenes the older he grew the more his mind took depth the stronger was this fancy in him though even to elsie he had scarcely breathed it  so strong a desire said the stranger smiling at his earnestness will be sure to work out its own accomplishment i shall meet you in england my young friend one day or another and you my little girl are you as anxious to see england as your brother  ned is not my brother said little elsie  the doctor here interposed some remark on a different subject for it was observable that he never liked to have the conversation turn on these children their parentage or relations to each other or himself  the children were sent to bed and the young englishman finding the conversation lag and his host becoming gruffer and less communicative than he thought quite courteous retired but before he went however he could not refrain from making a remark on the gigantic spider which was swinging like a pendulum above the doctors head  what a singular pet said he for the nervous part of him had latterly been getting uppermost so that it disturbed him in fact the spider above and the grim man below equally disturbed him are you a naturalist have you noted his habits  yes said the doctor i have learned from his web how to weave a plot and how to catch my victim and devour him  thank god said the englishman as he issued forth into the cold gray night i have escaped the grim fellows web at all events how strange a groupthose two sweet children that grim old man  as regards this matter of the ancient grave it remains to be recorded that when the snow melted little ned and elsie went to look at the spot where by this time there was a little hillock with the brown sods laid duly upon it which the coming spring would make green by the side of it they saw with more curiosity than repugnance a few fragments of crumbly bones which they plausibly conjectured to have appertained to some part of the framework of the ancient colcord wherewith he had walked through the troublous life of which his gravestone spoke and little elsie whose eyes were very sharp and her observant qualities of the quickest found something which ned at first pronounced to be only a bit of old iron incrusted with earth but elsie persisted to knock off some of the earth that seemed to have incrusted it and discovered a key the children ran with their prize to the grim doctor who took it between his thumb and finger turned it over and over and then proceeded to rub it with a chemical substance which soon made it bright it proved to be a silver key of antique and curious workmanship  perhaps this is what mr hammond was in search of said ned what a pity he is gone perhaps we can send it after him  nonsense said the gruff doctor  and attaching the key to a chain which he took from a drawer and which seemed to be gold he hung it round neds neck  when you find a lock for this key said he open it and consider yourself heir of whatever treasure is revealed there  ned continued that sad fatal habit of growing out of childhood as boys will until he was now about ten years old and little elsie as much as six or seven he looked healthy but pale something there was in the character and influences of his life that made him look as if he were growing up in a shadow with less sunshine than he needed for a robust and exuberant development though enough to make his intellectual growth tend towards a little luxuriance in some directions he was likely to turn out a fanciful perhaps a poetic youth young as he was there had been already discoveries on the grim doctors part of certain blotted and clumsily scrawled scraps of paper the chirography on which was arrayed in marshalled lines of unequal length and each commanded by a capital letter and marching on from six to ten lame feet doctor grim inspected these things curiously and to say the truth most scornfully before he took them to light his pipe withal but they told him little as regarded this boys internal state being mere echoes and very lugubrious ones of poetic strains that were floating about in the atmosphere of that day long before any now remembered bard had begun to sing but there were the rudiments of a poetic and imaginative mind within the boy if its subsequent culture should be such as the growth of that delicate flower requires a brooding habit taking outward things into itself and imbuing them with its own essence until after they had lain there awhile they assumed a relation both to truth and to himself and became mediums to affect other minds with the magnetism of his own he lived far too much an inward life for healthfulness at his age the peculiarity of his situation a child of mystery with certain reaches and vistas that seemed to promise a bright solution of his mystery keeping his imagination always awake and strong that castle in the airso much more vivid than other castles because it had perhaps a real substance of ancient ivygrown hewn stone somewherethat visionary hall in england with its surrounding woods and fine lawns and the beckoning shadows at the ancient windows and that fearful threshold with the blood still glistening on ithe dwelt and wandered so much there that he had no real life in the sombre house on the corner of the graveyard except that the loneliness of the latter and the grim doctor with his grotesque surroundings and then the great ugly spider and that odd inhuman mixture of crusty hannah all served to remove him out of the influences of common life little elsie was all that he had to keep life real and substantial and she a child so much younger than he was influenced by the same circumstances and still more by himself so that as far as he could impart himself to her he led her hand in hand through the same dreamscenery amid which he strayed himself they knew not another child in town the grim doctor was their only friend as for ned this seclusion had its customary and normal effect upon him it had made him think ridiculously high of his own gifts powers attainments and at the same time doubt whether they would pass with those of others it made him despise all flesh as if he were of a superior race and yet have an idle and weak fear of coming in contact with them from a dread of his incompetency to cope with them so he at once depreciated and exalted to an absurd degree both himself and others  ned said the doctor to him one day in his gruffest tone you are not turning out to be the boy i looked for and meant to make i have given you sturdy english instruction and solidly grounded you in matters that the poor superficial people and time merely skim over i looked to see the rudiments of a man in you by this time and you begin to mope and pule as if your babyhood were coming back on you you seem to think more than a boy of your years should and yet it is not manly thought nor ever will be so what do you mean boy by making all my care of you come to nothing in this way  i do my best doctor grim said ned with sullen dignity what you teach me i learn what more can i do  ill tell you what my fine fellow quoth doctor grim getting rude as was his habit you disappoint me and ill not bear it i want you to be a man and ill have you a man or nothing if i had foreboded such a fellow as you turn out to be i never would have taken you from the place where as i once told you i found youthe almshouse  o doctor grim doctor grim cried little elsie in a tone of grief and bitter reproach  ned had risen slowly as the doctor uttered those last words turning as white as a sheet and stood gazing at him with large eyes in which there was a calm upbraiding a strange dignity was in his childish aspect which was no longer childish but seemed to have grown older all in a moment  sir added the doctor incensed at the boys aspect there is nonsense that ought to be whipt out of you  you have said enough sir said the boy would to god you had left me where you found meendnote 4 it was not my fault that you took me from the almshouse but it will be my fault if i ever eat another bit of your bread or stay under your roof an hour longer  he was moving towards the door but little elsie sprung upon him and caught him round the neck although he repelled her with severe dignity and doctor grimshawe after a look at the group in which a bitter sort of mirth and mischief struggled with a better and kindlier sentiment at last flung his pipe into the chimney hastily quaffed the remnant of a tumbler and shuffled after ned kicking off his old slippers in his hurry he caught the boy just by the door  ned ned my boy im sorry for what i said cried he i am a guzzling old blockhead and dont know how to treat a gentleman when he honors me with his company it is not in my blood nor breeding to have such knowledge ned you will make a man and i lied if i said otherwise come im sorry im sorry  the boy was easily touched at these years as a boy ought to be and though he had not yet forgiven the grim doctor the tears to his especial shame gushed out of his eyes in a torrent and his whole frame shook with sobs the doctor caught him in his arms and hugged him to his old tobaccofragrant dressinggown hugged him like a bear as he was so that poor ned hardly knew whether he was embracing him with his love or squeezing him to death in his wrath  ned said he im not going to live a great while longer i seem an eternal nuisance to you i know but its not so im mortal and i feel myself breaking up let us be friends while i live for believe me ned ive done as well by you as i knew and care for nothing love nothing so much as you little elsie here yes i love her too but thats different you are a boy and will be a man and a man whom i destine to do for me what it has been the object of my life to achieve let us be friends we willwe must be friends and when old doctor grim worthless wretch that he is sleeps in his grave you shall not have the pang of having parted from him in unkindness forgive me ned and not only that but love me better than ever for though i am a hasty old wretch i am not altogether evil as regards you  i know not whether the doctor would have said all this if the day had not been pretty well advanced and if his potations had not been many but at any rate he spoke no more than he felt and his emotions thrilled through the sensitive system of the boy and quite melted him down he forgave doctor grim and as he asked loved him better than ever and so did elsie then it was so sweet so good to have had this one outgush of affectionhe poor child who had no memory of mothers kisses or of being cared for out of tenderness and whose heart had been hungry all his life for some such thing and probably doctor grim in his way had the same kind of enjoyment of this passionate crisis so that though the next day they all three looked at one another a little ashamed yet it had some remote analogy to that delicious embarrassment of two lovers at their first meeting after they know all     chapter x   it is very remarkable that ned had so much good in him as we find there in the first place born as he seemed to be of a wild vagrant stock a seedling sown by the breezes and falling among the rocks and sands the growing up without a mother to cultivate his tenderness with kisses and the inestimable inevitable love of love breaking out on all little occasions without reference to merit or demerit unfailing whether or no mothers faith in excellences the buds which were yet invisible to all other eyes but to which her warm faith was the genial sunshine necessary to their growth mothers generous interpretation of all that was doubtful in him and which might turn out good or bad according as should be believed of it mothers pride in whatever the boy accomplished and unfailing excuses explanations apologies so satisfactory for all his failures mothers deep intuitive insight which should see the permanent good beneath all the appearance of temporary evil being wiser through her love than the wisest sage could bethe dullest homeliest mother than the wisest sage the creator apparently has set a little of his own infinite wisdom and love which are one in a mothers heart so that no child in the common course of things should grow up without some heavenly instruction instead of all this and the vast deal more that mothers do for children there had been only the gruff passionate doctor without sense of religion with only a fitful tenderness with years length between the fits so fiercely critical so wholly unradiant of hope misanthropic savagely morbid yes there was little elsie too it must have been that she was the boys preserver being childhood sisterhood womanhood all that there had been for him of human life and enoughhe being naturally of such good stuffto keep him good he had lost much but not all he was not nearly what he might have been under better auspices flaws and imperfections there were in abundance great uncultivated wastes and wildernesses in his moral nature tangled wilds where there might have been stately venerable religious groves but there was no rank growth of evil that unknown mother that had no opportunity to nurse her boy must have had gentle and noblest qualities to endow him with a noble father too a long unstained descent one would have thought was this an almshouse child  doctor grim knew very probably that there was all this on the womanly side that was wanting to neds occasion and very probably too being a man not without insight he was aware that tender treatment as a mother bestows it tends likewise to foster strength and manliness of character as well as softer developments but all this he could not have supplied and now as little as ever but there was something else which ned ought to have and might have and this was intercourse with his kind free circulation free air instead of the stivedup house with the breeze from the graveyard blowing over itto be drawn out of himself and made to share the life of many to be introduced at one remove to the world with which he was to contend to this end shortly after the scene of passion and reconciliation above described the doctor took the resolution of sending ned to an academy famous in that day and still extant accordingly they all threethe grim doctor ned and elsieset forth one day of spring leaving the house to crusty hannah and the great spider in a carryall being the only excursion involving a nights absence that either of the two children remembered from the house by the graveyard as at nightfall they saw the modest pinebuilt edifice with its cupola and bell where ned was to be initiated into the schoolboy the doctor remembering perhaps days spent in some gray stately legendary great school of england instinct with the boyhood of men afterwards great puffed forth a depreciating curse upon it but nevertheless made all arrangements for neds behoof and next morning prepared to leave him there  ned my son good by cried he shaking the little fellows hand as he stood tearful and wistful beside the chaise shivering at the loneliness which he felt settling around hima new loneliness to himthe loneliness of a crowd do not be cast down my boy face the world grasp the thistle strongly and it will sting you the less have faith in your own fist fear no man have no secret plot never do what you think wrong if hereafter you learn to know that doctor grim was a bad man forgive him and be a better one yourself good by and if my blessing be good for anything in gods name i invoke it upon you heartily  little elsie was sobbing and flung her arms about neds neck and he his about hers so that they parted without a word as they drove away a singular sort of presentiment came over the boy as he stood looking after them  it is all overall over said he to himself doctor grim and little elsie are gone out of my life they leave me and will never come backnot they to me not i to them o how cold the world is would we threethe doctor and elsie and icould have lain down in a row in the old graveyard close under the eaves of the house and let the grass grow over us the world is cold and i am an almshouse child  the house by the graveyard seemed dismal now no doubt to little elsie who being of a cheerful nature herself common natures often having this delusion about a home had grown up with the idea that it was the most delightful spot in the world the place fullest of pleasant play and of household love because her own love welled over out of her heart like a spring in a barrel the place where everybody was kind and good the world beyond its threshold appearing perhaps strange and sombre the spot where it was pleasantest to be for its own mere sake the dim old homely place so warm and cosey in winter so cool in summer who else was fortunate enough to have such a home with that nice kind beautiful ned and that dear kind gentle old doctor grim with his sweet ways so wise so upright so good beyond all other men o happy girl that she was to have grown up in such a home was there ever any other house with such cosey nooks in it such probably were the feelings of good little elsie about this place which has seemed to us so dismal for the home feeling in the childs heart her warm cheerful affectionate nature was a magic so far as she herself was concerned and made all the house and its inmates over after her own fashion but now that little ned was gone there came a change she moped about the house and for the first time suspected it was dismal  as for the grim doctor there did not appear to be much alteration in that hard old character perhaps he drank a little more though that was doubtful because it is difficult to see where he could find niches to stick in more frequent drinks nor did he more frequently breathe through the pipe he fell into desuetude however of his daily walk endnote 1 and sent elsie to play by herself in the graveyard a dreary business enough for the poor child instead of taking her to country or seaside himself he was more savage and blasphemous sometimes than he had been heretofore known to be but on the other hand he was sometimes softer with a kind of weary consenting to circumstances intervals of helpless resignation when he no longer fought and struggled in his heart he did not seem to be alive all the time but on the other hand he was sometimes a good deal too much alive and could not bear his potations as well as he used to do and was overheard blaspheming at himself for being so weakly and having a brain that could not bear a thimbleful and growing to be a milksop like colcord as he said this person of whom the doctor and his young people had had such a brief experience appeared nevertheless to hang upon his remembrance in a singular waythe more singular as there was little resemblance between them or apparent possibility of sympathy little elsie was startled to hear doctor grim sometimes call out colcord colcord as if he were summoning a spirit from some secret place he muttered sitting by himself long indistinct masses of talk in which this name was discernible and other names going on mumbling by the hour together great masses of vague trouble in which if it only could have been unravelled and put in order no doubt all the secrets of his lifesecrets of wrath guilt vengeance love hatred all beaten up together and the best quite spoiled by the worst might have been found his mind evidently wandered sometimes he seemed to be holding conversation with unseen interlocutors and almost invariably so far as could be gathered he was bitter and then sat immitigable pouring out wrath and terror denunciating tyrannical speaking as to something that lay at his feet but which he would not spare endnote 2 then suddenly he would start look round the dark old study upward to the dangling spider overhead and then at the quiet little girl who try as she might could not keep her affrighted looks from his face and always met his eyes with a loyal frankness and unyielded faith in him  oh you little jade what have you been overhearing  nothing doctor grimnothing that i could make out  make out as much as you can he said i am not afraid of you  afraid of little elsie dear doctor grim  neither of you nor of the devil murmured the doctorof nobody but little ned and that milksop colcord if i have wronged anybody it is them as for the rest let the day of judgment come doctor grim is ready to fling down his burden at the judgment seat and have it sorted there  then he would lie back in his chair and look up at the great spider who or else it was elsies fancy seemed to be making great haste in those days filling out his web as if he had less time than was desirable for such a piece of work  one morning the doctor arose as usual and after breakfast at which he ate nothing and even after filling his coffeecup half with brandy half with coffee left it untouched save sipping a little out of a teaspoon he went to the study with a rather unsteady gait chiefly remarkable because it was so early in the day and there established himself with his pipe as usual and his medical books and machines and his manuscript but he seemed troubled irresolute weak and at last he blew out a volley of oaths with no apparent appropriateness and then seemed to be communing with himself  it is of no use to carry this on any further said he fiercely in a decided tone as if he had taken a resolution elsie my girl come and kiss me  so elsie kissed him amid all the tobaccosmoke which was curling out of his mouth as if there were a halfextinguished furnace in his inside  elsie my little girl i mean to die today said the old man  to die dear doctor grim o no o no  o yes elsie said the doctor in a very positive tone i have kept myself alive by main force these three weeks and i find it hardly worth the trouble it requires so much exercise of willand i am weary weary the pipe does not taste good the brandy bewilders me ned is gone tooi have nothing else to do i have wrought this many a year for an object and now taking all things into consideration i dont know whether to execute it or no ned is gone there is nobody but my little elsiea good child but not quite enough to live for i will let myself die therefore before sunset  o no doctor grim let us send for ned and you will think it worth the trouble of living  no elsie i want no one near my deathbed when i have finished a little business you must go out of the room and i will turn my face to the wall and say goodnight but first send crusty hannah for mr pickering  he was a lawyer of the town a man of classical and antiquarian tastes as well as legal acquirement and some of whose pursuits had brought him and doctor grim occasionally together besides calling this gentleman crusty hannah of her own motion but whether out of good will to the poor doctor grim or from a tendency to mischief inherent in such unnatural mixtures as hers summoned likewise in all haste a medical manand as it happened the one who had taken a most decidedly hostile part to our doctorand a clergyman who had often devoted our poor friend to the infernal regions almost by name in his sermons a kindness to say the truth which the doctor had fully reciprocated in many anathemas against the clergyman these two worthies arriving simultaneously and in great haste were forthwith ushered to where the doctor lay half reclining in his study and upon showing their heads the doctor flew into an awful rage threatening in his customary improper way when angry to make them smell the infernal regions and proceeding to put his threats into execution by flinging his odorous tobaccopipe in the face of the medical man and rebaptizing the clergyman with a halfemptied tumbler of brandy and water and sending a terrible vociferation of oaths after them both as they clattered hastily down the stairs really that crusty hannah must have been the devil for she stood grinning and chuckling at the foot of the stairs curtseying grotesquely  he terrible man our old doctor grim quoth crusty hannah he drive us all to the wicked place before him  this however was the final outbreak of poor doctor grim indeed he almost went off at once in the exhaustion that succeeded the lawyer arrived shortly after and was shut up with him for a considerable space after which crusty hannah was summoned and desired to call two indifferent persons from the street as witnesses to a will and this document was duly executed and given into the possession of the lawyer this done and the lawyer having taken his leave the grim doctor desired and indeed commanded imperatively that crusty hannah should quit the room having firstwe are sorry to sayplaced the brandybottle within reach of his hand and leaving him propped up in his armchair in which he leaned back gazing up at the great spider who was dangling overhead as the door closed behind crusty hannahs grinning and yet strangely interested face the doctor caught a glimpse of little elsie in the passage bathed in tears and lingering and looking earnestly into the chamber endnote 3  seeing the poor little girl the doctor cried out to her half wrathfully half tenderly dont cry you little wretch come and kiss me once more so elsie restraining her grief with a great effort ran to him and gave him a last kiss  tell ned said the doctor solemnly to think no more of the old english hall or of the bloody footstep or of the silver key or any of all that nonsense good by my dear then he said with his thunderous and imperative tone let no one come near me till tomorrow morning  so that parting was over but still the poor little desolate child hovered by the study door all day long afraid to enter afraid to disobey but unable to go sometimes she heard the doctor muttering as was his wont once she fancied he was praying and dropping on her knees she also prayed fervently and perhaps acceptably then all at once the doctor called out in a loud voice no ned no drop it drop it  and then there was an utter silence unbroken forevermore by the lips that had uttered so many objectionable things  and finally after an interval which had been prescribed by the grim doctor a messenger was sent by the lawyer to our friend ned to inform him of this sad event and to bring him back temporarily to town for the purpose of hearing what were his prospects and what disposition was now to be made of him we shall not attempt to describe the grief astonishment and almost incredulity of ned on discovering that a person so mixed up with and built into his whole life as the stalwart doctor grimshawe had vanished out of it thus unexpectedly like something thin as a vaporlike a red flame that one instant is very bright in its lurid ray and then is nothing at all amid the darkness to the poor boys still further grief and astonishment he found on reaching the spot that he called home that little elsie as the lawyer gave him to understand by the express orders of the doctor and for reasons of great weight had been conveyed away by a person under whose guardianship she was placed and that ned could not be informed of the place even crusty hannah had been provided for and disposed of and was no longer to be found mr pickering explained to ned the dispositions in his favor which had been made by his deceased friend who out of a moderate property had left him the means of obtaining as complete an education as the country would afford and of supporting himself until his own exertions would be likely to give him the success which his abilities were calculated to win the remainder of his property a less sum than that thus disposed of was given to little elsie with the exception of a small provision to crusty hannah with the recommendation from the doctor that she should retire and spend the remainder of her life among her own people there was likewise a certain sum left for the purpose of editing and printing with a dedication to the medical society of the state an account of the process of distilling balm from cobwebs the bequest being worded in so singular a way that it was just as impossible as it had ever been to discover whether the grim doctor was in earnest or no  what disappointed the boy in a greater degree than we shall try to express was the lack of anything in reference to those dreams and castles of the airany explanation of his birth so that he was left with no trace of it except just so far as the almshouse whence the doctor had taken him there all traces of his name and descent vanished just as if he had been made up of the air as an aerolite seems to be before it tumbles on the earth with its mysterious iron  the poor boy in his bewilderment had not yet come to feel what his grief was it was not to be conceived in a few days that he was deprived of every person thing or thought that had hitherto kept his heart warm he tried to make himself feel it yearning for this grief as for his sole friend being for the present domiciled with the lawyer he obtained the key of his former home and went through the desolate house that he knew so well and which now had such a silent cold familiar strangeness with none in it though the ghosts of the grim doctor of laughing little elsie of crusty hannahdead and alive alikewere all there and his own ghost among them for he himself was dead that is his former self which he recognized as himself had passed away as they were in the study everything looked as formerly yet with a sort of unreality as if it would dissolve and vanish on being touched and indeed it partly proved so for over the doctors chair seemed still to hang the great spider but on looking closer at it and finally touching it with the end of the doctors stick ned discovered that it was merely the skin shell apparition of the real spiderendnote 4 the reality of whom it is to be supposed had followed the grim doctor whithersoever he had gone  a thought struck ned while he was here he remembered the secret niche in the wall where he had once seen the doctor deposit some papers he looked and there they were who was the heir of those papers if not he if there were anything wrong in appropriating them it was not perceptible to him in the desolation anxiety bewilderment and despair of that moment he grasped the papers and hurried from the room and down the stairs afraid to look round and half expecting to hear the gruff voice of doctor grim thundering after him to bring them back  then ned went out of the back door and found his way to the doctors new grave which as it happened was dug close beside that one which occupied the place of the one which the stranger had come to seek and as if to spite the doctors professional antipathies it lay beside a grave of an old physician and surgeon one doctor summerton who used to help diseases and kill patients above a hundred years ago but doctor grim was undisturbed by these neighbors and apparently not more by the grief of poor little ned who hid his face in the crumbly earth of the grave and the sods that had not begun to grow and wept as if his heart would break  but the heart never breaks on the first grave and after many graves it gets so obtuse that nothing can break it  and now let the mists settle down over the trail of our story hiding it utterly on its onward course for a long way to come until after many years they may disperse and discover something which were it worth while to follow it through all that obscurity would prove to be the very same track which that boy was treading when we last saw him though it may have lain over land and sea since then but the footsteps that trod there are treading here     chapter xi   there isor there was now many years ago and a few years also it was still extanta chamber which when i think of it seems to me like entering a deep recess of my own consciousness a deep cave of my nature so much have i thought of it and its inmate through a considerable period of my life after i had seen it long in fancy then i saw it in reality with my waking eyes and questioned with myself whether i was really awake  not that it was a picturesque or stately chamber not in the least it was dim dim as a melancholy mood so dim to come to particulars that till you were accustomed to that twilight medium the print of a book looked all blurred a pin was an indistinguishable object the face of your familiar friend or your dearest beloved one would be unrecognizable across it and the figures so warm and radiant with life and heart would seem like the faint gray shadows of our thoughts brooding in age over youthful images of joy and love nevertheless the chamber though so difficult to see across was small you detected that it was within very narrow boundaries though you could not precisely see them only you felt yourself shut in compressed impeded in the deep centre of something and you longed for a breath of fresh air some articles of furniture there seemed to be but in this dim medium to which we are unaccustomed it is not well to try to make out what they were or anything elsenow at leastabout the chamber only one thing small as the light was it was rather wonderful how there came to be any for no windows were apparent no communication with the outward day endnote 1  looking into this chamber in fancy it is some time before we who come out of the broad sunny daylight of the world discover that it has an inmate yes there is some one within but where we know it but do not precisely see him only a presence is impressed upon us it is in that corner no not there only a heap of darkness and an old antique coffer that as we look closely at it seems to be made of carved wood ah he is in that other dim corner and now that we steal close to him we see him a young man pale flung upon a sort of mattress couch he seems in alarm at something or other he trembles he listens as if for voices it must be a great peril indeed that can haunt him thus and make him feel afraid in such a seclusion as you feel this to be but there he is tremulous and so pale that really his face is almost visible in the gloomy twilight how came he here who is he what does he tremble at in this duskiness we cannot tell only that he is a young man in a state of nervous excitement and alarm looking about him starting to his feet sometimes standing and staring about him  has he been living here apparently not for see he has a pair of long ridingboots on coming up to the knees they are splashed with mud as if he had ridden hastily through foul ways the spurs are on the heel a ridingdress upon him ha is that blood upon the hand which he clasps to his forehead  what more do you perceive nothing the light is so dim but only we wonder where is the door and whence the light comes there is a strange abundance of spiders too we perceive spinning their webs here as if they would entrammel something in them a mouse has run across the floor apparently but it is too dim to detect him or to detect anything beyond the limits of a very doubtful vagueness we do not even know whether what we seem to have seen is really so whether the man is young or old or what his surroundings are and there is something so disagreeable in this seclusion this stifled atmosphere that we should be loath to remain here long enough to make ourselves certain of what was a mystery let us forth into the broad genial daylight for there is magic there is a devilish subtile influence in this chamber which i have reason to believe makes it dangerous to remain here there is a spell on the threshold heaven keep us safe from it  hark has a door unclosed is there another human being in the room we have now become so accustomed to the dim medium that we distinguish a man of mean exterior with a look of habitual subservience that seems like that of an english servingman or a person in some menial situation decent quiet neat softlybehaved but yet with a certain hard and questionable presence which we would not well like to have near us in the room  am i safe asks the inmate of the prisonchamber  sir there has been a search  leave the pistols said the voice  again endnote 2 after this time a long time extending to years let us look back into that dim chamber wherever in the world it was into which we had a glimpse and where we saw apparently a fugitive how looks it now still dimperhaps as dim as everbut our eyes or our imagination have gained an acquaintance a customariness with the medium so that we can discern things now a little more distinctly than of old possibly there may have been something cleared away that obstructed the light at any rate we see now the whereaboutsbetter than we did it is an oblong room lofty but narrow and some ten paces in length its floor is heavily carpeted so that the tread makes no sound it is hung with old tapestry or carpet wrought with the hand long ago and still retaining much of the ancient colors where there was no sunshine to fade them worked on them is some tapestried story done by catholic hands of saints or devils looking each equally grave and solemnly the light whence comes it there is no window but it seems to come through a stone or something like ita dull gray medium that makes noonday look like evening twilight though sometimes there is an effect as if something were striving to melt itself through this dull medium andnever making a shadowyet to produce the effect of a cloud gathering thickly over the sun there is a chimney yes a little grate in which burns a coal fire a dim smouldering fire it might be an illumination if that were desirable  what is the furniture an antique chairone chair no more a table manyfooted of dark wood it holds writingmaterials a book too on its face with the dust gathered on its back there is moreover a sort of antique box or coffer of some dark wood that seems to have been wrought or carved with skill wondrous skill of some period when the art of carving wainscot with arms and devices was much practised so that on this coffersome six feet long it is and two or three broadmost richly wrought you see faces in relief of knight and dame lords heraldic animals some story very likely told almost revelling in gothic sculpture of wood like what we have seen on the marble sarcophagus of the old greeks it has too a lock elaborately ornamented and inlaid with silver  what else only the spiders webs spinning strangely over everything over that light which comes into the room through the stone over everything and now we see in a corner a strange great spider curiously variegated the ugly terrible seemingly poisonous thing makes us shudder endnote 3  what else there are pistols they lie on the coffer there is a curiously shaped italian dagger of the kind which in a groove has poison that makes its wound mortal on the old mantelpiece over the fireplace there is a vial in which are kept certain poisons it would seem as if some one had meditated suicide or else that the foul fiend had put all sorts of implements of selfdestruction in his way so that in some frenzied moment he might kill himself  but the inmate there he is but the frenzied alarm in which we last saw him seems to have changed its character no throb now no passion no frenzy of fear or despair he sits dull and motionless see his cheek is very pale his hair long and dishevelled his beard has grown and curls round his face he has on a sleepinggown a long robe as of one who abides within doors and has nothing to do with outward elements a pair of slippers a dull dreamy reverie seems to have possessed him hark there is again a stealthy step on the floor and the servingman is here again there is a peering anxious curiosity in his face as he struts towards him a sort of enjoyment one would say in the way in which he looks at the strange case  i am here you know he says at length after feasting his eyes for some time on the spectacle  i hear you says the young man in a dull indifferent tone  will not your honor walk out today says the man it is long now since your honor has taken the air  very long says the master but i will not go out today what weather is it  sunny bright a summer day says the man but you would never know it in these damp walls the last winters chill is here yet had not your honor better go forth  it might seem that there was a sort of sneer deeply hidden under respect and obeisance in the mans words and craftily respectful tone deeply hidden but conveying a more subtile power on that account at all events the master seemed aroused from his state of dull indifference and writhed as with poignant anguishan infused poison in his veinsas the man spoke  have you procured me that new drug i spoke of asked the master  here it is said the man putting a small package on the table  is it effectual  so said the apothecary answered the man and i tried it on a dog he sat quietly a quarter of an hour then had a spasm or two and was dead but your honor the dead carcass swelled horribly  hush villain have therehave there been inquiries for memention of me  o none sirnone sir affairs go on bravelythe new live the world fills up the gap is not vacant there is no mention of you marry at the alehouse i heard some idle topers talking of a murder that took place some few years since and saying that heavens vengeance would come for it yet  silence villain there is no such thing said the young man and with a laugh that seemed like scorn he relapsed into his state of sullen indifference during which the servant stole away after looking at him some time as if to take all possible note of his aspect the man did not seem so much to enjoy it himself as he did to do these things in a kind of formal and matterofcourse way as if he were performing a set duty as if he were a subordinate fiend and were doing the duty of a superior one without any individual malice of his own though a general satisfaction in doing what would accrue to the agglomeration of deadly mischief he stole away and the master was left to himself  by and by by what impulse or cause it is impossible to say he started upon his feet in a sudden frenzy of rage and despair it seemed as if a consciousness of some strange wild miserable fate that had befallen him had come upon him all at once how that he was a prisoner to a devilish influence to some wizard might that bound him hand and foot with spiders web so he stamped so he half shrieked yet stopped himself in the midst so that his cry was stifled and smothered then he snatched up the poisoned dagger and looked at it the noose and put it about his neckevil instrument of deathbut laid it down again and then was a voice at the door quietly quietly you know or they will hear you and at that voice he sank into sullen indifference again     chapter xii   a traveller with a knapsack on his shoulders comes out of the duskiness of vague unchronicled times throwing his shadow before him in the morning sunshine along a welltrodden though solitary path  it was early summer or perhaps latter spring and the most genial weather that either spring or summer ever brought possessing a character indeed as if both seasons had done their utmost to create an atmosphere and temperature most suitable for the enjoyment and exercise of life to one accustomed to a climate where there is seldom a medium between heat too fierce and cold too deadly it was a new development in the nature of weather so genial it was so full of all comfortable influences and yet somehow or other void of the torrid characteristic that inevitably burns in our full sunbursts the traveller thought in fact that the sun was at less than his brightest glow for though it was brightthough the day seemed cloudless though it appeared to be the clear transparent morning that precedes an unshadowed noonstill there was a mild and softened character not so perceptible when he directly sought to see it but as if some veil were interposed between the earth and sun absorbing all the passionate qualities out of the latter and leaving only the kindly ones warmth was in abundance and yet all through it and strangely akin to it there was a halfsuspected coolness that gave the atmosphere its most thrilling and delicious charm it was good for human life as the traveller felt throughout all his being good likewise for vegetable life as was seen in the depth and richness of verdure over the gently undulating landscape and the luxuriance of foliage wherever there was tree or shrub to put forth leaves  the path along which the traveller was passing deserved at least a word or two of description it was a welltrodden footpath running just here along the edge of a field of grass and bordered on one side by a hedge which contained materials within itself for varied and minute researches in natural history so richly luxuriant was it with its diverse vegetable life such a green intricacy did it form so impenetrable and so beautiful and such a paradise it was for the birds that built their nests there in a labyrinth of little boughs and twigs unseen and inaccessible while close beside the human race to which they attach themselves that they must have felt themselves as safe as when they sung to eve homely flowers likewise grew in it and many creeping and twining plants that were an original part of the hedge had come of their own accord and dwelt here beautifying and enriching the verdant fence by way of repayment for the shelter and support which it afforded them at intervals trees of vast trunk and mighty spread of foliage whether elms or oaks grew in the line of the hedge and the bark of those gigantic agelong patriarchs was not gray and naked like the trees which the traveller had been accustomed to see but verdant with moss or in many cases richly enwreathed with a network of creeping plants and oftenest the ivy of old growth clambering upward and making its own twisted stem almost of one substance with the supporting tree on one venerable oak there was a plant of mystic leaf which the traveller knew by instinct and plucked a bough of it with a certain reverence for the sake of the druids and christmas kisses and of the pasty in which it was rooted from of old  the path in which he walked rustic as it was and made merely by the feet that pressed it down was one of the ancientest of ways older than the oak that bore the mistletoe older than the villages between which it passed older perhaps than the common road which the traveller had crossed that morning old as the times when people first debarred themselves from wandering freely and widely wherever a vagrant impulse led them the footpath therefore still retains some of the characteristics of a woodland walk taken at random by a lover of nature not pressed for time nor restrained by artificial barriers it sweeps and lingers along and finds pretty little dells and nooks of delightful scenery and picturesque glimpses of halls or cottages in the same neighborhood where a highroad would disclose only a tiresome blank they run into one another for miles and miles together and traverse rigidly guarded parks and domains not as a matter of favor but as a right so that the poorest man thus retains a kind of property and privilege in the oldest inheritance of the richest the highroad sees only the outside the footpath leads down into the heart of the country  a pleasant feature of the footpath was the stile between two fields no frail and temporary structure but betokening the permanence of this rustic way the ancient solidity of the stone steps worn into cavities by the hobnailed shoes that had pressed upon them here not only the climbing foot had passed for ages but here had sat the maiden with her milkpail the rustic on his way afield or homeward here had been lover meetings cheerful chance chats song as natural as bird note a thousand pretty scenes of rustic manners  it was curious to see the traveller pause to contemplate so simple a thing as this old stile of a few stone steps antique as an old castle simple and rustic as the gap in a rail fence and while he sat on one of the steps making himself pleasantly sensible of his whereabout like one who should handle a dream and find it tangible and real he heard a sound that bewitched him with still another dreamy delight a bird rose out of the grassy field and still soaring aloft made a cheery melody that was like a spire of audible flamerapturous music as if the whole soul and substance of the winged creature had been distilled into this melody as it vanished skyward  the lark the lark exclaimed the traveller recognizing the note though never heard before as if his childhood had known it  a moment afterwards another bird was heard in the shadow of a neighboring wood or some other inscrutable hidingplace singing softly in a flutelike note as if blown through an instrument of woodcuckoo cuckooonly twice and then a stillness  how familiar these rustic sounds he exclaimed surely i was born here  the person who thus enjoyed these sounds as if they were at once familiar and strange was a young man tall and rather slenderly built and though we have called him young there were the traces of thought struggle and even of experience in his marked brow and somewhat pale face but the spirit within him was evidently still that of a youth lithe and active gazing out of his dark eyes and taking note of things about him with an eager centring interest that seemed to be unusually awake at the present moment  it could be but a few years since he first called himself a man but they must have been thickly studded with events turbulent with action spent amidst circumstances that called for resources of energy not often so early developed and thus his youth might have been kept in abeyance until now when in this simple rural scene he grew almost a boy again as for his station in life his coarse gray suit and the knapsack on his shoulders did not indicate a very high one yet it was such as a gentleman might wear of a morning or on a pedestrian ramble and was worn in a way that made it seem of a better fashion than it really was as it enabled him to find a rare enjoyment as we have seen in bypath hedgerow rustic stile lark and cuckoo and even the familiar grass and clover blossom it was as if he had long been shut in a sickchamber or a prison or at least within the iron cage of busy life that had given him but few glimpses of natural things through its bars or else this was another kind of nature than he had heretofore known  as he walked along through a kind of dream though he seemed so sensibly observant of trifling things around him he failed to notice that the path grew somewhat less distinctly marked more infringed upon by grass more shut in by shrubbery he had deviated into a side track and in fact a certain printed board nailed against a tree had escaped his notice warning off intruders with inhospitable threats of prosecution he began to suspect that he must have gone astray when the path led over plashy ground with a still fainter trail of preceding footsteps and plunged into shrubbery and seemed on the point of deserting him altogether after having beguiled him thus far the spot was an entanglement of boughs and yet did not give one the impression of wildness for it was the strangers idea that everything in this long cultivated region had been touched and influenced by mans care every oak every bush every sodthat man knew them all and that they knew him and by that mutual knowledge had become far other than they were in the first freedom of growth such as may be found in an american forest nay the wildest denizens of this sylvan neighborhood were removed in the same degree from their primeval character for hares sat on their hind legs to gaze at the approaching traveller and hardly thought it worth their while to leap away among some ferns as he drew near two pheasants looked at him from a bough a little inward among the shrubbery and to complete the wonder he became aware of the antlers and brown muzzle of a deer protruding among the boughs and though immediately there ensued a great rush and rustling of the herd it seemed evidently to come from a certain lingering shyness an instinct that had lost its purpose and object and only mimicked a dread of man whose neighborhood and familiarity had tamed the wild deer almost into a domestic creature remembering his experience of true woodland life the traveller fancied that it might be possible to want freer air less often used for human breath than was to be found anywhere among these woods  but then the sweet calm sense of safety that was here the certainty that with the wild element that centuries ago had passed out of this scene had gone all the perils of wild men and savage beasts dwarfs witches leaving nature not effete but only disarmed of those rougher deadlier characteristics that cruel rawness which make primeval nature the deadly enemy even of her own children here was consolation doubtless so we sit down on the stone step of the last stile that he had crossed and listen to the footsteps of the traveller and the distant rustle among the shrubbery as he goes deeper and deeper into the seclusion having by this time lost the deceitful track no matter if he go astray even were it after nightfall instead of noontime a willothewisp or puck himself would not lead him into worse harm than to delude him into some mossy pool the depths of which the truant schoolboys had known for ages nevertheless some little time after his disappearance there was the report of a shot that echoed sharp and loud startling the pheasants from their boughs and sending the hares and deer ascampering in good earnest  we next find our friend from whom we parted on the footpath in a situation of which he then was but very imperfectly aware for indeed he had been in a state of unconsciousness lasting until it was now late towards the sunset of that same day he was endeavoring to make out where he was and how he came thither or what had happened or whether indeed anything had happened unless to have fallen asleep and to be still enveloped in the fragments of some vivid and almost tangible dream the more confused because so vivid his wits did not come so readily about him as usual there may have been a slight delusion which mingled itself with his sober perceptions and by its leaven of extravagance made the whole substance of the scene untrue thus it happened that as it were at the same instant he fancied himself years back in life thousands of miles away in a gloomy cobwebbed room looking out upon a graveyard while yet neither more nor less distinctly he was conscious of being in a small chamber panelled with oak and furnished in an antique style he was doubtful too whether or no there was a grim feudal figure in a shabby dressinggown and an old velvet cap sitting in the dusk of the room smoking a pipe that diffused a scent of tobaccoquaffing a deephued liquor out of a tumblerlooking upwards at a spider that hung above was there too a child sitting in a little chair at his footstool in his earnestness to see this apparition more distinctly he opened his eyes wider and stirred and ceased to see it at all  but though that other dusty squalid cobwebbed scene quite vanished and along with it the two figures old and young grim and childish of whose portraits it had been the framework still there were features in the old oakenpanelled chamber that seemed to belong rather to his dream the panels were ornamented here and there with antique carving representing over and over again an identical device being a bare arm holding the tornoff head of some savage beast which the stranger could not know by species any more than agassiz himself could have assigned its type or kindred because it was that kind of natural history of which heraldry alone keeps the menagerie but it was just as familiar to his recollection as that of the cat which he had fondled in his childhood  there was likewise a mantelpiece heavily wrought of oak quite black with smoke and age in the centre of which more prominent than elsewhere was that same leopards head that seemed to thrust itself everywhere into sight as if typifying some great mystery which human nature would never be at rest till it had solved and below in a cavernous hollow there was a smouldering fire of coals for the genial day had suddenly grown chill and a shower of rain spattered against the small windowpanes almost at the same time with the struggling sunshine and over the mantelpiece where the light of the declining day came strongest from the window there was a larger and more highly relieved carving of this same device and underneath it a legend in old english letters which though his eyes could not precisely trace it at that distance he knew to be this                        hold hard the head  otherwise the aspect of the room bewildered him by not being known since these details were so familiar a narrow precinct it was with one window full of oldfashioned diamondshaped panes of glass a small desk table standing on clawed feet two or three highbacked chairs on the top of each of which was carved that same crest of the fabulous brutes head which the carvers fancy seemed to have clutched so strongly that he could not let it go in another part of the room a very old engraving rude and strong representing some ruffled personage which the stranger only tried to make out with a sort of idle curiosity because it was strange he should dream so distinctly  very soon it became intolerably irritating that these two dreams both purposeless should have mingled and entangled themselves in his mind he made a nervous and petulant motion intending to rouse himself fully and immediately a sharp pang of physical pain took him by surprise and made him groan aloud  immediately there was an almost noiseless step on the floor and a figure emerged from a deep niche that looked as if it might once have been an oratory in ancient times and the figure too might have been supposed to possess the devout and sanctified character of such as knelt in the oratories of ancient times it was an elderly man tall thin and pale and wearing a long dark tunic and in a peculiar fashion whichlike almost everything else about himthe stranger seemed to have a confused remembrance of this venerable person had a benign and pitiful aspect and approached the bedside with such good will and evident desire to do the sufferer good that the latter felt soothed at least by his very presence he lay a moment gazing up at the old mans face without being able to exert himself to say a word but sensible as it were of a mild soft influence from him cooling the fever which seemed to burn in his veins  do you suffer much pain asked the old man gently  none at all said the stranger but again a slight motion caused him to feel a burning twinge in his shoulder yes there was a throb of strange anguish why should i feel pain where am i  in safety and with those who desire to be your friends said the old man you have met with an accident but do not inquire about it now quiet is what you need  still the traveller gazed at him and the old mans figure seemed to enter into his dream or delirium whichever it might be as if his peaceful presence were but a shadow so quaint was his address so unlike real life in that dark robe with a velvet skullcap on his head beneath which his hair made a silvery border and looking more closely the stranger saw embroidered on the breast of the tunic that same device the arm and the leopards head which was visible in the carving of the room yes this must still be a dream which under the unknown laws which govern such psychical states had brought out thus vividly figures devices words forgotten since his boyish days though of an imaginative tendency the stranger was nevertheless strongly tenacious of the actual and had a natural horror at the idea of being seriously at odds in beliefs perceptions conclusions with the real world about him so that a tremor ran through him as if he felt the substance of the world shimmering before his eyes like a mere vaporous consistency  are you real said he to the antique presence or a spirit or a fantasy  the old man laid his thin cool palm on the strangers burning forehead and smiled benignantly keeping it there an instant  if flesh and blood are real i am so said he a spirit too i may claim to be made thin by fantasy again do not perplex yourself with such things tomorrow you may find denser substance in me drink this composing draught and close your eyes to those things that disturb you  your features too and your voice said the stranger in a resigned tone as if he were giving up a riddle the solution of which he could not find have an image and echo somewhere in my memory it is all an entanglement i will drink and shut my eyes  he drank from a little oldfashioned silver cup which his venerable guardian presented to his lips but in so doing he was still perplexed and tremulously disturbed with seeing that same weary old device the leopards head engraved on the side and shut his eyes to escape it for it irritated a certain portion of his brain with vague fanciful elusive ideas so he sighed and spoke no more the medicine whatever it might be had the merit rare in doctors stuff of being pleasant to take assuasive of thirst and imbued with a hardly perceptible fragrance that was so ethereal that it also seemed to enter into his dream and modify it he kept his eyes closed and fell into a misty state in which he wondered whether this could be the panacea or medicament which old doctor grimshawe used to distil from cobwebs and of which the fragrance seemed to breathe through all the waste of years since then he wondered too who was this benign saintlike old man and where in what former state of being he could have known him to have him thus as no strange thing and yet so strange be attending at his bedside with all this ancient garniture but it was best to dismiss all things he being so weak to resign himself all this had happened before and had passed away prosperously or unprosperously it would pass away in this case likewise and in the morning whatever might be delusive would have disappeared     chapter xiii   the patient endnote 1 had a favorable night and awoke with a much clearer head though still considerably feverish and in a state of great exhaustion from loss of blood which kept down the fever the events of the preceding day shimmered as it were and shifted illusively in his recollection nor could he yet account for the situation in which he found himself the antique chamber the old man of medi√¶val garb nor even for the wound which seemed to have been the occasion of bringing him thither one moment so far as he remembered he had been straying along a solitary footpath through rich shrubbery with the antlered deer peeping at him listening to the lark and the cuckoo the next he lay helpless in this oakpanelled chamber surrounded with objects that appealed to some fantastic shadow of recollection which could have had no reality endnote 2  to say the truth the traveller perhaps wilfully kept hold of this strange illusiveness and kept his thoughts from too harshly analyzing his situation and solving the riddle in which he found himself involved in his present weakness his mind sympathizing with the sinking down of his physical powers it was delightful to let all go to relinquish all control and let himself drift vaguely into whatever region of improbabilities there exists apart from the dull common plane of life weak stricken down given over to influences which had taken possession of him during an interval of insensibility he was no longer responsible let these delusions if they were such linger as long as they would and depart of their own accord at last he meanwhile would willingly accept the idea that some spell had transported him out of an epoch in which he had led a brief troubled existence of battle mental strife success failure all equally feverish and unsatisfactory into some past century where the business was to restto drag on dreamy days looking at things through half shut eyes into a limbo where things were put away shows of what had once been now somehow fainted and still maintaining a sort of half existence a serious mockery a state likely enough to exist just a little apart from the actual world if we only know how to find our way into it scenes and events that had once stained themselves in deep colors on the curtain that time hangs around us to shut us in from eternity cannot be quite effaced by the succeeding phantasmagoria and sometimes by a palimpsest show more strongly than they endnote 3  in the course of the morning however he was a little too feelingly made sensible of realities by the visit of a surgeon who proceeded to examine the wound in his shoulder removing the bandages which he himself seemed to have put upon this mysterious hurt the traveller closed his eyes and submitted to the manipulations of the professional person painful as they were assisted by the gentle touch of the old palmer and there was something in the way in which he resigned himself that met the approbation of the surgeon in spite of a little fever and slight delirium too to judge by his eye  a very quiet and wellbehaved patient said he to the palmer unless i greatly mistake he has been under the surgeons hand for a similar hurt ere now he has learned under good discipline how to take such a thing easily yes yes just here is a mark where a bullet went in some time agothree or four years since when he could have been little more than a boy a wild fellow this i doubt  it was an indian bullet said the patient still fancying himself gone astray into the past shot at me in battle twas three hundred years hereafter  ah he has served in the east indies said the surgeon i thought this sunburned cheek had taken its hue elsewhere than in england  the patient did not care to take the trouble which would have been involved in correcting the surgeons surmise so he let it pass and patiently awaited the end of the examination with only a moan or two which seemed rather pleasing and desirable than otherwise to the surgeons ear  he has vitality enough for his needs said he nodding to the palmer these groans betoken a good degree of pain though the young fellow is evidently a selfcontained sort of nature and does not let us know all he feels it promises well however keep him in bed and quiet and within a day or two we shall see  he wrote a recipe or two or three perhaps for in those days the medical fraternity had faith in their own art and took his leave  the whitebearded palmer withdrew into the half concealment of the oratory which we have already mentioned and then putting on a pair of spectacles betook himself to the perusal of an old folio volume the leaves of which he turned over so gently that not the slightest sound could possibly disturb the patient all his manifestations were gentle and soft but of a simplicity most unlike the feline softness which we are apt to associate with a noiseless tread and movement in the male sex the sunshine came through the ivy and glimmered upon his great book however with an effect which a little disturbed the patients nerves besides he desired to have a fuller view of his benign guardian  will you sit nearer the bedside said he i wish to look at you  weakness the relaxation of nerves and the state of dependence on anothers carevery long unfelthad made him betray what we must call childishness and it was perceptible in the low halfcomplaining tone in which he spoke indicating a consciousness of kindness in the other a little plaintiveness in himself of which the next instant weak and wandering as he was he was ashamed and essayed to express it endnote 4  you must deem me very poorspirited said he not to bear this trifling hurt with a firmer mind but perhaps it is not entirely that i am so weak but i feel you to be so benign  be weak and be the stronger for it said the old man with a grave smile it is not in the pride of our strength that we are best or wisest to be made anew we even must be again a little child and consent to be enwrapt quietly in the arms of providence as a child in its mothers arms  i never knew a mothers care replied the traveller in a low regretful tone being weak to the incoming of all soft feelings in his present state since my boyhood i have lived among mena life of struggle and hard rivalry it is good to find myself here in the long past and in a sheltered harbor  and here he smiled by way of showing to this old palmer that he saw through the slight infirmity of mind that impelled him to say such things as the above that he was not its dupe though he had not strength just now to resist its impulse after this he dozed off softly and felt through all his sleep some twinges of his wound bringing him back as it were to the conscious surface of the great deep of slumber into which he might otherwise have sunk at all such brief intervals half unclosing his eyes like a child when the mother sits by its bed and he fears that she will steal away if he falls quite asleep and leave him in the dark solitude he still beheld the whitebearded kindly old man of saintly aspect sitting near him and turning over the pages of his folio volume so softly that not the faintest rustle did it make the picture at length got so fully into his idea that he seemed to see it even through his closed eyelids after a while however the slumberous tendency left him more entirely and without having been consciously awake he found himself contemplating the old man with wideopen eyes the venerable personage seemed soon to feel his gaze and ceasing to look at the folio he turned his eyes with quiet inquiry to meet those of the stranger endnote 5  what great volume is that asked the latter endnote 6  it is a book of english chronicles said the old man mostly relating to the part of the island where you now are and to times previous to the stuarts  ah it is to you a contemporary what reading the newspaper is to other men said the stranger then with a smile of selfreproach i shall conquer this idle mood im not so imbecile as you must think me but there is something that strangely haunts mewhere in what state of being can i have seen your face before there is nothing in it i distinctly remember but some impression some characteristic some look with which i have been long ago familiar haunts me and brings back all old scenes do you know me  the old man smiled i knew long ago a bright and impressible boy said he  and his name said the stranger  it was edward redclyffe said the old man  ah i see who you are said the traveller not too earnestly but with a soft gratified feeling as the riddle thus far solved itself you are my old kindly instructor you are colcord that is it i remember you disappeared you shall tell me when i am quite myself what was that mysteryand whether it is your real self or only a part of my dream and going to vanish when i quite awake now i shall sleep and dream more of it  one more waking interval he had that day and again essayed to enter into conversation with the old man who had thus strangely again become connected with his life after having so long vanished from his path  where am i asked edward redclyffe  in the home of misfortune said colcord  ah then i have a right to be here said he i was born in such a home do you remember it  i know your story said colcord  yes from doctor grim said edward people whispered he had made away with you i never believed it but finding you here in this strange way and myself having been shot perhaps to death it seems not so strange pooh i wander again and ought to sleep a little more and this is the home of misfortune but not like the squalid place of rage idiocy imbecility drunkenness where i was born how many times i have blushed to remember that native home but not of late i have struggled i have fought i have triumphed the unknown boy has come to be no undistinguished man his ancestry should he ever reveal himself to them need not blush for the poor foundling  hush said the quiet watcher your fever burns you take this draught and sleep a little longer endnote 7  another day or two found edward redclyffe almost a convalescent the singular lack of impatience that characterized his present moodthe repose of spirit into which he had lapsedhad much to do with the favorable progress of his cure after strife anxiety great mental exertion and excitement of various kinds which had harassed him ever since he grew to be a man had come this opportunity of perfect rest this dream in the midst of which he lay while its magic boundaries involved him and kept far off the contact of actual life so that its sounds and tumults seemed remote its cares could not fret him its ambitions objects good or evil were shut out from him the electric wires that had connected him with the battery of life were broken for the time and he did not feel the unquiet influence that kept everybody else in galvanic motion so under the benign influence of the old palmer he lay in slumberous luxury undisturbed save by some twinges of no intolerable pain which however he almost was glad of because it made him sensible that this deep luxury of quiet was essential to his cure however idle it might seem for the first time since he was a child he resigned himself not to put a finger to the evolution of his fortune he determined to accept all things that might happen good or evil he would not imagine an event beyond today but would let one spontaneous and halfdefined thought loiter after another through his mind listen to the spattering showerthe puffs of shutout wind and look with halfshut eyes at the sunshine glimmering through the ivy twigs and illuminating those old devices on the wall at the gathering twilight at the dim lamp at the creeping upward of another day and with it the lark singing so far away that the thrill of its delicious song could not disturb him with an impulse to awake sweet as its carol was he could almost have been content to miss the lark sweet and clear it was too like a fairy trumpetcall summoning him to awake and struggle again with eager combatants for new victories the best of which were not worth this deep repose  the old palmer did his best to prolong a mood so beneficial to the wounded young man the surgeon also nodded approval and attributed this happy state of the patients mind and all the physical advantages growing out of it to his own consummate skill nor indeed was he undeserving of credit not often to be awarded to medical men for having done nothing to impede the good which kind nature was willing to bring about she was doing the patient more good indeed than either the surgeon or the palmer could fully estimate in taking this opportunity to recreate a mind that had too early known stirring impulse and that had been worked to a degree beyond what its organization in some respects singularly delicate ought to have borne once in a long while the weary actors in the headlong drama of life must have such repose or else go mad or die when the machinery of human life has once been stopped by sickness or other impediment it often needs an impulse to set it going again even after it is nearly wound up  but it could not last forever the influx of new life into his being began to have a poignancy that would not let him lie so quietly lapped in the past in gone by centuries and waited on by quiet age in the person of the old palmer he began to feel again that he was young and must live in the time when his lot was cast he began to say to himself that it was not well to be any longer passive but that he must again take the troublesome burden of his own life on his own shoulders he thought of this necessity this duty throughout one whole day and determined that on the morrow he would make the first step towards terminating his inaction which he now began to be half impatient of at the same time that he clutched it still for the sake of the deliciousness that it had had  tomorrow i hope to be clothed and in my right mind said he to the old palmer and very soon i must thank you with my whole heart for your kind care and go it is a shame that i burden the hospitality of this house so long  no shame whatever replied the old man but on the contrary the fittest thing that could have chanced you are dependent on no private benevolence nor on the good offices of any man now living or who has lived these last three hundred years this ancient establishment is for the support of poverty misfortune and age and according to the word of the founder it serves himhe was indebted to the beneficiaries not they to him for in return for his temporal bequests he asked their prayers for his souls welfare he needed them could they avail him for this ponderous structure was built upon the founders mortal transgressions and even i may say out of the actual substance of them sir edward redclyffe was a fierce fighter in the wars of the roses and amassed much wealth by spoil rapine confiscation and all violent and evil ways that those disturbed times opened to him and on his deathbed he founded this hospital for twelve men who should be able to prove kindred with his race to dwell here with a stipend and pray for him and likewise provision for a sick stranger until he should be able to go on his way again  i shall pray for him willingly said edward moved by the pity which awaits any softened state of our natures to steal into our hearts though no catholic i will pray for his soul and that is his crest which you wear embroidered on his garment  it is said the old man you will see it carved painted embroidered everywhere about the establishment but let us give it the better and more reasonable interpretationnot that he sought to proclaim his own pride of ancestry and race but to acknowledge his sins the more manifestly by stamping the emblem of his race on this structure of his penitence  and are you said redclyffe impressed anew by the quiet dignity of the venerable speaker in authority in the establishment  a simple beneficiary of the charity said the palmer one of the twelve poor brethren and kinsmen of the founder slighter proofs of kindred are now of necessity received since in the natural course of things the race has long been growing scarce but i had it in my power to make out a sufficient claim  singular exclaimed redclyffe you being an american endnote 8  you remember me then said the old man quietly  from the first said edward although your image took the fantastic aspect of the bewilderment in which i then was and now that i am in clearer state of mind it seems yet stranger that you should be here we two children thought you translated and people i remember whispered dark hints about your fate  there was nothing wonderful in my disappearance said the old man there were causes an impulse an intuition that made me feel one particular night that i might meet harm whether from myself or others by remaining in a place with which i had the most casual connection but i never so long as i remained in america quite lost sight of you and doctor grimshawe before his death had knowledge of where i was and gave me in charge a duty which i faithfully endeavored to perform singular man that he was much evil much good in him both it may be will live after him  redclyffe when the conversation had reached this point felt a vast desire to reveal to the old man all that the grim doctor had instilled into his childish mind all that he himself in subsequent years had wrought more definitely out of it all his accompanying doubts respecting the secret of his birth and some supposed claims which he might assert and which only half acknowledging the purpose had availed to bring him a republican hither as to an ancestral centre he even fancied that the benign old man seemed to expect and await such a confidence but that very idea contributed to make it impossible for him to speak  another time he said to himself perhaps never it is a fantastic folly and with what the workhouse foundling has since achieved he would give up too many hopes to take the representation of a mouldy old english family  i find my head still very weak said he by way of cutting short the conversation i must try to sleep again     chapter xiv   the next day he called for his clothes and with the assistance of the pensioner managed to be dressed and awaited the arrival of the surgeon sitting in a great easychair with not much except his pale thin cheeks dark thoughtful eyes and his arm in a sling to show the pain and danger through which he had passed soon after the departure of the professional gentleman a step somewhat louder than ordinary was heard on the staircase and in the corridor leading to the sick chamber the step as redclyffes perceptions nicely attempered by his weakness assured him of a man in perfect and robust health and of station and authority a moment afterwards a gentleman of middle age or a little beyond appeared in the doorway in a dress that seemed clerical yet not very decidedly so he had a frank kindly yet authoritative bearing and a face that might almost be said to beam with geniality when as now the benevolence of his nature was aroused and ready to express itself  my friend said he doctor portingale tells me you are much better and i am most happy to hear it  there was something brusque and unceremonious in his manner that a little jarred against redclyffes sensitiveness which had become morbid in sympathy with his weakness he felt that the newcomer had not probably the right idea as to his own position in life he was addressing him most kindly indeed but as an inferior  i am much better sir he replied gravely and with reserve so nearly well that i shall very soon be able to bid farewell to my kind nurse here and to this ancient establishment to which i owe so much  the visitor seemed struck by mr redclyffes tone and finely modulated voice and glanced at his face and then over his dress and figure as if to gather from them some reliable data as to his station  i am the warden of this hospital said he with not less benignity than heretofore and greater courtesy and in that capacity must consider you under my careas my guest in factalthough owing to my casual absence one of the brethren of the house has been the active instrument in attending you i am most happy to find you so far recovered do you feel yourself in a condition to give any account of the accident which has befallen you  it will be a very unsatisfactory one at best said redclyffe trying to discover some definite point in his misty reminiscences i am a stranger to this country and was on a pedestrian tour with the purpose of making myself acquainted with the aspects of english scenery and life i had turned into a footpath being told that it would lead me within view of an old hall which from certain early associations i was very desirous of seeing i think i went astray at all events the path became indistinct and so far as i can recollect i had just turned to retrace my stepsin fact that is the last thing in my memory  you had almost fallen a sacrifice said the warden to the old preference which our english gentry have inherited from their norman ancestry of game to man you had come unintentionally as an intruder into a rich preserve much haunted by poachers and exposed yourself to the deadly mark of a springgun which had not the wit to distinguish between a harmless traveller and a poacher at least such is our conclusion for our old friend here who luckily for you is a great rambler in the woods when the report drew him to the spot found you insensible and the gun discharged  a gun has so little discretion said redclyffe smiling that it seems a pity to trust entirely to its judgment in a matter of life and death but to confess the truth i had come this morning to the suspicion that there was a direct human agency in the matter for i find missing a little pocketbook which i carried  then said the warden that certainly gives a new aspect to the affair was it of value  of none whatever said redclyffe merely containing pencil memoranda and notes of a travellers little expenses i had papers about me of far more value and a moderate sum of money a letter of credit which have escaped i do not however feel inclined on such grounds to transfer the guilt decidedly from the springgun to any more responsible criminal for it is very possible that the pocket book being carelessly carried might have been lost on the way i had not used it since the preceding day  much more probable indeed said the warden the discharged gun is strong evidence against itself mr colcord continued he raising his voice how long was the interval between the discharge of the gun and your arrival on the spot  five minutes or less said the old man for i was not far off and made what haste i could it being borne in on my spirit that mischief was abroad  did you hear two reports asked the warden  only one replied colcord  it is a plain case against the springgun said the warden and as you tell me you are a stranger i trust you will not suppose that our peaceful english woods and parks are the haunt of banditti we must try to give you a better idea of us may i ask are you an american and recently come among us  i believe a letter of credit is considered as decisive as most modes of introduction said redclyffe feeling that the good warden was desirous of knowing with some precision who and what he was and that in the circumstances he had a right to such knowledge here is mine on a respectable house in london  the warden took it and glanced it over with a slight apologetic bow it was a credit for a handsome amount in favor of the honorable edward redclyffe a title that did not fail to impress the englishman rather favorably towards his new acquaintance although he happened to know something of their abundance even so early in the republic among the men branded sons of equality but at all events it showed no ordinary ability and energy for so young a man to have held such position as this title denoted in the fiercely contested political struggles of the new democracy  do you know mr redclyffe that this name is familiar to us hereabouts asked he with a kindly bow and recognitionthat it is in fact the principal name in this neighborhoodthat a family of your name still possesses braithwaite hall and that this very hospital where you have happily found shelter was founded by former representatives of your name perhaps you count yourself among their kindred  my countrymen are apt to advance claims to kinship with distinguished english families on such slight grounds as to make it ridiculous said redclyffe coloring i should not choose to follow so absurd an example  well well perhaps not said the warden laughing frankly i have been amongst your republicans myself a long while ago and saw that your countrymen have no adequate idea of the sacredness of pedigrees and heraldic distinctions and would change their own names at pleasure and vaunt kindred with an english duke on the strength of the assumed one but i am happy to meet an american gentleman who looks upon this matter as englishmen necessarily must i met with great kindness in your country mr redclyffe and shall be truly happy if you will allow me an opportunity of returning some small part of the obligation you are now in a condition for removal to my own quarters across the quadrangle i will give orders to prepare an apartment and you must transfer yourself there by dinnertime  with this hospitable proposal so decisively expressed the warden took his leave and edward redclyffe had hardly yet recovered sufficient independent force to reject an invitation so put even were he inclined but in truth the proposal suited well with his wishes such as they were and was moreover backed it is singular to say by another of those dreamlike recognitions which had so perplexed him ever since he found himself in the hospital in some previous state of being the warden and he had talked together before  what is the wardens name he inquired of the old pensioner  hammond said the old man he is a kinsman of the redclyffe family himself a man of fortune and spends more than the income of his wardenship in beautifying and keeping up the glory of the establishment he takes great pride in it  and he has been in america said redclyffe how strange i knew him there never was anything so singular as the discovery of old acquaintances where i had reason to suppose myself unknowing and unknown unless dear doctor grim or dear little elsie were to start up and greet me i know not what may chance next  redclyffe took up his quarters in the wardens house the next day and was installed in an apartment that made a picture such as he had not before seen of english household comfort he was thus established under the good wardens roof and being very attractive of most peoples sympathies soon began to grow greatly in favor with that kindly personage  when edward redclyffe removed from the old pensioners narrow quarters to the far ampler accommodations of the wardens house the latter gentleman was taking his morning exercise on horseback a servant however in a grave livery ushered him to an apartment where the new guest was surprised to see some luggage which two or three days before edward had ordered from london on finding that his stay in this part of the country was likely to be much longer than he had originally contemplated the sight of these thingsthe sense which they conveyed that he was an expected and welcome guesttended to raise the spirits of the solitary wanderer and made him endnote 1  the wardens abode was an original part of the ancient establishment being an entire side of the quadrangle which the whole edifice surrounded and for the establishment of a bachelor which was his new friends condition it seemed to edward redclyffe abundantly spacious and enviably comfortable his own chamber had a grave rich depth as it were of serene and timelong garniture for purposes of repose convenience daily and nightly comfort that it was soothing even to look at long accustomed as redclyffe had been to the hardy and rude accommodations if so they were to be called of log huts and hasty mudbuilt houses in the western states of america life its daily habits its passing accommodations seemed to assume an importance under these aspects which it had not worn before those deep downy beds those antique chairs the heavy carpet the tester and curtains the stateliness of the old roomthey had a charm as compared with the thin preparation of a foresters bedchamber such as redclyffe had chiefly known them in the ruder parts of the country that really seemed to give a more substantial value to life so much pains had been taken with its modes and appliances that it looked more solid than before nevertheless there was something ghostly in that stately curtained bed with the deep gloom within its drapery so ancient as it was and suggestive of slumberers there who had long since slumbered elsewhere  the old servant whose grave circumspect courtesy was a matter quite beyond redclyffes experience soon knocked at the chamber door and suggested that the guest might desire to await the wardens arrival in the library which was the customary sittingroom redclyffe assenting he was ushered into a spacious apartment lighted by various gothic windows surrounded with old oaken cases in which were ranged volumes most or many of which seemed to be coeval with the foundation of the hospital and opening one of them redclyffe saw for the first time in his life endnote 2 a genuine bookworm that ancient form of creature living upon literature it had gnawed a circular hole penetrating through perhaps a score of pages of the seldom opened volume and was still at his musty feast there was a fragrance of old learning in this ancient library a soothing influence as the american felt of timehonored ideas where the strife novelties uneasy agitating conflict attrition of unsettled theories freshspringing thought did not attain a foothold a good place to spend a life which should not be agitated with the disturbing element so quiet so peaceful how slowly with how little wear would the years pass here how unlike what he had hitherto known and was destined to knowthe quick violent struggle of his mother country which had traced lines in his young brow already how much would be saved by taking his former existence not as dealing with things yet malleable but with fossils things that had had their life and now were unchangeable and revered here  at one end of this large room there was a bowed window the space near which was curtained off from the rest of the library and the window being filled with painted glass most of which seemed old though there were insertions evidently of modern and much inferior handiwork there was a rich gloom of light or you might call it a rich glow according to your mood of mind redclyffe soon perceived that this curtained recess was the especial study of his friend the warden and as such was provided with all that modern times had contrived for making an enjoyment out of the perusal of old books a study table with every convenience of multifarious devices a great inkstand pens a luxurious study chair where thought endnote 3 upon to say the truth there was not in this retired and thoughtful nook anything that indicated to redclyffe that the warden had been recently engaged in consultation of learned authoritiesor in abstract labor whether moral metaphysical or historic there was a volume of translations of mother gooses melodies into greek and latin printed for private circulation and with the wardens name on the titlepage a london newspaper of the preceding day lillebullero chevy chase and the old political ballads and what a little amused redclyffe the three volumes of a novel from a circulating library so that redclyffe came to the conclusion that the good warden like many educated men whose early scholastic propensities are backed up by the best of opportunities and all desirable facilities and surroundings still contented himself with gathering a flower or two instead of attempting the hard toil requisite to raise a crop  it must not be omitted that there was a fragrance in the room which unlike as the scene was brought back through so many years to redclyffes mind a most vivid remembrance of poor old doctor grims squalid chamber with his wild bearded presence in the midst of it puffing his everlasting cloud for here was the same smell of tobacco and on the mantelpiece of a chimney lay a german pipe and an old silver tobaccobox into which was wrought the leopards head and the inscription in black letter the warden had evidently availed himself of one of the chief bachelor sources of comfort redclyffe whose destiny had hitherto and up to a very recent period been to pass a feverishly active life was greatly impressed by all these tokens of learned easea degree of selfindulgence combined with duties enough to quiet an otherwise uneasy conscienceby the consideration that this pensioner acted a good part in a world where no one is entitled to be an unprofitable laborer he thought within himself that his prospects in his own galvanized country that seemed to him a few years since to offer such a career for an adventurous young man conscious of motive power had nothing so enticing as such a nook as thisa quiet recess of unchangeable old time around which the turbulent tide now eddied and rushed but could not disturb it here to be sure hope love ambition came not progress came not but here was what just now the early wearied american could appreciate better than aught elsehere was rest  the fantasy took edward to imitate the useful labors of the learned warden and to make trial whether his own classical conditionthe results of doctor grims tuition and subsequently that of an american collegehad utterly deserted him by attempting a translation of a few verses of yankee doodle and he was making hopeful progress when the warden came in fresh and rosy from a mornings ride in a keen east wind he shook hands heartily with his guest and though by no means frigid at their former interview seemed to have developed at once into a kindlier man now that he had suffered the stranger to cross his threshold and had thus made himself responsible for his comfort  i shall take it greatly amiss said he if you do not pick up fast under my roof and gather a little english ruddiness moreover in the walks and rides that i mean to take you your countrymen as i saw them are a sallow set but i think you must have english blood enough in your veins to eke out a ruddy tint with the help of good english beef and ale and daily draughts of wholesome light and air  my cheeks would not have been so very pale said edward laughing if an english shot had not deprived me of a good deal of my american blood  only follow my guidance said the warden and i assure you you shall have back whatever blood we have deprived you of together with an addition it is now luncheontime and we will begin the process of replenishing your veins  so they went into a refectory where were spread upon the board what might have seemed a goodly dinner to most americans though for this englishman it was but a byincident a slight refreshment to enable him to pass the midway stage of life it is an excellent thing to see the faith of a hearty englishman in his own stomach and how well that kindly organ repays his trust with what devout assimilation he takes to himself his kindred beef loving it believing in it making a good use of it and without any qualms of conscience or prescience as to the result they surely eat twice as much as we and probably because of their undoubted faith it never does them any harm dyspepsia is merely a superstition with us if we could cease to believe in its existence it would exist no more redclyffe eating little himself his wound compelling him to be cautious as to his diet was secretly delighted to see what sweets the warden found in a cold round of beef in a pigeon pie and a cut or two of yorkshire ham not that he was ravenous but that his stomach was so healthy  you eat little my friend said the warden pouring out a glass of sherry for redclyffe and another for himself but you are right in such a predicament as yours spare your stomach while you are weakly and it will help you when you are strong this now is the most enjoyable meal of the day with me you will not see me play such a knife and fork at dinner though there too especially if i have ridden out in the afternoon i do pretty well but come now if like most of your countrymen as i have heard you are a lover of the weed i can offer you some as delicate latakia as you are likely to find in england  i lack that claim upon your kindness i am sorry to say replied redclyffe i am not a good smoker though i have occasionally taken a cigar at need  well when you find yourself growing old and especially if you chance to be a bachelor i advise you to cultivate the habit said the warden a wife is the only real obstacle or objection to a pipe they can seldom be thoroughly reconciled and therefore it is well for a man to consider beforehand which of the two he can best dispense with i know not how it might have been once had the conflicting claim of these two rivals ever been fairly presented to me but i now should be at no loss to choose the pipe  they returned to the study and while the warden took his pipe redclyffe considering that as the guest of this hospitable englishman he had no right to continue a stranger thought it fit to make known to him who he was and his condition plans and purposes he represented himself as having been liberally educated bred to the law but to his misfortune having turned aside from that profession to engage in politics in this pursuit indeed his success wore a flattering outside for he had become distinguished and though so young a leader locally at least in the party which he had adopted he had been for a biennial term a member of congress after winning some distinction in the legislature of his native state but some one of those fitful changes to which american politics are peculiarly liable had thrown him out in his candidacy for his second term and the virulence of party animosity the abusiveness of the press had acted so much upon a disposition naturally somewhat too sensitive for the career which he had undertaken that he had resolved being now freed from legislative cares to seize the opportunity for a visit to england whither he was drawn by feelings which every educated and impressible american feels in a degree scarcely conceivable by the english themselves and being here but he had already too much experience of english selfsufficiency to confess so much he began to feel the deep yearning which a sensitive americanhis mind full of english thoughts his imagination of english poetry his heart of english character and sentimentcannot fail to be influenced bythe yearning of the blood within his veins for that from which it has been estranged the halffanciful regret that he should ever have been separated from these woods these fields these natural features of scenery to which his nature was moulded from the men who are still so like himself from these habits of life and thought which though he may not have known them for two centuries he still perceives to have remained in some mysterious way latent in the depths of his character and soon to be reassumed not as a foreigner would do it but like habits native to him and only suspended for a season  this had been redclyffes state of feeling ever since he landed in england and every day seemed to make him more at home so that it seemed as if he were gradually awakening to a former reality     chapter xv  after lunch the warden showed a good degree of kind anxiety about his guest and ensconced him in a most comfortable chair in his study where he gave him his choice of books old and new and was somewhat surprised as well as amused to see that redclyffe seemed most attracted towards a department of the library filled with books of english antiquities and genealogies and heraldry the two latter indeed having the preference over the others  this is very remarkable said he smiling by what right or reason by what logic of character can you a democrat renouncing all advantages of birthneither priding yourself on family nor seeking to found onehow therefore can you care for genealogies or for this fantastic science of heraldry having no antiquities being a people just made how can you care for them  my dear sir said redclyffe i doubt whether the most devoted antiquarian in england ever cares to search for an old thing merely because it is old as any american just landed on your shores would do age is our novelty therefore it attracts and absorbs us and as for genealogies i know not what necessary repulsion there may be between it and democracy a line of respectable connections being the harder to preserve where there is nothing in the laws to defend it is therefore the more precious when we have it really to boast of  true said the warden when a race keeps itself distinguished among the grimy order of your commonalty all with equal legal rights to place and eminence as itself it must needs be because there is a force and efficacy in the blood i doubt not he said looking with the free approval of an elder man at the young mans finely developed face and graceful formi doubt not that you can look back upon a line of ancestry always shining out from the surrounding obscurity of the mob  redclyffe though ashamed of himself could not but feel a paltry confusion and embarrassment as he thought of his unknown origin and his advent from the almshouse coming out of that squalid darkness as if he were a thing that had had a spontaneous birth out of poverty meanness petty crime and here in ancestral england he felt more keenly than ever before what was his misfortune  i must not let you lie under this impression said he manfully to the warden i have no ancestry at the very first step my origin is lost in impenetrable obscurity i only know that but for the aid of a kind friendon whose benevolence i seem to have had no claim whatevermy life would probably have been poor mean unenlightened  well well said the kind wardenhardly quite feeling however the noble sentiment which he expressedit is better to be the first noble illustrator of a name than even the worthy heir of a name that has been noble and famous for a thousand years the highest pride of some of our peers who have won their rank by their own force has been to point to the cottage whence they sprung your posterity at all events will have the advantage of youthey will know their ancestor  redclyffe sighed for there was truly a great deal of the foolish yearning for a connection with the past about him his imagination had taken this turn and the very circumstances of his obscure birth gave it a field to exercise itself  i advise you said the warden by way of changing the conversation to look over the excellent history of the county which you are now in there is no reading better to my mind than these country histories though doubtless a stranger would hardly feel so much interest in them as one whose progenitors male or female have strewn their dust over the whole field of which the history treats this history is a fine specimen of the kind  the work to which redclyffes attention was thus drawn was in two large folio volumes published about thirty years before bound in calf by some famous artist in that line illustrated with portraits and views of ruined castles churches cathedrals the seats of nobility and gentry roman british and saxon remains painted windows oak carvings and so forth  and as for its contents the author ascended for the history of the county as far as into the preroman ages before caesar had ever heard of britain and brought it down an ever swelling and increasing tale to his own days inclusive of the separate histories and pedigrees and hereditary legends and incidents of all the principal families in this latter branch of information indeed the work seemed particularly full and contained every incident that would have worked well into historical romance  aye aye said the warden laughing at some strange incident of this sort which redclyffe read out to him my old friend gibber the learned author of this work he has been dead this score of years so he will not mind my saying it had a little too much the habit of seeking his authorities in the cottage chimneycorners i mean that an old womans tale was just about as acceptable to him as a recorded fact and to say the truth they are really apt to have ten times the life in them  redclyffe saw in the volume a full account of the founding of the hospital its regulations and purposes its edifices all of which he reserved for future reading being for the present more attracted by the mouldy gossip of family anecdotes which we have alluded to some of these and not the least singular referred to the ancient family which had founded the hospital and he was attracted by seeing a mention of a bloody footstep which reminded him of the strange old story which good doctor grimshawe had related by his new england fireside in those childish days when edward dwelt with him by the graveyard on reading it however he found that the english legend if such it could be called was far less full and explicit than that of new england indeed it assigned various origins to the bloody footstepone being that it was the stamp of the foot of the saxon thane who fought at his own threshold against the assault of the norman baron who seized his mansion at the conquest another that it was the imprint of a fugitive who had sought shelter from the lady of the house during the wars of the roses and was dragged out by her husband and slain on the door step still another that it was the footstep of a protestant in bloody marys days who being sent to prison by the squire of that epoch had lifted his hands to heaven and stamped his foot in appeal as against the unjust violence with which he was treated and stamping his foot it had left the bloody mark it was hinted too however that another version which out of delicacy to the family the author was reluctant to state assigned the origin of the bloody footstep to so late a period as the wars of the parliament and finally there was an odious rumor that what was called the bloody footstep was nothing miraculous after all but most probably a natural reddish stain in the stone door step but against this heresy the excellent dr gibber set his face most sturdily  the original legend had made such an impression on redclyffes childish fancy that he became strangely interested in thus discovering it or something remotely like it in england and being brought by such unsought means to reside so near it curious about the family to which it had occurred he proceeded to examine its records as given in the county history the name was redclyffe like most english pedigrees there was an obscurity about a good many of the earlier links but the line was traced out with reasonable definiteness from the days of coeur de lion and there was said to be a crosslegged ancestor in the village church who but the inscription was obliterated was probably a redclyffe and had fought either under the lion heart or in the crusades it was in subsequent ages one of the most distinguished families though there had been turbulent men in all those turbulent times hard fighters in one age a barony of early creation seemed to have come into the family and had been as it were playing bopeep with the race for several centuries some of them had actually assumed the title others had given it up for lack of sufficient proof but still there was such a claim and up to the time at which this county history was written it had neither been made out nor had the hope of doing so been relinquished  have the family asked redclyffe of his host ever yet made out their claim to this title which has so long been playing the willof thewisp with them  no not yet said the warden puffing out a volume of smoke from his meerschaum and making it curl up to the ceiling their claim has as little substance in my belief as yonder vanishing vapor from my pipe but they still keep up their delusion i had supposed that the claim would perish with the last squire who was a childless manat least without legitimate heirs but this estate passed to one whom we can scarcely call an englishman he being a catholic the descendant of forefathers who have lived in italy since the time of george ii and who is moreover a catholic we english would not willingly see an ancestral honor in the possession of such a man  is there do you think a prospect of his success  i have heard so but hardly believe it replied the warden i remember some dozen or fifteen years ago it was given out that some clue had been found to the only piece of evidence that was wanting it had been said that there was an emigration to your own country above a hundred years ago and on account of some family feud the true heir had gone thither and never returned now the point was to prove the extinction of this branch of the family but excuse me i must pay an official visit to my charge here will you accompany me or continue to pore over the county history  redclyffe felt enough of the elasticity of convalescence to be desirous of accompanying the warden and they accordingly crossed the enclosed quadrangle to the entrance of the hospital portion of the large and intricate structure it was a building of the early elizabethan age a plaster and timber structure like many houses of that period and much earlier endnote 1 around this court stood the building with the date 1437 cut on the front on each side a row of gables looked upon the enclosed space most venerable old gables with heavy mullioned windows filled with little diamond panes of glass and opening on lattices on two sides there was a cloistered walk under echoing arches and in the midst a spacious lawn of the greenest and loveliest grass such as england only can show and which there is of perennial verdure and beauty in the midst stood a stone statue of a venerable man wrought in the best of medi√¶val sculpture with robe and ruff and tunic and venerable beard resting on a staff and holding what looked like a clasped book in his hand the english atmosphere together with the coal smoke settling down in the space of centuries from the chimneys of the hospital had roughened and blackened this venerable piece of sculpture enclosing it as it were in a superficies of decay but still and perhaps the more from these tokens of having stood so long among men the statue had an aspect of venerable life and of connection with human life that made it strongly impressive  this is the effigy of sir edward redclyffe the founder of the hospital said the warden he is a most peaceful and venerable old gentleman in his attire and aspect as you see but he was a fierce old fellow in his day and is said to have founded the hospital as a means of appeasing heaven for some particular deed of blood which he had imposed upon his conscience in the war of the roses  yes said redclyffe i have just read in the county history that the bloody footstep was said to have been imprinted in his time but what is that thing which he holds in his hand  it is a famous heirloom of the redclyffes said the warden on the possession of which as long as they did possess it they prided themselves it is said more than on their ancient manorhouse it was a saxon ornament which a certain ancestor was said to have had from harold the old saxon king but if there ever was any such article it has been missing from the family mansion for two or three hundred years there is not known to be an antique relic of that description now in existence  i remember having seen such an articleyes precisely of that shape observed redclyffe in the possession of a very dear old friend of mine when i was a boy  what in america exclaimed the warden that is very remarkable the time of its being missed coincides well enough with that of the early settlement of new england some puritan before his departure may have thought himself doing god service by filching the old golden gewgaw from the cavalier for it was said to be fine ductile gold  the circumstances struck redclyffe with a pleasant wonder for indeed the old statue held the closest possible imitation in marble of that strange old glitter of gold which he himself had so often played with in the doctors study endnote 2 so identical that he could have fancied that he saw the very thing changed from metal into stone even with its bruises and other casual marks in it as he looked at the old statue his imagination played with it and his naturally great impressibility half made him imagine that the old face looked at him with a keen subtile wary glance as if acknowledging that it held some secret but at the same time defying him to find it out and then again came that visionary feeling that had so often swept over him since he had been an inmate of the hospital  all over the interior part of the building was carved in stone the leopards head with wearisome iteration as if the founder were anxious to imprint his device so numerously lestwhen he produced this edifice as his remuneration to eternal justice for many sinsthe omniscient eye should fail to be reminded that sir edward redclyffe had done it but at all events it seemed to redclyffe that the ancient knight had purposed a good thing and in a measurable degree had effected it for here stood the venerable edifice securely founded bearing the moss of four hundred years upon it and though wars and change of dynasties and religious change had swept around it with seemingly destructive potency yet here had the lodging the food the monastic privileges of the brethren been held secure and were unchanged by all the altering mariners of the age the old fellow somehow or other seemed to have struck upon an everlasting rock and founded his pompous charity there  they entered an arched door on the left of the quadrangle and found themselves hi a dark old hall with oaken beams to say the truth it was a barnlike sort of enclosure and was now used as a sort of rubbishplace for the hospital where they stored away old furniture and where carpenters work might be done and yet as the warden assured redclyffe it was once a hall of state hung with tapestry carpeted for aught he knew with cloth of gold and set with rich furniture and a groaning board in the midst here the hereditary patron of the hospital had once entertained king james the first who made a latin speech on the occasion a copy of which was still preserved in the archives on the rafters of this old hall there were cobwebs in such abundance that redclyffe could not but reflect on the joy which old doctor grimshawe would have had in seeing them and the health to the human race which he would have hoped to collect and distil from them  from this great antique room they crossed the quadrangle and entered the kitchen of the establishment a hospitable fire was burning there and there seemed to be a great variety of messes cooking and the warden explained to redclyffe that there was no general table in the hospital but the brethren at their own will and pleasure either formed themselves into companies or messes of any convenient size or enjoyed a solitary meal by themselves each in their own apartments there was a goodly choice of simple but good and enjoyable food and a sufficient supply of potent ale brewed in the vats of the hospital which among its other praiseworthy characteristics was famous for this having at some epoch presumed to vie with the famous ale of trinity in cambridge and the archdeacon of oxfordthese having come down to the hospital from a private receipt of sir edwards butler which was now lost in the redclyffe family nor would the ungrateful hospital give up its secret even out of loyalty to its founder  i would use my influence with the brewer said the warden on communicating this little fact to redclyffe but the present mannow owner of the estateis not worthy to have good ale brewed in his house having himself no taste for anything but italian wines wretched fellow that he is he might make himself an englishman if he would take heartily to our ale and with that end in view i should be glad to give it him  the kitchen fire blazed warmly as we have said and roast and stewed and boiled were in process of cooking producing a pleasant fume while great heaps of wheaten loaves were smoking hot from the ovens and the master cook and his subordinates were in fume and hiss like beings that were of a fiery element and though irritable and scorching yet were happier here than they could have been in any other situation the warden seemed to have an especial interest and delight in this department of the hospital and spoke apart to the head cook on the subject as redclyffe surmised from what he overheard of some especial delicacy for his own table that day  this kitchen is a genial place said he to redclyffe as they retired in the evening after the cooks have done their work the brethren have liberty to use it as a sort of common room and to sit here over their ale till a reasonable bedtime it would interest you much to make one at such a party for they have had a varied experience in life each one for himself and it would be strange to hear the varied roads by which they have come hither  yes replied redclyffe and i presume not one of them ever dreamed of coming hither when he started in life the only one with whom i am acquainted could hardly have expected it at all events  he is a remarkable man more so than you may have had an opportunity of knowing said the warden i know not his history for he is not communicative on that subject and it was only necessary for him to make out his proofs of claim to the charity to the satisfaction of the curators but it has often struck me that there must have been strange and striking events in his lifethough how it could have been without his attracting attention and being known i cannot say i have myself often received good counsel from him in the conduct of the hospital and the present owner of the hall seems to have taken him for his counsellor and confidant being himself strange to english affairs and life  i should like to call on him as a matter of course rather than courtesy observed redclyffe and thank him for his great kindness  they accordingly ascended the dark oaken staircase with its black balustrade and approached the old mans chamber the door of which they found open and in the blurred lookingglass which hung deep within the room redclyffe was surprised to perceive the young face of a woman who seemed to be arranging her headgear as women are always doing it was but a moment and then it vanished like a vision  i was not aware he said turning to the warden that there was a feminine side to this establishment  nor is there said the old bachelor else it would not have held together so many ages as it has the establishment has its own wise monkish regulations but we cannot prevent the fact that some of the brethren may have had foolish relations with the other sex at some previous period of their lives this seems to be the case with our wise old friend of whom we have been speakingwhereby he doubtless became both wiser and sadder if you have seen a female face here it is that of a relative who resides out of the hospitalan excellent young lady i believe who has charge of a school  while he was speaking the young lady in question passed out greeting the warden in a cheerful respectful way in which deference to him was well combined with a sense of what was due to herself  that observed the warden who had returned her courtesy with a kindly air betwixt that of gentlemanly courtesy and a superiors acknowledgmentthat is the relative of our old friend a young persona gentlewoman i may almost call herwho teaches a little school in the village here and keeps her guardians heart warm no doubt with her presence an excellent young woman i do believe and very useful and faithful in her station     chapter xvi   on entering the old palmers apartment they found him looking over some ancient papers yellow and crabbedly written and on one of them a large old seal all of which he did up in a bundle and enclosed in a parchment cover so that before they were well in the room the documents were removed from view  those papers and parchments have a fine old yellow tint colcord said the warden very satisfactory to an antiquary  there is nothing in them said the old man of general interest some old papers they are which came into my possession by inheritance and some of them relating to the affairs of a friend of my youtha long past time and a long past friend added he sighing  here is a new friend at all events said the kindly warden wishing to cheer the old man who feels himself greatly indebted to you for your care endnote 1  there now ensued a conversation between the three in the course of which reference was made to america and the wardens visit there  you are so mobile he said you change so speedily that i suppose there are few external things now that i should recognize the face of your country changes like one of your own sheets of water under the influence of sun cloud and wind but i suppose there is a depth below that is seldom effectually stirred it is a great fault of the country that its sons find it impossible to feel any patriotism for it  i do not by any means acknowledge that impossibility responded redclyffe with a smile i certainly feel that sentiment very strongly in my own breast more especially since i have left america three thousand miles behind me  yes it is only the feeling of selfassertion that rises against the selfcomplacency of the english said the warden nothing else for what else have you become the subject of this noble weakness of patriotism you cannot love anything beyond the soil of your own estate or in your case if your heart is very large you may possibly take in in a quiet sort of way the whole of new england what more is possible how can you feel a hearts love for a mere political arrangement like your union how can you be loyal where personal attachmentthe lofty and noble and unselfish attachment of a subject to his princeis out of the question where your sovereign is felt to be a mere man like yourselves whose petty struggles whose ambition mean before it grew to be audaciousyou have watched and know him to be just the same now as yesterday and that tomorrow he will be walking unhonored amongst you again your system is too bare and meagre for human nature to love or to endure it long these stately degrees of society that have so strong a hold upon us in england are not to be done away with so lightly as you think your experiment is not yet a success by any means and you will live to see it result otherwise than you think  it is natural for you englishmen to feel thus said redclyffe although ever since i set my foot on your shoresforgive me but you set me the example of free speechi have had a feeling of coming change among all that you look upon as so permanent so everlasting and though your thoughts dwell fondly on things as they are and have been there is a deep destruction somewhere in this country that is inevitably impelling it in the path of my own but i care not for this i do aver that i love my country that i am proud of its institutions that i have a feeling unknown probably to any but a republican but which is the proudest thing in me that there is no man above mefor my ruler is only myself in the person of another whose office i impose upon himnor any below me if you would understand me i would tell you of the shame i felt when first on setting foot in this country i heard a man speaking of his birth as giving him privileges saw him looking down on laboring men as of an inferior race and what i can never understand is the pride which you positively seem to feel in having men and classes of men above you born to privileges which yon can never hope to share it may be a thing to be endured but surely not one to be absolutely proud of and yet an englishman is so  ah i see we lack a ground to meet upon said the warden we can never truly understand each other what you have last mentioned is one of our inner mysteries it is not a thing to be reasoned about but to be feltto be born within one and i uphold it to be a generous sentiment and good for the human heart  forgive me sir said redclyffe but i would rather be the poorest and lowest man in america than have that sentiment  but it might change your feeling perhaps suggested the warden if you were one of the privileged class  i dare not say that it would not said redclyffe for i know i have a thousand weaknesses and have doubtless as many more that i never suspected myself of but it seems to me at this moment impossible that i should ever have such an ambition because i have a sense of meanness in not starting fair in beginning the world with advantages that my fellows have not  really this is not wise said the warden bluntly how can the start in life be fair for all providence arranges it otherwise did you yourselfa gentleman evidently by birth and educationdid you start fair in the race of life  redclyffe remembered what his birth or rather what his first recollected place had been and reddened  in birth certainly i had no advantages said he and would have explained further but was kept back by invincible reluctance feeling that the bare fact of his origin in an almshouse would be accepted while all the inward assurances and imaginations that had reconciled himself to the ugly fact would go for nothing but there were advantages very early in life added he smiling which perhaps i ought to have been ashamed to avail myself of  an old cobwebby libraryan old dwelling by a graveyardan old doctor busied with his own fantasies and entangled in his own cobwebsand a little girl for a playmate these were things that you might lawfully avail yourself of said colcord unheard by the warden who thinking the conversation had lasted long enough had paid a slight passing courtesy to the old man and was now leaving the room do you remain here long he added  if the wardens hospitality holds out said the american i shall be glad for the place interests me greatly  no wonder replied colcord  and wherefore no wonder said redclyffe impressed with the idea that there was something peculiar in the tone of the old mans remark  because returned the other quietly it must be to you especially interesting to see an institution of this kind whereby one mans benevolence or penitence is made to take the substance and durability of stone and last for centuries whereas in america the solemn decrees and resolutions of millions melt away like vapor and everything shifts like the pomp of sunset clouds though it may be as pompous as they heaven intended the past as a foundation for the present to keep it from vibrating and being blown away with every breeze  but said redclyffe i would not see in my country what i see elsewherethe past hanging like a millstone round a countrys neck or encrusted in stony layers over the living form so that to all intents and purposes it is dead  well said colcord we are only talking of the hospital you will find no more interesting place anywhere stay amongst us this is the very heart of england and if you wish to know the fatherlandthe place whence you sprungthis is the very spot  again redclyffe was struck with the impression that there was something marked something individually addressed to himself in the old mans words at any rate it appealed to that primal imaginative vein in him which had so often in his own country allowed itself to dream over the possibilities of his birth he knew that the feeling was a vague and idle one but yet just at this time a convalescent with a little play moment in what had heretofore been a turbulent life he felt an inclination to follow out this dream and let it sport with him and by and by to awake to realities refreshed by a season of unreality at a firmer and stronger period of his life though redclyffe might have indulged his imagination with these dreams yet he would not have let them interfere with his course of action but having come hither in utter weariness of active life it seemed just the thing for him to dojust the fools paradise for him to be in  yes repeated the old man looking keenly in his face you will not leave us yet  redclyffe returned through the quadrangle to the wardens house and there were the brethren sitting on benches loitering in the sun which though warm for england seemed scarcely enough to keep these old people warm even with their cloth robes they did not seem unhappy nor yet happy if they were so it must be with the mere bliss of existence a sleepy sense of comfort and quiet dreaminess about things past leaving out the things to comeof which there was nothing indeed in their future save one day after another just like this with loaf and ale and such substantial comforts and prayers and idle days again gathering by the great kitchen fire and at last a day when they should not be there but some other old men in their stead and redclyffe wondered whether in the extremity of age he himself would like to be one of the brethren of the leopards head the old men he was sorry to see did not seem very genial towards one another in fact there appeared to be a secret enjoyment of one anothers infirmities wherefore it was hard to tell unless that each individual might fancy himself to possess an advantage over his fellow which he mistook for a positive strength and so there was sometimes a sardonic smile when on rising from his seat the rheumatism was a little evident in an old fellows joints or when the palsy shook anothers fingers so that he could barely fill his pipe or when a cough the gathered spasmodic trouble of thirty years fairly convulsed another then any two that happened to be sitting near one another looked into each others cold eyes and whispered or suggested merely by a look for they were bright to such perceptions the old fellow will not outlast another winter  methinks it is not good for old men to be much together an old man is a beautiful object in his own place in the midst of a circle of young people going down in various gradations to infancy and all looking up to the patriarch with filial reverence keeping him warm by their own burning youth giving him the freshness of their thought and feeling with such natural influx that it seems as if it grew within his heart while on them he reacts with an influence that sobers tempers keeps them down his wisdom very probably is of no great accounthe cannot fit to any new state of things but nevertheless it works its effect in such a situation the old man is kind and genial mellow more gentle and generous and widerminded than ever before but if left to himself or wholly to the society of his contemporaries the ice gathers about his heart his hope grows torpid his lovehaving nothing of his own blood to develop itgrows cold he becomes selfish when he has nothing in the present or the future worth caring about in himself so that instead of a beautiful object he is an ugly one little mean and torpid i suppose one chief reason to be that unless he has his own race about him he doubts of anybodys love he feels himself a stranger in the world and so becomes unamiable  a very few days in the wardens hospitable mansion produced an excellent effect on redclyffes frame his constitution being naturally excellent and a flow of cheerful spirits contributing much to restore him to health especially as the abode in this old place which would probably have been intolerably dull to most young englishmen had for this young american a charm like the freshness of paradise in truth it had that charm and besides it another intangible evanescent perplexing charm full of an airy enjoyment as if he had been here before what could it be it could be only the old very deepest inherent nature which the englishman his progenitor carried over the sea with him nearly two hundred years before and which had lain buried all that time under heaps of new things new customs new institutions new snows of winter new layers of forest leaves until it seemed dead and was altogether forgotten as if it had never been but now his return had seemed to dissolve or dig away all this incrustation and the old english nature awoke all fresh so that he saw the green grass the hedgerows the old structures and old manners the old clouds the old raindrops with a recognition and yet a newness redclyffe had never been so quietly happy as now he had as it were the quietude of the old man about him and the freshness of his own still youthful years  the warden was evidently very favorably impressed with his transatlantic guest and he seemed to be in a constant state of surprise to find an american so agreeable a kind of person  you are just like an englishman he sometimes said are you quite sure that you were not born on this side of the water  this is said to be the highest compliment that an englishman can pay to an american and doubtless he intends it as such all the praise and good will that an englishman ever awards to an american is so far gratifying to the recipient that it is meant for him individually and is not to be put down in the slightest degree to the score of any regard to his countrymen generally so far from this if an englishman were to meet the whole thirty millions of americans and find each individual of them a pleasant amiable wellmeaning and wellmannered sort of fellow he would acknowledge this honestly in each individual case but still would speak of the whole nation as a disagreeable people  as regards redclyffe being precisely like an englishman we cannot but think that the good warden was mistaken no doubt there was a common ground the old progenitor whose blood moreover was mixed with a hundred other streams equally english was still there under this young mans shape but with a vast difference climate sun cold heat soil institutions had made a change in him before he was born and all the life that he had lived since so unlike any that he could have lived in england had developed it more strikingly in manners i cannot but think that he was better than the generality of englishmen and different from the highestmannered men though most resembling them his natural sensitiveness a tincture of reserve had been counteracted by the frank mixture with men which his political course had made necessary he was quicker to feel what was right at the moment than the englishman more alive he had a finer grain his look was more aristocratic than that of a thousand englishmen of good birth and breeding he had a faculty of assimilating himself to new manners which being his most unenglish trait was what perhaps chiefly made the warden think him so like an englishman when an englishman is a gentleman to be sure it is as deep in him as the marrow of his bones and the deeper you know him the more you are aware of it and that generation after generation has contributed to develop and perfect these unpretending manners which at first may have failed to impress you under his plain almost homely exterior an american often gets as good a surface of manners in his own progress from youth through the wear and attrition of a successful life to some high station in middle age whereas a plebeian englishman who rises to eminent station never does credit to it by his manners often you would not know the american ambassador from a duke this is often merely external but in redclyffe having delicate original traits in his character it was something more and we are bold to say when our countrymen are developed or any one class of them as they ought to be they will show finer traits than have yet been seen we have more delicate and quicker sensibilities nerves more easily impressed and these are surely requisites for perfect manners and moreover the courtesy that proceeds on the ground of perfect equality is better than that which is a gracious and benignant condescensionas is the case with the manners of the aristocracy of england  an american be it said seldom turns his best side outermost abroad and an observer who has had much opportunity of seeing the figure which they make in a foreign country does not so much wonder that there should be severe criticism on their manners as a people i know not exactly why but all our imputed peculiaritiesour nasal pronunciation our ungraceful idioms our forthputtingness our uncouth lack of courtesydo really seem to exist on a foreign shore and even perhaps to be heightened of malice prepense the cold unbelieving eye of englishmen expectant of solecisms in manners contributes to produce the result which it looks for then the feeling of hostility and defiance in the american must be allowed for and partly too the real existence of a different code of manners founded on and arising from different institutions and also certain national peculiarities which may be intrinsically as good as english peculiarities but being different and yet the whole result being just too nearly alike and moreover the english manners having the prestige of long establishment and furthermore our own manners being in a transition state between those of old monarchies and what is proper to a new republicit necessarily followed that the american though really a man of refinement and delicacy is not just the kind of gentleman that the english can fully appreciate in cases where they do so their standard being different from ours they do not always select for their approbation the kind of man or manners whom we should judge the best we are perhaps apt to be a little too fine a little too sedulously polished and of course too conscious of ita deadly social crime certainly     chapter xvii   to return from this long discussion the warden took kindly as we have said to redclyffe and thought him a miraculously good fellow to have come from the rude american republic hitherto in the little time that he had been in england redclyffe had received civil and even kind treatment from the english with whom he had come casually in contact but stillperhaps partly from our yankee narrowness and reservehe had felt in the closest coming together as if there were a naked sword between the englishman and him as between the arabian prince in the tale and the princess whom he wedded he felt as if that would be the case even if he should love an englishwoman to such a distance into such an attitude of selfdefence does english selfcomplacency and belief in englands superiority throw the stranger in fact in a goodnatured way john bull is always doubling his fist in a strangers face and though it be goodnatured it does not always produce the most amiable feeling  the worthy warden being an englishman had doubtless the same kind of feeling doubtless too he thought ours a poor distracted country perhaps prosperous for the moment but as likely as not to be the scene of anarchy five minutes hence but being of so genial a nature when he came to see the amiableness of his young guest and how deeply he was impressed with england all prejudice died away and he loved him like a treasure that he had found for himself and valued him as if there were something of his own in him and so the old wardens residence had never before been so cheery as it was now his bachelor life passed the more pleasantly with this quiet vivacious yet not troublesomely restless spirit beside himthis eager almost childish interest in everything english and yet this capacity to take independent views of things and sometimes it might be to throw a gleam of light even on things appertaining to england and so the better they came to know one another the greater was their mutual liking  i fear i am getting too strong to burden you much longer said redclyffe this morning i have no pretence to be a patient now  pooh nonsense ejaculated the warden it will not be safe to leave you to yourself for at least a month to come and i have half a dozen excursions in a neighborhood of twenty miles in which i mean to show you what old england is in a way that you would never find out for yourself do not speak of going this day if you find yourself strong enough you shall go and look at an old village church  with all my heart said redclyffe  they went accordingly walking slowly in consequence of redclyffes yet imperfect strength along the highroad which was overshadowed with elms that grew in beautiful shape and luxuriance in that part of england not with the slender drooping picturesque grace of a new england elm but more luxuriant fuller of leaves sturdier in limb it was a day which the warden called fine and which redclyffe at home would have thought to bode rain though here he had learned that such weather might continue for weeks together with only a few raindrops all the time the road was in the finest condition hard and dry  they had not long emerged from the gateway of the hospitalat the venerable front and gables of which redclyffe turned to look with a feeling as if it were his homewhen they heard the clatter of hoofs behind them and a gentleman on horseback rode by paying a courteous salute to the warden as he passed a groom in livery followed at a little distance and both rode roundly towards the village whither the warden and his friend were going  did you observe that man asked the warden  yes said redclyffe is he an englishman  that is a pertinent question replied the warden but i scarcely know how to answer it  in truth redclyffes question had been suggested by the appearance of the mounted gentleman who was a dark thin man with black hair and a black moustache and pointed beard setting off his sallow face in which the eyes had a certain pointed steeliness which did not look english whose eyes methinks are usually not so hard as those of americans or foreigners redclyffe somehow or other had fancied that these not very pleasant eyes had been fixed in a marked way on himself a stranger while at the same time his salute was evidently directed towards the warden  an englishmanwhy no continued the latter if you observe he does not even sit his horse like an englishman but in that absurd stiff continental way as if a poker should get on horseback neither has he an english face english manners nor english religion nor an english heart nor to sum up the whole had he english birth nevertheless as fate would have it he is the inheritor of a good old english name a fine patrimonial estate and a very probable claim to an old english title this is lord braithwaite of braithwaite hall who if he can make his case good and they say there is good prospect of it will soon be lord hinchbrooke  i hardly know why but i should be sorry for it said redclyffe he certainly is not english and i have an odd sort of sympathy which makes me unwilling that english honors should be enjoyed by foreigners this then is the gentleman of italian birth whom you have mentioned to me and of whom there is a slight mention in the county history  yes said the warden there have been three descents of this mans branch in italy and only one english mother in all that time positively i do not see an english trait in his face and as little in his manner his civility is italian such as oftentimes among his countrymen has offered a cup of poison to a guest or insinuated the stab of a stiletto into his heart  you are particularly bitter against this poor man said redclyffe laughing at the wardens vehemence his appearanceand yet he is a handsome manis certainly not prepossessing but unless it be countersigned by something in his actual life i should hardly think it worth while to condemn him utterly  well well you can forgive a little english prejudice said the warden a little ashamed but in good earnest the man has few or no good traits takes no interest in the country dislikes our sky our earth our people is close and inhospitable a hard landlord and whatever may be his good qualities they are not such as flourish in this soil and climate or can be appreciated here endnote 1  has he children asked redclyffe  they say soa family by an italian wife whom some on the other hand pronounce to be no wife at all his son is at a catholic college in france his daughter in a convent there  in talk like this they were drawing near the little rustic village of braithwaite and saw above a cloud of foliage the small low battlemented tower the gray stones of which had probably been laid a little after the norman conquest approaching nearer they passed a thatched cottage or two very plain and simple edifices though interesting to redclyffe from their antique aspect which denoted that they were probably older than the settlement of his own country and might very likely have nursed children who had gone more than two centuries ago to found the commonwealth of which he was a citizen if you considered them in one way prosaically they were ugly enough but then there were the old latticed windows and there the thatch which was verdant with leek and strange weeds possessing a whole botanical growth and birds flew in and out as if they had their homes there then came a row of similar cottages all joined on together and each with a little garden before it divided from its neighbors by a hedge now in full verdure redclyffe was glad to see some symptoms of natural love of beauty here for there were plants of box cut into queer shapes of birds peacocks etc as if year after year had been spent in bringing these vegetable sculptures to perfection in one of the gardens moreover the ingenious inhabitant had spent his leisure in building grottowork of which the english are rather ludicrously fond on their little bits of lawn and in building a miniature castle of oystershells where were seen turrets ramparts a frowning arched gateway and miniature cannon looking from the embrasures a pleasanter and better adornment were the homely household flowers and a pleasant sound too was the hum of bees who had their home in several beehives and were making their honey among the flowers of the garden or come from afar buzzing dreamily through the air laden with honey that they had found elsewhere fruit trees stood erect or in some instances were flattened out against the walls of cottages looking somewhat like hawks nailed in terrorem against a barn door the male members of this little community were probably afield with the exception of one or two halftorpid greatgrandsires who were moving rheumatically about the gardens and some children not yet in breeches who stared with stolid eyes at the passersby but the good dames were busy within doors where redclyffe had glimpses of their interior with its pavement of stone flags altogether it seemed a comfortable settlement enough  do you see that child yonder observed the warden creeping away from the door and displaying a vista of his petticoats as he does so that sturdy boy is the lineal heir of one of the oldest families in this part of englandthough now decayed and fallen as you may judge so you see with all our contrivances to keep up an aristocracy there still is change forever going on  there is something not agreeable and something otherwise in the thought replied redclyffe what is the name of the old family whose representative is in such a case  moseby said the warden their family residence stood within three miles of braithwaite hall but was taken down in the last century and its place supplied by a grand showplace built by a birmingham manufacturer who also originated here  they kept onward from this outskirt of the village and soon passing over a little rising ground and descending now into a hollow came to the new portion of it clustered around its gray norman church one side of the tower of which was covered with ivy that was carefully kept the warden said from climbing to the battlements on account of some old prophecy that foretold that the tower would fall if ever the ivy mantled over its top certainly however there seemed little likelihood that the square low mass would fall unless by external violence in less than as many ages as it had already stood  redclyffe looked at the old tower and little adjoining edifice with an interest that attached itself to every separate mossgrown stone but the warden like most englishmen was at once amazed and wearied with the americans enthusiasm for this spot which to him was uninteresting for the very reason that made it most interesting to redclyffe because it had stood there such a weary while it was too common an object to excite in his mind as it did in redclyffes visions of the long ago time when it was founded when mass was first said there and the glimmer of torches at the altar was seen through the vista of that broadbrowed porch and of all the procession of villagers that had since gone in and come out during nine hundred years in their varying costume and fashion but yetand this was the strongest and most thrilling part of the ideaall the very oldest of them bearing a resemblance of feature the kindred the family likeness to those who died yesterdayto those who still went thither to worship and that all the grassy and halfobliterated graves around had held those who bore the same traits  in front of the church was a little green on which stood a very ancient yew tree endnote 2 all the heart of which seemed to have been eaten away by time so that a man could now creep into the trunk through a wide opening and looking upward see another opening to the sky  that tree observed the warden is well worth the notice of such an enthusiastic lover of old things though i suppose aged trees may be the one antiquity that you do not value having them by myriads in your primeval forests but then the interest of this tree consists greatly in what your trees have notin its long connection with men and the goings of men some of its companions were made into bows for harolds archers this tree is of unreckonable antiquity so old that in a record of the time of edward iv it is styled the yew tree of braithwaite green that carries it back to norman times truly it was in comparatively modern times when it served as a gallows for one of james iis bloodthirsty judges to hang his victims on after monmouths rebellion  on one side of this yew was a certain structure which redclyffe did not recognize as anything that he had before seen but soon guessed its purpose though from appearances it seemed to have been very long since it had served that purpose it was a ponderous old oaken framework six or seven feet high so contrived that a heavy cross piece shut down over another leaving two round holes in short it was a pair of stocks in which i suppose hundreds of vagrants and petty criminals had sat of old but which now appeared to be merely a matter of curiosity  this excellent old machine said the warden had been lying in a rubbish chamber of the church tower for at least a century when the clerk who is a little of an antiquarian unearthed it and i advised him to set it here where it used to standnot with any idea of its being used though there is as much need of it now as ever but that the present age may see what comforts it has lost  they sat down a few moments on the circular seat and looked at the pretty scene of this quiet little village clustered round the old church as a centre a collection of houses mostly thatched though there were one or two with rather more pretension that had roofs of red tiles some of them were stone cottages whitewashed but the larger edifices had timber frames filled in with brick and plaster which seemed to have been renewed in patches and to be a frailer and less durable material than the old oak of their skeletons they were gabled with lattice windows and picturesquely set off with projecting stones and many little patchwork additions such as in the course of generations the inhabitants had found themselves to need there was not much commerce apparently in this little village there seeming to be only one shop with some gingerbread penny whistles ballads and such matters displayed in the window and there too across the little green opposite the church was the village alehouse with its bench under the low projecting eaves with a teniers scene of two wayfaring yeomen drinking a pot of beer and smoking their pipes  with redclyffes yankee feelings there was something sad to think how the generations had succeeded one another over and over in innumerable succession in this little spot being born here living dying lying down among their fathers dust and forthwith getting up again as it were and recommencing the same meaningless round and really bringing nothing to pass for probably the generation of today in so secluded and motionless a place as this had few or no ideas in advance of their ancestors of five centuries ago it seems not worth while that more than one generation of them should have existed even in dress with their smock frocks and breeches they were just like their fathers the stirring blood of the new landwhere no man dwells in his fathers housewhere no man thinks of dying in his birthplaceawoke within him and revolted at the thought and as connected with it revolted at all the hereditary pretensions which since his stay here had exercised such an influence over the fanciful part of his nature in another mood the village might have seemed a picture of rural peace which it would have been worth while to give up ambition to enjoy now as his warmer impulse stirred it was a weariness to think of the new american was stronger in him than the hereditary englishman  i should go mad of it exclaimed he aloud  he started up impulsively to the amazement of his companion who of course could not comprehend what seemed so to have stung his american friend as they passed the tree on the other side of its huge trunk they saw a young woman sitting on that side of it and sketching apparently the church tower with the old elizabethan vicarage that stood near it with a gate opening into the churchyard and much embowered and ivyhung  ah miss cheltenham said the warden i am glad to see that you have taken the old church in hand for it is one of the prettiest rustic churches in england and as well worthy as any to be engraved on a sheet of notepaper or put into a portfolio will you let my friend and me see your sketch  the warden had made his request with rather more freedom than perhaps he would to a lady whom he considered on a level with himself though with perfect respect that being considered and redclyffe looking at the person saw that it was the same of whose face he had had a glimpse in the lookingglass in the old palmers chamber  no doctor hammond said the young lady with a respectful sort of frankness you must excuse me i am no good artist and am but jotting down the old church because i like it  well well as you please said the warden and whispered aside to redclyffe a girls sketchbook is seldom worth looking at but now miss cheltenham i am about to give my american friend here a lecture on gargoyles and other peculiarities of sacred gothic architecture and if you will honor me with your attention i should be glad to find my audience increased by one  so the young lady arose and redclyffe considering the wardens allusion to him as a sort of partial introduction bowed to her and she responded with a cold reserved yet not unpleasant sort of courtesy they went towards the church porch and looking in at the old stone bench on each side of the interior the warden showed them the hacks of the swords of the roundheads when they took it by storm redclyffe mindful of the old graveyard on the edge of which he had spent his childhood began to look at this far more antique receptacle expecting to find there many ancient tombstones perhaps of contemporaries or predecessors of the founders of his country in this however he was disappointed at least in a great measure for the persons buried in the churchyard were probably for the most part of a humble rank in life such as were not so ambitious as to desire a monument of any kind but were content to let their low earthmounds subside into the level where their memory had waxed so faint that none among the survivors could point out the spot or cared any longer about knowing it while in other cases where a monument of red freestone or even of hewn granite had been erected the english climate had forthwith set to work to gnaw away the inscriptions so that in fifty yearsin a time that would have left an american tombstone as fresh as if just cutit was quite impossible to make out the record their superiors meanwhile were sleeping less enviably in dismal mouldy and dusty vaults instead of under the daisies thus redclyffe really found less antiquity here than in the graveyard which might almost be called his natal spot  when he said something to this effect the warden nodded  yes said he and in truth we have not much need of inscriptions for these poor people all good familiesevery one almost with any pretensions to respectable station has his family or individual recognition within the church or upon its walls or some of them you see on tombs on the outside as for our poorer friends here they are content as they may well be to swell and subside like little billows of mortality here on the outside  and for my part said redclyffe if there were anything particularly desirable on either side i should like best to sleep under this lovely green turf with the daisies strewn over me by nature herself and whatever other homely flowers any friend might choose to add  and doctor hammond said the young woman we see by this gravestone that sometimes a person of humble rank may happen to be commemorated and that naturein this instance at leastseems to take especial pains and pleasure to preserve the record  she indicated a flat gravestone near the porch which time had indeed beautified in a singular way for there was cut deep into it a name and date in old english characters very deep it must originally have been and as if in despair of obliterating it time had taken the kindlier method of filling up the letters with moss so that now high embossed in loveliest green was seen the name richard oglethorpe 1613green and flourishing and beautiful like the memory of a good man the inscription originally seemed to have contained some twenty lines which might have been poetry or perhaps a prose eulogy or perhaps the simple record of the buried persons life but all this having been done in fainter and smaller letters was now so far worn away as to be illegible nor had they ever been deep enough to be made living in moss like the rest of the inscription  how tantalizing remarked redclyffe to see the verdant shine of this name impressed upon us as something remarkableand nothing else i cannot but think that there must be something worth remembering about a man thus distinguished when two hundred years have taken all these natural pains to illustrate and emblazon richard oglethorpe 1613 ha i surely recollect that name it haunts me somehow as if it had been familiar of old  and me said the young lady  it was an old name hereabouts observed the warden but has been long extincta cottage name not a gentlemans i doubt not that oglethorpes sleep in many of these undistinguished graves  redclyffe did not much attend to what his friend said his attention being attracted to the toneto something in the tone of the young lady and also to her coincidence in his remark that the name appealed to some early recollection he had been taxing his memory to tell him when and how the name had become familiar to him and he now remembered that it had occurred in the old doctors story of the bloody footstep told to him and elsie so long ago endnote 3 to him and elsie it struck himwhat if it were possiblebut he knew it was notthat the young lady had a remembrance also of the fact and that she after so many years were mingling her thoughts with his as this fancy recurred to him he endeavored to get a glimpse of her face and while he did so she turned it upon him it was a quick sensitive face that did not seem altogether english he would rather have imagined it american but at all events he could not recognize it as one that he had seen before and a thousand fantasies died within him as in his momentary glance he took in the volume of its contour     chapter xviii   after the two friends had parted from the young lady they passed through the village and entered the park gate of braithwaite hall pursuing a winding road through its beautiful scenery which realized all that redclyffe had read or dreamed about the perfect beauty of these sylvan creations with the clumps of trees or sylvan oaks picturesquely disposed to heighten the charm they saw a herd of deer reposing who on their appearance rose from their recumbent position and began to gaze warily at the strangers then tossing their horns they set off on a stampede but only swept round and settled down not far from where they were redclyffe looked with great interest at these deer who were at once wild and civilized retaining a kind of free forest citizenship while yet they were in some sense subject to man it seemed as if they were a link between wild nature and tame as if they could look back in their long recollections through a vista into the times when englands forests were as wild as those of america though now they were but a degree more removed from domesticity than cattle and took their food in winter from the hand of man and in summer reposed upon his lawns this seemed the last touch of that delightful conquered and regulated wildness which english art has laid upon the whole growth of english nature animal or vegetable  there is nothing really wild in your whole island he observed to the warden i have a sensation as if somebody knew and had cultivated and fostered and set out in its proper place every tree that grows as if somebody had patted the heads of your wildest animals and played with them it is very delightful to me for the present and yet i think in the course of time i should feel the need for something genuine as it weresomething that had not the touch and breath of man upon it i suppose even your skies are modified by the modes of human life that are going on beneath it london skies of course are so but the breath of a great people to say nothing of its furnace vapors and hearthsmokes make the sky other than it was a thousand years ago  i believe we english have a feeling like this occasionally replied the warden and it is from that partly that we must account for our adventurousness into other regions especially for our interest in what is wild and new in your own forests now and prairies i fancy we find a charm that americans do not in the sea too and therefore we are yachters for my part however i have grown to like nature a little smoothed down and enriched less gaunt and wolfish than she would be if left to herself  yes i feel that charm too said redclyffe but yet life would be slow and heavy methinks to see nothing but english parks  continuing their course through the noble clumps of oaks they by and by had a vista of the distant hall itself it was one of the old english timber and plaster houses many of which are of unknown antiquity as was the case with a portion of this house although other portions had been renewed repaired or added within a century it had originally the warden said stood all round an enclosed courtyard like the great houses of the continent but now one side of the quadrangle had long been removed and there was only a front with two wings the beams of old oak being picked out with black and three or four gables in a line forming the front while the wings seemed to be stone it was the timber portion that was most ancient a clock was on the midmost gable and pointed now towards one oclock the whole scene impressed redclyffe not as striking but as an abode of ancient peace where generation after generation of the same family had lived each making the most of life because the life of each successive dweller there was eked out with the lives of all who had hitherto lived there and had in it equally those lives which were to come afterwards so that there was a rare and successful contrivance for giving length fulness body substance to this thin and frail matter of human life and as life was so rich in comprehensiveness the dwellers there made the most of it for the present and future each generation contriving what it could to add to the cosiness the comfortableness the grave solid respectability the sylvan beauty of the house with which they seemed to be connected both before and after death the family had its home there not merely the individual ancient shapes that had apparently gone to the family tomb had yet a right by family hearth and in family hall nor did they come thither cold and shivering and diffusing dim ghostly terrors and repulsive shrinkings and death in life but in warm genial attributes making this life now passing more dense as it were by adding all the substance of their own to it redclyffe could not compare this abode and the feelings that it aroused to the houses of his own country poor tents of a day inns of a night where nothing was certain save that the family of him who built it would not dwell here even if he himself should have the bliss to die under the roof which with absurdest anticipations he had built for his posterity posterity an american can have none  all this sort of thing is beautiful the family institution was beautiful in its day ejaculated he aloud to himself not to his companion but it is a thing of the past it is dying out in england and as for ourselves we never had it something better will come up but as for this it is past  that is a sad thing to say observed the warden by no means comprehending what was passing in his friends mind but if you wish to view the interior of the hall we will go thither for harshly as i have spoken of the owner i suppose he has english feeling enough to give us lunch and show us the old house of his forefathers  not at present if you please replied redclyffe i am afraid of destroying my delightful visionary idea of the house by coming too near it before i leave this part of the country i should be glad to ramble over the whole of it but not just now  while redclyffe was still enjoying the frank hospitality of his new friend a rather marked event occurred in his life yet not so important in reality as it seemed to his english friend  a large letter was delivered to him bearing the official seal of the united states and the indorsement of the state department a very importantlooking document which could not but add to the importance of the recipient in the eyes of any englishman accustomed as they are to bow down before any seal of government redclyffe opened it rather coolly being rather loath to renew any of his political remembrances now that he was in peace or to think of the turmoil of modern and democratic politics here in this quietude of goneby ages and customs the contents however took him by surprise nor did he know whether to be pleased or not  the official package in short contained an announcement that he had been appointed by the president by and with the advice of the senate to one of the continental missions usually esteemed an object of considerable ambition to any young man in politics so that if consistent with his own pleasure he was now one of the diplomatic corps a minister and representative of his country on first considering the matter redclyffe was inclined to doubt whether this honor had been obtained for him altogether by friendly aid though it did happen to have much in it that might suit his halfformed purpose of remaining long abroad but with an eye already rendered somewhat oblique by political practice he suspected that a political rivala rival though of his own partyhad been exerting himself to provide an inducement for redclyffe to leave the local field to him while he himself should take advantage of the vacant field and his rival be thus insidiously though honorably laid on the shelf whence if he should try to remove himself a few years hence the shifting influences of american politics would be likely enough to thwart him so that for the sake of being a few years nominally somebody he might in fine come back to his own country and find himself permanently nobody but redclyffe had already sufficiently begun to suspect that he lacked some qualities that a politician ought to have and without which a political life whether successful or otherwise is sure to be a most irksome one some qualities he lacked others he had both almost equally an obstacle when he communicated the offer therefore to his friend the warden it was with the remark that he believed he should accept it  accept it cried the warden opening his eyes i should think so indeed why it puts you above the level of the highest nobility of the court to which you are accredited simple republican as you are it gives you rank with the old blood and birth of europe accept it by all means and i will come and see you at your court  nothing is more different between england and america said redclyffe than the different way in which the citizen of either country looks at official station to an englishman a commission of whatever kind emanating from his sovereign brings apparently a gratifying sense of honor to an american on the contrary it offers really nothing of the kind he ceases to be a sovereignan atom of sovereignty at all eventsand stoops to be a servant if i accept this mission honorable as you think it i assure you i shall not feel myself quite the man i have hitherto been although there is no obstacle in the way of party obligations or connections to my taking it if i please  i do not well understand this quoth the good warden it is one of the promises of scripture to the wise man that he shall stand before kings and that this embassy will enable you to do no manno man of your country surelyis more worthy to do so so pray accept  i think i shall said redclyffe  much as the warden had seemed to affectionize redclyffe hitherto the latter could not but be sensible thereafter of a certain deference in his friend towards him which he would fain have got rid of had it been in his power however there was still the same heartiness under it all and after a little he seemed in some degree to take redclyffes own view of the matternamely that being so temporary as these republican distinctions are they really do not go skin deep have no reality in them and that the sterling quality of the man be it higher or lower is nowise altered by itan apothegm that is true even of an hereditary nobility and still more so of our own honorables and excellencies however the good warden was glad of his friends dignity and perhaps too a little glad that this high fortune had befallen one whom he chanced to be entertaining under his roof as it happened there was an opportunity which might be taken advantage of to celebrate the occasion at least to make it known to the english world so far as the extent of the county endnote 1  it was an hereditary custom for the warden of braithwaite hospital once a year to give a grand dinner to the nobility and gentry of the neighborhood and to this end a bequest had been made by one of the former squires or lords of braithwaite which would of itself suffice to feed forty or fifty englishmen with reasonable sumptuousness the present warden being a gentleman of private fortune was accustomed to eke the limited income devoted for this purpose with such additions from his own resources as brought the rude and hearty hospitality contemplated by the first founder on a par with modern refinements of gourmandism the banquet was annually given in the fine old hall where james ii had feasted and on some of these occasions the wardens table had been honored with illustrious guests especially when any of them happened to be wanting an opportunity to come before the public in an afterdinner speech just at present there was no occasion of that sort and the good warden fancied that he might give considerable √©clat to his hereditary feast by bringing forward the young american envoy a distinguished and eloquent man to speak on the well worn topic of the necessity of friendly relations between england and america  you are eloquent i doubt not my young friend inquired he  why no answered redclyffe modestly  ah yes i know it returned the warden if one have all the natural prerequisites of eloquence a quick sensibility ready thought apt expression a good voiceand not making its way into the world through your nose either as they say most of your countrymens voices do you shall make the crack speech at my dinner and so strengthen the bonds of good fellowship between our two countries that there shall be no question of war for at least six months to come  accordingly the preparations for this stately banquet went on with great spirit and the warden exhorted redclyffe to be thinking of some good topics for his international speech but the young man laughed it off and told his friend that he thought the inspiration of the moment aided by the good old wine which the warden had told him of as among the treasures of the hospital would perhaps serve him better than any elaborate preparation  redclyffe being not even yet strong used to spend much time when the day chanced to be pleasant which was oftener than his preconceptions of english weather led him to expect in the garden behind the wardens house it was an extensive one and apparently as antique as the foundation of the establishment and during all these years it had probably been growing richer and richer here were flowers of ancient race and some that had been merely field or wayside flowers when first they came into the garden but by long cultivation and hereditary care instead of dying out they had acquired a new richness and beauty so that you would scarcely recognize the daisy or the violet roses too there were which doctor hammond said had been taken from those white and red rosetrees in the temple gardens whence the partisans of york and lancaster had plucked their fatal badges with these there were all the modern and farfetched flowers from america the east and elsewhere even the prairie flowers and the california blossoms were represented here for one of the brethren had horticultural tastes and was permitted freely to exercise them there the antique character of the garden was preserved likewise by the alleys of box a part of which had been suffered to remain and was now grown to a great height and density so as to make impervious green walls there were also yew trees clipped into strange shapes of bird and beast and uncouth heraldic figures among which of course the leopards head grinned triumphant and as for fruit the high garden wall was lined with pear trees spread out flat against it where they managed to produce a cold flavorless fruit a good deal akin to cucumbers  here in these genial old arbors redclyffe used to recline in the sweet mild summer weather basking in the sun which was seldom too warm to make its full embrace uncomfortable and it seemed to him with its fertility with its marks everywhere of the quiet longbestowed care of man the sweetest and cosiest seclusion he had ever known and two or three times a day when he heard the screech of the railway train rushing on towards distant london it impressed him still more with a sense of safe repose here  not unfrequently he here met the whitebearded palmer in whose chamber he had found himself as if conveyed thither by enchantment when he first came to the hospital the old man was not by any means of the garrulous order and yet he seemed full of thoughts full of reminiscences and not disinclined to the company of redclyffe in fact the latter sometimes flattered himself that a tendency for his society was one of the motives that brought him to the garden though the amount of their intercourse after all was not so great as to warrant the idea of any settled purpose in so doing nevertheless they talked considerably and redclyffe could easily see that the old man had been an extensive traveller and had perhaps occupied situations far different from his present one and had perhaps been a struggler in troubled waters before he was drifted into the retirement where redclyffe found him he was fond of talking about the unsuspected relationship that must now be existing between many families in england and unknown consanguinity in the new world where perhaps really the main stock of the family tree was now existing and with a new spirit and life which the representative growth here in england had lost by too long continuance in one air and one mode of life for history and observation proved that all peopleand the english people by no means less than othersneeded to be transplanted or somehow renewed every few generations so that according to this ancient philosophers theory it would be good for the whole people of england now if it could at once be transported to america where its fatness its sleepiness its too great beefiness its preponderant animal character would be rectified by a different air and soil and equally good on the other hand for the whole american people to be transplanted back to the original island where their nervousness might be weighted with heavier influences where their little women might grow bigger where their thin dry men might get a burden of flesh and good stomachs where their children might with the air draw in a reverence for age forms and usage  redclyffe listened with complacency to these speculations smiling at the thought of such an exodus as would take place and the reciprocal dissatisfaction which would probably be the result but he had greater pleasure in drawing out some of the old gentlemans legendary lore some of which whether true or not was very curious endnote 2  as redclyffe sat one day watching the old man in the garden he could not help being struck by the scrupulous care with which he attended to the plants it seemed to him that there was a sense of justiceof desiring to do exactly what was right in the matter not favoring one plant more than another and doing all he could for each his progress in consequence was so slow that in an hour while redclyffe was off and on looking at him he had scarcely done anything perceptible then he was so minute and often when he was on the point of leaving one thing to take up another some small neglect that he saw or fancied called him back again to spend other minutes on the same task he was so full of scruples it struck redclyffe that this was conscience morbid sick a despot in trifles looking so closely into life that it permitted nothing to be done the man might once have been strong and able but by some unhealthy process of his life he had ceased to be so now nor did any happy or satisfactory result appear to come from these painfully wrought efforts he still seemed to know that he had left something undone in doing too much in another direction here was a lily that had been neglected while he paid too much attention to a rose he had set his foot on a violet he had grubbed up in his haste a little plant that he mistook for a weed but that he now suspected was an herb of grace grieved by such reflections as these he heaved a deep sigh almost amounting to a groan and sat down on the little stool that he carried with him in his weeding resting his face in his hands  redclyffe deemed that he might be doing the old man a good service by interrupting his melancholy labors so he emerged from the opposite door of the summerhouse and came along the adjoining walk with somewhat heavy footsteps in order that the palmer might have warning of his approach without any grounds to suppose that he had been watched hitherto accordingly when he turned into the other alley he found the old man sitting erect on his stool looking composed but still sad as was his general custom  after all your wanderings and experience said he i observe that you come back to the original occupation of cultivating a gardenthe innocentest of all  yes so it would seem said the old man but somehow or other i do not find peace in this  these plants and shrubs returned redclyffe seem at all events to recognize the goodness of your rule so far as it has extended over them see how joyfully they take the sun how clear they are from all these vices that lie scattered round in the shape of weeds it is a lovely sight and i could almost fancy a quiet enjoyment in the plants themselves which they have no way of making us aware of except by giving out a fragrance  ah how infinitely would that idea increase mans responsibility said the old palmer if besides man and beast we should find it necessary to believe that there is also another set of beings dependent for their happiness on our doing or leaving undone what might have effect on them  i question said redclyffe smiling whether their pleasurable or painful experiences can be so keen that we need trouble our consciences much with regard to what we do merely as it affects them so highly cultivated a conscience as that would be a nuisance to ones self and ones fellows  you say a terrible thing rejoined the old man can conscience be too much alive in us is not everything however trifling it seems an item in the great account which it is of infinite importance therefore to have right a terrible thing is that you have said  that may be said redclyffe but it is none the less certain to me that the efficient actorsthose who mould the worldare the persons in whom something else is developed more strongly than conscience there must be an invincible determination to effect something it may be set to work in the right direction but after that it must go onward trampling down small obstaclessmall considerations of right and wrongas a great rock thundering down a hillside crushes a thousand sweet flowers and ploughs deep furrows in the innocent hillside  as redclyffe gave vent to this doctrine which was not naturally his but which had been the inculcation of a life hitherto devoted to politics he was surprised to find how strongly sensible he became of the ugliness and indefensibleness of what he said he felt as if he were speaking under the eye of omniscience and as if every word he said were weighed and its emptiness detected by an unfailing intelligence he had thought that he had volumes to say about the necessity of consenting not to do right in all matters minutely for the sake of getting out an available and valuable right as the whole but there was something that seemed to tie his tongue could it be the quiet gaze of this old man so unpretending so humble so simple in aspect he could not tell only that he faltered and finally left his speech in the midst  but he was surprised to find how he had to struggle against a certain repulsion within himself to the old man he seemed so nonsensical interfering with everybodys right in the world so mischievous standing there and shutting out the possibility of action it seemed well to trample him down to put him out of the wayno matter how somehow it gave him he thought an inkling of the way in which this poor old man had made himself odious to his kind by opposing himself inevitably to what was bad in man chiding it by his very presence accepting nothing false you must either love him utterly or hate him utterly for he could not let you alone redclyffe being a susceptible man felt this influence in the strongest way for it was as if there was a battle within him one party pulling wrenching him towards the old man another wrenching him away so that by the agony of the contest he felt disposed to end it by taking flight and never seeing the strange individual again he could well enough conceive how a brutal nature if capable of receiving his influence at all might find it so intolerable that it must needs get rid of him by violenceby taking his blood if necessary  all these feelings were but transitory however they swept across him like a wind and then he looked again at the old man and saw only his simplicity his unworldlinesssaw little more than the worn and feeble individual in the hospital garb leaning on his staff and then turning again with a gentle sigh to weed in the garden and then redclyffe went away in a state of disturbance for which he could not account to himself     chapter xix   high up in the old carved roof meanwhile the spiders of centuries still hung their flaunting webs with a profusion that old doctor grimshawe would have been ravished to see but even this was to be remedied for one day on looking in redclyffe found the great hall dim with floating dust and down through it came great floating masses of cobweb out of which the old doctor would have undertaken to regenerate the world and he saw dimly aloft men on ladders sweeping away these accumulations of years and breaking up the haunts and residences of hereditary spiders  the stately old hall had been in process of cleaning and adapting to the banquet purposes of the nineteenth century which it was accustomed to subserve in so proud a way in the sixteenth it was in the first place well swept and cleansed the painted glass windows were cleansed from dust and several panes which had been unfortunately broken and filled with common glass were filled in with colored panes which the warden had picked up somewhere in his antiquarian researches they were not to be sure just what was wanted a piece of a saint from some cathedral window supplying what was lacking of the gorgeous purple of a medi√¶val king but the general effect was rich and good whenever the misty english atmosphere supplied sunshine bright enough to pervade it tapestry too from antique looms faded but still gorgeous was hung upon the walls some suits of armor that hung beneath the festal gallery were polished till the old battered helmets and pierced breastplates sent a gleam like that with which they had flashed across the battlefields of old endnote 1  so now the great day of the wardens dinner had arrived and as may be supposed there were fiery times in the venerable old kitchen the cook according to ancient custom concocted many antique dishes such as used to be set before kings and nobles dainties that might have called the dead out of their graves combinations of ingredients that had ceased to be put together for centuries historic dishes which had long long ceased to be in the list of revels then there was the stalwart english cheer of the sirloin and the round there were the vast plumpuddings the juicy mutton the venison there was the game now just in seasonthe halftame wild fowl of english covers the halfdomesticated wild deer of english parks the heathcock from the faroff hills of scotland and one little prairie hen and some canvas back ducksobtained heaven knows how in compliment to redclyffe from his native shores o the old jolly kitchen how rich the flavored smoke that went up its vast chimney how inestimable the atmosphere of steam that was diffused through it how did the old men peep into it even venture across the threshold braving the hot wrath of the cook and his assistants for the sake of imbuing themselves with these rich and delicate flavors receiving them in as it were spiritually for received through the breath and in the atmosphere it was really a spiritual enjoyment the ghosts of ancient epicures seemed on that day and the few preceding ones to haunt the dim passages snuffing in with shadowy nostrils the rich vapors assuming visibility in the congenial medium almost becoming earthly again in the strength of their earthly longings for one other feast such as they used to enjoy  nor is it to be supposed that it was only these antique dainties that the warden provided for his feast no if the cook the cultured and recondite old cook who had accumulated within himself all that his predecessors knew for centuriesif he lacked anything of modern fashion and improvement he had supplied his defect by temporary assistance from a london club and the bill of fare was provided with dishes that soyer would not have harshly criticised the ethereal delicacy of modern taste the nice adjustment of flowers the french style of cookery was richly attended to and the list was long of dishes with fantastic names fish fowl and flesh and entremets and sweets as the english call them and sugared cates too numerous to think of  the wines we will not take upon ourselves to enumerate but the juice then destined to be quaffed was in part the precious vintages that had been broached half a century ago and had been ripening ever since the rich and dry old port so unlovely to the natural palate that it requires long english seasoning to get it down the sherry imported before these modern days of adulteration some claret the warden said of rarest vintage some burgundy of which it was the quality to warm the blood and genialize existence for three days after it was drunk then there was a rich liquid contributed to this department by redclyffe himself for some weeks since when the banquet first loomed in the distance he had anxious to evince his sense of the wardens kindness sent across the ocean for some famous madeira which he had inherited from the doctor and never tasted yet this together with some of the western wines of america had arrived and was ready to be broached  the warden tested these modern wines and recognized a new flavor but gave it only a moderate approbation for in truth an elderly englishman has not a wide appreciation of wines nor loves new things in this kind more than in literature or life but he tasted the madeira too and underwent an ecstasy which was only alleviated by the dread of gout which he had an idea that this wine must bring on and truly if it were so splendid a wine as he pronounced it some pain ought to follow as the shadow of such a pleasure  as it was a festival of antique date the dinner hour had been fixed earlier than is usual at such stately banquets namely at six oclock which was long before the dusky hour at which englishmen love best to dine about that period the carriages drove into the old courtyard of the hospital in great abundance blocking up too the ancient portal and remaining in a line outside carriages they were with armorial bearings family coaches in which came englishmen in their black coats and white neckcloths elderly whiteheaded freshcolored squat not beautiful certainly nor particularly dignified nor very well dressed nor with much of an imposing air but yet somehow or other producing an effect of force respectability reliableness trust which is probably deserved since it is invariably experienced cold they were in deportment and looked coldly on the stranger who on his part drew himself up with an extra haughtiness and reserve and felt himself in the midst of his enemies and more as if he were going to do battle than to sit down to a friendly banquet the warden introduced him as an american diplomatist to one or two of the gentlemen who regarded him forbiddingly as englishmen do before dinner  not long after redclyffe had entered the receptionroom which was but shortly before the hour appointed for the dinner there was another arrival betokened by the clatter of hoofs and grinding wheels in the courtyard and then entered a gentleman of different mien from the bluff ruddy simpleminded yet worldly englishmen around him he was a tall dark man with a black moustache and almost olive skin a slender lithe figure a flexible face quick flashing mobile his deportment was graceful his dress though it seemed to differ in little or nothing from that of the gentlemen in the room had yet a grace and picturesqueness in his mode of wearing it he advanced to the warden who received him with distinction and yet redclyffe fancied not exactly with cordiality it seemed to redclyffe that the warden looked round as if with the purpose of presenting redclyffe to this gentleman but he himself from some latent reluctance had turned away and entered into conversation with one of the other gentlemen who said now looking at the newcomer are you acquainted with this last arrival  not at all said redclyffe i know lord braithwaite by sight indeed but have had no introduction he is a man certainly of distinguished appearance  why pretty well said the gentleman but unenglish as also are his manners it is a pity to see an old english family represented by such a person neither he his father nor grandfather was born among us he has far more italian blood than enough to drown the slender stream of anglosaxon and norman his modes of life his prejudices his estates his religion are unlike our own and yet here he is in the position of an old english gentleman possibly to be a peer you whose nationality embraces that of all the world cannot i suppose understand this english feeling endnote 2  pardon me said redclyffe i can perfectly understand it an american in his feelings towards england has all the jealousy and exclusiveness of englishmen themselvesperhaps indeed a little exaggerated  i beg your pardon said the englishman incredulously i think you cannot possibly understand it endnote 3  the guests were by this time all assembled and at the wardens bidding they moved from the receptionroom to the dininghall in some order and precedence of which redclyffe could not exactly discover the principle though he found that to himselfin his quality doubtless of ambassadorthere was assigned a pretty high place a venerable dignitary of the churcha dean he seemed to behaving asked a blessing the fair scene of the banquet now lay before the guests presenting a splendid spectacle in the highwalled antique tapestried hall overhung with the dark intricate oaken beams with the high gothic windows through one of which the setting sunbeams streamed and showed the figures of kings and warriors and the old braithwaites among them beneath and adown the hall extended the long line of the tables covered with the snow of the damask tablecloth on which glittered gleamed and shone a good quality of ancient ancestral plate and an √©pergne of silver extending down the middle also the gleam of golden wine in the decanters and truly redclyffe thought that it was a noble spectacle made so by old and stately associations which made a noble banquet of what otherwise would be only a vulgar dinner the english have this advantage and know how to make use of it they bringin these old timehonored feastsall the past to sit down and take the stately refreshment along with them and they pledge the historic characters in their wine  a printed bill of fare in gold letters lay by each plate on which redclyffe saw the company glancing with great interest the first dish of course was turtle soup of whichas the gentleman next him the mayor of a neighboring town told redclyffeit was allowable to take twice this was accompanied according to one of those rules which one knows not whether they are arbitrary or founded on some deep reason by a glass of punch then came the noble turbot the salmon the sole and divers of fishes and the dinner fairly set in the genial warden seemed to have given liberal orders to the attendants for they spared not to offer hock champagne sherry to the guests and good bitter ale foaming in the goblet and so the stately banquet went on with somewhat tedious magnificence and yet with a fulness of effect and thoroughness of sombre life that made redclyffe feel that so much importance being assigned to itit being so much believed init was indeed a feast the cumbrous courses swept by one after another and redclyffe finding it heavy work sat idle most of the time regarding the hall the old decaying beams the armor hanging beneath the galleries and these englishmen feasting where their fathers had feasted for so many ages the same occasion the same men probably in appearance though the black coat and the white neckcloth had taken the place of ruff embroidered doublet and the magnificence of other ages after all the english have not such good things to eat as we in america and certainly do not know better how to make them palatable endnote 4  well but by and by the dinner came to a conclusion as regarded the eating part the cloth was withdrawn a dessert of fruits fresh and dried pines hothouse grapes and all candied conserves of the indies was put on the long extent of polished mahogany there was a tuning up of musicians an interrogative drawing of fiddlebows and other musical twangs and puffs the decanters opposite the warden and his vicepresidentsherry port redclyffes madeira and claret were put in motion along the table and the guests filled their glasses for the toast which at english dinnertables is of course the first to be honoredthe queen then the band struck up the good old anthem god save the queen which the whole company rose to their feet to sing it was a spectacle both interesting and a little ludicrous to redclyffe being so apart from an americans sympathies so unlike anything that he has in his life or possibilitiesthis active and warm sentiment of loyalty in which love of country centres and assimilates and transforms itself into a passionate affection for a person in whom they love all their institutions to say the truth it seemed a happy notion nor could the americanwhile he comforted himself in the pride of his democracy and that he himself was a sovereigncould he help envying it a little this childlike love and reverence for a person embodying all their country their past their earthly future he felt that it might be delightful to have a sovereign provided that sovereign were always a womanand perhaps a young and fine one but indeed this is not the difficulty methinks in english institutions which the american finds it hardest to deal with we could endure a born sovereign especially if made such a mere pageant as the english make of theirs what we find it hardest to conceive of is the satisfaction with which englishmen think of a race above them with privileges that they cannot share entitled to condescend to them and to have gracious and beautiful manners at their expense to be kind simple unpretending because these qualities are more available than haughtiness to be specimens of perfect manhoodall these advantages in consequence of their position if the peerage were a mere name it would be nothing to envy but it is so much more than a name it enables men to be really so superior the poor the lower classes might bear this well enough but the classes that come next to the nobilitythe upper middle classeshow they bear it so lovingly is what must puzzle the american but probably the advantage of the peerage is the less perceptible the nearer it is looked at  it must be confessed that redclyffe as he looked at this assembly of peers and gentlemen thought with some selfgratulation of the probability that he had within his power as old a rank as desirable a station as the best of them and that if he were restrained from taking it it would probably only be by the democratic pride that made him feel that he could not retaining all his manly sensibility accept this gewgaw on which the ageshis own country especiallyhad passed judgment while it had been suspended over his head he felt himself at any rate in a higher position having the option of taking this rank and forbearing to do so than if he took it endnote 5  after this ensued a ceremony which is of antique date in old english corporations and institutions at their high festivals it is called the loving cup a sort of herald or toastmaster behind the wardens chair made proclamation reciting the names of the principal guests and announcing to them the warden of the braithwaite hospital drinks to you in a loving cup of which cup having sipped or seemed to sip for redclyffe observed that the old drinkers were rather shy of it a small quantity he sent it down the table its progress was accompanied with a peculiar entanglement of ceremony one guest standing up while another drinks being pretty much as follows first each guest receiving it covered from the next above him the same took from the silver cup its silver cover the guest drank with a bow to the warden and company took the cover from the preceding guest covered the cup handed it to the next below him then again removed the cover replaced it after the guest had drunk who on his part went through the same ceremony and thus the cup went slowly on its way down the stately hall these ceremonies being it is said originally precautions against the risk in wild times of being stabbed by the man who was drinking with you or poisoned by one who should fail to be your taster the cup was a fine ancient piece of plate massive heavy curiously wrought with armorial bearings in which the leopards head appeared its contents so far as redclyffe could analyze them by a moderate sip appeared to be claret sweetened with spices and however suited to the peculiarity of antique palates was not greatly to redclyffes taste endnote 6  redclyffes companion just below him while the loving cup was beginning its march had been explaining the origin of the custom as a defence of the drinker in times of deadly feud when it had reached lord braithwaite who drank and passed it to redclyffe covered and with the usual bow redclyffe looked into his lordships italian eyes and dark face as he did so and the thought struck him that if there could possibly be any use in keeping up this old custom it might be so now for how intimated he could hardly tell he was sensible in his deepest self of a deadly hostility in this dark courteous handsome face he kept his eyes fixed on his lordship as he received the cup and felt that in his own glance there was an acknowledgment of the enmity that he perceived and a defiance expressed without visible sign and felt in the bow with which they greeted one another when they had both resumed their seats redclyffe chose to make this ceremonial intercourse the occasion of again addressing him  i know not whether your lordship is more accustomed than myself to these stately ceremonials said he  no said lord braithwaite whose english was very good but this is a good old ceremony and an ingenious one for does it not twine us into knotted links of lovethis loving cuplike a wreath of bacchanals whom i have seen surrounding an antique vase doubtless it has great efficacy in entwining a company of friendly guests into one affectionate society  yes it should seem so replied redclyffe with a smile and again meeting those black eyes which smiled back on him it should seem so but it appears that the origin of the custom was quite different and that it was as a safeguard to a man when he drank with his enemy what a peculiar flavor it must have given to the liquor when the eyes of two deadly foes met over the brim of the loving cup and the drinker knew that if he withdrew it a dagger would be in his heart and the other watched him drink to see if it was poison  ah responded his lordship they had strange fashions in those rough old times nowadays we neither stab shoot nor poison i scarcely think we hate except as interest guides us without malevolence  this singular conversation was interrupted by a toast and the rising of one of the guests to answer it several other toasts of routine succeeded one of which being to the honor of the old founder of the hospital lord braithwaite as his representative rose to reply which he did in good phrases in a sort of eloquence unlike that of the englishmen around him and sooth to say comparatively unaccustomed as he must have been to the use of the language much more handsomely than they in truth redclyffe was struck and amused with the rudeness the slovenliness the inartistic quality of the english speakers who rather seemed to avoid grace and neatness of set purpose as if they would be ashamed of it nothing could be more ragged than these utterances which they called speeches so patched and darned and yet somehow or otherthough dull and heavy as all which seemed to inspire themthey had a kind of force each man seemed to have the faculty of getting after some rude fashion at the sense and feeling that was in him and without glibness without smoothness without form or comeliness still the object with which each one rose to speak was accomplishedand what was more remarkable it seemed to be accomplished without the speakers having any particular plan for doing it he was surprised too to observe how loyally every man seemed to think himself bound to speak and rose to do his best however unfit his usual habits made him for the task observing this and thinking how many an american would be taken aback and dumbfounded by being called on for a dinner speech he could not but doubt the correctness of the general opinion that englishmen are naturally less facile of public speech than our countrymen  you surpass your countrymen said redclyffe when his lordship resumed his seat amid rapping and loud applause  my countrymen i scarcely know whether yon mean the english or italians said lord braithwaite like yourself i am a hybrid with really no country and ready to take up with any  i have a countryone which i am little inclined to deny replied redclyffe gravely while a flush perhaps of conscientious shame rose to his brow  his lordship bowed with a dark italian smile but redclyffes attention was drawn away from the conversation by a toast which the warden now rose to give and in which he found himself mainly concerned with a little preface of kind words not particularly aptly applied to the great and kindred country beyond the atlantic the worthy warden proceeded to remark that his board was honored on this high festival with a guest from that new world a gentleman yet young but already distinguished in the councils of his country the bearer he remarked of an honored english name which might well claim to be remembered here and on this occasion although he had understood from his friend that the american bearers of this name did not count kindred with the english ones this gentleman he further observed with considerable flourish and emphasis had recently been called from his retirement and wanderings into the diplomatic service of his country which he would say from his knowledge the gentleman was well calculated to honor he drank the health of the honorable edward redclyffe ambassador of the united states to the court of hohen linden  our english cousins received this toast with the kindest enthusiasm as they always do any such allusion to our country it being a festal feeling not to be used except on holidays they rose with glass in hand in honor of the ambassador the band struck up hail columbia and our hero marshalled his thoughts as well as he might for the necessary response and when the tumult subsided he arose  his quick apprehending had taught him something of the difference of taste between an english and an american audience at a dinnertable he felt that there must be a certain looseness and carelessness and roughness and yet a certain restraint that he must not seem to aim at speaking well although for his own ambition he was not content to speak ill that somehow or other he must get a heartiness into his speech that he must not polish nor be too neat and must come with a certain rudeness to his good points as if he blundered on them and were surprised into them above all he must let the good wine and cheer and all that he knew and really felt of english hospitality as represented by the kind warden do its work upon his heart and speak up to the extent of what he feltand if a little more then no great harmabout his own love for the fatherland and the broader grounds of the relations between the two countries on this system redclyffe began to speak and being naturally and habitually eloquent and of mobile and ready sensibilities he succeeded between art and nature in making a speech that absolutely delighted the company who made the old hall echo and the banners wave and tremble and the board shake and the glasses jingle with their rapturous applause what he saidor some shadow of it and more than he quite liked to ownwas reported in the county paper that gave a report of the dinner but on glancing over it it seems not worth while to produce this eloquent effort in our pages the occasion and topics being of merely temporary interest  redclyffe sat down and sipped his claret feeling a little ashamed of himself as people are apt to do after a display of this kind  you know the way to the english heart better than i do remarked his lordship after a polite compliment to the speech methinks these dull english are being improved in your atmosphere the english need a change every few centurieseither by immigration of new stock or transportation of the oldor else they grow too gross and earthly with their beef mutton and ale i think now it might benefit both countries if your new england population were to be reciprocally exchanged with an equal number of englishmen indeed italians might do as well  i should regret said redclyffe to change the english heavy as they are  you are an admirable englishman said his lordship for my part i cannot say that the people are very much to my taste any more than their skies and climate in which i have shivered during the two years that i have spent here  here their conversation ceased and redclyffe listened to a long train of speechifying in the course of which everybody almost was toasted everybody present at all events and many absent the wardens old wine was not spared the music rang and resounded from the gallery and everybody seemed to consider it a model feast although there were no very vivid signs of satisfaction but a decorous heavy enjoyment a dull red heat of pleasure without flame soda and seltzerwater and coffee by and by were circulated and at a late hour the company began to retire  before taking his departure lord braithwaite resumed his conversation with redclyffe and as it appeared with the purpose of making a hospitable proposition  i live very much alone said he being insulated from my neighbors by many circumstanceshabits religion and everything else peculiarly english if you are curious about old english modes of life i can show you at least an english residence little altered within a century past pray come and spend a week with me before you leave this part of the country besides i know the court to which you are accredited and can give you perhaps useful information about it  redclyffe looked at him in some surprise and with a nameless hesitation for he did not like his lordship and had fancied in truth that there was a reciprocal antipathy nor did he yet feel that he was mistaken in this respect although his lordships invitation was given in a tone of frankness and seemed to have no reserve except that his eyes did not meet his like anglosaxon eyes and there seemed an italian looking out from within the man but redclyffe had a sort of repulsion within himself and he questioned whether it would be fair to his proposed host to accept his hospitality while he had this secret feeling of hostility and repugnancewhich might be well enough accounted for by the knowledge that he secretly entertained hostile interests to their race and half a purpose of putting them in force and besides thisalthough redclyffe was ashamed of the feelinghe had a secret dread a feeling that it was not just a safe thing to trust himself in this mans power for he had a sense sure as death that he did not wish him well and had a secret dread of the american but he laughed within himself at this feeling and drove it down yet it made him feel that there could be no disloyalty in accepting his lordships invitation because it was given in as little friendship as it would be accepted  i had almost made my arrangements for quitting the neighborhood said he after a pause nor can i shorten the week longer which i had promised to spend with my very kind friend the warden yet your lordships kindness offers we a great temptation and i would gladly spend the next ensuing week at braithwaite hall  i shall expect you then said lord braithwaite you will find me quite alone except my chaplaina scholar and a man of the world whom you will not be sorry to know  he bowed and took his leave without shaking hands as an american would have thought it natural to do after such a hospitable agreement nor did redclyffe make any motion towards it and was glad that his lordship had omitted it on the whole there was a secret dissatisfaction with himself a sense that he was not doing quite a frank and true thing in accepting this invitation and he only made peace with himself on the consideration that lord braithwaite was as little cordial in asking the visit as he in acceding to it     chapter xx   the guests were now rapidly taking their departure and the warden and redclyffe were soon left alone in the antique hall which now in its solitude presented an aspect far different from the gay festivity of an hour before the duskiness up in the carved oaken beams seemed to descend and fill the hall and the remembrance of the feast was like one of those that had taken place centuries ago with which this was now numbered and growing ghostly and faded and sad even as they had long been  well my dear friend said the warden stretching himself and yawning it is over come into my study with me and we will have a devilled turkeybone and a pint of sherry in peace and comfort  i fear i can make no figure at such a supper said redclyffe but i admire your inexhaustibleness in being ready for midnight refreshment after such a feast  not a glass of good liquor has moistened my lips tonight said the warden save and except such as was supplied by a decanter of water made brown with toast and such a sip as i took to the health of the queen and another to that of the ambassador to hohenlinden it is the only way when a man has this vast labor of speechifying to do and indeed there is no possibility of keeping up a jolly countenance for such a length of time except on toastwater  they accordingly adjourned to the wardens sanctum where that worthy dignitary seemed to enjoy himself over his sherry and cracked bones in a degree that he probably had not heretofore while redclyffe whose potations had been more liberal and who was feverish and disturbed tried the effect of a little brandy and sodawater as often happens at such midnight symposiums the two friends found themselves in a more kindly and confidential vein than had happened before great as had been the kindness and confidence already grown up between them redclyffe told his friend of lord braithwaites invitation and of his own resolution to accept it  why not you will do well said the warden and you will find his lordship an accustomed host and the old house most interesting if he knows the secrets of it himself and will show them they will be well worth the seeing  i have had a scruple in accepting this invitation said redclyffe  i cannot see why said the warden i advise it by all means since i shall lose nothing by it myself as it will not lop off any part of your visit to me  my dear friend said redclyffe irresistibly impelled to a confidence which he had not meditated a moment before there is a foolish secret which i must tell you if you will listen to it and which i have only not revealed to you because it seemed to me foolish and dreamlike because too i am an american and a democrat because i am ashamed of myself and laugh at myself  is it a long story asked the warden  i can make it of any length and almost any brevity said redclyffe  i will fill my pipe then answered the warden and listen at my ease and if as you intimate there prove to be any folly in it i will impute it all to the kindly freedom with which you have partaken of our english hospitality and forget it before tomorrow morning  he settled himself in his easychair in a most luxurious posture and redclyffe who felt a strange reluctance to revealfor the first time in his lifethe shadowy hopes if hopes they were and purposes if such they could be called with which he had amused himself so many years begun the story from almost the earliest period that he could remember he told even of his earliest recollection with an old woman in the almshouse and how he had been found there by the doctor and educated by him with all the hints and halfrevelations that had been made to him he described the singular character of the doctor his scientific pursuits his evident accomplishments his great abilities his morbidness and melancholy his moodiness and finally his death and the singular circumstances that accompanied it the story took a considerable time to tell and after its close the warden who had only interrupted it by now and then a question to make it plainer continued to smoke his pipe slowly and thoughtfully for a long while  this doctor of yours was a singular character said he evidently from what you tell me as to the accuracy of his local reminiscences he must have been of this part of the countryof this immediate neighborhoodand such a man could not have grown up here without being known i myselffor i am an old fellow nowmight have known him if he lived to manhood hereabouts  he seemed old to me when i first knew him said redclyffe but children make no distinctions of age he might have been fortyfive then as well as i can judge  you are now twentyseven or eight said the warden and were four years old when you first knew him he might now be sixtyfive do you know my friend that i have something like a certainty that i know who your doctor was  how strange this seems exclaimed redclyffe it has never struck me that i should be able to identify this singular personage with any surroundings or any friends  the warden to requite his friends storyand without as yet saying a word good or bad on his ancestral claimsproceeded to tell him some of the gossip of the neighborhoodwhat had been gossip thirty or forty years ago but was now forgotten or at all events seldom spoken of and only known to the old at the present day he himself remembered it only as a boy and imperfectly there had been a personage of that day a man of poor estate who had fallen deeply in love and been betrothed to a young lady of family he was a young man of more than ordinary abilities and of great promise though small fortune it was not well known how but the match between him and the young lady was broken off and his place was supplied by the then proprietor of braithwaite hall as it was supposed by the artifices of her mother there had been circumstances of peculiar treachery in the matter and mr oglethorpe had taken it severely to heart so severely indeed that he had left the country after selling his ancestral property and had only been occasionally heard of again now from certain circumstances it had struck the warden that this might be the mysterious doctor of whom redclyffe spoke endnote 1  but why suggested redclyffe should a man with these wrongs to avenge take such an interest in a descendant of his enemys family  that is a strong point in favor of my supposition replied the warden there is certainly and has long been a degree of probability that the true heir of this family exists in america if oglethorpe could discover him he ousts his enemy from the estate and honors and substitutes the person whom he has discovered and educated most certainly there is revenge in the thing should it happen now however the triumph would have lost its sweetness even were oglethorpe alive to partake of it for his enemy is dead leaving no heir and this foreign branch has come in without oglethorpes aid  the friends remained musing a considerable time each in his own train of thought till the warden suddenly spoke  do you mean to prosecute this apparent claim of yours  i have not intended to do so said redclyffe  of course said the warden that should depend upon the strength of your ground and i understand you that there is some link wanting to establish it otherwise i see not how you can hesitate is it a little thing to hold a claim to an old english estate and honors  no it is a very great thing to an englishman born and who need give up no higher birthright to avail himself of it answered redclyffe you will laugh at me my friend but i cannot help feeling that i a simple citizen of a republic yet with none above me except those whom i help to place thereand who are my servants not my superiors must stoop to take these honors i leave a set of institutions which are the noblest that the wit and civilization of man have yet conceived to enlist myself in one that is based on a far lower conception of man and which therefore lowers every one who shares in it besides said the young man his eyes kindling with the ambition which had been so active a principle in his life what prospectswhat rewards for spirited exertionwhat a career only open to an american would i give up to become merely a rich and idle englishman belonging as i should nowhere without a possibility of struggle such as a strong man loves with only a mockery of a title which in these days really means nothinghardly more than one of our own honorables what has any success in english life to offer even were it within my reach which as a stranger it would not be to balance the proud career of an american statesman  true you might be a president i suppose said the warden rather contemptuouslya four years potentate it seems to me an office about on a par with that of the lord mayor of london for my part i would rather be a baron of three or four hundred years antiquity  we talk in vain said redclyffe laughing we do not approach one anothers ideas on this subject but waiving all speculations as to my attempting to avail myself of this claim do you think i can fairly accept this invitation to visit lord braithwaite there is certainly a possibility that i may arraign myself against his dearest interests conscious of this can i accept his hospitality  the warden paused you have not sought access to his house he observed you have no designs it seems no settled designs at all events against his lordshipnor is there a probability that they would be forwarded by your accepting this invitation even if you had any i do not see but you may go the only danger is that his lordships engaging qualities may seduce you into dropping your claims out of a chivalrous feeling which i see is among your possibilities to be sure it would be more satisfactory if he knew your actual position and should then renew his invitation  i am convinced said redclyffe looking up from his musing posture that he does know them you are surprised but in all lord braithwaites manner towards me there has been an undefinable something that makes me aware that he knows on what terms we stand towards each other there is nothing inconceivable in this the family have for generations been suspicious of an american line and have more than once sent messengers to try to search out and put a stop to the apprehension why should it not have come to their knowledge that there was a person with such claims and that he is now in england  it certainly is possible replied the warden and if you are satisfied that his lordship knows it or even suspects it you meet him on fair ground but i fairly tell you my good friend thathis lordship being a man of unknown principles of honor outlandish and an italian in habit and moral sensei scarcely like to trust you in his house he being aware that your existence may be inimical to him my humble board is the safer of the two  pshaw said redclyffe you englishmen are so suspicious of anybody not regularly belonging to yourselves poison and the dagger haunt your conceptions of all others in america you think we kill every third man with the bowieknife but supposing there were any grounds for your suspicion i would still encounter it an american is no braver than an englishman but still he is not quite so chary of his life as the latter who never risks it except on the most imminent necessity we take such matters easy in regard to this invitation i feel that i can honorably accept it and there are many idle and curious motives that impel me to it i will go  be it so but you must come back to me for another week after finishing your visit said the warden after all it was an idle fancy in me that there could be any danger his lordship has good english blood in his veins and it would take oceans and rivers of italian treachery to wash out the sterling quality of it and my good friend as to these claims of yours i would not have you trust too much to what is probably a romantic dream yet were the dream to come true i should think the british peerage honored by such an accession to its ranks and now to bed for we have heard the chimes of midnight two hours agone  they accordingly retired and redclyffe was surprised to find what a distinctness his ideas respecting his claim to the braithwaite honors had assumed now that he after so many years had imparted them to another heretofore though his imagination had played with them so much they seemed the veriest dreams now they had suddenly taken form and hardened into substance and he became aware in spite of all the lofty and patriotic sentiments which he had expressed to the warden that these prospects had really much importance in his mind  redclyffe during the few days that he was to spend at the hospital previous to his visit to braithwaite hall was conscious of a restlessness such as we have all felt on the eve of some interesting event he wondered at himself at being so much wrought up by so simple a thing as he was about to do but it seemed to him like a coming home after an absence of centuries it was like an actual prospect of entrance into a castle in the airthe shadowy threshold of which should assume substance enough to bear his foot its thin fantastic walls actually protect him from sun and rain its hall echo with his footsteps its hearth warm him that delicious thrilling uncertainty between reality and fancy in which he had often been enwrapt since his arrival in this region enveloped him more strongly than ever and with it too there came a sort of apprehension which sometimes shuddered through him like an icy draught or the touch of cold steel to his heart he was ashamed too to be conscious of anything like fear yet he would not acknowledge it for fear and indeed there was such an airy exhilarating thrilling pleasure bound up with it that it could not really be so  it was in this state of mind that a day or two after the feast he saw colcord sitting on the bench before the portal of the hospital in the sun whichseptember though it wasstill came warm and bright for english sunshine into that sheltered spot a spot where many generations of old men had warmed their limbs while they looked down into the life the torpid life of the old village that trailed its homely yet picturesque street along by the venerable buildings of the hospital  my good friend said redclyffe i am about leaving you for a time indeed with the limited time at my disposal it is possible that i may not be able to come back hither except for a brief visit before i leave you i would fain know something more about one whom i must ever consider my benefactor  yes said the old man with his usual benignant quiet i saved your life it is yet to be seen perhaps whether thereby i made myself your benefactor i trust so  i feel it so at least answered redclyffe and i assure you life has a new value for me since i came to this place for i have a deeper hold upon it as it weremore hope from it more trust in something good to come of it  this is a good changeor should be so quoth the old man  do you know continued redclyffe how long you have been a figure in my life  i know it said colcord though you might well have forgotten it  not so said redclyffe i remember as if it were this morning that time in new england when i first saw you  the man with whom you then abode said colcord knew who i was  and he being dead and finding you here now by such a strange coincidence said redclyffe and being myself a man capable of taking your counsel i would have you impart it to me for i assure you that the current of my life runs darkly on and i would be glad of any light on its future or even its present phase  i am not one of those from whom the world waits for counsel said the pensioner and i know not that mine would be advantageous to you in the light which men usually prize yet if i were to give any it would be that you should be gone hence  gone hence repeated redclyffe surprised i tell youwhat i have hardly hitherto told to myselfthat all my dreams all my wishes hitherto have looked forward to precisely the juncture that seems now to be approaching my dreaming childhood dreamt of this if you know anything of me you know how i sprung out of mystery akin to none a thing concocted out of the elements without visible agency how all through my boyhood i was alone how i grew up without a root yet continually longing for onelonging to be connected with somebody and never feeling myself so yet there was ever a looking forward to this time at which i now find myself if my next step were death yet while the path seemed to lead toward a certainty of establishing me in connection with my race i would take it i have tried to keep down this yearning to stifle it annihilate it by making a position for myself by being my own fact but i cannot overcome the natural horror of being a creature floating in the air attached to nothing ever this feeling that there is no reality in the life and fortunes good or bad of a being so unconnected there is not even a grave not a heap of dry bones not a pinch of dust with which i can claim kindred unless i find it here  this is sad said the old manthis strong yearning and nothing to gratify it yet i warn you do not seek its gratification here there are delusions snares pitfalls in this life i warn you quit the search  no said redclyffe i will follow the mysterious clue that seems to lead me on and even now it pulls me one step further  how is that asked the old man  it leads me onward even as far as the thresholdacross the threshold of yonder mansion said redclyffe  step not across it there is blood on that threshold exclaimed the pensioner a bloody footstep emerging take heed that there be not as bloody a one entering in  pshaw said redclyffe feeling the ridicule of the emotion into which he had been betrayed as the old mans wildness of demeanor made him feel that he was talking with a monomaniac we are talking idly i do but go in the common intercourse of society to see the old english residence which such is the unhappy obscurity of my position i fancy among a thousand others may have been that of my ancestors nothing is likely to come of it my foot is not bloody nor polluted with anything except the mud of the damp english soil  yet go not in persisted the old man  yes i must go said redclyffe determinedly and i will  ashamed to have been moved to such idle utterances by anything that the old man could say redclyffe turned away though he still heard the sad halfuttered remonstrance of the old man like a moan behind him and wondered what strange fancy had taken possession of him  the effect which this opposition had upon him made him the more aware how much his heart was set upon this visit to the hall how much he had counted upon being domiciliated there what a wrench it would be to him to tear himself away without going into that mansion and penetrating all the mysteries wherewith his imagination exercising itself upon the theme since the days of the old doctors fireside talk had invested it in his agitation he wandered forth from the hospital and passing through the village street found himself in the park of braithwaite hall where he wandered for a space until his steps led him to a point whence the venerable hall appeared with its limes and its oaks around it its look of peace and aged repose and loveliness its stately domesticity so ancient so beautiful its mild sweet simplicity it seemed the ideal of home the thought thrilled his bosom that this was his homethe home of the wild western wanderer who had gone away centuries ago and encountered strange chances and almost forgotten his origin but still kept a clue to bring him back and had now come back and found all the original emotions safe within him it even seemed to him that by his kindred with those who had gone beforeby the line of sensitive blood linking him with that final emigranthe could remember all these objectsthat tree hardly more venerable now than then that clocktower still marking the elapsing time that spire of the old church raising itself beyond he spread out his arms in a kind of rapture and exclaimed  o home my home my forefathers home i have come back to thee the wanderer has come back  there was a slight stir near him and on a mossy seat that was arranged to take advantage of a remarkably good point of view of the old hall he saw elsie sitting she had her drawingmaterials with her and had probably been taking a sketch redclyffe was ashamed of having been overheard by any one giving way to such idle passion as he had been betrayed into and yet in another sense he was gladglad at least that something of his feeling as yet unspoken to human being was shared and shared by her with whom alone of living beings he had any sympathies of old date and whom he often thought of with feelings that drew him irresistibly towards her  elsie said he uttering for the first time the old name providence makes you my confidant we have recognized each other though no word has passed between us let us speak now again with one another how came you hither what has brought us together againaway with this strangeness that lurks between us let us meet as those who began life together and whose lifestrings being so early twisted in unison cannot now be torn apart  you are not wise said elsie in a faltering voice to break the restraint we have tacitly imposed upon ourselves do not let us speak further on this subject  how strangely everything evades me exclaimed redclyffe i seem to be in a land of enchantment where i can get hold of nothing that lends me a firm support there is no medium in my life between the most vulgar realities and the most vaporous fiction too thin to breathe tell me elsie how came you here why do you not meet me frankly what is there to keep you apart from the oldest friend i am bold to say you have on earth are you an english girl are you one of our own new england maidens with her freedom and her knowhow and her force beyond anything that these demure and decorous damsels can know  this is wild said elsie straggling for composure yet strongly moved by the recollections that he brought up it is best that we should meet as strangers and so part  no said redclyffe the long past comes up with its memories and yet it is not so powerful as the powerful present we have met again our adventures have shown that providence has designed a relation in my fate to yours elsie are you lonely as i am  no she replied i have bonds ties a life a duty i must live that life and do that duty you have likewise both do yours lead your own life like me  do you know elsie he said whither that life is now tending  whither said she turning towards him  to yonder hall said he  she started up and clasped her hands about his arm  no no she exclaimed go not thither there is blood upon the threshold return a dreadful fatality awaits you here  come with me then said he and i yield my purpose  it cannot be said elsie  then i too tell you it cannot be returned redclyffe endnote 2  the dialogue had reached this point when there came a step along the woodpath the branches rustled and there was lord braithwaite looking upon the pair with the ordinary slightly sarcastic glance with which he gazed upon the world  a fine morning fair lady and fair sir said he we have few such except in italy     chapter xxi   so redclyffe left the hospital where he had spent many weeks of strange and not unhappy life and went to accept the invitation of the lord of braithwaite hall it was with a thrill of strange delight poignant almost to pain that he found himself driving up to the door of the hall and actually passing the threshold of the house he looked as he stept over it for the bloody footstep with which the house had so long been associated in his imagination but could nowhere see it the footman ushered him into a hall which seemed to be in the centre of the building and where little as the autumn was advanced a fire was nevertheless burning and glowing on the hearth nor was its effect undesirable in the somewhat gloomy room the servants had evidently received orders respecting the guest for they ushered him at once to his chamber which seemed not to be one of those bachelors rooms where in an english mansion young and single men are forced to be entertained with very bare and straitened accommodations but a large well though antiquely and solemnly furnished room with a curtained bed and all manner of elaborate contrivances for repose but the deep embrasures of the windows made it gloomy with the little light that they admitted through their small panes there must have been english attendance in this department of the household arrangements at least for nothing could exceed the exquisite nicety and finish of everything in the room the cleanliness the attention to comfort amid antique aspects of furniture the rich deep preparations for repose  the servant told redclyffe that his master had ridden out and adding that luncheon would be on the table at two oclock left him and redclyffe sat some time trying to make out and distinguish the feelings with which he found himself here and realizing a lifelong dream he ran back over all the legends which the doctor used to tell about this mansion and wondered whether this old rich chamber were the one where any of them had taken place whether the shadows of the dead haunted here but indeed if this were the case the apartment must have been very much changed antique though it looked with the second or third or whatever other numbered arrangement since those old days of tapestry hangings and rushstrewed floor otherwise this stately and gloomy chamber was as likely as any other to have been the one where his ancestor appeared for the last time in the paternal mansion here he might have been the night before that mysterious bloody footstep was left on the threshold whence had arisen so many wild legends and since the impression of which nothing certain had ever been known respecting that illfated mannothing certain in england at least and whose story was left so ragged and questionable even by all that he could add  do what he could redclyffe still was not conscious of that deep home feeling which he had imagined he should experience when if ever he should come back to the old ancestral place there was strangeness a struggle within himself to get hold of something that escaped him an effort to impress on his mind the fact that he was at last established at his temporary home in the place that he had so long looked forward to and that this was the moment which he would have thought more interesting than any other in his life he was strangely cold and indifferent frozen up as it were and fancied that he would have cared little had he been to leave the mansion without so much as looking over the remaining part of it  at last he became weary of sitting and indulging this fantastic humor of indifference and emerged from his chamber with the design of finding his way about the lower part of the house the mansion had that delightful intricacy which can never be contrived never be attained by design but is the happy result of where many builders many designs many ages perhapshave concurred in a structure each pursuing his own design thus it was a house that you could go astray in as in a city and come to unexpected places but never until after much accustomance go where you wished so redclyffe although the great staircase and wide corridor by which he had been led to his room seemed easy to find yet soon discovered that he was involved in an unknown labyrinth where strange little bits of staircases led up and down and where passages promised much in letting him out but performed nothing to be sure the old english mansion had not much of the stateliness of one of mrs radcliffes castles with their suites of rooms opening one into another but yet its very domesticityits look as if long ago it had been lived inmade it only the more ghostly and so redclyffe felt the more as if he were wandering through a homely dream sensible of the ludicrousness of his position he once called aloud but his voice echoed along the passages sounding unwontedly to his ears but arousing nobody it did not seem to him as if he were going afar but were bewildered round and round within a very small compass a predicament in which a man feels very foolish usually  as he stood at an old window stonemullioned at the end of a passage into which he had come twice over a door near him opened and a personage looked out whom he had not before seen it was a face of great keenness and intelligence and not unpleasant to look at though dark and sallow the dress had something which redclyffe recognized as clerical though not exactly pertaining to the church of englanda sort of arrangement of the vest and shirtcollar and he had knee breeches of black he did not seem like an english clerical personage however for even in this little glimpse of him redclyffe saw a mildness gentleness softness and askingofleave in his manner which he had not observed in persons so well assured of their position as the church of england clergy  he seemed at once to detect redclyffes predicament and came forward with a pleasant smile speaking in good english though with a somewhat foreign accent  ah sir you have lost your way it is a labyrinthian house for its size this old english hallfull of perplexity shall i show you to any point  indeed sir said redclyffe laughing i hardly know whither i want to go being a stranger and yet knowing nothing of the public places of the house to the library perhaps if you will be good enough to direct me thither  willingly my dear sir said the clerical personage the more easily too as my own quarters are close adjacent the library being my province do me the favor to enter here  so saying the priest ushered redclyffe into an austerelooking yet exceedingly neat study as it seemed on one side of which was an oratory with a crucifix and other accommodations for catholic devotion behind a white curtain there were glimpses of a bed which seemed arranged on a principle of conventual austerity in respect to limits and lack of softness but still there was in the whole austerity of the premises a certain character of restraint poise principle which redclyffe liked a table was covered with books many of them folios in an antique binding of parchment and others were small thickset volumes into which antique lore was rammed and compressed through an open door opposite to the one by which he had entered there was a vista of a larger apartment with alcoves a rather dreary looking room though a little sunshine came through a window at the further end distained with colored glass  will you sit down in my little home said the courteous priest i hope we may be better acquainted so allow me to introduce myself i am father angelo domestic chaplain to his lordship you i know are the american diplomatic gentleman from whom his lordship has been expecting a visit  redclyffe bowed  i am most happy to know you continued the priest ah you have a happy country most catholic most recipient of all that is outcast on earth men of my religion must ever bless it  it certainly ought to be remembered to our credit replied redclyffe that we have shown no narrow spirit in this matter and have not like other protestant countries rejected the good that is found in any man on account of his religious faith american statesmanship comprises jew catholic all  after this pleasant little acknowledgment there ensued a conversation having some reference to books for though redclyffe of late years had known little of what deserves to be called literaturehaving found political life as much estranged from it as it is apt to be with politiciansyet he had early snuffed the musty fragrance of the doctors books and had learned to love its atmosphere at the time he left college he was just at the point where he might have been a scholar but the active tendencies of american life had interfered with him as with thousands of others and drawn him away from pursuits which might have been better adapted to some of his characteristics than the one he had adopted the priest gently felt and touched around his pursuits and finding some remains of classic culture he kept up a conversation on these points showing him the possessions of the library in that department where indeed were some treasures that he had discovered and which seemed to have been collected at least a century ago  generally however observed he as they passed from one dark alcove to another the library is of little worth except to show how much of living truth each generation contributes to the botheration of life and what a public benefactor a bookworm is after all there now did you ever happen to see one here is one that i have watched at work some time past and have not thought it worth while to stop him  redclyffe looked at the learned little insect who was eating a strange sort of circular trench into an old book of scholastic latin which probably only he had ever devouredat least ever found to his taste the insect seemed in excellent condition fat with learning having doubtless got the essence of the book into himself but redclyffe was still more interested in observing in the corner a great spider which really startled himnot so much for its own terrible aspect though that was monstrous as because he seemed to see in it the very great spider which he had known in his boyhood that same monster that had been the doctors familiar and had been said to have had an influence in his death he looked so startled that father angelo observed it  do not be frightened said he though i allow that a brave man may well be afraid of a spider and that the bravest of the brave need not blush to shudder at this one there is a great mystery about this spider no one knows whence he came nor how long he has been here the library was very much shut up during the time of the last inheritor of the estate and had not been thoroughly examined for some years when i opened it and swept some of the dust away from its old alcoves i myself was not aware of this monster until the lapse of some weeks when i was startled at seeing him one day as i was reading an old book here he dangled down from the ceiling by the cordage of his web and positively seemed to look into my face  he is of the species condetas said redclyffea rare spider seldom seen out of the tropic regions  you are learned then in spiders observed the priest surprised  i could almost make oath at least that i have known this ugly specimen of his race observed redclyffe a very dear friend now deceased to whom i owed the highest obligations was studious of spiders and his chief treasure was one the very image of this  how strange said the priest there has always appeared to me to be something uncanny in spiders i should be glad to talk further with you on this subject several times i have fancied a strange intelligence in this monster but i have natural horror of him and therefore refrain from interviews  you do wisely sir said redclyffe his powers and purposes are questionably beneficent at best  in truth the manylegged monster made the old library ghostly to him by the associations which it summoned up and by the idea that it was really the identical one that had seemed so stuffed with poison in the lifetime of the doctor and at that so distant spot yet on reflection it appeared not so strange for the old doctors spider as he had heard him say was one of an ancestral race that he had brought from beyond the sea they might have been preserved for ages possibly in this old library whence the doctor had perhaps taken his specimen and possibly the one now before him was the sole survivor it hardly however made the monster any the less hideous to suppose that this might be the case and to fancy the poison of old times condensed into this animal who might have sucked the diseases moral and physical of all this family into him and to have made himself their demon he questioned with himself whether it might not be well to crush him at once and so perhaps do away with the evil of which he was the emblem  i felt a strange disposition to crush this monster at first remarked the priest as if he knew what redclyffe was thinking ofa feeling that in so doing i should get rid of a mischief but then he is such a curious monster you cannot long look at him without coming to the conclusion that he is indestructible  yes and to think of crushing such a deepbowelled monster said redclyffe shuddering it is too great a catastrophe  during this conversation in which he was so deeply concerned the spider withdrew himself and hand over hand ascended to a remote and dusky corner where was his hereditary abode  shall i be likely to meet lord braithwaite here in the library asked redclyffe when the fiend had withdrawn himself i have not yet seen him since my arrival  i trust said the priest with great courtesy that you are aware of some peculiarities in his lordships habits which imply nothing in detriment to the great respect which he pays all his few guests and which i know he is especially desirous to pay to you i think that we shall meet him at lunch which though an english institution his lordship has adopted very readily  i should hope said redclyffe willing to know how far he might be expected to comply with the peculiaritieswhich might prove to be eccentricitiesof his host that my presence here will not be too greatly at variance with his lordships habits whatever they may be i came hither indeed on the pledge that as my host would not stand in my way so neither would i in his  that is the true principle said the priest and here comes his lordship in person to begin the practice of it     chapter xxii   lord braithwaite came into the principal door of the library as the priest was speaking and stood a moment just upon the threshold looking keenly out of the stronger light into this dull and darksome apartment as if unable to see perfectly what was within or rather as redclyffe fancied trying to discover what was passing between those two and indeed as when a third person comes suddenly upon two who are talking of him the two generally evince in their manner some consciousness of the fact so it was in this case with redclyffe at least although the priest seemed perfectly undisturbed either through practice of concealment or because he had nothing to conceal  his lordship after a moments pause came forward presenting his hand to redclyffe who shook it and not without a certain cordiality till he perceived that it was the left hand when he probably intimated some surprise by a change of manner  i am an awkward person said his lordship the left hand however is nearest the heart so be assured i mean no discourtesy  the signor ambassador and myself observed the priest have had a most interesting conversation to me at least about books and bookworms spiders and other congruous matters and i find his excellency has heretofore made acquaintance with a great spider bearing strong resemblance to the hermit of our library  indeed said his lordship i was not aware that america had yet enough of age and old misfortune crime sordidness that accumulate with it to have produced spiders like this had he sucked into himself all the noisomeness of your heat  redclyffe made some slight answer that the spider was a sort of pet of an old virtuoso to whom he owed many obligations in his boyhood and the conversation turned from this subject to others suggested by topics of the day and place his lordship was affable and redclyffe could not it must be confessed see anything to justify the prejudices of the neighbors against him indeed he was inclined to attribute them in great measure to the narrowness of the english viewto those insular prejudices which have always prevented them from fully appreciating what differs from their own habits at lunch which was soon announced the party of three became very pleasant and sociable his lordship drinking a light italian red wine and recommending it to redclyffe who however was english enough to prefer some bitter ale while the priest contented himself with pure waterwhich is in truth a less agreeable drink in chill moist england than in any country we are acquainted with  you must make yourself quite at home here said his lordship as they rose from table i am not a good host nor a very genial man i believe i can do little to entertain you but here is the house and the grounds at your disposalhorses in the stableguns in the hallhere is father angelo good at chess there is the library pray make the most of them all and if i can contribute in any way to your pleasure let me know  all this certainly seemed cordial and the manner in which it was said seemed in accordance with the spirit of the words and yet whether the fault was in anything of morbid suspicion in redclyffes nature or whatever it was it did not have the effect of making him feel welcome which almost every englishman has the natural faculty of producing on a guest when once he has admitted him beneath his roof it might be in great measure his face so thin and refined and intellectual without feeling his voice which had melody but not heartiness his manners which were not simple by nature but by artwhatever it was redclyffe found that lord braithwaite did not call for his own naturalness and simplicity but his art and felt that he was inevitably acting a part in his intercourse with him that he was on his guard playing a game and yet he did not wish to do this but there was a mobility a subtleness in his nature an unconscious tact which the mode of life and of mixing with men in america fosters and perfectsthat made this sort of finesse inevitable to him with any but a natural character with whom on the other hand redclyffe could be as fresh and natural as any englishman of them all  redclyffe spent the time between lunch and dinner in wandering about the grounds from which he had hitherto felt himself debarred by motives of delicacy it was a most interesting ramble to him coming to trees which his ancestor who went to america might have climbed in his boyhood might have sat beneath with his ladylove in his youth deer there were the descendants of those which he had seen old stone stiles which his foot had trodden the sombre clouded light of the day fell down upon this scene which in its verdure its luxuriance of vegetable life was purely english cultivated to the last extent without losing the nature out of a single thing in the course of his walk he came to the spot where he had been so mysteriously wounded on his first arrival in this region and examining the spot he was startled to see that there was a path leading to the other side of a hedge and this path which led to the house had brought him here  musing upon this mysterious circumstance and how it should have happened in so orderly a country as england so tamed and subjected to civilizationan incident to happen in an english park which seemed better suited to the indianhaunted forests of the wilder parts of his own landand how no researches which the warden had instituted had served in the smallest degree to develop the mysteryhe clambered over the hedge and followed the footpath it plunged into dells and emerged from them led through scenes which seemed those of old romances and at last by these devious ways began to approach the old house which with its many gray gables put on a new aspect from this point of view redclyffe admired its venerableness anew the ivy that overran parts of it the marks of age and wondered at the firmness of the institutions which through all the changes that come to man could have kept this house the home of one lineal race for so many centuries so many that the absence of his own branch from it seemed but a temporary visit to foreign parts from which he was now returned to be again at home by the old hearthstone  but what do i mean to do said he to himself stopping short and still looking at the old house am i ready to give up all the actual life before me for the sake of taking up with what i feel to be a less developed state of human life would it not be better for me to depart now to turn my back on this flattering prospect i am not fit to be herei so strongly susceptible of a newer more stirring life than these men lead i who feel that whatever the thought and cultivation of england may be my own countrymen have gone forward a long long march beyond them not intellectually but in a way that gives them a further start if i come back hither with the purpose to make myself an englishman especially an englishman of rank and hereditary estate then for me america has been discovered in vain and the great spirit that has been breathed into us is in vain and i am false to it all  but again came silently swelling over him like a flood all that ancient peace and quietude and dignity which looked so stately and beautiful as brooding round the old house all that blessed order of ranks that sweet superiority and yet with no disclaimer of common brotherhood that existed between the english gentleman and his inferiors all that delightful intercourse so sure of pleasure so safe from rudeness lowness unpleasant rubs that exists between gentleman and gentleman where in public affairs all are essentially of one mind or seem so to an american politician accustomed to the fierce conflicts of our embittered parties where life was made so enticing so refined and yet with a sort of homeliness that seemed to show that all its strength was left behind that seeming taking in of all that was desirable in life and all its grace and beauty yet never giving life a hard enamel of overrefinement what could there be in the wild harsh ill conducted american approach to civilization which could compare with this what to compare with this juiciness and richness what other men had ever got so much out of life as the polished and wealthy englishmen of today what higher part was to be acted than seemed to lie before him if he willed to accept it  he resumed his walk and drawing near the manorhouse found that he was approaching another entrance than that which had at first admitted him a very pleasant entrance it was beneath a porch of antique form and ivyclad hospitable and inviting and it being the approach from the grounds it seemed to be more appropriate to the residents of the house than the other one drawing near redclyffe saw that a flight of steps ascended within the porch oldlooking much worn and nothing is more suggestive of long time than a flight of worn steps it must have taken so many soles through so many years to make an impression judging from the make of the outside of the edifice redclyffe thought that he could make out the way from the porch to the hall and library so he determined to enter this way  there had been as was not unusual a little shower of rain during the afternoon and as redclyffe came close to the steps they were glistening with the wet the stones were whitish like marble and one of them bore on it a token that made him pause while a thrill like terror ran through his system for it was the mark of a footstep very decidedly made out and red like bloodthe bloody footstepthe mark of a foot which seemed to have been slightly impressed into the rock as if it had been a soft substance at the same time sliding a little and gushing with blood the glistening moisture of which we have spoken made it appear as if it were just freshly stamped there and it suggested to redclyffes fancy the idea that impressed more than two centuries ago there was some charm connected with the mark which kept it still fresh and would continue to do so to the end of time it was well that there was no spectator therefor the american would have blushed to have it known how much this old traditionary wonder had affected his imagination but indeed it was as old as any bugbear of his mindas any of those bugbears and private terrors which grow up with people and make the dreams and nightmares of childhood and the feverimages of mature years till they haunt the deliriums of the dying bed and after that possibly are either realized or known no more the doctors strange story vividly recurred to him and all the horrors which he had since associated with this trace and it seemed to him as if he had now struck upon a bloody track and as if there were other tracks of this supernatural foot which he was bound to search out removing the dust of ages that had settled on them the moss and deep grass that had grown over them the forest leaves that might have fallen on them in americamarking out the pathway till the pedestrian lay down in his grave  the foot was issuing from not entering into the house whoever had impressed it or on whatever occasion he had gone forth and doubtless to return no more redclyffe was impelled to place his own foot on the track and the action as it were suggested in itself strange ideas of what had been the state of mind of the man who planted it there and he felt a strange vague yet strong surmise of some agony some terror and horror that had passed here and would not fade out of the spot while he was in these musings he saw lord braithwaite looking at him through the glass of the porch with fixed curious eyes and a smile on his face on perceiving that redclyffe was aware of his presence he came forth without appearing in the least disturbed  what think you of the bloody footstep asked he  it seems to me undoubtedly said redclyffe stooping to examine it more closely a good thing to make a legend out of and like most legendary lore not capable of bearing close examination i should decidedly say that the bloody footstep is a natural reddish stain in the stone  do you think so indeed rejoined his lordship it may be but in that case if not the record of an actual deedof a foot stamped down there in guilt and agony and oozing out with unwipeupable bloodwe may consider it as propheticas foreboding from the time when the stone was squared and smoothed and laid at this threshold that a fatal footstep was really to be impressed here  it is an ingenious supposition said redclyffe but is there any sure knowledge that the prophecy you suppose has yet been fulfilled  if not it might yet be in the future said lord braithwaite but i think there are enough in the records of this family to prove that there did one cross this threshold in a bloody agony who has since returned no more great seekings i have understood have been had throughout the world for him or for any sign of him but nothing satisfactory has been heard  and it is now too late to expect it observed the american  perhaps not replied the nobleman with a glance that redclyffe thought had peculiar meaning in it ah it is very curious to see what turnings up there are in this world of old circumstances that seem buried forever how things come back like echoes that have rolled away among the hills and been seemingly hushed forever we cannot tell when a thing is really dead it comes to life perhaps in its old shape perhaps in a new and unexpected one so that nothing really vanishes out of the world i wish it did  the conversation now ceased and redclyffe entered the house where he amused himself for some time in looking at the ancient hall with its gallery its armor and its antique fireplace on the hearth of which burned a genial fire he wondered whether in that fire was the continuance of that custom which the doctors legend spoke of and that the flame had been kept up there two hundred years in expectation of the wanderers return it might be so although the climate of england made it a natural custom enough in a large and damp old room into which many doors opened both from the exterior and interior of the mansion but it was pleasant to think the custom a traditionary one and to fancy that a booted figure enveloped in a cloak might still arrive and fling open the veiling cloak throw off the sombre and droopingbrimmed hat and show features that were similar to those seen in pictured faces on the walls was he himselfin another guise as lord braithwaite had been sayingthat longexpected one was his the echoing tread that had been heard so long through the agesso far through the wide worldapproaching the bloodstained threshold  with such thoughts or dreams for they were hardly sincerely enough entertained to be called thoughts redclyffe spent the day a strange delicious day in spite of the sombre shadows that enveloped it he fancied himself strangely wonted already to the house as if his every part and peculiarity had at once fitted into its nooks and corners and crannies but indeed his mobile nature and active fancy were not entirely to be trusted in this matter it was perhaps his american faculty of making himself at home anywhere that he mistook for the feeling of being peculiarly at home here     chapter xxiii   redclyffe was now established in the great house which had been so long and so singularly an object of interest with him with his customary impressibility by the influences around him he begun to take in the circumstances and to understand them by more subtile tokens than he could well explain to himself there was the steward endnote 1 or whatever was his precise office so quiet so subdued so nervous so strange what had been this mans history what was now the secret of his daily life there he was creeping stealthily up and down the staircases and about the passages of the house always as if he were afraid of meeting somebody on seeing redclyffe in the house the latter fancied that the man expressed a kind of interest in his face but whether pleasure or pain he could not well tell only he sometimes found that he was contemplating him from a distance or from the obscurity of the room in which he sator from a corridor while he smoked his cigar on the lawn a great part if not the whole of this he imputed to his knowledge of redclyffes connections with the doctor but yet this hardly seemed sufficient to account for the pertinacity with which the old man haunted his footstepsthe poor nervous old thingalways near him or often unexpectedly so and yet apparently not very willing to hold conversation with him having nothing of importance to say  mr omskirk said redclyffe to him a day or two after the commencement of his visit how many years have you now been in this situation  0 sir ever since the doctors departure for america said omskirk now thirty and five years five months and three days  a long time said redclyffe smiling and you seem to keep the account of it very accurately  a very long time your honor said omskirk so long that i seem to have lived one life before it began and i cannot think of any life than just what i had my life was broken off short in the midst and what belonged to the earlier part of it was another mans life this is mine  it might be a pleasant life enough i should think in this fine old hall said redclyffe rather monotonous however would you not like a relaxation of a few days a pleasure trip in all these thirtyfive years you old englishmen are so sturdily faithful to one thing you do not resemble my countrymen in that  0 none of them ever lived in an old mansionhouse like this replied omskirk they do not know the sort of habits that a man gets here they do not know my business either nor any mans here  is your master then so difficult said redclyffe  my master who was speaking of him said the old man as if surprised ah i was thinking of dr grimshawe he was my master you know  and redclyffe was again inconceivably struck with the strength of the impression that was made on the poor old mans mind by the character of the old doctor so that after thirty years of other service he still felt him to be the master and could not in the least release himself from those earlier bonds he remembered a story that the doctor used to tell of his once recovering a hanged person and more and more came to the conclusion that this was the man and that as the doctor had said this hold of a strong mind over a weak one strengthened by the idea that he had made him had subjected the man to him in a kind of slavery that embraced the soul  and then again the lord of the estate interested him greatly and not unpleasantly he compared what he seemed to be now with what according to all reports he had been in the past and could make nothing of it nor reconcile the two characters in the least it seemed as if the estate were possessed by a devila foul and melancholy fiendwho resented the attempted possession of others by subjecting them to himself one had turned from quiet and sober habits to reckless dissipation another had turned from the usual gayety of life to recluse habits and both apparently by the same influence at least so it appeared to redclyffe as he insulated their story from all other circumstances and looked at them by one light he even thought that he felt a similar influence coming over himself even in this little time that he had spent here gradually should this be his permanent residenceand not so very gradually eitherthere would come its own individual mode of change over him that quick suggestive mind would gather the moss and lichens of decay palsy of its powers would probably be the form it would assume he looked back through the vanished years to the time which he had spent with the old doctor and he felt unaccountably as if the mysterious old man were yet ruling him as he did in his boyhood as if his inscrutable inevitable eye were upon him in all his movements nay as if he had guided every step that he took in coming hither and were stalking mistily before him leading him about he sometimes would gladly have given up all these wild and enticing prospects these dreams that had occupied him so long if he could only have gone away and looked back upon the house its inmates and his own recollections no more but there came a fate and took the shape of the old doctors apparition holding him back  and then too the thought of elsie had much influence in keeping him quietly here her natural sunshine was the one thing that just now seemed to have a good influence upon the world she too was evidently connected with this place and with the fate whatever it might be that awaited him here the doctor the ruler of his destiny had provided her as well as all the rest and from his grave or wherever he was he still seemed to bring them together  so here in this darkened dream he waited for what should come to pass and daily when he sat down in the dark old library it was with the thought that this day might bring to a close the doubt amid which he livedmight give him the impetus to go forward in such a state no doubt the witchcraft of the place was really to be recognized the old witchcraft too of the doctor which he had escaped by the quick ebullition of youthful spirit long ago while the doctor lived but which had been stored up till now till an influence that remained latent for years had worked out in active disease he held himself open for intercourse with the lord of the mansion and intercourse of a certain nature they certainly had but not of the kind which redclyffe desired they talked together of politics of the state of the relations between england and america of the court to which redclyffe was accredited sometimes redclyffe tried to lead the conversation to the family topics nor in truth did lord braithwaite seem to decline his lead although it was observable that very speedily the conversation would be found turned upon some other subject to which it had swerved aside by subtle underhand movements yet redclyffe was not the less determined and at no distant period to bring up the subject on which his mind dwelt so much and have it fairly discussed between them  he was sometimes a little frightened at the position and circumstances in which he found himself a great disturbance there was in his being the causes of which he could not trace it had an influence on his dreams through which the doctor seemed to pass continually and when he awoke it was often with the sensation that he had just the moment before been holding conversation with the old man and that the latter with that gesture of power that he remembered so wellhad been impressing some command upon him but what that command was he could not possibly call to mind he wandered among the dark passages of the house and up its antique staircases as if expecting at every turn to meet some one who would have the word of destiny to say to him when he went forth into the park it was as if to hold an appointment with one who had promised to meet him there and he came slowly back lingering and loitering because this expected one had not yet made himself visible yet plucked up a little alacrity as he drew near the house because the communicant might have arrived in his absence and be waiting for him in the dim library it seemed as if he was under a spell he could neither go away nor restnothing but dreams troubled dreams he had ghostly fears as if some one were near him whom he could not make out stealing behind him and starting away when he was impelled to turn round a nervousness that his healthy temperament had never before permitted him to be the victim of assailed him now he could not help imputing it partly to the influence of the generations who had left a portion of their individual human nature in the house which had become magnetic by them and could not rid itself of their presence in one sense though in another they had borne it as far off as to where the gray tower of the village church rose above their remains  again he was frightened to perceive what a hold the place was getting upon him how the tendrils of the ivy seemed to hold him and would not let him go how natural and homelike grim and sombre as they were the old doorways and apartments were becoming how in no place that he had ever known had he had such a homelike feeling to be sure poor fellow he had no earlier home except the almshouse where his recollection of a fireside crowded by grim old women and pale sickly children of course never allowed him to have the reminiscences of a private domestic home but then there was the doctors home by the graveyard and little elsie his constant playmate no even those recollections did not hold him like this heavy present circumstance how should he ever draw himself away no the proud and vivid and active prospects that had heretofore spread themselves before himthe striving to conquer the struggle the victory the defeat if such it was to bethe experiences for good or illthe life life life all possibility of these was passing from him all that hearty earnest contest or communion of man with man and leaving him nothing but this great sombre shade this brooding of the old family mansion with its dreary ancestral hall its mouldy dignity its life of the past its fettering honor which to accept must bind him hand and foot as respects all effort such as he had trained himself forsuch as his own country offered it was not any value for theseas it seemed to redclyffebut a witchcraft an indefinable spell a something that he could not define that enthralled him and was now doing a work on him analogous to though different from that which was wrought on omskirk and all the other inhabitants high and low of this old mansion  he felt greatly interested in the master of the mansion although perhaps it was not from anything in his nature but partly because he conceived that he himself had a controlling power over his fortunes and likewise from the vague perception of this beforementioned trouble in him it seemed whatever it might be to have converted an ordinary superficial man of the world into a being that felt and suffered inwardly had pangs fears a conscience a sense of unseen things it seemed as if underneath this manorhouse were the entrance to the cave of trophonius one visit to which made a man sad forever after and that lord braithwaite had been there once or perhaps went nightly or at any hour or the mansion itself was like darkcolored experience the reality the point of view where things were seen in their true lights the true world all outside of which was delusion and here dreamlike as its structures seemedthe absolute truth all those that lived in it were getting to be a brotherhood and he among them and perhaps before the bloodstained threshold would grow up an impassable barrier which would cause himself to sit down in dreary quiet like the rest of them  redclyffe as has been intimated had an unavowedunavowed to himself suspicion that the master of the house cherished no kindly purpose towards him he had an indistinct feeling of danger from him he would not have been surprised to know that he was concocting a plot against his life and yet he did not think that lord braithwaite had the slightest hostility towards him it might make the thing more horrible perhaps but it has been often seen in those who poison for the sake of interest without feelings of personal malevolence that they do it as kindly as the nature of the thing will permit they possibly may even have a certain degree of affection for their victims enough to induce them to make the last hours of life sweet and pleasant to wind up the fever of life with a double supply of enjoyable throbs to sweeten and delicately flavor the cup of death that they offer to the lips of him whose life is inconsistent with some stated necessity of their own dear friend such a one might say to the friend whom he reluctantly condemned to death think not that there is any base malice any desire of pain to thee that actuates me in this thing heaven knows i earnestly wish thy good but i have well considered the mattermore deeply than thou hastand have found that it is essential that one thing should be and essential to that thing that thou my friend shouldst die is that a doom which even thou wouldst object to with such an end to be answered thou art innocent thou art not a man of evil life the worst thing that can come of it so far as thou art concerned would be a quiet endless repose in yonder churchyard among dust of thy ancestry with the english violets growing over thee there and the green sweet grass which thou wilt not scorn to associate with thy dissolving elements remembering that thy forefather owed a debt for his own birth and growth to this english soil and paid it not consigned himself to that rough soil of another clime under the forest leaves pay it dear friend without repining and leave me to battle a little longer with this troublesome world and in a few years to rejoin thee and talk quietly over this matter which we are now arranging how slight a favor then for one friend to do another will seem this that i seek of thee  redclyffe smiled to himself as he thus gave expression to what he really half fancied were lord braithwaites feelings and purposes towards him and he felt them in the kindness and sweetness of his demeanor and his evident wish to make him happy combined with his own subtile suspicion of some design with which he had been invited here or which had grown up since he came  whoever has read italian history must have seen such instances of this poisoning without malice or personal illfeeling  his own pleasant companionable perhaps noble traits and qualities may have made a favorable impression on lord braithwaite and perhaps he regretted the necessity of acting as he was about to do but could not therefore weakly relinquish his deliberately formed design and on his part redclyffe bore no malice towards lord braithwaite but felt really a kindly interest in him and could he have made him happy at any less cost than his own life or dearest interests would perhaps have been glad to do so he sometimes felt inclined to remonstrate with him in a friendly way to tell him that his intended course was not likely to lead to a good result that they had better try to arrange the matter on some other basis and perhaps he would not find the american so unreasonable as he supposed  all this it will be understood were the mere dreamy suppositions of redclyffe in the idleness and languor of the old mansion letting his mind run at will and following it into dim caves whither it tended he did not actually believe anything of all this unless it be a lawyer or a policeman or some very vulgar natural order of mind no man really suspects another of crime it is the hardest thing in the world for a noble naturethe hardest and the most shockingto be convinced that a fellowbeing is going to do a wrong thing and the consciousness of ones own inviolability renders it still more difficult to believe that ones self is to be the object of the wrong what he had been fancying looked to him like a romance the strange part of the matter was what suggested such a romance in regard to his kind and hospitable host who seemed to exercise the hospitality of england with a kind of refinement and pleasant piquancy that came from his italian mixture of blood was there no spiritual whisper here  so the time wore on and redclyffe began to be sensible that he must soon decide upon the course that he was to take for his diplomatic position waited for him and he could not loiter many days more away in this half delicious half painful reverie and quiet in the midst of his struggling life he was yet as undetermined what to do as ever or if we may come down to the truth he was perhaps loath to acknowledge to himself the determination that he had actually formed  one day at dinner which now came on after candlelight he and lord braithwaite sat together at table as usual while omskirk waited at the sideboard it was a wild gusty night in which an autumnal breeze of later autumn seemed to have gone astray and come into september intrusively the two friendsfor such we may call themhad spent a pleasant day together wandering in the grounds looking at the old house at all points going to the church and examining the cross legged stone statues they had ridden too and taken a great deal of healthful exercise and had now that pleasant sense of just weariness enough which it is the boon of the climate of england to incite and permit men to take redclyffe was in one of his most genial moods and lord braithwaite seemed to be the same so kindly they were both disposed to one another that the american felt that he might not longer refrain from giving his friend some light upon the character in which he appeared or in which at least he had it at his option to appear lord braithwaite might or might not know it already but at all events it was his duty to tell him or to take his leave having thus far neither gained nor sought anything from their connection which would tend to forward his pursuitshould he decide to undertake it  when the cheerful fire the rare wine and the good fare had put them both into a good physical state redclyffe said to lord braithwaite  there is a matter upon which i have been some time intending to speak to you  braithwaite nodded  a subject continued he of interest to both of us has it ever occurred to you from the identity of name that i may be really what we have jokingly assumed me to bea relation  it has said lord braithwaite readily enough the family would be proud to acknowledge such a kinsman whose abilities and political rank would add a public lustre that it has long wanted  redclyffe bowed and smiled  you know i suppose the annals of your house he continued and have heard how two centuries ago or somewhat less there was an ancestor who mysteriously disappeared he was never seen again there were tales of private murder out of which a hundred legends have come down to these days as i have myself found though most of them in so strange a shape that i should hardly know them had i not myself a clue  i have heard some of these legends said lord braithwaite  but did you ever hear among them asked redclyffe that the lost ancestor did not really diewas not murderedbut lived long though in another hemispherelived long and left heirs behind him  there is such a legend said lord braithwaite  left posterity continued redclyffea representative of whom is alive at this day  that i have not known though i might conjecture something like it said braithwaite  the coolness with which he took this perplexed redclyffe he resolved to make trial at once whether it were possible to move him  and i have reason to believe he added that that representative is myself  should that prove to be the case you are welcome back to your own said lord braithwaite quietly it will be a very remarkable case if the proofs for two hundred years or thereabouts can be so distinctly made out as to nullify the claim of one whose descent is undoubted yet it is certainly not impossible i suppose it would hardly be fair in me to ask what are your proofs and whether i may see them  the documents are in the hands of my agents in london replied redclyffe and seem to be ample among them being a certified genealogy from the first emigrant downward without a break a declaration of two men of note among the first settlers certifying that they knew the first emigrant under a change of name to be the eldest son of the house of braithwaite full proofs at least on that head  you are a lawyer i believe said braithwaite and know better than i what may be necessary to prove your claim i will frankly own to you that i have heard long agoas long as when my connection with this hereditary property first beganthat there was supposed to be an heir extant for a long course of years and that there was no proof that that main line of the descent had ever become extinct if these things had come fairly before me and been represented to me with whatever force belongs to them before my accession to the estatethese and other facts which i have since become acquainted withi might have deliberated on the expediency of coming to such a doubtful possession the property i assure you is not so desirable that taking all things into consideration it has much increased my happiness but now here i am having paid a price in a certain waywhich you will understand if you ever come into the propertya price of a nature that cannot possibly be refunded it can hardly be presumed that i shall see your right a moment sooner than you make it manifest by law  i neither expect nor wish it replied redclyffe nor to speak frankly am i quite sure that you will ever have occasion to defend your title or to question mine when i came hither to be your guest it was almost with the settled purpose never to mention my proofs nor to seek to make them manifest that purpose is not i may say yet relinquished  yet i am to infer from your words that it is shaken said braithwaite you find the estate then so delightfulthis life of the old manorhouse so exquisitely agreeablethis air so cheering this moral atmosphere so invigoratingthat your scruples are about coming to an end you think this life of an englishman this fair prospect of a title so irresistibly enticing as to be worth more than your claim in behalf of your american birthright to a possible presidency  there was a sort of sneer in this which redclyffe did not well know how to understand and there was a look on braithwaites face as he said it that made him think of a condemned soul who should be dressed in magnificent robes and surrounded with the mockery of state splendor and happiness who if he should be congratulated on his fortunate and blissful situation would probably wear just such a look and speak in just that tone he looked a moment in braithwaites face  no he replied i do not think that there is much happiness in it a brighter healthier more useful far more satisfactory though tumultuous life would await me in my own country but there is about this place a strange deep sad brooding interest which possesses me and draws me to it and will not let me go i feel as if in spite of myself and my most earnest efforts i were fascinated by something in the spot and must needs linger here and make it my home if i can  you shall be welcome the old hereditary chair will be filled at last said braithwaite pointing to the vacant chair come we will drink to you in a cup of welcome take the old chair now  in halffrolic redclyffe took the chair  he called to omskirk to bring a bottle of a particularly exquisite italian wine known only to the most deeply skilled in the vintages of that country and which he said was oftener heard of than seen oftener seen than tasted omskirk put it on the table in its original glass and braithwaite filled redclyffes glass and his own and raised the latter to his lips with a frank expression of his mobile countenance  may you have a secure possession of your estate said he and live long in the midst of your possessions to me on the whole it seems better than your american prospects  redclyffe thanked him and drank off the glass of wine which was not very much to his taste as new varieties of wine are apt not to be all the conversation that had passed had been in a free careless sort of way without apparently much earnestness in it for they were both men who knew how to keep their more serious parts within them but redclyffe was glad that the explanation was over and that he might now remain at braithwaites table under his roof without that uneasy feeling of treachery which whether rightly or not had haunted him hitherto he felt joyous and stretched his hand out for the bottle which braithwaite kept near himself instead of passing it  you do not yourself do justice to your own favorite wine observed redclyffe seeing his hosts full glass standing before him  i have filled again said braithwaite carelessly but i know not that i shall venture to drink a second glass it is a wine that does not bear mixture with other vintages though of most genial and admirable qualities when taken by itself drink your own however for it will be a rare occasion indeed that would induce me to offer you another bottle of this rare stock  redclyffe sipped his second glass endeavoring to find out what was this subtile and peculiar flavor that hid itself so and yet seemed on the point of revealing itself it had he thought a singular effect upon his faculties quickening and making them active and causing him to feel as if he were on the point of penetrating rare mysteries such as mens thoughts are always hovering round and always returning from some strange vast sombre mysterious truth which he seemed to have searched for long appeared to be on the point of being revealed to him a sense of something to come something to happen that had been waiting long long to happen an opening of doors a drawing away of veils a lifting of heavy magnificent curtains whose dark folds hung before a spectacle of aweit was like the verge of the grave whether it was the exquisite wine of braithwaite or whatever it might be the american felt a strange influence upon him as if he were passing through the gates of eternity and finding on the other side the revelation of some secret that had greatly perplexed him on this side he thought that braithwaites face assumed a strange subtile smile not malicious yet crafty triumphant and at the same time terribly sad and with that perception his senses his life welled away and left him in the deep ancestral chair at the board of braithwaite     chapter xxiv   when awake endnote 1 or beginning to awake he lay for some time in a maze not a disagreeable one but thoughts were running to and fro in his mind all mixed and jumbled together reminiscences of early days even those that were preadamite referring we mean to those times in the almshouse which he could not at ordinary times remember at all but now there seemed to be visions of old women and men and pallid girls and little dirty boys which could only be referred to that epoch also and most vividly there was the old doctor with his sternness his fierceness his mystery and all that happened since playing phantasmagoria before his yet unclosed eyes nor so mysterious was his state did he know when he should unclose those lids where he should find himself he was content to let the world go on in this way as long as it would and therefore did not hurry but rather kept back the proofs of awakening willing to look at the scenes that were unrolling for his amusement as it seemed and willing too to keep it uncertain whether he were not back in america and in his boyhood and all other subsequent impressions a dream or a prophetic vision but at length something stirring near himor whether it stirred or whether he dreamed it he could not quite tellbut the uncertainty impelled him at last to open his eyes and see whereabouts he was  even then he continued in as much uncertainty as he was before and lay with marvellous quietude in it trying sluggishly to make the mystery out it was in a dim twilight place wherever it might be a place of halfawakeness where the outlines of things were not well defined but it seemed to be a chamber antique and vaulted narrow and high hung round with old tapestry whether it were morning or midday he could not tell such was the character of the light nor even where it came from for there appeared to be no windows and yet it was not apparently artificial light nor light at all indeed but a gray dimness it was so like his own halfawake state that he lay in it a longer time not incited to finish his awaking but in a languor not disagreeable yet hanging heavily heavily upon him like a dark pall it was in fact as if he had been asleep for years or centuries or till the last day was dawning and then was collecting his thoughts in such slow fashion as would then be likely  again that noisea little low quiet sound as of one breathing somewhere near him the whole thing was very much like that incident which introduced him to the hospital and his first coming to his senses there and he almost fancied that some such accident must again have happened to him and that when his sight cleared he should again behold the venerable figure of the pensioner with this idea he let his head steady itself and it seemed to him that its dizziness must needs be the result of very long and deep sleep what if it were the sleep of a century what if all things that were extant when he went to sleep had passed away and he was waking now in another epoch of time where was america and the republic in which he hoped for such great things where england had she stood it better than the republic was the old hospital still in beingalthough the good warden must long since have passed out of his warm and pleasant life and himself how came he to be preserved in what musty old nook had he been put away where time neglected and death forgot him until now he was to get up friendless helplesswhen new heirs had come to the estate he was on the point of laying claim toand go onward through what remained of life would it not have been better to have lived with his contemporaries and to be now dead and dust with them poor petty interests of a day how slight  again the noise a little stir a sort of quiet moan or something that he could not quite define but it seemed whenever he heard it as if some fact thrust itself through the dreamwork with which he was circumfused something alien to his fantasies yet not powerful enough to dispel them it began to be irksome to him this little sound of something near him and he thought in the space of another hundred years if it continued he should have to arouse himself and see what it was but indeed there was something so cheering in this long reposethis rest from all the troubles of earth which it sometimes seems as if only a churchyard bed would give usthat he wished the noise would let him alone but his thoughts were gradually getting too busy for this slumberous state he begun perforce to come nearer actuality the strange question occurred to him had any time at all passed was he not still sitting at lord braithwaites table having just now quaffed a second glass of that rare and curious italian wine was it not affecting his head very strangelyso that he was put out of time as it were he would rally himself and try to set his head right with another glass he must be still at table for now he remembered he had not gone to bed at all endnote 2  ah the noise he could not bear it he would awake now nowsilence it and then to sleep again in fact he started up started to his feet in puzzle and perplexity and stood gazing around him with swimming brain it was an antique room which he did not at all recognize and indeed in that dim twilightwhich how it came he could not tellhe could scarcely discern what were its distinguishing marks but he seemed to be sensible that in a highbacked chair at a little distance from him sat a figure in a long robe a figure of a man with snowwhite hair and a long beard who seemed to be gazing at him quietly as if he had been gazing a hundred years i know not what it was but there was an influence as if this old man belonged to some other age and category of man than he was now amongst he remembered the old family legend of the existence of an ancestor two or three centuries in age  it is the old family personified thought he  the old figure made no sign but continued to sit gazing at him in so strangely still a manner that it made redclyffe shiver with something that seemed like affright there was an aspect of long long time about him as if he had never been young or so long ago as when the world was young along with him he might be the demon of this old house the representative of all that happened in it the grief the long languor and weariness of life the deaths gathering them all into himself and figuring them in furrows wrinkles and white hairsa being that might have been young when those old saxon timbers were put together with the oaks that were saplings when caesar landed and was in his maturity when the conqueror came and was now lapsing into extreme age when the nineteenth century was elderly his garb might have been of any time that long loose robe that enveloped him redclyffe remained in this way gazing at this aged figure at first without the least wonder but calmly as we feel in dreams when being in a land of enchantment we take everything as if it were a matter of course and feel by the right of our own marvellous nature on terms of equal kindred with all other marvels so it was with him when he first became aware of the old man sitting there with that agelong regard directed towards him  but by degrees a sense of wonder had its will and grew slowly at first in redclyffes mind and almost twinborn with it and growing piece by piece there was a sense of awful fear as his waking senses came slowly back to him in the dreamy state he had felt no fear but as a waking man it was fearful to discover that the shadowy forms did not fly from his awaking eyes he started at last to his feet from the low couch on which he had all this time been lying  what are you he exclaimed where am i  the old figure made no answer nor could redclyffe be quite sure that his voice had any effect upon it though he fancied that it was shaken a little as if his voice came to it from afar but it continued to gaze at him or at least to have its aged face turned towards him in the dim light and this strange composure and unapproachableness were very frightful as his manhood gathered about his heart however the american endeavored to shake off this besetting fear or awe or whatever it was and to bring himself to a sense of waking thingsto burst through the mist and delusive shows that bewildered him and catch hold of a reality he stamped upon the floor it was solid stone the pavement or oak so old and stanch that it resembled it there was one firm thing therefore but the contrast between this and the slipperiness the unaccountableness of the rest of his position made him the more sensible of the latter he made a step towards the old figure another another he was face to face with him within a yard of distance he saw the faint movement of the old mans breath he sought through the twilight of the room some glimmer of perception in his eyes  are you a living man asked redclyffe faintly and doubtfully  he mumbled the old figure some faint moaning sound that if it were language at all had all the edges and angles worn off it by decay unintelligible except that it seemed to signify a faint mournfulness and complainingness of mood and then held his peace continuing to gaze as before redclyffe could not bear the awe that filled him while he kept at a distance and coming desperately forward he stood close to the old figure he touched his robe to see if it were real he laid his hand upon the withered hand that held the staff in which he now recognized the very staff of the doctors legend his fingers touched a real hand though bony and dry as if it had been in the grave  then you are real said redclyffe doubtfully  the old figure seemed to have exhausted itselfits energies what there were of themin the effort of making the unintelligible communication already vouchsafed then he seemed to lapse out of consciousness and not to know what was passing or to be sensible that any person was near him but redclyffe was now resuming his firmness and daylight consciousness even in the dimness he ran over all that he had heard of the legend of the old house rapidly considering whether there might not be something of fact in the legend of the undying old man whether as told or whispered in the chimneycorners it might not be an instance of the mysterious the halfspiritual mode in which actual truths communicate themselves imperfectly through a medium that gives them the aspect of falsehood something in the atmosphere of the house made its inhabitants and neighbors dimly aware that there was a secret resident it was by a language not audible but of impression there could not be such a secret in its recesses without making itself sensible this legend of the undying one translated it to vulgar apprehension he remembered those early legends told by the doctor in his childhood he seemed imperfectly and doubtfully to see what was their true meaning and how taken aright they had a reality and were the craftily concealed history of his own wrongs sufferings and revenge and this old man who was he he joined the wardens account of the family to the doctors legends he could not believe or take thoroughly in the strange surmise to which they led him but by an irresistible impulse he acted on it  sir edward redclyffe he exclaimed  ha who speaks to me exclaimed the old man in a startled voice like one who hears himself called at an unexpected moment  sir edward redclyffe repeated redclyffe i bring you news of norman oglethorpe endnote 3  the villain the tyrant mercy mercy save me cried the old man in most violent emotion of terror and rage intermixed that shook his old frame as if it would be shaken asunder he stood erect the picture of ghastly horror as if he saw before him that stern face that had thrown a blight over his life and so fearfully avenged from youth to age the crime that he had committed the effect the passion was too muchthe terror with which it smote the rage that accompanied it blazed up for a moment with a fierce flame then flickered and went out he stood tottering redclyffe put out his hand to support him but he sank down in a heap on the floor as if a thing of dry bones had been suddenly loosened at the joints and fell in a rattling heap endnote 4     chapter xxv   redclyffe apparently had not communicated to his agent in london his change of address when he left the wardens residence to avail himself of the hospitality of braithwaite hall for letters arrived for him from his own country both private and with the seal of state upon them one among the rest that bore on the envelope the name of the president of the united states the good warden was impressed with great respect for so distinguished a signature and not knowing but that the welfare of the republic for which he had an englishmans contemptuous interest might be involved in its early delivery at its destination he determined to ride over to braithwaite hall call on his friend and deliver it with his own hand with this purpose he mounted his horse at the hour of his usual morning ride and set forth and before reaching the village saw a figure before him which he recognized as that of the pensioner endnote 1  soho whither go you old friend said the warden drawing his bridle as he came up with the old man  to braithwaite hall sir said the pensioner who continued to walk diligently on and i am glad to see your honor if it be so on the same errand  why so asked the warden you seem much in earnest why should my visit to braithwaite hall be a special cause of rejoicing  nay said the pensioner your honor is specially interested in this young american who has gone thither to abide and when one is in a strange country he needs some guidance my mind is not easy about the young man  well said the warden smiling to himself at the old gentlemans idle and senile fears i commend your diligence on behalf of your friend  he rode on as he spoke and deep in one of the woodland paths he saw the flutter of a womans garment and greatly to his surprise overtook elsie who seemed to be walking along with great rapidity and startled by the approach of hoofs behind her looked up at him with a pale cheek  good morning miss elsie said the warden you are taking a long walk this morning i regret to see that i have frightened you  pray whither are you going said she  to the hall said the warden wondering at the abrupt question  ah sir exclaimed elsie for heavens sake pray insist on seeing mr redclyffetake no excuse there are reasons for it  certainly fair lady responded the warden wondering more and more at this injunction from such a source and when i see this fascinating gentleman pray what message am i to give him from miss elsiewho moreover seems to be on the eve of visiting him in person  see him see him only see him said elsie with passionate earnestness and in haste see him now  she waved him onward as she spoke and the warden greatly commoted for the nonce complied with the maidens fantasy so far as to ride on at a quicker pace uneasily marvelling at what could have aroused this usually shy and reserved girls nervousness to such a pitch the incident served at all events to titillate his english sluggishness so that he approached the avenue of the old hall with a vague expectation of something that had happened there though he knew not of what nature it could possibly be however he rode round to the side entrance by which horsemen generally entered the house and a groom approaching to take his bridle he alighted and approached the door i know not whether it were anything more than the glistening moisture common in an english autumnal morning but so it was that the trace of the bloody footstep seemed fresh as if it had been that very night imprinted anew and the crime made all over again with fresh guilt upon somebodys soul  when the footman came to the door responsive to his ring the warden inquired for mr redclyffe the american gentleman  the american gentleman left for london early this morning replied the footman in a matteroffact way  gone exclaimed the warden this is sudden and strange that he should go without saying good by gone and then he remembered the old pensioners eagerness that the warden should come here and elsies strange injunction that he should insist on seeing redclyffe pray is lord braithwaite at home  i think sir he is in the library said the servant but will see pray sir walk in  he returned in a moment and ushered the warden through passages with which he was familiar of old to the library where he found lord braithwaite sitting with the london newspaper in his hand he rose and welcomed his guest with great equanimity  to the wardens inquiries after redclyffe lord braithwaite replied that his guest had that morning left the house being called to london by letters from america but of what nature lord braithwaite was unable to say except that they seemed to be of urgency and importance the wardens further inquiries which he pushed as far as was decorous elicited nothing more than this and he was preparing to take his leavenot seeing any reason for insisting according to elsies desire on the impossibility of seeing a man who was not therenor indeed any reason for so doing and yet it seemed very strange that redclyffe should have gone so unceremoniously nor was he half satisfied though he knew not why he should be otherwise  do you happen to know mr redclyffes address in london asked the warden  not at all said braithwaite but i presume there is courtesy enough in the american character to impel him to write to me or both of us within a day or two telling us of his whereabouts and whatabouts should you know i beg you will let me know for i have really been pleased with this gentleman and should have been glad could he have favored me with a somewhat longer visit  there was nothing more to be said and the warden took his leave and was about mounting his horse when he beheld the pensioner approaching the house and he remained standing until he should come up  you are too late said he as the old man drew near our friend has taken french leave  mr warden said the old man solemnly let me pray you not to give him up so easily come with me into the presence of lord braithwaite  the warden made some objections but the pensioners manner was so earnest that he soon consented knowing that the strangeness of his sudden return might well enough be put upon the eccentricities of the pensioner especially as he was so well known to lord braithwaite he accordingly again rang at the door which being opened by the same stolid footman the warden desired him to announce to lord braithwaite that the warden and a pensioner desired to see him he soon returned with a request that they would walk in and ushered them again to the library where they found the master of the house in conversation with omskirk at one end of the apartmenta whispered conversation which detained him a moment after their arrival the warden fancied that he saw in old omskirks countenance a shade more of that mysterious horror which made him such a bugbear to children but when braithwaite turned from him and approached his visitor there was no trace of any disturbance beyond a natural surprise to see his good friend the warden so soon after his taking leave endnote 2  i see you are surprised said the latter but you must lay the blame if any on our good old friend here who for some reason best known to himself insisted on having my company here  braithwaite looked to the old pensioner with a questioning look as if goodhumoredly yet not as if he cared much about it asking for an explanation as omskirk was about leaving the room having remained till this time with that nervous look which distinguished him gazing towards the party the pensioner made him a sign which he obeyed as if compelled to do so  well my friend said the warden somewhat impatient of the aspect in which he himself appeared i beg of you explain at once to lord braithwaite why you have brought me back in this strange way  it is said the pensioner quietly that in your presence i request him to allow me to see mr redclyffe  why my friend said braithwaite how can i show you a man who has left my house and whom in the chances of this life i am not very likely to see again though hospitably desirous of so doing  here ensued a laughing sort of colloquy between the warden and braithwaite in which the former jocosely excused himself for having yielded to the whim of the pensioner and returned with him on an errand which he well knew to be futile  i have long been aware he said apart in a confidential way of something a little awry in our old friends mental system you will excuse him and me for humoring him  of course of course said braithwaite in the same tone i shall not be moved by anything the old fellow can say  the old pensioner meanwhile had been as it were heating up and gathering himself into a mood of energy which those who saw him had never before witnessed in his usually quiet person he seemed somehow to grow taller and larger more impressive at length fixing his eyes on lord braithwaite he spoke again  dark murderous man exclaimed he your course has not been unwatched the secrets of this mansion are not unknown for two centuries back they have been better known to them who dwell afar off than to those resident within the mansion the foot that made the bloody footstep has returned from its long wanderings and it passes on straight as destinysure as an avenging providenceto the punishment and destruction of those who incur retribution  here is an odd kind of tragedy said lord braithwaite with a scornful smile come my old friend lay aside this vein and talk sense  not thus do you escape your penalty hardened and crafty one exclaimed the pensioner i demand of you before this worthy warden access to the secret ways of this mansion of which thou dost unjustly retain possession i shall disclose what for centuries has remained hiddenthe ghastly secrets that this house hides  humor him whispered the warden and hereafter i will take care that the exuberance of our old friend shall be duly restrained he shall not trouble you again  lord braithwaite to say the truth appeared a little flabbergasted and disturbed by these latter expressions of the old gentleman he hesitated turned pale but at last recovering his momentary confusion and irresolution he replied with apparent carelessness  go wherever you will old gentleman the house is open to you for this time if ever you have another opportunity to disturb it the fault will be mine  follow sir said the pensioner turning to the warden follow maidenendnote 3 now shall a great mystery begin to be revealed  so saying he led the way before them passing out of the hall not by the doorway but through one of the oaken panels of the wall which admitted the party into a passage which seemed to pass through the thickness of the wall and was lighted by interstices through which shone gleams of light this led them into what looked like a little vestibule or circular room which the warden though deeming himself many years familiar with the old house had never seen before any more than the passage which led to it to his surprise this room was not vacant for in it sat in a large old chair omskirk like a toad in its hole like some wild fearful creature in its den and it was now partly understood how this man had the possibility of suddenly disappearing so inscrutably and so in a moment and when all quest for him was given up of as suddenly appearing again  ha said old omskirk slowly rising as at the approach of some event that he had long expected is he coming at last  poor victim of anothers iniquity said the pensioner thy release approaches rejoice  the old man arose with a sort of trepidation and solemn joy intermixed in his manner and bowed reverently as if there were in what he heard more than other ears could understand in it  yes i have waited long replied he welcome if my release is come  well said lord braithwaite scornfully this secret retreat of my house is known to many it was the priests secret chamber when it was dangerous to be of the old and true religion here in england there is no longer any use in concealing this place and the warden or any man might have seen it or any of the curiosities of the old hereditary house if desirous so to do  aha son of belial quoth the pensioner and this too  he took three pieces from a certain point of the wall which he seemed to know and stooped to press upon the floor the warden looked at lord braithwaite and saw that he had grown deadly pale what his change of cheer might bode he could not guess but at the pressure of the old pensioners finger the floor or a segment of it rose like the lid of a box and discovered a small darksome pair of stairs within which burned a lamp lighting it downward like the steps that descend into a sepulchre  follow said he to those who looked on wondering  and he began to descend lord braithwaite saw him disappear then frantically followed the warden next and old omskirk took his place in the rear like a man following his inevitable destiny at the bottom of a winding descent that seemed deep and remote and far within they came to a door which the pensioner pressed with a spring and passing through the space that disclosed itself the whole party followed and found themselves in a small gloomy room on one side of it was a couch on which sat redclyffe face to face with him was a whitehaired figure in a chair  you are come said redclyffe solemnly but too late  and yonder is the coffer said the pensioner open but that and our quest is ended  that if i mistake not i can do said redclyffe  he drew forthwhat he had kept all this time as something that might yet reveal to him the mystery of his birththe silver key that had been found by the grave in far new england and applying it to the lock he slowly turned it on the hinges that had not been turned for two hundred years alleven lord braithwaite guilty and shame stricken as he feltpressed forward to look upon what was about to be disclosed what were the wondrous contents the entire mysterious coffer was full of golden ringlets abundant clustering through the whole coffer and living with elasticity so as immediately as it were to flow over the sides of the coffer and rise in large abundance from the long compression into thisby a miracle of natural production which was known likewise in other casesinto this had been resolved the whole bodily substance of that fair and unfortunate being known so long in the legends of the family as the beauty of the golden locks as the pensioner looked at this strange sightthe lustre of the precious and miraculous hair gleaming and glistening and seeming to add light to the gloomy roomhe took from his breast pocket another lock of hair in a locket and compared it before their faces with that which brimmed over from the coffer  it is the same said he  and who are you that know it asked redclyffe surprised  he whose ancestors taught him the secretwho has had it handed down to him these two centuries and now only with regret yields to the necessity of making it known  you are the heir said redclyffe  in that gloomy room beside the dead old man they looked at him and saw a dignity beaming on him covering his whole figure that broke out like a lustre at the close of day     appendix   chapter i  note 1

graveyard we are sorry to have to treat of such a disagreeable piece of ground but everybodys business centres there at one time or another was the most ancient in the town the dust of the original englishmen had become incorporated with the soil of those englishmen whose immediate predecessors had been resolved into the earth about the country churchesthe little norman square battlemented stone towers of the villages in the old land so that in this point of view as holding bones and dust of the first ancestors this graveyard was more english than anything else in town there had been hidden from sight many a broad bluff visage of husbandmen that had ploughed the real english soil there the faces of noted men now known in history there many a personage whom tradition told about making wondrous qualities of strength and courage for himall these mingled with succeeding generations turned up and battened down again with the sextons spade until every blade of grass was human more than vegetablefor an hundred and fifty years will do this and so much time at least had elapsed since the first little mound was piled up in the virgin soil old tombs there were too with numerous sculptures on them and quaint mossy gravestones although all kinds of monumental appendages were of a date more recent than the time of the first settlers who had been content with wooden memorials if any the sculptors art not having then reached new england thus rippled surged broke almost against the house this dreary graveyard which made the street gloomy so that people did not like to pass the dark high wooden fence with its closed gate that separated it from the street and this old house was one that crowded upon it and took up the ground that would otherwise have been sown as thickly with dead as the rest of the lot so that it seemed hardly possible but that the dead people should get up out of their graves and come in there to warm themselves but in truth i have never heard a whisper of its being haunted  note 6 authors notethe spiders are affected by the weather and serve as barometersit shall always be a moot point whether the doctor really believed in cobwebs or was laughing at

notecrusty hannah teaches elsie curious needlework etc  note 3 these two children are described as follows in an early note of the authors the boy had all the qualities fitted to excite tenderness in those who had the care of him in the first and most evident place on account of his personal beauty which was very remarkablethe most intelligent and expressive face that can be conceived changing in those early years like an april day and beautiful in all its changes dark but of a soft expression kindling melting glowing laughing a varied intelligence which it was as good as a book to read he was quick in all modes of mental exercise quick and strong too in sensibility proud and gifted probably by the circumstances in which he was placed with an energy which the softness and impressibility of his nature neededas for the little girl all the squalor of the abode served but to set off her lightsomeness and brightsomeness she was a pale largeeyed little thing and it might have been supposed that the air of the house and the contiguity of the burialplace had a bad effect upon her health yet i hardly think this could have been the case for she was of a very airy nature dancing and sporting through the house as if melancholy had never been made she took all kinds of childish liberties with the doctor and with his pipe and with everything appertaining to him except his spiders and his cobwebsall of which goes to show that hawthorne first conceived his characters in the mood of the twicetold tales and then by meditation solidified them to the inimitable fleshandblood of the house of

it  note 4 authors noteput into the doctors character a continual enmity against somebody breaking out in curses of which nobody can understand the application    chapter iv  note 1 the doctors propensity for cobwebs is amplified in the following note for an earlier and somewhat milder version of the character according to him all science was to be renewed and established on a sure ground by no other means than cobwebs the cobweb was the magic clue by which mankind was to be rescued from all its errors and guided safely back to the right and so he cherished spiders above all things and kept them spinning spinning away the only textile factory that existed at that epoch in new england he distinguished the production of each of his ugly friends and assigned peculiar qualities to each and he had been for years engaged in writing a work on this new discovery in reference to which he had already compiled a great deal of folio manuscript and had unguessed at resources still to come with this suggestive subject he interwove all imaginable learning collected from his own library rich in works that few others had read and from that of his beloved university crabbed with greek rich with latin drawing into itself like a whirlpool all that men had thought hitherto and combining them anew in such a way that it had all the charm of a racy originality then he had projects for the cultivation of cobwebs to which end in the good doctors opinion it seemed desirable to devote a certain part of the national income and not content with this all publicspirited citizens would probably be induced to devote as much of their time and means as they could to the same end according to him there was no such beautiful festoon and drapery for the halls of princes as the spinning of this heretofore despised and hated insect and by due encouragement it might be hoped that they would flourish and hang and dangle and wave triumphant in the breeze to an extent as yet generally undreamed of and he lamented much the destruction that has heretofore been wrought upon this precious fabric by the housemaids broom and insisted upon by foolish women who claimed to be good housewives indeed it was the general opinion that the doctors celibacy was in great measure due to the impossibility of finding a woman who would pledge herself to co operate with him in this great ambition of his lifethat of reducing the world to a cobweb factory or who would bind herself to let her own drawingroom be ornamented with this kind of tapestry but there never was a wife precisely fitted for our friend the doctor unless it had been arachne herself to whom if she could again have been restored to her female shape he would doubtless have lost no time in paying his addresses it was doubtless the having dwelt too long among the musty and dusty clutter and litter of things gone by that made the doctor almost a monomaniac on this subject there were cobwebs in his own brain and so he saw nothing valuable but cobwebs in the world around him and deemed that the march of created things up to this time had been calculated by foreknowledge to produce them  note 2 authors notened must learn

where he was sold for a servant    chapter xix  note 1 the following passage though it seems to fit in here chronologically is concerned with a side issue which was not followed up the author was experimenting for a character to act as the accomplice of lord braithwaite at the hall and he makes trial of the present personage mountford of an italian priest father angelo and finally of the steward omskirk who is adopted it will be noticed that mountford is here endowed for the moment with the birthright of good doctor hammond the warden he is represented as having made the journey to america in search of the grave this alteration being inconsistent with the true thread of the story and being moreover not continued i have placed this passage in the appendix instead of in the text  redclyffe often in the dim weather when the prophetic intimations of rain were too strong to allow an american to walk abroad with peace of mind was in the habit of pacing this noble hall and watching the process of renewal and adornment or which suited him still better of enjoying its great deep solitude when the workmen were away parties of visitors curious tourists sometimes peeped in took a cursory glimpse at the old hall and went away these were the only ordinary disturbances but one day a person entered looked carelessly round the hall as if its antiquity had no great charm to him then he seemed to approach redclyffe who stood far and dim in the remote distance of the great room the echoing of feet on the stone pavement of the hall had always an impressive sound and turning his head towards the visitant edward stood as if there were an expectance for him in this approach it was a middleaged manrather a man towards fifty with an alert capable air a man evidently with something to do in life and not in the habit of throwing away his moments in looking at old halls a gentlemanly man enough too he approached redclyffe without hesitation and lifting his hat addressed him in a way that made edward wonder whether he could be an englishman if so he must have known that edward was an american and have been trying to adapt his manners to those of a democratic freedom  mr redclyffe i believe said he  redclyffe bowed with the stiff caution of an englishman for with american mobility he had learned to be stiff  i think i have had the pleasure of knowingat least of meetingyou very long ago said the gentleman but i see you do not recollect me  redclyffe confessed that the stranger had the advantage of him in his recollection of a previous acquaintance  no wonder said the other for as i have already hinted it was many years ago  in my own country then of course said redclyffe  in your own country certainly said the stranger and when it would have required a penetrating eye to see the distinguished mr redclyffe the representative of american democracy abroad in the little pale faced intelligent boy dwelling with an old humorist in the corner of a graveyard  at these words redclyffe sent back his recollections and though doubtfully began to be aware that this must needs be the young englishman who had come to his guardian on such a singular errand as to search an old grave it must be he for it could be nobody else and in truth he had a sense of his identitywhich however did not express itself by anything that he could confidently remember in his looks manner or voiceyet if anything it was most in the voice but the image which on searching he found in his mind of a fresh colored young englishman with light hair and a frank pleasant face was terribly realized for the worse in this somewhat heavy figure and coarser face and heavier eye in fact there is a terrible difference between the mature englishman and the young man who is not yet quite out of his blossom his hair too was getting streaked and sprinkled with gray and in short there were evident marks of his having worked and succeeded and failed and eaten and drunk and being made largely of beef ale port and sherry and all the solidities of english life  i remember you now said redclyffe extending his hand frankly and yet mountford took it in so cold a way that he was immediately sorry that he had done it and called up an extra portion of reserve to freeze the rest of the interview he continued coolly enough i remember you and something of your american errandwhich indeed has frequently been in my mind since i hope you found the results of your voyage in the way of discovery sufficiently successful to justify so much trouble  you will remember said mountford that the grave proved quite unproductive yes you will not have forgotten it for i well recollect how eagerly you listened with that queer little girl to my talk with the old governor and how disappointed you seemed when you found that the grave was not to be opened and yet it is very odd i failed in that mission and yet there are circumstances that have led me to think that i ought to have succeeded betterthat some other person has really succeeded better  redclyffe was silent but he remembered the strange old silver key and how he had kept it secret and the doubts that had troubled his mind then and long afterwards whether he ought not to have found means to convey it to the stranger and ask whether that was what he sought and now here was that same doubt and question coming up again and he found himself quite as little able to solve it as he had been twenty years ago indeed with the views that had come up since it behooved him to be cautious until he knew both the man and the circumstances  you are probably aware continued mountfordfor i understand you have been some time in this neighborhoodthat there is a pretended claim a contesting claim to the present possession of the estate of braithwaite and a long dormant title possiblywho knowsyou yourself might have a claim to one or the other would not that be a singular coincidence have you ever had the curiosity to investigate your parentage with a view to this point  the title replied redclyffe ought not to be a very strong consideration with an american one of us would be ashamed i verily believe to assume any distinction except such as may be supposed to indicate personal not hereditary merit we have in some measure i think lost the feeling of the past and even of the future as regards our own lines of descent and even as to wealth it seems to me that the idea of heaping up a pile of gold or accumulating a broad estate for our children and remoter descendants is dying out we wish to enjoy the fulness of our success in life ourselves and leave to those who descend from us the task of providing for themselves this tendency is seen in our lavish expenditure and the whole arrangement of our lives and it is slowlyyet not very slowly eithereffecting a change in the whole economy of american life  still rejoined mr mountford with a smile that redclyffe fancied was dark and subtle still i should imagine that even an american might recall so much of hereditary prejudice as to be sensible of some earthly advantages in the possession of an ancient title and hereditary estate like this personal distinction may suit you betterto be an ambassador by your own talent to have a future for yourself involving the possibility of ranking though it were only for four years among the acknowledged sovereigns of the earththis is very good but if the silver key would open the shut up secret today it might be possible that you would relinquish these advantages  before redclyffe could reply and indeed there seemed to be an allusion at the close of mountfords speech which whether intended or not he knew not how to reply to a young lady entered the hall whom he was at no loss by the colored light of a painted window that fell upon her translating her out of the common daylight to recognize as the relative of the pensioner she seemed to have come to give her fanciful superintendence to some of the decorations of the hall such as required womans taste rather than the sturdy english judgment and antiquarian knowledge of the warden slowly following after her came the pensioner himself leaning on his staff and looking up at the old roof and around him with a benign composure and himself a fitting figure by his antique and venerable appearance to walk in that old hall  ah said mountford to redclyffes surprise here is an acquaintancetwo acquaintances of mine  he moved along the hall to accost them and as he appeared to expect that redclyffe would still keep him company and as the latter had no reason for not doing so they both advanced to the pensioner who was now leaning on the young womans arm the incident too was not unacceptable to the american as promising to bring him into a more available relation with herwhom he half fancied to be his old american acquaintancethan he had yet succeeded in obtaining  well my old friend said mountford after bowing with a certain measured respect to the young woman how wears life with you rather perhaps it does not wear at all you being so well suited to the life around you you grow by it like a lichen on a wall i could fancy now that you have walked here for three hundred years and remember when king james of blessed memory was entertained in this hall and could marshal out all the ceremonies just as they were then  an old man said the pensioner quietly grows dreamy as he wanes away and i too am sometimes at a loss to know whether i am living in the past or the present or whereabouts in time i amor whether there is any time at all but i should think it hardly worth while to call up one of my shifting dreams more than another  i confess said redclyffe i shall find it impossible to call up this sceneany of these sceneshereafter without the venerable figure of this whom i may truly call my benefactor among them i fancy him among them from the foundationyoung then but keeping just the equal step with their age and decayand still doing good and hospitable deeds to those who need them  the old man seemed not to like to hear these remarks and expressions of gratitude from mountford and the american at any rate he moved away with his slow and light motion of infirmity but then came uneasily back displaying a certain quiet restlessness which redclyffe was sympathetic enough to perceive not so the sturdier more heavily moulded englishman who continued to direct the conversation upon the pensioner or at least to make him a part of it thereby bringing out more of his strange characteristics in truth it is not quite easy for an englishman to know how to adapt himself to the line feelings of those below him in point of station whatever gentlemanly deference he may have for his equals or superiors  i should like now father pensioner said he to know how many steps you may have taken in life before your path led into this hole and whence your course started  do not let him speak thus to the old man said the young woman in a low earnest tone to redclyffe he was surprised and startled it seemed like a voice that has spoken to his boyhood  note 2 authors noteredclyffes place is next to that of the proprietor at table  note 3 authors notedwell upon the antique liveried servants somewhat  note 4 authors notethe rosewater must precede the toasts  note 5 authors notethe jollity of the warden at the feast to be noticed and afterwards explain that he had drunk nothing  note 6 authors notemention the old silver snuffbox which i saw at the liverpool mayors dinner    chapter xx  note 1 this is not the version of the story as indicated in the earlier portion of the romance it is there implied that elsie is the doctors granddaughter her mother having been the doctors daughter who was ruined by the then possessor of the braithwaite estates and who died in consequence that the doctors scheme of revenge was far deeper and more terrible than simply to oust the family from its possessions will appear further on  note 2 the foregoing passage was evidently experimental and the author expresses his estimate of its value in the following words what unimaginable nonsense he then goes on to make the following memoranda as to the plot it should be remembered however that all this part of the romance was written before the american part  half of a secret is preserved in england that is to say in the particular part of the mansion in which an old coffer is hidden the other part is carried to america one key of an elaborate lock is retained in england among some old curiosities of forgotten purpose the other is the silver key that redclyffe found beside the grave a treasure of gold is what they expect they find a treasure of golden locks this lady the beloved of the bloody footstep had been murdered and hidden in the coffer on account of jealousy elsie must know the baselessness of redclyffes claims and be loath to tell him because she sees that he is so much interested in them she has a paper of the old doctors revealing the whole plota deathbed confession redclyffe having been absent at the time  the reader will recollect that this latter suggestion was not adopted there was no deathbed confession as regards the coffer full of golden locks it was suggested by an incident recorded in the english note books 1854 the grandmother of mrs osullivan died fifty years ago at the age of twentyeight she had great personal charms and among them a head of beautiful chestnut hair after her burial in a family tomb the coffin of one of her children was laid on her own so that the lid seems to have decayed or been broken from this cause at any rate this was the case when the tomb was opened about a year ago the grandmothers coffin was then found to be filled with beautiful glossy living chestnut ringlets into which her whole substance seems to have been transformed for there was nothing else but these shining curls the growth of half a century in the tomb an old man with a ringlet of his youthful mistress treasured in his heart might be supposed to witness this wonderful thing    chapter xxiii  note 1 in a study of the plot too long to insert here this new character of the steward is introduced and described it must suffice to say in this place that he was intimately connected with dr grimshawe who had resuscitated him after he had been hanged and had thus gained his gratitude and secured his implicit obedience to his wishes even twenty years after his grimshawes death the use the doctor made of him was to establish him in braithwaite hall as the perpetual confidential servant of the owners thereof of course the latter are not aware that the steward is acting in grimshawes interest and therefore in deadly opposition to their own precisely what the stewards mission in life was will appear hereafter  the study above alluded to with others amounting to about a hundred pages will be published as a supplement to a future edition of this work    chapter xxiv  note 1 authors noteredclyffe lies in a dreamy state thinking fantastically as if he were one of the seven sleepers he does not yet open his eyes but lies there in a maze  note 2 authors noteredclyffe must look at the old man quietly and dreamily and without surprise for a long while  note 3 presumably the true name of doctor grimshawe  note 4 this mysterious prisoner sir edward redclyffe is not of course the sir edward who founded the hospital but a descendant of that man who ruined doctor grimshawes daughter and is the father of elsie he had been confined in this chamber by the doctors contrivance ever since omskirk being his jailer as is foreshadowed in chapter xl he has been kept in the belief that he killed grimshawe in a struggle that took place between them and that his confinement in the secret chamber is voluntary on his own parta measure of precaution to prevent arrest and execution for murder in this miserable delusion he has cowered there for five and thirty years this and various other dusky points are partly elucidated in the notes hereafter to be appended to this volume    chapter xxv  note 1 at this point the author for what reason i will not venture to surmise chooses to append this gloss bubbleandsqueak  note 2 authors notethey found him in the hall about to go out  note 3 elsie appears to have joined the party
