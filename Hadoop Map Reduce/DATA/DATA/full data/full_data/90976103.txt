warning at the very hour his hand was outstretched to crumple the holz and gunsberg combine the new york doctors called it overwork and he lay in a darkened room one ankle crossed above the other tongue pressed into palate wondering whether the next brainsurge of prickly fires would drive his soul from all anchorages at last they gave judgment with care he might in two years return to the arena but for the present he must go across the water and do no work whatever he accepted the terms it was capitulation but the combine that had shivered beneath his knife gave him all the honours of war gunsberg himself full of condolences came to the steamer and filled the chapins suite of cabins with overwhelming flowerworks  smilax said george chapin when he saw them fitz is right im dead only i dont see why he left out the in memoriam on the ribbons  nonsense his wife answered and poured him his tincture youll be back before you can think  he looked at himself in the mirror surprised that his face had not been branded by the hells of the past three months the noise of the decks worried him and he lay down his tongue only a little pressed against his palate  an hour later he said sophie i feel sorry about taking you away from everything like this ii suppose were the two loneliest people on gods earth tonight  said sophie his wife and kissed him isnt it something to you that were going together  they drifted about europe for monthssometimes alone sometimes with chance met gipsies of their own land from the north cape to the blue grotto at capri they wandered because the next steamer headed that way or because some one had set them on the road the doctors had warned sophie that chapin was not to take interest even in other mens interests but a familiar sensation at the back of the neck after one hours keen talk with a nauheimed railway magnate saved her any trouble he nearly wept  and im over thirty he cried with all i meant to do  lets call it a honeymoon said sophie d you know in all the six years weve been married youve never told me what you meant to do with your life  with my life whats the use its finished now sophie looked up quickly from the bay of naples as far as my business goes i shall have to live on my rents like that architect at san moritz  youll get better if you dont worry and even if it rakes time there are worse things thanhow much have you  between four and five million but it isnt the money you know it isnt its the principle how could you respect me you never did the first year after we married till i went to work like the others our tradition and upbringing are against it we cant accept those ideals  well i suppose i married you for some sort of ideal she answered and they returned to their fortythird hotel  in england they missed the alien tongues of continental streets that reminded them of their own polyglot cities in england all men spoke one tongue speciously like american to the ear but on crossexamination unintelligible  ah but you have not seen england said a lady with irongrey hair they had met her in vienna bayreuth and florence and were grateful to find her again at claridges for she commanded situations and knew where prescriptions are most carefully made up you ought to take an interest in the home of our ancestors as i do  ive tried for a week mrs shonts said sophie but i never get any further than tipping german waiters  these men are not the true type mrs shouts went on i know where you should go  chapin pricked up his ears anxious to run anywhere from the streets on which quick men something of his kidney did the business denied to him  we hear and we obey mrs shonts said sophie feeling his unrest as he drank the loathed british tea  mrs shonts smiled and took them in hand she wrote widely and telegraphed far on their behalf till armed with her letter of introduction she drove them into that wilderness which is reached from an ashbarrel of a station called charing cross they were to go to rockettsthe farm of one cloke in the southern countieswhere she assured them they would meet the genuine england of folklore and song  rocketts they found after some hours four miles from a station and so far as they could judge in the bumpy darkness twice as many from a road trees kine and the outlines of barns showed shadowy about them when they alighted and mr and mrs cloke at the open door of a deep stonefloored kitchen made them shyly welcome they lay in an attic beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling and because it rained a wood fire was made in an iron basket on a brick hearth and they fell asleep to the chirping of mice and the whimper of flames  when they woke it was a fair day full of the noises of birds the smell of box lavender and fried bacon mixed with an elemental smell they had never met before  this said sophie nearly pushing out the thin casement in an attempt to see round the corner iswhat did the hackcabman say to the railway porter about my trunkquite on the top  no a little bit of all right i feel farther away from anywhere than ive ever felt in my life we must find out where the telegraph office is  who cares said sophie wandering about hairbrush in hand to admire the illustrated weekly pictures pasted on door and cupboard  but there was no rest for the alien soul till he had made sure of the telegraph office he asked the clokes daughter laying breakfast while sophie plunged her face in the lavender bush outside the low window  go to the stile atop o the barn field said mary and look across pardons to the next spire its directly under you cant miss itnot if you keep to the footpath my sisters the telegraphist there but youre in the threemile radius sir the boy delivers telegrams directly to this door from pardons village  one has to take a good deal on trust in this country he murmured  sophie looked at the close turf scarred only with last nights wheels at two ruts which wound round a rickyard and at the circle of still orchard about the halftimbered house  whats the matter with it she said telegrams delivered to the vale of avalon of course and she beckoned in an earnesteyed hound of engaging manners and no engagements who answered at times to the name of rambler he led them after breakfast to the rise behind the house where the stile stood against the skyline and i wonder what we shall find now said sophie frankly prancing with joy on the grass  it was a slope of gaphedged fields possessed to their centres by clumps of brambles gates were not and the rabbitmined cattlerubbed posts leaned out and in a narrow path doubled among the bushes scores of white tails twinkled before the racing hound and a hawk rose whistling shrilly  no roads no nothing said sophie her short skirt hooked by briers i thought all england was a garden theres your spire george across the valley how curious  they walked toward it through an all abandoned land here they found the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die there a harsh fallow surrendered to yardhigh thistles and here a breadth of rampant kelk feigning to be lawful crop in the ungrazed pastures swaths of dead stuff caught their feet and the ground beneath glistened with sweat at the bottom of the valley a little brook had undermined its footbridge and frothed in the wreckage but there stood great woods on the slopes beyondold tall and brilliant like unfaded tapestries against the walls of a ruined house  all this within a hundred miles of london he said looks as if it had had nervous prostration too the footpath turned the shoulder of a slope through a thicket of rank rhododendrons and crossed what had once been a carriage drive which ended in the shadow of two gigantic holmoaks  a house said sophie in a whisper a colonial house  behind the bluegreen of the twin trees rose a darkbluish brick georgian pile with a shellshaped fanlight over its pillared door the hound had gone off on his own foolish quests except for some stir it the branches and the flight of four startled magpies there was neither life nor sound about the square house but it looked out of its long windows most friendlily  chaarmed to meet you im sure said sophie and curtsied to the ground george this is history i can understand we began here she curtsied again  the june sunshine twinkled on all the lights it was as though an old lady wise in three generations experience but for the present sitting out bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild  i must look sophie tiptoed to a window and shaded her eyes with her hand oh this rooms halffull of cottonbaleswool i suppose but i can see a bit of the mantelpiece george do come isnt that some one  she fell back behind her husband the front door opened slowly to show the hound his nose white with milk in charge of an ancient of days clad in a blue linen ephod curiously gathered on breast and shoulders  certainly said george half aloud father time himself this is where he lives sophie  we came said sophie weakly can we see the house im afraid thats our dog  no tis rambler said the old man hes been at my swillpail again staying at rocketts be ye come in ah you runagate  the hound broke from him and he tottered after him down the drive they entered the halljust such a high light hall as such a house should own a slimbalustered staircase wide and shallow and once creamywhite climbed out of it under a long oval window on either side delicately moulded doors gave on to woollumbered rooms whose seagreen mantelpieces were adorned with nymphs scrolls and cupids in low relief  whats the firm that makes these things cried sophie enraptured oh i forgot these must be the originals adams is it i never dreamed of anything like that steelcut fender does he mean us to go everywhere  hes catching the dog said george looking out we dont count  they explored the first or ground floor delighted as children playing burglars  this is like all england she said at last wonderful but no explanation youre expected to know it beforehand now lets try upstairs  the stairs never creaked beneath their feet from the broad landing they entered a long greenpanelled room lighted by three fulllength windows which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden and wooded slopes beyond  the drawingroom of course sophie swam up and down it that mantelpieceorpheus and eurydiceis the best of them all isnt it marvellous why the room seems furnished with nothing in it hows that george  its the proportions ive noticed it  i saw a heppelwhite couch oncesophie laid her finger to her flushed cheek and considered with two of themone on each sideyou wouldnt need anything else exceptthere must be one perfect mirror over that mantelpiece  look at that view its a framed constable her husband cried  no its a morlanda parody of a morland but about that couch george dont you think empire might be better than heppelwhite dull gold against that pale green its a pity they dont make spinets nowadays  i believe you can get them look at that oak wood behind the pines  while you sat and played toccatas stately at the clavichord sophie hummed and head on one side nodded to where the perfect mirror should hang  then they found bedrooms with dressingrooms and powderingclosets and steps leading up and downboxes of rooms round square and octagonal with enriched ceilings and chased doorlocks  now about servants oh she had darted up the last stairs to the chequered darkness of the top floor where loose tiles lay among broken laths and the walls were scrawled with names sentiments and hop records theyve been keeping pigeons here she cried  and you could drive a buggy through the roof anywhere said george  thats what i say the old man cried below them on the stairs not a dry place for my pigeons at all  but why was it allowed to get like this said sophie  tis with housen as teeth he replied let em go too far and theres nothing to be done time was they was minded to sell her but none would buy she was too far away along from any place time was theyd ha lived here theyselves but they took and died  here sophie moved beneath the light of a hole in the roof  nahnone dies here excep falling off ricks and such in london they died he plucked a lock of wool from his blue smock they was no stapleneither the elphicks nor the moones shart and brittle all of em dead they be seventeen year for ive been here caretakin twentyfive  who does all the wool belong to downstairs george asked  to the estate ill show you the back parts if ye like youre from america aint ye ive had a son there once myself they followed him down the main stairway he paused at the turn and swept one hand toward the wall plenty room here for your coffin to come down seven foot and three men at each end wouldnt brish the paint if i die in my bed theyll ave to upend me like a milkcan tis all luck dye see  he led them on and on through a maze of back kitchens dairies larders and sculleries that melted along covered ways into a farmhouse visibly older than the main building which again rambled out among barns byres pigpens stalls and stables to the dead fields behind  somehow said sophie sitting exhausted on an ancient wellcurbsomehow one wouldnt insult these lovely old things by filling them with hay  george looked at long stone walls upholding reaches of silveryoak weatherboarding buttresses of mixed flint and bricks outside stairs stone upon arched stone curves of thatch where grass sprouted roundels of houseleeked tiles and a huge paved yard populated by two cows and the repentant rambler he had not thought of himself or of the telegraph office for two and a half hours  but why said sophie as they went back through the crater of stricken fieldswhy is one expected to know everything in england why do they never tell  you mean about the elphicks and the moones he answered  yesand the lawyers and the estate who are they i wonder whether those painted floors in the green room were real oak dont you like us exploring things togetherbetter than pompeii  george turned once more to look at the view eight hundred acres go with the housethe old man told me five farms altogether rocketts is one of em  i like mrs cloke but what is the old house called  george laughed thats one of the things youre expected to know he never told me  the clokes were more communicative that evening and thereafter for a week they gave the chapins the official history as one gives it to lodgers of friars pardon the house and its five farms but sophie asked so many questions and george was so humanly interested that as confidence in the strangers grew they launched with observed and acquired detail into the lives and deaths and doings of the elphicks and the moones and their collaterals the haylings and the torrells it was a tale told serially by cloke in the barn or his wife in the dairy the last chapters reserved for the kitchen o nights by the big fire when the two had been half the day exploring about the house where old iggulden of the blue smock cackled and chuckled to see them the motives that swayed the characters were beyond their comprehension the fates that shifted them were gods they had never met the sidelights mrs cloke threw on act and incident were more amazing than anything in the record therefore the chapins listened delightedly and blessed mrs shonts  but whywhywhydid soandso do soandso sophie would demand from her seat by the pothook and mrs cloke would answer smoothing her knees for the sake of the place  i give it up said george one night in their own room people dont seem to matter in this country compared to the places they live in the way she tells it friars pardon was a sort of moloch  poor old thing they had been walking round the farms as usual before tea no wonder they loved it think of the sacrifices they made for it jane elphick married the younger torrell to keep it in the family the octagonal room with the moulded ceiling next to the big bedroom was hers now what did he tell you while he was feeding the pigs said sophie  about the torrell cousins and the uncle who died in java they lived at burnt housebehind high pardons where that brook is all blocked up  no burnt house is under high pardons wood before you come to gale anstey sophie corrected  well old man cloke said  sophie threw open the door and called down into the kitchen where the clokes were covering the fire mrs cloke isnt burnt house under high pardons  yes my dear of course the soft voice answered absently a cough i beg your pardon madam what was it you said  never mind i prefer it the other way sophie laughed and george retold the missing chapter as she sat on the bed  here today an gone tomorrow said cloke warningly theyve paid their first month but weve only that mrs shontss letter for guarantee  none she sent never cheated us yet it slipped out before i thought shes a most humane young lady theyll be going away in a little an youve talked a lot too alfred  yes but the elphicks are all dead no one can bring my loose talking home to me but why do they stay on and stay on so  in due time george and sophie asked each other that question and put it aside they argued that the climatea pearly blend unlike the hot and cold ferocities of their native landsuited them as the thick stillness of the nights certainly suited george he was saved even the sight of a metalled road which as presumably leading to business wakes desire in a man and the telegraph office at the village of friars pardon where they sold picture postcards and pegtops was two walking miles across the fields and woods  for all that touched his past among his fellows or their remembrance of him he might have been in another planet and sophie whose life had been very largely spent among husbandless wives of lofty ideals had no wish to leave this present of god the unhurried meals the foreknowledge of deliciously empty hours to follow the breadths of soft sky under which they walked together and reckoned time only by their hunger or thirst the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the miles their discoveries always together amid the farmsgriffons rocketts burnt house gale anstey and the home farm where iggulden of the blue smockfrock would waylay them and they would ransack the old house once more the long wet afternoons when they tucked up their feet on the bedrooms deep windowsill over against the appletrees and talked together as never till then had they found time to talkthese things contented her soul and her body throve  have you realized she asked one morning that weve been here absolutely alone for the last thirtyfour days  have you counted them he asked  did you like them she replied  i must have i didnt think about them yes i have six months ago i should have fretted myself sick remember at cairo ive only had two or three bad times am i getting better or is it senile decay  climate all climate sophie swung her newbought english boots as she sat on the stile overlooking friars pardon behind the clokess barn  one must take hold of things though he said if its only to keep ones hand in his eyes did not flicker now as they swept the empty fields mustnt one  lay out a morristown links over gale anstey i dare say you could hire it  no im not as english as thatnor as morristown cloke says all the farms here could be made to pay  well im anastasia in the treasure of franchard im content to be alive and purr theres no hurry  no he smiled all the same im going to see after my mail  you promised you wouldnt have any  theres some business coming through thats amusing me honest it doesnt get on my nerves at all  want a secretary  no thanks old thing isnt that quite english  too english go away but none the less in broad daylight she returned the kiss im off to pardons i havent been to the house for nearly a week  howve you decided to furnish jane elphicks bedroom he laughed for it had come to be a permanent castle in spain between them  black chinese furniture and yellow silk brocade she answered and ran downhill she scattered a few cows at a gap with a flourish of a groundash that iggulden had cut for her a week ago and singing as she passed under the holmoaks sought the farmhouse at the back of friars pardon the old man was not to be found and she knocked at his halfopened door for she needed him to fill her idle forenoon a blueeyed sheepdog a new friend and ramblers old enemy crawled out and besought her to enter  iggulden sat in his chair by the fire a thistlespud between his knees his head drooped though she had never seen death before her heart that missed a beat told her that he was dead she did not speak or cry but stood outside the door and the dog licked her hand when he threw up his nose she heard herself saying dont howl please dont begin to howl scottie or i shall run away  she held her ground while the shadows in the rickyard moved toward noon sat after a while on the steps by the door her arms round the dogs neck waiting till some one should come she watched the smokeless chimneys of friars pardon slash its roofs with shadow and the smoke of igguldens last lighted fire gradually thin and cease against her will she fell to wondering how many moones elphicks and torrells had been swung round the turn of the broad mall stairs then she remembered the old mans talk of being upended like a milkcan and buried her face on scotties neck at last a horses feet clinked upon flags rustled in the old grey straw of the rickyard and she found herself facing the vicara figure she had seen at church declaiming impossibilities sophie was a unitarian in an unnatural voice  hes dead she said without preface  old iggulden i was coming for a talk with him the vicar passed in uncovered ah she heard him say heartfailure how long have you been here  since a quarter to eleven she looked at her watch earnestly and saw that her hand did not shake  ill sit with him now till the doctor comes dyou think you could tell him andyes mrs betts in the cottage with the wistaria next the blacksmiths im afraid this has been rather a shock to you  sophie nodded and fled toward the village her body failed her for a moment she dropped beneath a hedge and looked back at the great house in some fashion its silence and stolidity steadied her for her errand  mrs betts small blackeyed and dark was almost as unconcerned as friars pardon  yiss yiss of course dear me well iggulden he had had his day in my fathers time muriel get me my little blue bag please yiss maam they come down like ellumbranches in still weather no warnin at all muriel my bicycles beind the fowlhouse ill tell dr dallas maam  she trundled off on her wheel like a brown bee while sophieheaven above and earth beneath changedwalked stiffly home to fall over george at his letters in a muddle of laughter and tears  its all quite natural for them she gasped they come down like ellumbranches in still weather yiss maam no there wasnt anything in the least horrible onlyonlyoh george that poor shiny stick of his between his poor thin knees i couldnt have borne it if scottie had howled i didnt know the vicar was soso sensitive he said he was afraid it was rarather a shock mrs betts told me to go home and i wanted to collapse on her floor but i didnt disgrace myself ii couldnt have left himcould i  youre sure youve took no arm cried mrs cloke who had heard the news by farmtelegraphy which is older but swifter than marconis  no im perfectly well sophie protested  you lay down till teatime mrs cloke patted her shoulder theyll be very pleased though she as ad no proper understandin for twenty years  they came before twilighta blackbearded man in moleskins and a little palsied old woman who chirruped like a wren  im his son said the man to sophie among the lavender bushes we ad a differencetwenty year back and didnt speak since but im his son all the same and we thank you for the watching  im only glad i happened to be there she answered and from the bottom of her heart she meant it  we heard he spoke a lot o youone time an another since you came we thank you kindly the man added  are you the son that was in america she asked  yes maam on my uncles farm in connecticut he was what they call roodmaster there  whereabouts in connecticut asked george over her shoulder  veering holler was the name i was there six year with my uncle  how small the world is sophie cried why all my mothers people come from veering hollow there must be some there stillthe lashmars did you ever hear of them  i remember hearing that name seems to me he answered but his face was blank as the back of a spade  a little before dusk a woman in grey striding like a footsoldier and bearing on her arm a long pole crashed through the orchard calling for food george upon whom the unannounced english worked mysteriously fled to the parlour but mrs cloke came forward beaming sophie could not escape  weve only just heard of it said the stranger turning on her ive been out with the otterhounds all day it was a splendidly sportin thing  did youerkill said sophie she knew from books she could not go far wrong here  yes a dry bitchseventeen pounds was the answer a splendidly sportin thing of you to do poor old iggulden  ohthat said sophie enlightened  if there had been any people at pardons it would never have happened hed have been looked after but what can you expect from a parcel of london solicitors  mrs cloke murmured something  no im soaked from the knees down if i hang about i shall get chilled a cup of tea mrs cloke and i can eat one of your sandwiches as i go she wiped her weatherworn face with a green and yellow silk handkerchief  yes my lady mrs cloke ran and returned swiftly  our land marches with pardons for a mile on the south she explained waving the full cup but one has quite enough to do with ones own people without poachin still if id known id have sent dora of course have you seen her this afternoon mrs cloke no i wonder whether that girl did sprain her ankle thank you it was a formidable hunk of bread and bacon that mrs cloke presented as i was sayin pardons is a scandal lettin people die like dogs there ought to be people there who do their duty youve done yours though there wasnt the faintest call upon you good night tell dora if she comes ive gone on  she strode away munching her crust and sophie reeled breathless into the parlour to shake the shaking george  why did you keep catching my eye behind the blind why didnt you come out and do your duty  because i should have burst did you see the mud on its cheek he said  once i darent look again who is she  goda local deity then anyway shes another of the things youre expected to know by instinct  mrs cloke shocked at their levity told them that it was lady conant wife of sir walter conant baronet a large landholder in the neighbourhood and if not god at least his visible providence george made her talk of that family for an hour  laughter said sophie afterward in their own room is the mark of the savage why couldnt you control your emotions its all real to her  its all real to me thats my trouble he answered in an altered tone anyway its real enough to mark time with dont you think so  what dyou mean she asked quickly though she knew his voice  that im better im well enough to kick  what at  this he waved his hand round the one room i must have something to play with till im fit for work again  ah she sat on the bed and leaned forward her hands clasped i wonder if its good for you  weve been better here than anywhere he went on slowly one could always sell it again  she nodded gravely but her eyes sparkled  the only thing that worries me is what happened this morning i want to know how you feel about it if its on your nerves in the least we can have the old farm at the back of the house pulled down or perhaps it has spoiled the notion for you  pull it down she cried youve no business faculty why thats where we could live while were putting the big house in order its almost under the same roof no what happened this morning seemed to be more of aof a leading than anything else there ought to be people at pardons lady conants quite right  i was thinking more of the woods and the roads i could double the value of the place in six months  what do they want for it she shook her head and her loosened hair fell glowingly about her cheeks  seventyfive thousand dollars theyll take sixtyeight  less than half what we paid for our old yacht when we married and we didnt have a good time in her you were  well i discovered i was too much of an american to be content to be a rich mans son you arent blaming me for that  oh no only it was a very businesslike honeymoon how far are you along with the deal george  i can mail the deposit on the purchase money tomorrow morning and we can have the thing completed in a fortnight or three weeksif you say so  friars pardonfriars pardon sophie chanted rapturously her dark gray eyes big with delight all the farms gale anstey burnt house rocketts the home farm and griffons sure youve got em all  sure he smiled  and the woods high pardons wood lower pardons suttons duttons shaw reubens ghyll maxeys ghyll and both the oak hangers sure youve got em all  every last stick why you know them as well as i do he laughed they say theres five thousanda thousand pounds worth of lumbertimber they call itin the hangers alone  mrs clokes oven must be mended first thing and the kitchen roof i think ill have all this whitewashed sophie broke in pointing to the ceiling the whole place is a scandal lady conant is quite right george when did you begin to fall in love with the house in the greenroom that first day i did  im not in love with it one must do something to mark time till ones fit for work  or when we stood under the oaks and the door opened oh ought i to go to poor igguldens funeral she sighed with utter happiness  wouldnt they call it a liberty now said he  but i liked him  but you didnt own him at the date of his death  that wouldnt keep me away only they made such a fuss about the watchingshe caught her breathit might be ostentatious from that point of view too oh georgeshe reached for his handwere two little orphans moving in worlds not realized and we shall make some bad breaks but were going to have the time of our lives  well run up to london tomorrow and see if we can hurry those english law solicitors i want to get to work  they went they suffered many things ere they returned across the fields in a fly one saturday night nursing a two by twoandahalf box of deeds and mapslawful owners of friars pardon and the five decayed farms therewith  i do most sincerely ope and trust youll be appy madam mrs cloke gasped when she was told the news by the kitchen fire  goodness it isnt a marriage sophie exclaimed a little awed for to them the joke which to an american means work was only just beginning  if its took in a proper spiritmrs clokes eye turned toward her oven  send and have that mended tomorrow sophie whispered  we couldnt elp noticing said cloke slowly from the times you walked there that you an your lady was drawn to it butbut i dont know as we ever precisely thought his wifes glance checked him  that we were that sort of people said george we arent sure of it ourselves yet  perhaps said cloke rubbing his knees just for the sake of saying something perhaps youll park it  whats that said george  turn it all into a fine park like violet hillhe jerked a thumb to westwardthat mr sangres bought it was four farms and mr sangres made a fine park of them with a herd of faller deer  then it wouldnt be friars pardon said sophie would it  i dont know as ive ever heard pardons was ever anything but wheat an wool only some gentlemen say that parks are less trouble than tenants he laughed nervously but the gentry o course they keep on pretty much as they was used to  i see said sophie how did mr sangres make his money  i never rightly heard it was pepper an spices or it may ha been gloves no gloves was sir reginald liss at marley end spices was mr sangres hes a brazilian gentlemanvery sunburnt like  be sure o one thing you wont ave any trouble said mrs cloke just before they went to bed  now the news of the purchase was told to mr and mrs cloke alone at 8 pm of a saturday none left the farm till they set out for church next morning yet when they reached the church and were about to slip aside into their usual seats a little beyond the font where they could see the redfurred tails of the bellropes waggle and twist at ringing time they were swept forward irresistibly a cloke on either flank and yet they had not walked with the clokes upon the everretiring bosom of a blackgowned verger who ushered them into a room of a pew at the head of the left aisle under the pulpit  this he sighed reproachfully is the pardons pew and shut them in  they could see little more than the choir boys in the chancel but to the roots of the hair of their necks they felt the congregation behind mercilessly devouring them by look  when the wicked man turneth away the strong alien voice of the priest vibrated under the hammerbeam roof and a loneliness unfelt before swamped their hearts as they searched for places in the unfamiliar church of england service the lords prayer our father which artset the seal on that desolation sophie found herself thinking how in other lands their purchase would long ere this have been discussed from every point of view in a dozen prints forgetting that george for months had not been allowed to glance at those black and bellowing headlines here was nothing but silencenot even hostility the game was up to them the other players hid their cards and waited suspense she felt was in the air and when her sight cleared saw indeed a mural tablet of a footless bird brooding upon the carven motto wayte awhylewayte awhyle  at the litany george had trouble with an unstable hassock and drew the slip of carpet under the pewseat sophie pushed her end back also and shut her eyes against a burning that felt like tears when she opened them she was looking at her mothers maiden name fairly carved on a blue flagstone on the pew floor ellen lashmar ob 1796 aetat 27  she nudged george and pointed sheltered as they kneeled they looked for more knowledge but the rest of the slab was blank  ever hear of her he whispered  never knew any of us came from here  coincidence  perhaps but it makes me feel better and she smiled and winked away a tear on her lashes and took his hand while they prayed for all women labouring of childnot in the perils of childbirth and the sparrows who had found their way through the guards behind the glass windows chirped above the faded gilt and alabaster family tree of the conants  the baronets pew was on the right of the aisle after service its inhabitants moved forth without haste but so as to block effectively a dusky person with a large family who champed in their rear  spices i think said sophie deeply delighted as the sangres closed up after the conants let em get away george  but when they came out many folk whose eyes were one still lingered by the lychgate  i want to see if any more lashmars are buried here said sophie  not now this seems to be show day come home quickly he replied  a group of families the clokes a little apart opened to let them through the men saluted with jerky nods the women with remnants of a curtsey only igguldens son his mother on his arm lifted his hat as sophie passed  your people said the clear voice of lady conant in her ear  i suppose so said sophie blushing for they were within two yards of her but it was not a question  then that child looks as if it were coming down with mumps you ought to tell the mother she shouldnt have brought it to church  i cant leave er behind my lady the woman said shed set the ouse afire in a minute shes that forward with the matches aint you maudie dear  has dr dallas seen her  not yet my lady  he must you cant get away of course mm my idiotic maid is coming in for her teeth tomorrow at twelve she shall pick her upat gale anstey isnt itat eleven  yes thank you very much my lady  i oughtnt to have done it said lady conant apologetically but there has been no one at pardons for so long that youll forgive my poaching now cant you lunch with us the vicar usually comes too i dont use the horses on a sundayshe glanced at the brazilians silverplated chariot its only a mile across the fields  youyoure very kind said sophie hating herself because her lip trembled  my dear the compelling tone dropped to a soothing gurgle dyou suppose i dont know how it feels to come to a strange countycountry i should sayaway from ones own people when i first left the shiresim shropshire you knowi cried for a day and a night but fretting doesnt make loneliness any better oh heres dora she did sprain her leg that day  im as lame as a tree still said the tall maiden frankly you ought to go out with the otterhounds mrs chapin i believe theyre drawing your water next week  sir walter had already led off george and the vicar came up on the other side of sophie there was no escaping the swift procession or the leisurely lunch where talk came and went in lowvoiced eddies that had the village for their centre sophie heard the vicar and sir walter address her husband lightly as chapin she also remembered many women known in a previous life who habitually addressed their husbands as mr suchanone after lunch lady conant talked to her explicitly of maternity as that is achieved in cottages and farmhouses remote from aid and of the duty thereto of the mistress of pardons  a gate in a beech hedge reached across triple lawns let them out before teatime into the unkempt south side of their land  i want your hand please said sophie as soon as they were safe among the beech boles and the lawless hollies dyou remember the old maid in providence and the guitar who heard the commissary swear and hardly reckoned herself a maiden lady afterward because im a relative of hers lady conant is  did you find out anything about the lashmars he interrupted  i didnt ask im going to write to aunt sydney about it first oh lady conant said something at lunch about their having bought some land from some lashmars a few years ago i found it was at the beginning of last century  what did you say  i said really how interesting like that im not going to push myself forward ive been hearing about mr sangress efforts in that direction and you i couldnt see you behind the flowers was it very deep water dear  george mopped a brow already browned by outdoor exposures  oh nodead easy he answered ive bought friars pardon to prevent sir walters birds straying  a cock pheasant scuttered through the dry leaves and exploded almost under their feet sophie jumped  thats one of em said george calmly  well your nerves are better at any rate said she did you tell em youd bought the thing to play with  no that was where my nerve broke down i only made one bad breaki think i said i couldnt see why hiring land to men to farm wasnt as much a business proposition as anything else  and what did they say  they smiled i shall know what that smile means some day they dont waste their smiles dyou see that track by gale anstey  they looked down from the edge of the hanger over a cuplike hollow people by twos and threes in their sunday best filed slowly along the paths that connected farm to farm  ive never seen so many on our land before said sophie why is it  to show us we mustnt shut up their rights of way  those cowtracks weve been using cross lots said sophie forcibly  yes any one of em would cost us two thousand pounds each in legal expenses to close  but we dont want to she said  the whole community would fight if we did  but its our land we can do what we like  its not our land weve only paid for it we belong to it and it belongs to the peopleour people they call em ive been to lunch with the english too  they passed slowly from one brackendotted field to the nextflushed with pride of ownership plotting alterations and restorations at each turn halting in their tracks to argue spreading apart to embrace two views at once or closing in to consider one couples moved out of their way but smiling covertly  we shall make some bad breaks he said at last  together though you wont let anyone else in will you  except the contractors this syndicate handles this proposition by its little lone  but you might feel the want of some one she insisted  i shallbut it will be you its business sophie but its going to be good fun  please god she answered flushing and cried to herself as they went back to tea its worth it oh its worth it  the repairing and moving into friars pardon was business of the most varied and searching but all done english fashion without friction time and money alone were asked the rest lay in the hands of beneficent advisers from london or spirits male and female called up by mr and mrs cloke from the wastes of the farms in the centre stood george and sophie a little aghast their interests reaching out on every side  i aint sayin anything against londoners said cloke selfappointed clerk of the outer works consulting engineer head of the immigration bureau and superintendent of woods and forests but your own people wont go about to make more than a fair profit out of you  how is one to know said george  five years from now or so on maybe youll be lookin over your first years accounts and knowin what youll know then youll say well billy beartupor old cloke as it might bedid me proper when i was new no man likes to have that sort of thing laid up against him  i think i see said george but five years is a long time to look ahead  i doubt if that oak billy beartup throwed in reubens ghyll will be fit for her drawinroom floor in less than seven cloke drawled  yes thats my work said sophie billy beartup of griffons a woodman by training and birth a tenant farmer by misfortune of marriage had laid his broad axe at her feet a month before sorry if ive committed you to another eternity  and we shant even know where weve gone wrong with your new carriage drive before that time either said cloke ever anxious to keep the balance true with an ounce or two in sophies favour the past four months had taught george better than to reply the carriage road winding up the hill was his present keen interest they set off to look at it and the imported american scraper which had blighted the none too sunny soul of skim winsh the carter  but young iggulden was in charge now and under his guidance buller and roberts the great horses moved mountains  you lif her like that an you tip her like that he explained to the gang my uncle he was roadmaster in connecticut  are they roads yonder said skim sitting under the laurels  no better than accommodation roads dirt they call em theyd suit you skim  why said the incautious skim  cause youd take no hurt when you fall out of your cart drunk on a saturday was the answer  i didnt last time neither skim roared  after the loud laugh old whybarne of gale anstey piped feebly well dirt or no dirt theres no denyin chapin knows a good job when he sees it e dont build one day and deestroy the next like that nigger sangres  shes the one that knows her own mind said pinky brother to skim winsh and a napoleon among carters who had helped to bring the grand piano across the fields in the autumn rains  she had ought to said iggulden whoa buller shes a lashmar they never was doublethinking  oh you found that has the answer come from your uncle said skim doubtful whether so remote a land as america had posts  the others looked at him scornfully skim was always a day behind the fair iggulden rested from his labours shes a lashmar right enough i started up to write to my uncleat oncethe month after she said her folks came from veering holler  where there aint any roads skim interrupted but none laughed  my uncle he married an american woman for his second and she took it up like a like the coroner shes a lashmar out of the old lashmar place fore they sold to conants she aint no toot hill lashmar nor any o the crayford lot her folk come out of the ground here neither chalk nor forest but wildishers they sailed over to americaive got it all writ down by my uncles womanin eighteen hundred an nothing my uncle says theyre all slow begetters like  would they be gentry yonder now skim asked  nahtheres no gentry in america no matter how long youre there its against their law theres only rich and poor allowed theyve been lawyers and such like over yonder for a hundred years but shes a lashmar for all that  lord whats a hundred years said whybarne who had seen seventyeight of them  an they write too from yondermy uncles woman writesthat you can still tell em by headmark their hairs foxyred stillan they throw out when they walk hes intoedtreads like a gipsy but you watch an youll see er throw outlike a colt  your trace wants taking up pinkys large ears had caught the sound of voices and as the two broke through the laurels the men were hard at work their eyes on sophies feet  she had been less fortunate in her inquiries than iggulden for her aunt sydney of meriden a badged and certificated daughter of the revolution to boot answered her inquiries with a twopaged discourse on patriotism the leaflets of a village improvement society of which she was president and a demand for an overdue subscription to a factory girls reading circle sophie burned it all in the orpheus and eurydice grate and kept her own counsel  what i want to know said george when spring was coming and the gardens needed thought is who will ever pay me for my labour ive put in at least half a million dollars worth already  sure youre not taking too much out of yourself his wife asked  oh no i havent been conscious of myself all winter he looked at his brown english gaiters and smiled its all behind me now i believe i could sit down and think of all thatthose months before we sailed  dontah dont she cried  but i must go back one day you dont want to keep me out of business alwaysor do you he ended with a nervous laugh  sophie sighed as she drew her own groundash of old igguldens cutting from the hall rack  arent you overdoing it too you look a little tired he said  you make me tired im going to rocketts to see mrs cloke about mary this was the sister of the telegraphist promoted to be sewingmaid at pardons coming  im due at burnt house to see about the new well by the way theres a sore throat at gale anstey  thats my province dont interfere the whybarne children always have sore throats they do it for jujubes  keep away from gale anstey till i make sure honey cloke ought to have told me  these people dont tell havent you learnt that yet but ill obey me lord see you later  she set off afoot for within the three main roads that bounded the blunt triangle of the estate even by night one could scarcely hear the carts on them wheels were not used except for farm work the footpaths served all other purposes and though at first they had planned improvements they had soon fallen in with the customs of their hidden kingdom and moved about the softfooted ways by woodland hedgerow and shaw as freely as the rabbits indeed for the most part sophie walked bareheaded beneath her helmet of chestnut hair but she had been plagued of late by vague toothaches which she explained to mrs cloke who asked some questions how it came about sophie never knew but after a while behold mrs clokes arm was about her waist and her head was on that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door  my dear my dear the elder woman almost sobbed an dyou mean to tell me you never suspicioned whywhywhere was you ever taught anything at all of course it is its what weve been only waitin for all of us time and again ive said to lady she checked herself an now we shall be as we should be  butbutbut sophie whimpered  an to see you buildin your nest so busypianos and booksan never thinkin of a nursery  no more i did sophie sat bolt upright and began to laugh  time enough yet the fingers tapped thoughtfully on the broad knee butthey must be strangeminded folk over yonder with you have you thought to send for your mother she dead my dear my dear never mind shell be happy where she knows tis gods work an we was only waitin for it for youve never failed in your duty yet it aint your way what did you say about my marys doings mrs clokes face hardened as she pressed her chin on sophies forehead if any of your girls thinks to beave arbitrary now illbut they wont my dear ill see they do their duty too be sure youll ave no trouble  when sophie walked back across the fields heaven and earth changed about her as on the day of old igguldens death for an instant she thought of the wide turn of the staircase and the new ivorywhite paint that no coffin corner could scar but presently the shadow passed in a pure wonder and bewilderment that made her reel she leaned against one of their new gates and looked over their lands for some other stay  well she said resignedly half aloud we must try to make him feel that he isnt a third in our party and turned the corner that looked over friars pardon giddy sick and faint  of a sudden the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had never seen it before lowfronted broadwinged ample prepared by course of generations for all such things as it had steadied her when it lay desolate so now that it had meaning from their few months of life within it soothed and promised good she went alone and quickly into the hall and kissed either doorpost whispering be good to me you know youve never failed in your duty yet  when the matter was explained to george he would have sailed at once to their own land but this sophie forbade  i dont want science she said i just want to be loved and there isnt time for that at home besides she added looking out of the window it would be desertion  george was forced to soothe himself with linking friars pardon to the telegraph system of great britain by telephonethreequarters of a mile of poles put in by whybarne and a few friends one of these was a foreigner from the next parish said he when the line was being run theres an old ellum right in our road shall us throw her  toot hill parish folk neither grace nor good luck god help em old whybarne shouted the local proverb from three poles down the line we aint goin to lay any axeiron to coffinwood here not till we know where we are yet awhile swing round er swing round  to this day then that sudden kink in the straight line across the upper pasture remains a mystery to sophie and george nor can they tell why skim winsh who came to his cottage under dutton shaw most musically drunk at 1045 pm of every saturday night as his father had done before him sang no more at the bottom of the garden steps where sophie always feared he would break his neck the path was undoubtedly an ancient right of way and at 1045 pm on saturdays skim remembered it was his duty to posterity to keep it opentill mrs cloke spoke to him once she spoke likewise to her daughter mary sewing maid at pardons and to marys best new friend the fivefootseven imported london housemaid who taught mary to trim hats and found the country dullish  but there was no noiseat no time was there any noiseand when sophie walked abroad she met no one in her path unless she had signified a wish that way then they appeared to protest that all was well with them and their children their chickens their roofs their watersupply and their sons in the police or the railway service  but dont you find it dull dear said george loyally doing his best not to worry as the months went by  ive been so busy putting my house in order i havent had time to think said she do you  nono if i could only be sure of you  she turned on the green drawingrooms couch it was empire not heppelwhite after all and laid aside a list of linen and blankets  it has changed everything hasnt it she whispered  oh lord yes but i still think if we went back to baltimore  and missed our first real summer together no thank you me lord  but were absolutely alone  isnt that what im doing my best to remedy dont you worry i like itlike it to the marrow of my little bones you dont realize what her house means to a woman we thought we were living in it last year but we hadnt begun to dont you rejoice in your study george  i prefer being here with you he sat down on the floor by the couch and took her hand  seven she said as the french clock struck year before last youd just be coming back from business  he winced at the recollection then laughed business ive been at work ten solid hours today  where did you lunch with the conants  no at dutton shaw sitting on a log with my feet in a swamp but weve found out where the old spring is and were going to pipe it down to gale anstey next year  ill come and see tomorrow oh please open the door dear i want to look down the passage isnt that corner by the stairhead lovely where the sun strikes in she looked through halfclosed eyes at the vista of ivorywhite and pale green all steeped in liquid gold  theres a step out of jane elphicks bedroom she went onand his first step in the world ought to be up i shouldnt wonder if those people hadnt put it there on purpose george will it make any odds to you if hes a girl  he answered as he had many times before that his interest was his wife not the child  then youre the only person who thinks so she laughed dont be silly dear its expected i know its my duty i shant be able to look our people in the face if i fail  what concern is it of theirs confound em  youll see luckily the tradition of the house is boys mrs cloke says so im provided for shall you ever begin to understand these people i shant  and we bought it for funfor fun he groaned and here we are held up for goodness knows how long  why were you thinking of selling it he did not answer do you remember the second mrs chapin she demanded  this was a bold brazen little blackbrowed womana widow for choicewho on sophies death was guilefully to marry george for his wealth and ruin him in a year george being busy sophie had invented her some two years after her marriage and conceived she was alone among wives in so doing  you arent going to bring her up again he asked anxiously  i only want to say that i should hate any one who bought pardons ten times worse than i used to hate the second mrs chapin think what weve put into it of our two selves  at least a couple of million dollars i know i could have made he broke off  the beasts she went on theyd be sure to build a redbrick lodge at the gates and cut the lawn up for bedding out you must leave instructions in your will that hes never to do that george wont you  he laughed and took her hand again but said nothing till it was time to dress then he muttered what the devil use is a mans country to him when he cant do business in it  friars pardon stood faithful to its tradition at the appointed time was born not that third in their party to whom sophie meant to be so kind but a godling in beauty it was manifest excelling eros as in wisdom confucius an enhancer of delights a renewer of companionships and an interpreter of destiny this last george did not realise till he met lady conant striding through dutton shaw a few days after the event  my dear fellow she cried and slapped him heartily on the back i cant tell you how glad we all are oh shell be all right theres never been any trouble over the birth of an heir at pardons now where the dooce is it she felt largely in her leatherboundskirt and drew out a small silver mug i sent a note to your wife about it but my silly ass of a groom forgot to take this you can save me a tramp give her my love she marched off amid her guard of grave airedales  the mug was worn and dented above the twined initials gl was the crest of a footless bird and the motto wayte awhylewayte awhyle  thats the other end of the riddle sophie whispered when he saw her that evening read her note the english write beautiful notes  the warmest of welcomes to your little man i hope he will appreciate his native land now he has come to it though you have said nothing we cannot of course look on him as a little stranger and so i am sending him the old lashmar christening mug it has been with us since gregory lashmar your greatgrandmothers brother   george stared at his wife  go on she twinkled from the pillows  mothers brother sold his place to walters family we seem to have acquired some of your household gods at that time but nothing survives except the mug and the old cradle which i found in the pottingshed and am having put in order for you i hope little georgelashmar he will be too wont hewill live to see his grandchildren cut their teeth on his mug      affectionately yours              alice conant  pshow quiet youve kept about it all  well im  dont swear said sophie bad for the infant mind  but how in the world did she get at it have you ever said a word about the lashmars  you know the only timeto young iggulden at rockettswhen iggulden died  your greatgrandmothers brother shes traced the whole connectionmore than your aunt sydney could do what does she mean about our keeping quiet  sophies eyes sparkled ive thought that out too weve got back at the english at last cant you see that she thought that we thought my mothers being a lashmar was one of those things wed expect the english to find out for themselves and thats impressed her she turned the mug in her white hands and sighed happily wayte awhylewayte awhyle thats not a bad motto george its been worth it  but still i dont quite see  i shouldnt wonder if they dont think our coming here was part of a deeplaid scheme to be near our ancestors theyd understand that and look how theyve accepted us all of them  are we so undesirable in ourselves george grunted  be just me lord that wretched sangres man has twice our money can you see marm conant slapping him between the shoulders not by a jugful the poor beast doesnt exist  do you think its that then he looked toward the cot by the fire where the godling snorted  the minute i get well i shall find out from mrs cloke what every lashmar gives in doles thats nicer than tips every time a lashmite is born ive done my duty thus far but theres much expected of me  entered here mrs cloke and hung worshipping over the cot they showed her the mug and her face shone oh now lady conants sent it itll be all proper maam wont it george of course hed have to be but seein what he is we was hopinall your people was hopinit ud be lashmar too and thatud just round it out a very andsome mug quite unique i should imagine wayte awhylewayte awhyle thats true with the lashmars ive heard very slow to fill their houses they are most like master george wont open is nursery till hes thirty  poor lamb cried sophie but how did you know my folk were lashmars  mrs cloke thought deeply im sure i cant quite say maam but ive a belief likely that it was something you may have let drop to young iggulden when you was at rocketts that may have been what give us an inkling an so it came out one thing in the way o talk leading to another and those american people at veering holler was very obligin with news im told maam  great scott said george under his breath and this is the simple peasant  yiss mrs cloke went on an cloke was only wonderin this afternoonyour pillows slipped my dear you mustnt lie that awayjust for the sake o sayin something whether you wouldnt think well now of getting the lashmar farms back sir they dont rightly round off sir walters estate they come caterin across us more cloke e ud be glad to show you over any day  but sir walter doesnt want to sell does he  we can find out from his bailiff sir butwith cold contempti think that trained nurse is just comin up from her dinner so m afraid well ave to ask you sir now master georgeaiie wake a litty minute lammie  a few months later the three of them were down at the brook in the gale anstey woods to consider the rebuilding of a footbridge carried away by spring floods george lashmar chapin wanted all the bluebells on gods earth that day to eat andsophie adored him in a voice like to the cooing of a dove so business was delayed  heres the place said his father at last among the water forgetmenots but where the deuce are the larchpoles cloke i told you to have them down here ready  well get em down if f you say so cloke answered with a thrust of the underlip they both knew  but i did say so what on earth have you brought that timbertug here for we arent building a railway bridge why in america halfadozen twobyfour bits would be ample  i dont know nothin about that said cloke  an ive nothin to say against larchif you want to make a tempry job of it i aint ere to tell you what isnt so sir an you cant say i ever come creepin up on you or tryin to lead you further in than you set out  a year ago george would have danced with impatience now he scraped a little mud off his old gaiters with his spud and waited  all i say is that you can put up larch and make a tempry job of it and by the time the young masters married itll have to be done again now ive brought down a couple of as sweet sixbyeight oak timbers as weve ever drawed you put em in an its off your mind or good an all tother wayi dont say it aint right im only just sayin what i thinkbut tother way hell no sooner be married than well lave it all to do again youve no call to regard my words but you cant get out of that  no said george after a pause ive been realising that for some time make it oak then we cant get out of it     the recall              i am the land of their fathers                in me the virtue stays             i will bring back my children                after certain days             under their feet in the grasses                my clinging magic runs             they shall return as strangers                they shall remain as sons             over their heads in the branches                of their newbought ancient trees             i weave an incantation                and draw them to my knees             scent of smoke in the evening                smell of rain in the night             the hours the days and the seasons                order their souls aright             till i make plain the meaning                of all my thousand years             till i fill their hearts with knowledge                while i fill their eyes with tears     garma hostage  one night a very long time ago i drove to an indian military cantonment called mian mir to see amateur theatricals at the back of the infantry barracks a soldier his cap over one eye rushed in front of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber as a matter of fact he was a friend of mine so i told him to go home before any one caught him but he fell under the pole and i heard voices of a military guard in search of some one  the driver and i coaxed him into the carriage drove home swiftly undressed him and put him to bed where he waked next morning with a sore headache very much ashamed when his uniform was cleaned and dried and he had been shaved and washed and made neat i drove him back to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling and reported that i had accidentally run over him i did not tell this story to my friends sergeant who was a hostile and unbelieving person but to his lieutenant who did not know us quite so well  three days later my friend came to call and at his heels slobbered and fawned one of the finest bullterriersof the oldfashioned breed two parts bull and one terrierthat i had ever set eyes on he was pure white with a fawncoloured saddle just behind his neck and a fawn diamond at the root of his thin whippy tail i had admired him distantly for more than a year and vixen my own foxterrier knew him too but did not approve  es for you said my friend but he did not look as though he liked parting with him  nonsense that dogs worth more than most men stanley i said  es that and more tention  the dog rose on his hind legs and stood upright for a full minute  eyes right  he sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right at a sign he rose and barked thrice then he shook hands with his right paw and bounded lightly to my shoulder here he made himself into a necktie limp and lifeless hanging down on either side of my neck i was told to pick him up and throw him in the air he fell with a howl and held up one leg  part o the trick said his owner youre going to die now dig yourself your little grave an shut your little eye  still limping the dog hobbled to the gardenedge dug a hole and lay down in it when told that he was cured he jumped out wagging his tail and whining for applause he was put through halfadozen other tricks such as showing how he would hold a man safe i was that man and he sat down before me his teeth bared ready to spring and how he would stop eating at the word of command i had no more than finished praising him when my friend made a gesture that stopped the dog as though he had been shot took a piece of blueruled canteenpaper from his helmet handed it to me and ran away while the dog looked after him and howled i read  siri give you the dog because of what you got me out of he is the best i know for i made him myself and he is as good as a man please do not give him too much to eat and please do not give him back to me for im not going to take him if you will keep him so please do not try to give him back any more i have kept his name back so you can call him anything and he will answer but please do not give him back he can kill a man as easy as anything but please do not give him too much meat he knows more than a man  vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little yap to the bullterriers despairing cry and i was annoyed for i knew that a man who cares for dogs is one thing but a man who loves one dog is quite another dogs are at the best no more than verminous vagrants selfscratchers foul feeders and unclean by the law of moses and mohammed but a dog with whom one lives alone for at least six months in the year a free thing tied to you so strictly by love that without you he will not stir or exercise a patient temperate humorous wise soul who knows your moods before you know them yourself is not a dog under any ruling  i had vixen who was all my dog to me and i felt what my friend must have felt at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving it in my garden however the dog understood clearly enough that i was his master and did not follow the soldier as soon as he drew breath i made much of him and vixen yelling with jealousy flew at him had she been of his own sex he might have cheered himself with a fight but he only looked worriedly when she nipped his deep iron sides laid his heavy head on my knee and howled anew i meant to dine at the club that night but as darkness drew in and the dog snuffed through the empty house like a child trying to recover from a fit of sobbing i felt that i could not leave him to suffer his first evening alone so we fed at home vixen on one side and the strangerdog on the other she watching his every mouthful and saying explicitly what she thought of his table manners which were much better than hers  it was vixens custom till the weather grew hot to sleep in my bed her head on the pillow like a christian and when morning came i would always find that the little thing had braced her feet against the wall and pushed me to the very edge of the cot this night she hurried to bed purposefully every hair up one eye on the stranger who had dropped on a mat in a helpless hopeless sort of way all four feet spread out sighing heavily she settled her head on the pillow several times to show her little airs and graces and struck up her usual whiney singsong before slumber the strangerdog softly edged toward me i put out my hand and he licked it instantly my wrist was between vixens teeth and her warning aaarh said as plainly as speech that if i took any further notice of the stranger she would bite  i caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand shook her severely and said  vixen if you do that again youll be put into the verandah now remember  she understood perfectly but the minute i released her she mouthed my right wrist once more and waited with her ears back and all her body flattened ready to bite the big dogs tail thumped the floor in a humble and peacemaking way  i grabbed vixen a second time lifted her out of bed like a rabbit she hated that and yelled and as i had promised set her out in the verandah with the bats and the moonlight at this she howled then she used coarse languagenot to me but to the bullterriertill she coughed with exhaustion then she ran round the house trying every door then she went off to the stables and barked as though some one were stealing the horses which was an old trick of hers last she returned and her snuffing yelp said ill be good let me in and ill be good  she was admitted and flew to her pillow when she was quieted i whispered to the other dog you can lie on the foot of the bed the bull jumped up at once and though i felt vixen quiver with rage she knew better than to protest so we slept till the morning and they had early breakfast with me bite for bite till the horse came round and we went for a ride i dont think the bull had ever followed a horse before he was wild with excitement and vixen as usual squealed and scuttered and scooted and took charge of the procession  there was one corner of a village near by which we generally passed with caution because all the yellow pariahdogs of the place gathered about it  they were halfwild starving beasts and though utter cowards yet where nine or ten of them get together they will mob and kill and eat an english dog i kept a whip with a long lash for them  that morning they attacked vixen who perhaps of design had moved from beyond my horses shadow  the bull was ploughing along in the dust fifty yards behind rolling in his run and smiling as bullterriers will i heard vixen squeal half a dozen of the curs closed in on her a white streak came up behind me a cloud of dust rose near vixen and when it cleared i saw one tall pariah with his back broken and the bull wrenching another to earth vixen retreated to the protection of my whip and the bull paddled back smiling more than ever covered with the blood of his enemies that decided me to call him garin of the bloody breast who was a great person in his time or garm for short so leaning forward i told him what his temporary name would be he looked up while i repeated it and then raced away i shouted garin he stopped raced back and came up to ask my will  then i saw that my soldier friend was right and that that dog knew and was worth more than a man at the end of the ride i gave an order which vixen knew and hated go away and get washed i said garin understood some part of it and vixen interpreted the rest and the two trotted off together soberly when i went to the back verandah vixen had been washed snowywhite and was very proud of herself but the dogboy would not touch garm on any account unless i stood by so i waited while he was being scrubbed and garm with the soap creaming on the top of his broad head looked at me to make sure that this was what i expected him to endure he knew perfectly that the dogboy was only obeying orders  another time i said to the dogboy you will wash the great dog with vixen when i send them home  does he know said the dogboy who understood the ways of dogs  garm i said another time you will be washed with vixen  i knew that garm understood indeed next washingday when vixen as usual fled under my bed garm stared at the doubtful dogboy in the verandah stalked to the place where he had been washed last time and stood rigid in the tub  but the long days in my office tried him sorely we three would drive off in the morning at halfpast eight and come home at six or later vixen knowing the routine of it went to sleep under my table but the confinement ate into garms soul he generally sat on the verandah looking out on the mall and well i knew what he expected  sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to the fort and garm rolled forth to inspect them or an officer in uniform entered into the office and it was pitiful to see poor garms welcome to the clothnot the man he would leap at him and sniff and bark joyously then run to the door and back again one afternoon i heard him bay with a full throata thing i had never heard beforeand he disappeared when i drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier in white uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end and the garm that met me was a joyous dog this happened twice or thrice a week for a month  i pretended not to notice but garm knew and vixen knew he would glide homewards from the office about four oclock as though he were only going to look at the scenery and this he did so quietly that but for vixen i should not have noticed him the jealous little dog under the table would give a sniff and a snort just loud enough to call my attention to the flight garm might go out forty times in the day and vixen would never stir but when he slunk off to see his true master in my garden she told me in her own tongue that was the one sign she made to prove that garm did not altogether belong to the family they were the best of friends at all times but vixen explained that i was never to forget garm did not love me as she loved me  i never expected it the dog was not my dog could never be my dogand i knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped eight miles a day to see him so it seemed to me that the sooner the two were reunited the better for all one afternoon i sent vixen home alone in the dogcart garm had gone before and rode over to cantonments to find another friend of mine who was an irish soldier and a great friend of the dogs master  i explained the whole case and wound up with  and now stanleys in my garden crying over his dog why doesnt he take him back theyre both unhappy  unhappy theres no sense in the little man any more but tis his fit  what is his fit he travels fifty miles a week to see the brute and he pretends not to notice me when he sees me on the road and im as unhappy as he is make him take the dog back  its his penance hes set himself i told him by way of a joke afther youd run over him so convenient that night whin he was drunki said if he was a catholic hed do penance off he went wid that fit in his little head an a dose of fever an nothin would suit but givin you the dog as a hostage  hostage for what i dont want hostages from stanley  for his good behaviour hes keepin straight now the way its no pleasure to associate wid him  has he taken the pledge  if twas only that i need not care ye can take the pledge for three months on an off he sez hell never see the dog again an so mark you hell keep straight for evermore ye know his fits well this is wan of them hows the dog takin it  like a man hes the best dog in india cant you make stanley take him back  i can do no more than i have done but ye know his fits hes just doin his penance what will he do when he goes to the hills the doctors put him on the list  it is the custom in india to send a certain number of invalids from each regiment up to stations in the himalayas for the hot weather and though the men ought to enjoy the cool and the comfort they miss the society of the barracks down below and do their best to come back or to avoid going i felt that this move would bring matters to a head so i left terrence hopefully though he called after me he wont take the dog sorr you can lay your months pay on that ye know his fits  i never pretended to understand private ortheris and so i did the next best thing i left him alone  that summer the invalids of the regiment to which my friend belonged were ordered off to the hills early because the doctors thought marching in the cool of the day would do them good their route lay south to a place called umballa a hundred and twenty miles or more then they would turn east and march up into the hills to kasauli or dugshai or subathoo i dined with the officers the night before they leftthey were marching at five in the morning it was midnight when i drove into my garden and surprised a white figure flying over the wall  that man said my butler has been here since nine making talk to that dog he is quite mad  i did not tell him to go away because he has been here many times before and because the dogboy told me that if i told him to go away that great dog would immediately slay me he did not wish to speak to the protector of the poor and he did not ask for anything to eat or drink  kadir buksh said i that was well done for the dog would surely have killed thee but i do not think the white soldier will come any more  garm slept ill that night and whimpered in his dreams once he sprang up with a clear ringing bark and i heard him wag his tail till it waked him and the bark died out in a howl he had dreamed he was with his master again and i nearly cried it was all stanleys silly fault  the first halt which the detachment of invalids made was some miles from their barracks on the amritsar road and ten miles distant from my house by a mere chance one of the officers drove back for another good dinner at the club cooking on the line of march is always bad and there i met him he was a particular friend of mine and i knew that he knew how to love a dog properly his pet was a big fat retriever who was going up to the hills for his health and though it was still april the round brown brute puffed and panted in the club verandah as though he would burst  its amazing said the officer what excuses these invalids of mine make to get back to barracks theres a man in my company now asked me for leave to go back to cantonments to pay a debt hed forgotten i was so taken by the idea i let him go and he jingled off in an ekka as pleased as punch ten miles to pay a debt wonder what it was really  if youll drive me home i think i can show you i said  so he went over to my house in his dogcart with the retriever and on the way i told him the story of garm  i was wondering where that brute had gone to hes the best dog in the regiment said my friend i offered the little fellow twenty rupees for him a month ago but hes a hostage you say for stanleys good conduct stanleys one of the best men i have when he chooses  thats the reason why i said a secondrate man wouldnt have taken things to heart as he has done  we drove in quietly at the far end of the garden and crept round the house there was a place close to the wall all grown about with tamarisk trees where i knew garm kept his bones even vixen was not allowed to sit near it in the full indian moonlight i could see a white uniform bending over the dog  goodbye old man we could not help hearing stanleys voice for evings sake dont get bit and go mad by any measly pidog but you can look after yourself old man you dont get drunk an run about ittin your friends you takes your bones an you eats your biscuit an you kills your enemy like a gentleman im goin awaydont owlim goin off to kasauli where i wont see you no more  i could hear him holding garms nose as the dog threw it up to the stars  youll stay here an beave anan ill go away an try to beave an i dont know ow to leave you i dont know  i think this is damn silly said the officer patting his foolish fubsy old retriever he called to the private who leaped to his feet marched forward and saluted  you here said the officer turning away his head  yes sir but im just goin back  i shall be leaving here at eleven in my cart you come with me i cant have sick men running about fall over the place report yourself at eleven here  we did not say much when we went indoors but the officer muttered and pulled his retrievers ears  he was a disgraceful overfed doormat of a dog and when he waddled off to my cookhouse to be fed i had a brilliant idea  at eleven oclock that officers dog was nowhere to be found and you never heard such a fuss as his owner made he called and shouted and grew angry and hunted through my garden for half an hour  then i said  hes sure to turn up in the morning send a man in by rail and ill find the beast and return him  beast said the officer i value that dog considerably more than i value any man i know its all very fine for you to talkyour dogs here  so she wasunder my feetand had she been missing food and wages would have stopped in my house till her return but some people grow fond of dogs not worth a cut of the whip my friend had to drive away at last with stanley in the back seat and then the dogboy said to me  what kind of animal is bullen sahibs dog look at him  i went to the boys hut and the fat old reprobate was lying on a mat carefully chained up he must have heard his master calling for twenty minutes but had not even attempted to join him  he has no face said the dogboy scornfully he is a punniarkooter a spaniel he never tried to get that cloth off his jaws when his master called now vixenbaba would have jumped through the window and that great dog would have slain me with his muzzled mouth it is true that there are many kinds of dogs  next evening who should turn up but stanley the officer had sent him back fourteen miles by rail with a note begging me to return the retriever if i had found him and if i had not to offer huge rewards the last train to camp left at halfpast ten and stanley stayed till ten talking to garm i argued and entreated and even threatened to shoot the bullterrier but the little man was as firm as a rock though i gave him a good dinner and talked to him most severely garm knew as well as i that this was the last time he could hope to see his man and followed stanley like a shadow the retriever said nothing but licked his lips after his meal and waddled off without so much as saying thank you to the disgusted dogboy  so that last meeting was over and i felt as wretched as garm who moaned in his sleep all night when we went to the office he found a place under the table close to vixen and dropped flat till it was time to go home there was no more running out into the verandahs no slinking away for stolen talks with stanley as the weather grew warmer the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart but sat at my side on the seat vixen with her head under the crook of my left elbow and garm hugging the left handrail  here vixen was ever in great form she had to attend to all the moving traffic such as bullockcarts that blocked the way and camels and led ponies as well as to keep up her dignity when she passed low friends running in the dust she never yapped for yappings sake but her shrill high bark was known all along the mall and other mens terriers kiyied in reply and bullockdrivers looked over their shoulders and gave us the road with a grin  but garm cared for none of these things his big eyes were on the horizon and his terrible mouth was shut there was another dog in the office who belonged to my chief we called him bob the librarian because he always imagined vain rats behind the bookshelves and in hunting for them would drag out half the old newspaperfiles bob was a wellmeaning idiot but garm did not encourage him he would slide his head round the door panting rats come along garm and garm would shift one forepaw over the other and curl himself round leaving bob to whine at a most uninterested back the office was nearly as cheerful as a tomb in those days  once and only once did i see garm at all contented with his surroundings he had gone for an unauthorised walk with vixen early one sunday morning and a very young and foolish artilleryman his battery had just moved to that part of the world tried to steal them both vixen of course knew better than to take food from soldiers and besides she had just finished her breakfast so she trotted back with a large piece of the mutton that they issue to our troops laid it down on my verandah and looked up to see what i thought i asked her where garin was and she ran in front of the horse to show me the way  about a mile up the road we came across our artilleryman sitting very stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on his knees garin was in front of him looking rather pleased when the man moved leg or hand garin bared his teeth in silence a broken string hung from his collar and the other half of it lay all warm in the artillerymans still hand he explained to me keeping his eyes straight in front of him that he had met this dog he called him awful names walking alone and was going to take him to the fort to be killed for a masterless pariah  i said that garin did not seem to me much of a pariah but that he had better take him to the fort if he thought best he said he did not care to do so i told him to go to the fort alone he said he did not want to go at that hour but would follow my advice as soon as i had called off the dog i instructed garin to take him to the fort and garm marched him solemnly up to the gate one mile and a half under a hot sun and i told the quarterguard what had happened but the young artilleryman was more angry than was at all necessary when they began to laugh several regiments he was told had tried to steal garm in their time  that month the hot weather shut down in earnest and the dogs slept in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is placed every morning as soon as the man filled my bath the two jumped in and every morning the man filled the bath a second time i said to him that he might as well fill a small tub specially for the dogs nay said he smiling it is not their custom they would not understand besides the big bath gives them more space  the punkahcoolies who pull the punkahs day and night came to know garin intimately he noticed that when the swaying fan stopped i would call out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke if the man still slept i would wake him up he discovered too that it was a good thing to lie in the wave of air under the punkah maybe stanley had taught him all about this in barracks at any rate when the punkah stopped garin would first growl and cock his eye at the rope and if that did not wake the man it nearly always didhe would tiptoe forth and talk in the sleepers ear vixen was a clever little dog but she could never connect the punkah and the coolie so garin gave me grateful hours of cool sleep buthe was utterly wretchedas miserable as a human being and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it and were envious if i moved from one room to another garin followed if my pen stopped scratching garms head was thrust into my hand if i turned half awake on the pillow garm was up and at my side for he knew that i was his only link with his master and day and night and night and day his eyes asked one questionwhen is this going to end  living with the dog as i did i never noticed that he was more than ordinarily upset by the hot weather till one day at the club a man said that dog of yours will die in a week or two hes a shadow then i dosed garin with iron and quinine which he hated and i felt very anxious he lost his appetite and vixen was allowed to eat his dinner under his eyes even that did not make him swallow and we held a consultation on him of the best mandoctor in the place a ladydoctor who cured the sick wives of kings and the deputy inspectorgeneral of the veterinary service of all india they pronounced upon his symptoms and i told them his story and garm lay on a sofa licking my hand  hes dying of a broken heart said the ladydoctor suddenly  pon my word said the deputy inspector general i believe mrs macrae is perfectly right as usual  the best mandoctor in the place wrote a prescription and the veterinary deputy inspectorgeneral went over it afterwards to be sure that the drugs were in the proper dogproportions and that was the first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his prescriptions to be edited it was a strong tonic and it put the dear boy on his feet for a week or two then he lost flesh again i asked a man i knew to take him up to the hills with him when he went and the man came to the door with his kit packed on the top of the carriage garin took in the situation at one red glance the hair rose along his back he sat down in front of me and delivered the most awful growl i have ever heard in the jaws of a dog i shouted to my friend to get away at once and as soon as the carriage was out of the garden garin laid his head on my knee and whined so i knew his answer and devoted myself to getting stanleys address in the hills  my turn to go to the cool came late in august we were allowed thirty days holiday in a year if no one fell sick and we took it as we could be spared my chief and bob the librarian had their holiday first and when they were gone i made a calendar as i always did and hung it up at the head of my cot tearing off one day at a time till they returned vixen had gone up to the hills with me five times before and she appreciated the cold and the damp and the beautiful wood fires there as much as i did  garm i said we are going back to stanley at kasauli kasaulistanley stanley kasauli and i repeated it twenty times it was not kasauli really but another place still i remembered what stanley had said in my garden on the last night and i dared not change the name then garm began to tremble then he barked and then he leaped up at me frisking and wagging his tail  not now i said holding up my hand when i say go well go garm i pulled out the little blanket coat and spiked collar that vixen always wore up in the hills to protect her against sudden chills and thieving leopards and i let the two smell them and talk it over what they said of course i do not know but it made a new dog of garm his eyes were bright and he barked joyfully when i spoke to him he ate his food and he killed his rats for the next three weeks and when he began to whine i had only to say stanleykasauli kasaulistanley to wake him up i wish i had thought of it before  my chief came back all brown with living in the open air and very angry at finding it so hot in the plains that same afternoon we three and kadir buksh began to pack for our months holiday vixen rolling in and out of the bullocktrunk twenty times a minute and garm grinning all over and thumping on the floor with his tail vixen knew the routine of travelling as well as she knew my officework she went to the station singing songs on the front seat of the carriage while garin sat with me she hurried into the railway carriage saw kadir buksh make up my bed for the night got her drink of water and curled up with her blackpatch eye on the tumult of the platform garin followed her the crowd gave him a lane all to himself and sat down on the pillows with his eyes blazing and his tail a haze behind him  we came to umballa in the hot misty dawn four or five men who had been working hard fox eleven months shouting for our dalesthe twohorse travelling carriages that were to take us up to kalka at the foot of the hills it was all new to garm he did not understand carriages where you lay at full length on your bedding but vixen knew and hopped into her place at once garin following the kalka road before the railway was built was about fortyseven miles long and the horses were changed every eight miles most of them jibbed and kicked and plunged but they had to go and they went rather better than usual for garms deep bay in their rear  there was a river to be forded and four bullocks pulled the carriage and vixen stuck her head out of the slidingdoor and nearly fell into the water while she gave directions garin was silent and curious and rather needed reassuring about stanley and kasauli so we rolled barking and yelping into kalka for lunch and garm ate enough for two  after kalka the road wound among the hills and we took a curricle with halfbroken ponies which were changed every six miles no one dreamed of a railroad to simla in those days for it was seven thousand feet up in the air the road was more than fifty miles long and the regulation pace was just as fast as the ponies could go here again vixen led garm from one carriage to the other jumped into the back seat and shouted a cool breath from the snows met us about five miles out of kalka and she whined for her coat wisely fearing a chill on the liver i had had one made for garm too and as we climbed to the fresh breezes i put it on and arm chewed it uncomprehendingly but i think he was grateful  hiyiyiyi sang vixen as we shot round the curves toottoottoot went the drivers bugle at the dangerous places and yow yow bayed garm kadir buksh sat on the front seat and smiled even he was glad to get away from the heat of the plains that stewed in the haze behind us now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work again and he would say whats it like below and i would shout hotter than cinders whats it like up above and he would shout back just perfect and away we would go  suddenly kadir buksh said over his shoulder here is solon and garm snored where he lay with his head on my knee solon is an unpleasant little cantonment but it has the advantage of being cool and healthy it is all bare and windy and one generally stops at a resthouse nearby for something to eat i got out and took both dogs with me while kadir buksh made tea a soldier told us we should find stanley out there nodding his head towards a bare bleak hill  when we climbed to the top we spied that very stanley who had given me all this trouble sitting on a rock with his face in his hands and his overcoat hanging loose about him i never saw anything so lonely and dejected in my life as this one little man crumpled up and thinking on the great gray hillside  here garm left me  he departed without a word and so far as i could see without moving his legs he flew through the air bodily and i heard the whack of him as he flung himself at stanley knocking the little man clean over they rolled on the ground together shouting and yelping and hugging i could not see which was dog and which was man till stanley got up and whimpered  he told me that he had been suffering from fever at intervals and was very weak he looked all he said but even while i watched both man and dog plumped out to their natural sizes precisely as dried apples swell in water garin was on his shoulder and his breast and feet all at the same time so that stanley spoke all through a cloud of garingulping sobbing slavering garm he did not say anything that i could understand except that he had fancied he was going to die but that now he was quite well and that he was not going to give up garin any more to anybody under the rank of beelzebub  then he said he felt hungry and thirsty and happy  we went down to tea at the resthouse where stanley stuffed himself with sardines and raspberry jam and beer and cold mutton and pickles when garm wasnt climbing over him and then vixen and i went on  garm saw how it was at once he said goodbye to me three times giving me both paws one after another and leaping on to my shoulder he further escorted us singing hosannas at the top of his voice a mile down the road then he raced back to his own master  vixen never opened her mouth but when the cold twilight came and we could see the lights of simla across the hills she snuffled with her nose at the breast of my ulster i unbuttoned it and tucked her inside then she gave a contented little sniff and fell fast asleep her head on my breast till we bundled out at simla two of the four happiest people in all the world that night     the power of the dog         there is sorrow enough in the natural way        from men and women to fill our day        but when we are certain of sorrow in store        why do we always arrange for more        brothers and sisters i bid you beware        of giving your heart to a dog to tear         buy a pup and your money will buy        love unflinching that cannot lie        perfect passion and worship fed        by a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head        nevertheless it is hardly fair        to risk your heart for a dog to tear         when the fourteen years which nature permits        are closing in asthma or tumour or fits        and the vets unspoken prescription runs        to lethal chambers or loaded guns        then you will findits your own affair        but youve given your heart to a dog to tear         when the body that lived at your single will        when the whimper of welcome is stilled how still        when the spirit that answered your every mood        is gone wherever it goesfor good        you will discover how much you care        and will give your heart to a dog to tear         weve sorrow enough in the natural way        when it comes to burying christian clay        our loves are not given but only lent        at compound interest of cent per cent        though it is not always the case i believe        that the longer weve kept em the more do we grieve        for when debts are payable right or wrong        a shorttime loan is as bad as a long        so why in heaven before we are there        should we give our hearts to a dog to tear     the mother hive  if the stock had not been old and overcrowded the waxmoth would never have entered but where bees are too thick on the comb there must be sickness or parasites the heat of the hive had risen with the june honeyflow and though the farmers worked until their wings ached to keep people cool everybody suffered  a young bee crawled up the greasy trampled alightingboard excuse me she began but its my first honeyflight could you kindly tell me if this is my  own hive the guard snapped yes buzz in and be foulbrooded to you next  shame cried half a dozen old workers with worn wings and nerves and there was a scuffle and a hum  the little grey waxmoth pressed close in a crack in the alightingboard had waited this chance all day she scuttled in like a ghost and knowing the senior bees would turn her out at once dodged into a broodframe where youngsters who had not yet seen the winds blow or the flowers nod discussed life here she was safe for young bees will tolerate any sort of stranger behind her came the bee who had been slanged by the guard  what is the world like melissa said a companion cruel i brought in a full load of firstclass stuff and the guard told me to go and be foulbrooded she sat down in the cool draught across the combs  if youd only heard said the waxmoth silkily the insolence of the guards tone when she cursed our sister it aroused the entire community she laid an egg she had stolen in for that purpose  there was a bit of a fuss on the gate melissa chuckled you were there miss she did not know how to address the slim stranger  dont call me miss im a sister to all in afflictionjust a workingsister my heart bled for you beneath your burden the waxmoth caressed melissa with her soft feelers and laid another egg  you mustnt lay here cried melissa you arent a queen  my dear child i give you my most solemn word of honour those arent eggs those are my principles and i am ready to die for them she raised her voice a little above the rustle and tramp round her if youd like to kill me pray do  dont be unkind melissa said a young bee impressed by the chaste folds of the waxmoths wing which hid her ceaseless eggdropping  i havent done anything melissa answered shes doing it all  ah dont let your conscience reproach you later but when youve killed me write me at least as one that loved her fellowworker  laying at every sob the waxmoth backed into a crowd of young bees and left melissa bewildered and annoyed so she lifted up her little voice in the darkness and cried stores till a gang of cellfillers hailed her and she left her load with them  im afraid i foulbrooded you just now said a voice over her shoulder id been on the gate for three hours and one would foulbrood the queen herself after that no offence meant  none taken melissa answered cheerily i shall be on guard myself some day whats next to do  theres a rumour of deaths head moths about send a gang of youngsters to the gate and tell them to narrow it in with a couple of stout scrapwax pillars itll make the hive hot but we cant have deaths headers in the middle of our honeyflow  my only wings i should think not melissa had all a sound bees hereditary hatred against the big squeaking feathery thief of the hives tumble out she called across the youngsters quarters all you who arent feeding babies show a leg scrapwax pillars for the gaate she chanted the order at length  thats nonsense a downy dayold bee answered in the first place i never heard of a deaths header coming into a hive people dont do such things in the second building pillars to keep em out is purely a cypriote trick unworthy of british bees in the third if you trust a deaths head he will trust you pillarbuilding shows lack of confidence our dear sister in grey says so  yes pillars are unenglish and provocative and a waste of wax that is needed for higher and more practical ends said the waxmoth from an empty storecell  the safety of the hive is the highest thing ive ever heard of you mustnt teach us to refuse work melissa began  you misunderstand me as usual love works the essence of life but to expend precious unreturning vitality and real labour against imaginary danger that is heartbreakingly absurd if i can only teach aa little tolerationa little ordinary kindness here toward that absurd old bogey you call the deaths header i shant have lived in vain  she hasnt lived in vain the darling cried twenty bees together you should see her saintly life melissa she just devotes herself to spreading her principles andandshe looks lovely  an old baldish bee came up the comb  pillarworkers for the gate get out and chew scraps buzz off she said the waxmoth slipped aside  the young bees trooped down the frame whispering whats the matter with em said the oldster why do they call each other ducky and darling must be the weather she sniffed suspiciously horrid stuffy smell here like stale quilts not waxmoth i hope melissa  not to my knowledge said melissa who of course only knew the waxmoth as a lady with principles and had never thought to report her presence she had always imagined waxmoths to be like bloodred dragonflies  you had better fan out this corner for a little said the old bee and passed on melissa dropped her head at once took firm hold with her forefeet and fanned obediently at the regulation stroke three hundred beats to the second fanning tries a bees temper because she must always keep in the same place where she never seems to be doing any good and all the while she is wearing out her only wings when a bee cannot fly a bee must not live and a bee knows it the waxmoth crept forth and caressed melissa again  i see she murmured that at heart you are one of us  i work with the hive melissa answered briefly  its the same thing we and the hive are one  then why are your feelers different from ours dont cuddle so  dont be provincial carissima you cant have all the world alikeyet  but why do you lay eggs melissa insisted you lay em like a queenonly you drop them in patches all over the place ive watched you  ah brighteyes so youve pierced my little subterfuge yes they are eggs by and by theyll spread our principles arent you glad  you gave me your most solemn word of honour that they were not eggs  that was my little subterfuge dearestfor the sake of the cause now i must reach the young the waxmoth tripped towards the fourth broodframe where the young bees were busy feeding the babies  it takes some time for a sound bee to realize a malignant and continuous lie shes very sweet and feathery was all that melissa thought but her talk sounds like ivy honey tastes id better get to my fieldwork again  she found the gate in a sulky uproar the youngsters told off to the pillars had refused to chew scrapwax because it made their jaws ache and were clamouring for virgin stuff  anything to finish the job said the badgered guards hang up some of you and make wax for these slackjawed sisters  before a bee can make wax she must fill herself with honey then she climbs to safe foothold and hangs while other gorged bees hang on to her in a cluster there they wait in silence till the wax comes the scales are either taken out of the makers pockets by the workers or tinkle down on the workers while they wait the workers chew them they are useless unchewed into the allsupporting allembracing wax of the hive  but now no sooner was the waxcluster in position than the workers below broke out again  come down they cried come down and work come on you levantine parasites dont think to enjoy yourselves up there while were sweating down here  the cluster shivered as from hooked forefoot to hooked hindfoot it telegraphed uneasiness at last a worker sprang up grabbed the lowest waxmaker and swung kicking above her companions  i can make wax too she bawled give me a full gorge and ill make tons of it  make it then said the bee she had grappled the spoken word snapped the current through the cluster it shook and glistened like a cats fur in the dark unhook it murmured no wax for any one today  you lazy thieves hang up at once and produce our wax said the bees below  impossible the sweats gone to make your wax we must have stillness warmth and food unhook unhook  they broke up as they murmured and disappeared among the other bees from whom of course they were undistinguishable  seems as if wed have to chew scrapwax for these pillars after all said a worker  not by a whole comb cried the young bee who had broken the cluster listen here ive studied the question more than twenty minutes its as simple as falling off a daisy youve heard of cheshire root and langstroth  they had not but they shouted good old langstroth just the same  those three know all that there is to be known about making hives one or tother of em must have made ours and if theyve made it theyre bound to look after it ours is a guaranteed patent hive you can see it on the label behind  good old guarantee hurrah for the label behind roared the bees  well such being the case i say that when we find theyve betrayed us we can exact from them a terrible vengeance  good old vengeance good old root nuff said chuck it the crowd cheered and broke away as melissa dived through  dyou know where langstroth root and cheshire live if you happen to want em she asked of the proud panting orator  gum me if i know they ever lived at all but arent they beautiful names to buzz about did you see how it worked up the sisterhood  yes but it didnt defend the gate she replied  ah perhaps thats true but think how delicate my position is sister ive a magnificent appetite and i dont like working its bad for the mind my instinct tells me that i can act as a restraining influence on others they would have been worse but for me  but melissa had already risen clear and was heading for a breadth of virgin white clover which to an overtired bee is as soothing as plain knitting to a woman  i think ill take this load to the nurseries she said when she had finished it was always quiet there in my day and she topped off with two little pats of pollen for the babies  she was met on the fourth broodcomb by a rush of excited sisters all buzzing together  one at a time let me put down my load now what is it sacharissa she said  grey sisterthat fluffy one i meanshe came and said we ought to be out in the sunshine gathering honey because life was short she said any old bee could attend to our babies and some day old bees would that isnt true melissa is it no old bees can take us away from our babies can they  of course not you feed the babies while your heads are soft when your heads harden you go on to fieldwork any one knows that  we told her so we told her so but she only waved her feelers and said we could all lay eggs like queens if we chose and im afraid lots of the weaker sisters believe her and are trying to do it so unsettling  sacharissa sped to a sealed workercell whose lid pulsated as the bee within began to cut its way out  come along precious she murmured and thinned the frail top from the other side a pale damp creased thing hoisted itself feebly on to the comb sacharissas note changed at once no time to waste go up the frame and preen yourself she said report for nursingduty in my ward tomorrow evening at six stop a minute whats the matter with your third right leg  the young bee held it out in silenceunmistakably a drone leg incapable of packing pollen  thank you you neednt report till the day after tomorrow sacharissa turned to her companion thats the fifth oddity hatched in my ward since noon i dont like it  theres always a certain number of em said melissa you cant stop a few working sisters from laying now and then when they overfeed themselves they only raise dwarf drones  but were hatching out drones with workers stomachs workers with drones stomachs and albinoes and mixedleggers who cant pack pollenlike that poor little beast yonder i dont mind dwarf drones any more than you do they all die in july but this steady hatch of oddities frightens me melissa  how narrow of you they are all so delightfully clever and unusual and interesting piped the waxmoth from a crack above them come here you dear downy duck and tell us all about your feelings  i wish shed go sacharissa lowered her voice she meets theseeroddities as they dry out and cuddles em in corners  i suppose the truth is that were overstocked and too well fed to swarm said melissa  that is the truth said the queens voice behind them they had not heard the heavy royal footfall which sets empty cells vibrating sacharissa offered her food at once she ate and dragged her weary body forward can you suggest a remedy she said  new principles cried the waxmoth from her crevice well apply them quietly later  suppose we sent out a swarm melissa suggested its a little late but it might ease us off  it would save us buti know the hive you shall see for yourself the old queen cried the swarming cry which to a bee of good blood should be what the trumpet was to jobs warhorse in spite of her immense age three years it rang between the canonlike frames as a pibroch rings in a mountain pass the fanners changed their note and repeated it up in every gallery and the broadwinged drones burly and eager ended it on one nervethrilling outbreak of bugles la reine le veult swarm swarrm swarrrm  but the roar which should follow the call was wanting they heard a broken grumble like the murmur of a falling tide  swarm what for catch me leaving a good barframe hive with fixed foundations for a rotten old oak out in the open where it may rain any minute were all right its a patent guaranteed hive why do they want to turn us out swarming be gummed swarming was invented to cheat a worker out of her proper comforts come on off to bed  the noise died out as the bees settled in empty cells for the night  you hear said the queen i know the hive  quite between ourselves i taught them that cried the waxmoth wait till my principles develop and youll see the light from a new quarter  you speak truth for once the queen said suddenly for she recognized the waxmoth that light will break into the top of the hive a hot smoke will follow it and your children will not be able to hide in any crevice  is it possible melissa whispered iwe have sometimes heard a legend like it  it is no legend the old queen answered i had it from my mother and she had it from hers after the waxmoth has grown strong a shadow will fall across the gate a voice will speak from behind a veil there will be light and hot smoke and earthquakes and those who live will see everything that they have done all together in one place burned up in one great fire the old queen was trying to tell what she had been told of the bee masters dealings with an infected hive in the apiary two or three seasons ago and of course from her point of view the affair was as important as the day of judgment  and then asked horrified sacharissa  then i have heard that a little light will burn in a great darkness and perhaps the world will begin again myself i think not  tut tut the waxmoth cried you good fat people always prophesy ruin if things dont go exactly your way but i grant you there will be changes  there were when her eggs hatched the wax was riddled with little tunnels coated with the dirty clothes of the caterpillars flannelly lines ran through the honeystores the pollenlarders the foundations and worst of all through the babies in their cradles till the sweeper guards spent half their time tossing out useless little corpses the lines ended in a maze of sticky webbing on the face of the comb the caterpillars could not stop spinning as they walked and as they walked everywhere they smarmed and garmed everything even where it did not hamper the bees feet the stale sour smell of the stuff put them off their work though some of the bees who had taken to egg laying said it encouraged them to be mothers and maintain a vital interest in life  when the caterpillars became moths they made friends with the everincreasing odditiesalbinoes mixedleggers singleeyed composites faceless drones halfqueens and laying sisters and the everdwindling band of the old stock worked themselves bald and fraywinged to feed their queer charges most of the oddities would not and many on account of their malformations could not go through a days fieldwork but the waxmoths who were always busy on the broodcomb found pleasant home occupations for them one albino for instance divided the number of pounds of honey in stock by the number of bees in the hive and proved that if every bee only gathered honey for seven and three quarter minutes a day she would have the rest of the time to herself and could accompany the drones on their mating flights the drones were not at all pleased  another an eyeless drone with no feelers said that all broodcells should be perfect circles so as not to interfere with the grub or the workers he proved that the old sixsided cell was solely due to the workers building against each other on opposite sides of the wall and that if there were no interference there would be no angles some bees tried the new plan for a while and found it cost eight times more wax than the old six sided specification and as they never allowed a cluster to hang up and make wax in peace real wax was scarce however they eked out their task with varnish stolen from new coffins at funerals and it made them rather sick then they took to cadging round sugarfactories and breweries because it was easiest to get their material from those places and the mixture of glucose and beer naturally fermented in store and blew the storecells out of shape besides smelling abominably some of the sound bees warned them that illgotten gains never prosper but the oddities at once surrounded them and balled them to death that was a punishment they were almost as fond of as they were of eating and they expected the sound bees to feed them curiously enough the ageold instinct of loyalty and devotion towards the hive made the sound bees do this though their reason told them they ought to slip away and unite with some other healthy stock in the apiary  what about seven and threequarter minutes work now said melissa one day as she came in ive been at it for five hours and ive only half a load  oh the hive subsists on the hival honey which the hive produces said a blind oddity squatting in a storecell  but honey is gathered from flowers outside two miles away sometimes cried melissa  pardon me said the blind thing sucking hard but this is the hive is it not  it was worse luck it is  and the hival honey is here is it not it opened a fresh storecell to prove it  yees but it wont be long at this rate said melissa  the rates have nothing to do with it this hive produces the hival honey you people never seem to grasp the economic simplicity that underlies all life  oh me said poor melissa havent you ever been beyond the gate  certainly not a fools eyes are in the ends of the earth mine are in my head it gorged till it bloated  melissa took refuge in her poorly paid fieldwork and told sacharissa the story  hut said that wise bee fretting with an old maid of a thistle tell us something new the hives full of such as himit i mean  whats the end to be all the honey going out and none coming in things cant last this way said melissa  who cares said sacharissa i know now how drones feel the day before theyre killed a short life and a merry one for me  if it only were merry but think of those awful solemn lopsided oddities waiting for us at home crawling and clambering and preachingand dirtying things in the dark  i dont mind that so much as their silly songs after weve fed em all about work among the merry merry blossoms said sacharissa from the deeps of a stale canterbury bell  i do hows our queen said melissa  cheerfully hopeless as usual but she lays an egg now and then  does she so melissa backed out of the next bell with a jerk suppose now we sound workers tried to raise a princess in some clean corner  youd be put to it to find one the hives all waxmoth and muckings butwell  a princess might help us in the time of the voice behind the veil that the queen talks of and anything is better than working for oddities that chirrup about work that they cant do and waste what we bring home  who cares said sacharissa im with you for the fun of it the oddities would ball us to death if they knew come home and well begin  there is no room to tell how the experienced melissa found a faroff frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cellbuilding experiments that for very shame the bees never went there how in that ruin she blocked out a royal cell of sound wax but disguised by rubbish till it looked like a kopje among deserted kopjes how she prevailed upon the hopeless queen to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg how the queen obeyed and died how her spent carcass was flung out on the rubbish heap and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping droneeggs where they listed and said there was no more need of queens how covered by this confusion sacharissa educated certain young bees to educate certain newborn bees in the almost lost art of making royal jelly how the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill winds how the hidden egg hatched trueno drone but blood royal how it was capped and how desperately they worked to feed and doublefeed the now swarming oddities lest any break in the foodsupplies should set them to instituting inquiries which with songs about work was their favourite amusement how in an auspicious hour on a moonless night the princess came forth a princess indeed and how melissa smuggled her into a dark empty honeymagazine to bide her time and how the drones knowing she was there went about singing the deep disreputable lovesongs of the old daysto the scandal of the laying sisters who do not think well of drones these things are written in the book of queens which is laid up in the hollow of the great ash ygdrasil  after a few days the weather changed again and became glorious even the oddities would now join the crowd that hung out on the alightingboard and would sing of work among the merry merry blossoms till an untrained ear might have received it for the hum of a working hive yet in truth their storehoney had been eaten long ago they lived from day to day on the efforts of the few sound bees while the waxmoth fretted and consumed again their already ruined wax but the sound bees never mentioned these matters they knew if they did the oddities would hold a meeting and ball them to death  now you see what we have done said the waxmoths we have created new material a new convention a new type as we said we would  and new possibilities for us said the laying sisters gratefully you have given us a new lifes work vital and paramount  more than that chanted the oddities in the sunshine you have created a new heaven and a new earth heaven cloudless and accessible it was a perfect august evening and earth teeming with the merry merry blossoms waiting only our honest toil to turn them all to good theeraster and the crocus and theerladies smock in her season the chrysanthemum after her kind and the guelder rose bringing forth abundantly withal  oh holy hymettus said melissa awestruck i knew they didnt know how honey was made but theyve forgotten the order of the flowers what will become of them  a shadow fell across the alightingboard as the bee master and his son came by the oddities crawled in and a voice behind a veil said ive neglected the old hive too long give me the smoker  melissa heard and darted through the gate come oh come she cried it is the destruction the old queen foretold princess come  really you are too archaic for words said an oddity in an alleyway a cloud i admit may have crossed the sun but why hysterics above all why princesses so late in the day are you aware its the hival teatime lets sing grace  melissa clawed past him with all six legs sacharissa had run to what was left of the fertile broodcomb down and out she called across the brown breadth of it nurses guards fanners sweepersout  never mind the babies theyre better deadout before the light and the hot smoke  the princesss first clear fearless call melissa had found her rose and drummed through all the frames la reine le veult swarm swarrm swarrrm  the hive shook beneath the shattering thunder of a stuckdown quilt being torn back  dont be alarmed dears said the waxmoths thats our work look up and youll see the dawn of the new day  light broke in the top of the hive as the queen had prophesiednaked light on the boiling bewildered bees  sacharissa rounded up her rearguard which dropped headlong off the frame and joined the princesss detachment thrusting toward the gate now panic was in full blast and each sound bee found herself embraced by at least three oddities the first instinct of a frightened bee is to break into the stores and gorge herself with honey but there were no stores left so the oddities fought the sound bees  you must feed us or we shall die they cried holding and clutching and slipping while the silent scared earwigs and little spiders twisted between their legs think of the hive traitors the holy hive  you should have thought before cried the sound bees stay and see the dawn of your new day  they reached the gate at last over the soft bodies of many to whom they had ministered  on out up roared melissa in the princesss ear for the hives sake to the old oak  the princess left the alightingboard circled once flung herself at the lowest branch of the old oak and her little loyal swarmyou could have covered it with a pint mugfollowed hooked and hung  hold close melissa gasped the old legends have come true look  the hive was half hidden by smoke and figures moved through the smoke they heard a frame crack stickily saw it heaved high and twirled round between enormous handsa blotched bulged and perished horror of grey wax corrupt brood and small dronecells all covered with crawling oddities strange to the sun  why this isnt a hive this is a museum of curiosities said the voice behind the veil it was only the bee master talking to his son  can you blame em father said a second voice its rotten with waxmoth see here  another frame came up a finger poked through it and it broke away in rustling flakes of ashy rottenness  number four frame that was your mothers pet comb once whispered melissa to the princess manys the good egg ive watched her lay there  arent you confusing pod hoc with propter hoc said the bee master waxmoth only succeed when weak bees let them in a third frame crackled and rose into the light all this is full of laying workers brood that never happens till the stocks weakened phew  he beat it on his knee like a tambourine and it also crumbled to pieces  the little swarm shivered as they watched the dwarf dronegrubs squirm feebly on the grass many sound bees had nursed on that frame well knowing their work was useless but the actual sight of even useless work destroyed disheartens a good worker  no they have some recuperative power left said the second voice heres a queen cell  but its tucked away amongwhat on earth has come to the little wretches they seem to have lost the instinct of cellbuilding the father held up the frame where the bees had experimented in circular cellwork it looked like the pitted head of a decaying toadstool  not altogether the son corrected theres one line at least of perfectly good cells  my work said sacharissa to herself im glad man does me justice before  that frame too was smashed out and thrown atop of the others and the foul earwiggy quilts  as frame after frame followed it the swarm beheld the upheaval exposure and destruction of all that had been well or ill done in every cranny of their hive for generations past there was black comb so old that they had forgotten where it hung orange buff and ochrevarnished storecomb built as bees were used to build before the days of artificial foundations and there was a little white frail new work there were sheets on sheets of level even broodcomb that had held in its time unnumbered thousands of unnamed workers patches of obsolete dronecomb broad and highshouldered showing to what marks the male grub was expected to grow and twoinch deep honeymagazines empty but still magnificent the whole gummed and glued into twisted scrapwork awry on the wires halfcells beginnings abandoned or grandiose weakwalled composite cells pieced out with rubbish and capped with dirt  good or bad every inch of it was so riddled by the tunnels of the waxmoth that it broke in clouds of dust as it was flung on the heap  oh see cried sacharissa the great burning that our queen foretold who can bear to look  a flame crawled up the pile of rubbish and they smelt singeing wax  the figures stooped lifted the hive and shook it upside down over the pyre a cascade of oddities chips of broken comb scale fluff and grubs slid out crackled sizzled popped a little and then the flames roared up and consumed all that fuel  we must disinfect said a voice get me a sulphurcandle please  the shell of the hive was returned to its place a light was set in its sticky emptiness tier by tier the figures built it up closed the entrance and went away the swarm watched the light leaking through the cracks all the long night at dawn one waxmoth came by fluttering impudently  there has been a miscalculation about the new day my dears she began one cant expect people to be perfect all at once that was our mistake  no the mistake was entirely ours said the princess  pardon me said the waxmoth when you think of the enormous upheavalcall it good or badwhich our influence brought about you will admit that we and we alone  you said the princess our stock was not strong so you cameas any other disease might have come hang close all my people  when the sun rose veiled figures came down and saw their swarm at the boughs end waiting patiently within sight of the old hivea handful but prepared to go on     the bees and the flies               a farmer of the augustan age              perused in virgils golden page              the story of the secret won              from proteus by cyrenes son              how the dank seagod sowed the swain              means to restore his hives again              more briefly how a slaughtered bull              breeds honey by the bellyful               the egregious rustic put to death              a bull by stopping of its breath              disposed the carcass in a shed              with fragrant herbs and branches spread              and having thus performed the charm              sat down to wait the promised swarm               nor waited long the god of day              impartial quickening with his ray              evil and good alike beheld              the carcassand the carcass swelled              big with new birth the belly heaves              beneath its screen of scented leaves              past any doubt the bull conceives               the farmer bids men bring more hives              to house the profit that arrives              prepares on pan

in which it appeared  a nine oclock of a gusty winter night i stood on the lower stages of one of the gpo outward mail towers my purpose was a run to quebec in postal packet 162 or such other as may be appointed and the postmastergeneral himself countersigned the order this talisman opened all doors even those in the despatchingcaisson at the foot of the tower where they were delivering the sorted continental mail the bags lay packed close as herrings in the long grey underbodies which our gpo still calls coaches five such coaches were filled as i watched and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars  from the despatchingcaisson i was conducted by a courteous and wonderfully learned official mr ll geary second despatcher of the western routeto the captains room this wakes an echo of old romance where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty he introduces me to the captain of 162captain purnall and his relief captain hodgson the one is small and dark the other large and red but each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and aeronauts you can see it in the pictures of our racing professionals from lv rautsch to little ada warrleighthat fathomless abstraction of eyes habitually turned through naked space  on the noticeboard in the captains room the pulsing arrows of some twenty indicators register degree by geographical degree the progress of as many homewardbound packets the word cape rises across the face of a dial a gong strikes the south african midweekly mail is

captain purnall and we are shot up by the passengerlift to the top of the despatchtowers our coach will lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard  no 162 waits for us in slip e of the topmost stage the great curve of her back shines frostily under the lights and some minute alteration of trim makes her rock a little in her holdingdown slips  captain purnall frowns and dives inside

forwarda touch on the wheel will sufficeand she sweeps at your good direction up or down open the complete circle and she presents to the air a mushroomhead that will bring her up all standing within a half mile  yes says captain hodgson answering my thought castelli thought hed discovered the secret of controlling aeroplanes when hed only found out how to steer dirigible balloons magniac invented his rudder to help warboats ram each other and war went out of fashion and magniac he went out of his mind because he said he couldnt serve his country any more i wonder if any of us ever know what were really doing  if you want to see the coach locked youd better go aboard its due now says mr geary i enter through the door amidships there is nothing here for display the inner skin of the

rudder or our flight would become a climb to the stars captain purnall prefers an overlifted to an underlifted ship but no two captains trim ship alike when i take the bridge says captain hodgson youll see me shunt forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper rudder with a swoop upward instead of a swoop downward as you say either way will do its only habit watch our dipdial tim fetches her down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing  so is it shown on the dipdial for five or six minutes the arrow creeps from 6700 to 7300 there is the faint szgee of the rudder and back slides the arrow to 6000 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots  in heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well says captain hodgson and unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engineroom from the bare deck he leads me on to the floor here we find fleurys paradox of the bulkheaded vacuumwhich we accept now without thoughtliterally in full blast the three engines are htt assistedvacuo fleury turbines running from 3000 to the limitthat is to say up to the point when the blades make the air bellcut out a vacuum for themselves precisely as overdriven marine propellers used to do 162s limit is low on account of the small size of her nine screws which though handier than the old colloid thelussons bell sooner the midships engine generally used as a reinforce is not running so the port and starboard turbine vacuumchambers draw direct into the returnmains  the turbines whistle reflectively from the lowarched expansiontanks on either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbinechests and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a power saw behind is its own pressure held in leash of spurred on by the liftshunts before it the vacuum where fleurys ray dances in violetgreen bands and whirled turbillons of flame the jointed utubes of the vacuumchamber are pressuretempered colloid no glass would endure the strain for an instant and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the ray intently it is the very heart of the machinea mystery to this day even fleury who begat it and unlike magniac died a multimillionaire could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the utube can in the fractional fraction of a second strike the furious blast of gas into a chill greyishgreen liquid that drains you can hear it trickle from the far end of the vacuum through the eductionpipes and the mains back to the bilges here it returns to its gaseous one had almost written sagacious state and climbs to work afresh bilgetank upper tank dorsaltank expansionchamber vacuum mainreturn as a liquid and bilgetank once more is the ordained cycle fleurys ray sees to that and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to fleurys ray if a speck of oil if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded terminals fleurys ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again this means half a days work for all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventyodd pounds to the gpo for radiumsalts and such trifles  now look at our thrustcollars you wont find much german compo there fulljewelled you see says captain hodgson as the engineer shunts open the top of a cap our shaftbearings are cmc commercial minerals company stones ground with as much care as the lens of a telescope they cost l837 apiece so far we have not arrived at their term of life these bearings came from no 97 which took them over from the old dominion of light which had them out of the wreck of the persew aeroplane in the years when men still flew wooden kites over oil engines  they are a shining reproof to all lowgrade german ruby enamels socalled boort facings and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina compounds which please dividendhunting owners and turn skippers crazy the ruddergear and the gas liftshunt seated side by side under the engineroom dials are the only machines in visible motion the former sighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch the latter cased and guarded like the utube aft exhibits another fleury ray but inverted and more green than violet its function is to shunt the lift out of the gas and this it will do without watching that is all a tiny pumprod wheezing and whining to itself beside a sputtering green lamp a hundred and fifty feet aft down the flattopped tunnel of the tanks a violet light restless and irresolute between the two three whitepainted turbinetrunks like eelbaskets laid on their side accentuate the empty perspectives you can hear the trickle of the liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the bilgetanks and the soft gluckglock of gaslocks closing as captain purnall brings 162 down by the head the hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our skin is no more than a cottonwool wrapping to the universal stillness and we are running an eighteensecond mile  i peer from the fore end of the engineroom over the hatchcoamings into the coach the mailclerks are sorting the winnipeg calgary and medicine hat bags but there is a pack of cards ready on the table  suddenly a bell thrills the engineers run to the turbinevalves and stand by but the spectacled slave of the ray in the utube never lifts his head he must watch where he is we are hardbraked and going astern there is language from the control platform  tims sparking badly about something says the unruffled captain hodgson lets look  captain purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since but the embodied authority of the gpo ahead of us floats an ancient aluminumpatched twinscrew tramp of the dingiest with no more right to the 5000foot lane than has a horsecart to a modern road she carries an obsolete barbette conning towera sixfoot affair with railed platform forwardand our warning beam plays on the top of it as a policemans lantern flashes on the area sneak like a sneakthief too emerges a shockheaded navigator in his shirtsleeves captain purnall wrenches open the colloid to talk with him man to man there are times when science does not satisfy  what under the stars are you doing here you skyscraping chimneysweep he shouts as we two drift side by side do you know this is a maillane you call yourself a sailor sir you aint fit to peddle toy balloons to an esquimaux your name and number report and get down and be  ive been blown up once the shockheaded man cries hoarsely as a dog barking i dont care two flips of a contact for anything you can do postey  dont you sir but ill make you care ill have you towed stern first to disko and broke up you cant recover insurance if youre broke for obstruction do you understand that  then the stranger bellows look at my propellers theres been a wulliwa down below that has knocked us into umbrellaframes weve been blown up about forty thousand feet were all one conjurors watch inside my mates arms broke my engineers heads cut open my ray went out when the engines smashed and and for pitys sake give me my height captain we doubt were dropping  six thousand eight hundred can you hold it captain purnall overlooks all insults and leans half out of the colloid staring and snuffing the stranger leaks pungently  we ought to blow into st johns with luck were trying to plug the foretank now but shes simply whistling it away her captain wails  shes sinking like a log says captain purnall in an undertone call up the banks mark boat george our dipdial shows that we keeping abreast the tramp have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes  captain purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing through the night twizzling spokes of light across infinity  thatll fetch something he says while captain hodgson watches the general communicator he has called up the north banks mark boat a few hundred miles west and is reporting the case  ill stand by you captain purnall roars to the lone figure on the conningtower  is it as bad as that comes the answer she isnt insured shes mine  might have guessed as much mutters hodgson owners risk is the worst risk of all  cant i fetch st johnsnot even with this breeze the voice quavers  stand by to abandon ship havent you any lift in you fore or aft  nothing but the midship tanks and theyre none too tight you see my ray gave out and he coughs in the reek of the escaping gas  you poor devil this does not reach our friend what does the mark boat say george  wants to know if theres any danger to traffic says shes in a bit of weather herself and cant quit station ive turned in a general call so even if they dont see our beam some ones bound to helpor else we must shall i clear our slings hold on here we are a planet liner too shell be up in a tick  tell her to have her slings ready cries his brother captain there wont be much time to spare tie up your mate he roars to the tramp  my mates all right its my engineer hes gone crazy  shunt the lift out of him with a spanner hurry  but i can make st johns if youll stand by  youll make the deep wet atlantic in twenty minutes youre less than fiftyeight hundred now get your papers  a planet liner east bound heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the air of us humming her underbody colloid is open land her transporterslings hang down like tentacles we shut off our beam as she adjusts herselfsteering to a hairover the tramps conningtower the mate comes up his arm strapped to his side and stumbles into the cradle a man with a ghastly scarlet head follows shouting that he must go back and build up his ray the mate assures him that he will find a nice new ray all ready in the liners engineroom the bandaged head goes up wagging excitedly a youth and a woman follow the liner cheers hollowly above us and we see the passengers faces at the saloon colloid  thats a pretty girl whats the fool waiting for now says captain purnall  the skipper comes up still appealing to us to stand by and see him fetch st johns he dives below and returnsat which we little human beings in the void cheer louder than everwith the ships kitten up fly the liners hissing slings her underbody crashes home and she hurtles away again the dial shows less than 3000 feet the mark boat signals we must attend to the derelict now whistling her deathsong as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags  keep our beam on her and send out a general warning says captain purnall following her down there is no need not a liner in air but knows the meaning of that vertical beam and gives us and our quarry a wide berth  but shell drown in the water wont she i ask not always is his answer ive known a derelict upend and sift her engines out of herself and flicker round the lower lanes for three weeks on her forward tanks only well run no risks pith her george and look sharp theres weather ahead  captain hodgson opens the underbody colloid swings the heavy pithingiron out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a smokingroom settee and at two hundred feet releases the catch we hear the whir of the crescentshaped arms opening as they descend the derelicts forehead is punched in starred across and rent diagonally she falls stern first our beam upon her slides like a lost soul down that pitiless ladder of light and the atlantic takes her  a filthy business says hodgson i wonder what it must have been like in the old days  the thought had crossed my mind too what if that wavering carcass had been filled with the men of the old days each one of them taught that is the horror of it that after death he would very possibly go for ever to unspeakable torment  and scarcely a generation ago we one knows now that we are only our fathers reenlarged upon the earth we i say ripped and rammed and pithed to admiration  here tim from the control platform shouts that we are to get into our inflators and to bring him his at once  we hurry into the heavy rubber suitsthe engineers are already dressedand inflate at the airpump taps gpo inflators are thrice as thick as a racing mans flickers and chafe abominably under the armpits george takes the wheel until tim has blown himself up to the extreme of rotundity if you kicked him off the c p to the deck he would bounce back but it is 162 that will do the kicking  the mark boats madstark ravin crazy he snorts returning to command she says theres a bad blowout ahead and wants me to pull over to greenland ill see her pithed first we wasted half an hour fussing over that dead duck down under and now im expected to go rubbin my back all round the pole what does she think a postal packets made of gummed silk tell her were coming on straight george  george buckles him into the frame and switches on the direct control now under tims left toe lies the portengine accelerator under his left heel the reverse and so with the other foot the liftshunt stops stand out on the rim of the steeringwheel where the fingers of his left hand can play on them at his right hand is the midships engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moments notice he leans forward in his belt eyes glued to the colloid and one ear cocked toward the general communicator henceforth he is the strength and direction of 162 through whatever may befall  the banks mark boat is reeling out pages of a bc directions to the traffic at large we are to secure all loose objects hood up our fleury rays and on no account to attempt to clear snow from our conningtowers till the weather abates underpowered craft we are told can ascend to the limit of their lift mailpackets to look out for them accordingly the lower lanes westward are pitting very badly with frequent blowouts vortices laterals etc  still the clear dark holds up unblemished the only warning is the electric skintension i feel as though i were a lacemakers pillow and an irritability which the gibbering of the general communicator increases almost to hysteria  we have made eight thousand feet since we pithed the tramp and our turbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots  very far to the west an elongated blur of red low down shows us the north banks mark boat there are specks of fire round her rising and fallingbewildered planets about an unstable sunhelpless shipping hanging on to her light for companys sake no wonder she could not quit station  she warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which her beam shows it she is even now reeling  the pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous filmswreathing and uneasy shapes one forms itself into a globe of pale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by it leaps monstrously across the blackness alights on the precise tip of our nose pirouettes there an instant and swings off our roaring bow sinks as though that light were leadsinks and recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath the next blowout tims fingers on the liftshunt strike chords of numbers147246753 and so on for he is running by his tanks only lifting or lowering her against the uneasy air all three engines are at work for the sooner we have skated over this thin ice the better higher we dare not go the whole upper vault is charged with pale krypton vapours which our skin friction may excite to unholy manifestations between the upper and lower levels5000 and 7000 hints the mark boatwe may perhaps bolt through if our bow clothes itself in blue flame and falls like a sword no human skill can keep pace with the changing tensions a vortex has us by the beak and we dive down a twothousand foot slant at an angle the dipdial and my bouncing body record it of thirtyfive our turbines scream shrilly the propellers cannot bite on the thin air tim shunts the lift out of five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her bullet wise through the maelstrom till she cushions with jar on an upgust three thousand feet below  now weve done it says george in my ear our skinfriction that last slide has played old harry with the tensions look out for laterals tim shell want some holding  ive got her is the answer come up old woman  she comes up nobly but the laterals buffet her left and right like the pinions of angry angels she is jolted off her course four ways at once and cuffed into place again only to be swung aside and dropped into a new chaos we are never without a corposant grinning on our bows or rolling head over heels from nose to midships and to the crackle of electricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of hailhail that will never fall on any sea slow we must or we may break our back pitchpoling  airs a perfectly elastic fluid roars george above the tumult about as elastic as a head sea off the fastnet aint it  he is less than just to the good element if one intrudes on the heavens when they are balancing their voltaccounts if one disturbs the high gods marketrates by hurling steel hulls at ninety knots across tremblingly adjusted electric tensions one must not complain of any rudeness in the reception tim met it with an unmoved countenance one corner of his under lip caught up on a tooth his eyes fleeting into the blackness twenty miles ahead and the fierce sparks flying from his knuckles at every turn of the hand now and again he shook his head to clear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows and it was then that george watching his chance would slide down the liferail and swab his face quickly with a big red handkerchief i never imagined that a human being could so continuously labour and so collectedly think as did tim through that hells halfhour when the flurry was at its worst we were dragged hither and yon by warm or frozen suctions belched up on the tops of wuliiwas spun down by vortices and clubbed aside by laterals under a dizzying rush of stars in the company of a drunken moon  i heard the rushing click of the midshipenginelever sliding in and out the low growl of the liftshunts and louder than the yelling winds without the scream of the bowrudder gouging into any lull that promised hold for an instant at last we began to claw up on a cant bowrudder and portpropeller together only the nicest balancing of tanks saved us from spinning like the riflebullet of the old days  weve got to hitch to windward of that mark boat somehow george cried  theres no windward i protested feebly where i swung shackled to a stanchion how can there be  he laughedas we pitched into a thousand foot blowoutthat red man laughed beneath his inflated hood  look he said we must clear those refugees with a high lift  the mark boat was below and a little to the souwest of us fluctuating in the centre of her distraught galaxy the air was thick with moving lights at every level i take it most of them were trying to lie head to wind but not being hydras they failed an undertanked moghrabi boat had risen to the limit of her lift and finding no improvement had dropped a couple of thousand there she met a superb wulliwa and was blown up spinning like a dead leaf instead of shutting off she went astern and naturally rebounded as from a wall almost into the mark boat whose language our g c took it in was humanly simple  if theyd only ride it out quietly it ud be better said george in a calm while we climbed like a bat above them all but some skipperswill navigate without enough lift what does that tadboat think she is doing tim  playin kiss in the ring was tims unmoved reply a transasiatic direct liner had found a smooth and butted into it full power but there was a vortex at the tail of that smooth so the t a d was flipped out like a pea from off a fingernail braking madly as she fled down and all but overending  now i hope shes satisfied said tim im glad im not a mark boat do i want help the general communicator dial had caught his ear george you may tell that gentleman with my lovelove remember georgethat i do not want help who is the officious sardinetin  a rimouski drogher on the lookout for a tow  very kind of the rimouski drogher this postal packet isnt being towed at present  those droghers will go anywhere on a chance of salvage george explained we call em kittiwakes  a longbeaked bright steel ninetyfooter floated at ease for one instant within hail of us her slings coiled ready for rescues and a single hand in her open tower he was smoking surrendered to the insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way he lay in absolute peace i saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat dropped it seemed like a stone in a well  we had just cleared the mark boat and her disorderly neighbours when the storm ended as suddenly as it had begun a shootingstar to northward filled the sky with the green blink of a meteorite dissipating itself in our atmosphere  said george that may iron out all the tensions even as he spoke the conflicting winds came to rest the levels filled the laterals died out in long easy swells the airways were smoothed before us in less than three minutes the covey round the mark boat had shipped their powerlights and whirred away upon their businesses  whats happened i gasped the nervestore within and the volttingle without had passed my inflators weighed like lead  god he knows said captain george soberly that old shootingstars skinfriction has discharged the different levels ive seen it happen before phew what a relief  we dropped from ten to six thousand and got rid of our clammy suits tim shut off and stepped out of the frame the mark boat was coming up behind us he opened the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mopped his face  hello williams he cried a degree or two out o station aint you  may be was the answer from the mark boat ive had some company this evening  so i noticed wasnt that quite a little draught  i warned you why didnt you pull out north the eastbound packets have  me not till im running a polar consumptives sanatorium boat i was squinting through a colloid before you were out of your cradle my son  id be the last man to deny it the captain of the mark boat replies softly the way you handled her just nowim a pretty fair judge of traffic in a volthurryit was a thousand revolutions beyond anything even ive ever seen  tims back supples visibly to this oiling captain george on the c p winks and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden pinned up on tims telescope bracket above the steeringwheel  i see wholly and entirely do i see  there is some talk overhead of coming round to tea on friday a brief report of the derelicts fate and tim volunteers as he descends for an a b c man young williams is less of a hightension fool than some were you thinking of taking her on george then ill just have a look round that portthrust seems to me its a trifle warmand well jog along  the mark boat hums off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed eyrie here she will stay a shutterless observatory a lifeboat station a salvage tug a court of ultimate appealcummeteorological bureau for three hundred miles in all directions till wednesday next when her relief slides across the stars to take her buffeted place her black hull double conningtower and everready slings represent all that remains to the planet of that odd old word authority she is responsible only to the aerial board of control the a b c of which tim speaks so flippantly but that semielected seminominated body of a few score of persons of both sexes controls this planet transportation is civilisation our motto runs theoretically we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies practically the a b c confirms or annuls all international arrangements and to judge from its last report finds our tolerant humorous lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders  i discuss this with tim sipping mate on the c p while george fans her along over the white blur of the banks in beautiful upward curves of fifty miles each the dipdial translates them on the tape in flowing freehand  tim gathers up a skein of it and surveys the last few feet which record 162s path through the voltflurry  i havent had a feverchart like this to show up in five years he says ruefully  a postal packets dipdial records every yard of every run the tapes then go to the a b c which collates and makes composite photographs of them for the instruction of captains tim studies his irrevocable past shaking his head  hello heres a fifteenhundredfoot drop at fiftyfive degrees we must have been standing on our heads then george  you dont say so george answers i fancied i noticed it at the time  george may not have captain purnalls catlike swiftness but he is all an artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the shuntstops the delicious flightcurves come away on the tape with never a waver the mark boats vertical spindle of light lies down to eastward setting in the face of the following stars westward where no planet should rise the triple verticals of trinity bay we keep still to the southern route make a lowlifting haze we seem the only thing at rest under all the heavens floating at ease till the earths revolution shall turn up our landingtowers  and minute by minute our silent clock gives us a sixteensecond mile  some fine night says tim well be even with that clocks master  hes coming now says george over his shoulder im chasing the night west  the stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under unobserved but the deep airboom on our skin changes to a joyful shout  the dawngust says tim itll go on to meet the sun look look theres the dark being crammed back over our bows come to the aftercolloid ill show you something  the engineroom is hot and stuffy the clerks in the coach are asleep and the slave of the ray is ready to follow them tim slides open the aft colloid and reveals the curve of the worldthe oceans deepest purpleedged with fuming and intolerable gold  then the sun rises and through the colloid strikes out our lamps tim scowls in his face  squirrels in a cage he mutters thats all we are squirrels in a cage hes going twice as fast as us just you wait a few years my shining friend and well take steps that will amaze you well joshua you  yes that is our dream to turn all earth into the yale of ajalon at our pleasure so far we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length in these latitudes but some dayeven on the equatorwe shall hold the sun level in his full stride  now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic a big submersible breaks water suddenly another and another follows with a swash and a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures the deepsea freighters are rising to lung up after the long night and the leisurely ocean is all patterned with peacocks eyes of foam  well lung up too says tim and when we return to the c p george shuts off the colloids are opened and the fresh air sweeps her out there is no hurry the old contracts they will be revised at the end of the year allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind her in ten so we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which pushes us along at a languid twenty  to enjoy life and tobacco begin both on a sunny morning half a mile or so above the dappled atlantic cloudbelts and after a voltflurry which has cleared and tempered your nerves while we discussed the thickening traffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved to ourselves we heard and i for the first time the morning hymn on a hospital boat  she was cloaked by a skein of ravelled fluff beneath us and we caught the chant before she rose into the sunlight oh ye winds of god sang the unseen voices bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  we slid off our caps and joined in when our shadow fell across her great open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands neighbourly while they sang we could see the doctors and the nurses and the whitebuttonlike faces of the cotpatients she passed slowly beneath us heading northward her hull wet with the dews of the night all ablaze in the sunshine so took she the shadow of a cloud and vanished her song continuing oh ye holy and humble men of heart bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  shes a public lunger or she wouldnt have been singing the benedicite and shes a greenlander or she wouldnt have snowblinds over her colloids said george at last shell be bound for frederikshavn or one of the glacier sanatoriums for a month if she was an accident ward shed be hung up at the eightthousandfoot level yesconsumptives  funny how the new things are the old thing ive read in books tim answered that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to the tops of hills because microbes were fewer there we hoist em in sterilized air for a while same idea how much do the doctors say weve added to the average life of man  thirty years says george with a twinkle in his eye are we going to spend em all up here tim  flap ahead then flap ahead whos hindering the senior captain laughed as we went in  we held a good lift to clear the coastwise and continental shipping and we had need of it though our route is in no sense a populated one there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along we met hudson bay furriers out of the great preserve hurrying to make their departure from bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets we overcossed keewatin liners small and cramped but their captains who see no land between trepassy and lanco know what gold they bring back from west erica transasiatic directs we met soberly ringing the world round the fiftieth meridian at an honest seventy knots and whitepainted ackroyd  hunt fruiters out of the south fled beneath us their ventilated hulls whistling like chinese kites their market is in the north among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their grapefruit and bananas across the cold snows argentine beef boats we sighted too of enormous capacity and unlovely outline they too feed the northern health stations in icebound ports where submersibles dare not rise  yellowbellied oreflats and ungava petroltanks punted down leisurely out of the north like strings of unfrightened wild duck it does not pay to fly minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary but the risks of transhipping to submersibles in the ice pack off nain or hebron are so great that these heavy freighters fly down to halifax direct and scent the air as they go they are the biggest tramps aloft except the athabasca graintubs but these last now that the wheat is moved are busy over the worlds shoulder timberlifting in siberia  we held to the st lawrence it is astonishing how the old waterways still pull us children of the air and followed his broad line of black between its drifting iceblocks all down the park that the wisdom of our fathersbut every one knows the quebec run  we dropped to the heights receiving towers twenty minutes ahead of time and there hung at ease till the yokohama intermediate packet could pull out and give us our proper slip it was curious to watch the action of the holdingdown clips all along the frosty river front as the boats cleared or came to rest a big hamburger was leaving pont levis and her crew unshipping the platform railings began to sing elsinorethe oldest of our chanteys you know it of course       mother rugens teahouse on the baltic       forty couple waltzing on the floor      and you can watch my ray      for i must go away       and dance with ella sweyn at elsinore  then while they sweated home the coveringplates

a gesture of indignant dismissal as though quebec glittering under her snows were casting out these light and unworthy lovers our signal came from the heights tim turned and floated up but surely then it was with passionate appeal that the great tower arms flung openor did i think so because on the upper staging a little hooded figure also opened her arms wide toward her father                                       in ten seconds the coach with its clerks clashed down to the receivingcaisson the hostlers displaced the engineers at the idle turbines and tim prouder of this than all introduced me to the maiden of the photograph on the shelf and by the way said he to her stepping forth in sunshine under the hat of civil life i saw young williams in the mark boat ive asked him to tea on friday

          highlevel sleet  the northern weather so far shows no sign of improvement from all quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the higher levels racing planes and digs alike have suffered severelythe former from unequal deposits of halffrozen slush on their vans and only those who have held up a badly balanced plane in a crosswind know what that means and the latter from loaded bows and snowcased bodies as a consequence the northern and northwestern upper levels have been practically abandoned and the high fliers have returned to the ignoble security of the three five and six hundred foot levels but there remain a few undaunted sunhunters who in spite of frozen stays and icejammed connectingrods still haunt the blue empyrean                   batboat racing  the scandals of the past few years have at last moved the yachting world to concerted action in regard to bat boat racing we have been treated to the spectacle of what are practically keeled racingplanes driven a clear five foot or more above the water and only eased down to touch their socalled native element as they near the line judges and starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity but the public demonstration off st catherines light at the autumn regattas has borne ample if tardy fruit in the future the bat is to be a boat and the longunheeded demand of the true sportsman for no daylight under midkeel in smooth water is in a fair way to be conceded the new rule severely restricts plane area and lift alike the gas compartments are permitted both fore and aft as in the old type but the waterballast central tank is rendered obligatory these things work if not for perfection at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome waterborne cruiser the type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules so we may expect to see the longdavidson make the patent on which has just expired come largely into use henceforward though the strain on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is admittedly very severe but batboat racing has a great future before it                   crete and the a b c  the story of the recent cretan crisis as told in the a b c monthly report is not without humour till the 25th october crete as all our planet knows was the sole surviving european repository of autonomous institutions local selfgovernment and the rest of the archaic lumber devised in the past for the confusion of human affairs she has lived practically on the tourist traffic attracted by her annual pageants of parliaments boards municipal councils etc etc last summer the islanders grew wearied as their premier explained of playing at being savages for pennies and proceeded to pull down all the landingtowers on the island and shut off general communication till such time as the a b c should annex them for sidesplitting comedy we would refer our readers to the correspondence between the board of control and the cretan premier during the war however alls well that ends well the a b c have taken over the administration of crete on normal lines and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the debates resolutions and popular movements of the old days the only people to suffer will be the board of control which is grievously overworked already it is easy enough to condemn the cretans for their laziness but when one recalls the large prosperous and presumably publicspirited communities which during the last few years have deliberately thrown themselves into the hands of the a b c one cannot be too hard upon st pauls old friends                    correspondence                  skylarking on the equator  to the editor only last week while crossing the equator w 2615 i became aware of a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or twenty knots s 4 e descending to the 500 ft level i found a party of transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs a b c standard and in the intervals of their pleasing labours firing bow and stern smokering swivels this orgiei can give it no other namewent on for at least two hours and naturally produced violent electric derangements my compasses of course were thrown out my bow was struck twice and i received two brisk shocks from the lower platformrail on remonstrating i was told that these professors were engaged in scientific experiments the extent of their scientific knowledge may be judged by the fact that they expected to produce i give their own words a little blue sky if they went on long enough this in the heart of the doldrums at 450 feet i have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of the year but i submit with all deference to the educational needs of transylvania that skylarking in the centre of a maintravelled road where at the best of times electricity literally drips off ones stanchions and screw blades is unnecessary when my friends had finished the road was seared and blown and pitted with unequal pressure layers spirals vortices and readjustments for at least an hour i pitched badly twice in an upward rushsolely due to these diabolical throwdownsthat came near to wrecking my propeller equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the doldrums       rhyl j vincent mathen  we entirely sympathize with professor mathens views but till the board sees fit to further regulate the southern areas in which

warning but so many complaints have reached us of accidents similar to yours while shooting the aurora that we are inclined to believe with lavalle that the upper strata of the aurora borealis are practically one big electric leak and that the paralysis of your engines was due to complete magnetization of all metallic parts lowflying planes often glue up when near the magnetic pole and there is no reason in science why the same disability should not be experienced at higher levels when the auroras are delivering strongly  indignanton your own showing you were not under control that you could

hardens by practice meantime vaseline                    review             the life of xavier lavalle      reviewed by rene talland ecole aeronautique paris  ten years ago lavalle that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens as lazareff hailed him gathered together the fruits of a lifetimes labour and gave it with welljustified contempt to a world bound hand and foot to baralds theory of vertices and compensating electric nodes they shall see he wrotein that immortal postscript to the heart of the cyclonethe laws whose existence they derided written in fire beneath them  but even here he continues there is no finality better a thousand times my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should lie across the threshold of the temple of sciencea bar to further inquiry  so died lavallea prince of the powers of the air and even at his funeral cellier jested at him who had gone to discover the secrets of the aurora borealis  if i choose thus to be banal it is only to remind you that colliers theories are today as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the spanish school in the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we have definitely lavalles law of the cyclone which he surprised in darkness and cold at the foot of the overarching throne of the aurora borealis it is there that i intent on my own investigations have passed and repassed a hundred times the worn leonine face white as the snow beneath him furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and gashes upon the north cape the nervous hand integrally a part of the mechanism of his flighter and above all the wonderful lambent eyes turned to the zenith  master i would cry as i moved respectfully beneath him what is it you seek today and always the answer clear and without doubt from above the old secret my son  the immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path but cry of the human always had i knownif i had knowni would many times have bartered my poor laurels for the privilege such as tinsley and herrera possess of having aided him in his monumental researches  it is to the filial piety of victor lavalle that we owe the two volumes consecrated to the groundlife of his father so full of the holy intimacies of the domestic hearth once returned from the abysms of the utter north to that little house upon the outskirts of meudon it was not the philosopher the daring observer the man of iron energy that imposed himself on his family but a fat and even plaintive jester a farceur incarnate and kindly the coequal of his children and it must be written not seldom the comic despair of madame lavalle who as she writes five years after the marriage to her venerable mother found in this unequalled intellect whose name i bear the abandon of a large and very untidy boy here is her letter  xavier returned from i do not know where at midnight absorbed in calculations on the eternal question of his aurorala belle aurore whom i begin to hate instead of anchoringi had set out the guidelight above our roof so he had but to descend and fasten the planehe wandered profoundly distracted above the town with his anchor down figure to yourself dear mother it is the roof of the mayors house that the grapnel first engages that i do not regret for the mayors wife and i are not sympathetic but when xavier uproots my pet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the conservatory i protest at the top of my voice little victor in his nightclothes runs to the window enormously amused at the parabolic flight without reason for it is too dark to see the grapnel of my prized tree the mayor of meudon thunders at our door in the name of the law demanding i suppose my husbands head here is the conversation through the megaphonexavier is two hundred feet above us  mons lavalle descend and make reparation for outrage of domicile descend mons lavalle  no one answers  xavier lavalle in the name of the law descend and submit to process for outrage of domicile  xavier roused from his calculations comprehending only the last words outrage of domicile my dear mayor who is the man that has corrupted thy julie  the mayor furious xavier lavalle  xavier interrupting i have not that felicity i am only a dealer in cyclones  my faith he raised one then all meudon attended in the streets and my xavier after a long time comprehending what he had done excused himself in a thousand apologies at last the reconciliation was effected in our house over a supper at two in the morningjulie in a wonderful costume of compromises and i have her and the mayor pacified in bed in the blue room  and on the next day while the mayor rebuilds his roof her xavier departs anew for the aurora borealis there to commence his lifes work m victor lavalle tells us of that historic collision en plane on the flank of hecla between herrera then a pillar of the spanish school and the man destined to confute his theories and lead him intellectually captive even through the years the immense laugh of lavalle as he sustains the spaniards wrecked plane and cries courage i shall not fall till i have found truth and i hold you fast rings like the call of trumpets this is that lavalle whom the world immersed in speculations of immediate gain did not know nor suspectthe lavalle whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a theorist  the human as apart from the scientific side developed in his own volumes of his epochmaking discoveries is marked with a simplicity clarity and good sense beyond praise i would specially refer such as doubt the sustaining influence of ancestral faith upon character and will to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters in which are contained the opening and consummation of the tellurionical records extending over nine years of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest house at meudon knew as little as that the records would one day be the planets standard in all official meteorology it was enough for them that their xavierthis son this father this husbandascended periodically to commune with powers it might be angelic beyond their comprehension and that they united daily in prayers for his safety  pray for me he says upon the eve of each of his excursions and returning with an equal simplicity he renders thanks after supper in the little room where he kept his barometers  to the last lavalle was a catholic of the old school acceptinghe who had looked into the very heart of the lightningsthe dogmas of papal infallibility of absolution of confessionof relics great and small marvellousenviable contradiction  the completion of the tellurionical records closed what lavalle himself was pleased to call the theoretical side of his labourslabours from which the youngest and least impressionable planeur might well have shrunk he had traced through cold and heat across the deeps of the oceans with instruments of his own invention over the inhospitable heart of the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts league by league patiently unweariedly remorselessly from their evershifting cradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted deathbed in the utmost ether of the upper atmosphere each one of the isoconical tellurions lavalles curves as we call them today he had disentangled the nodes of their intersections assigning to each its regulated period of flux and reflux thus equipped he summons herrera and tinsley his pupils to the final demonstration as calmly as though he were ordering his flighter for some midday journey to marseilles  i have proved my thesis he writes it remains now only that you should witness the proof we go to manila tomorrow a cyclone will form off the pescadores s 17 e in four days and will reach its maximum intensity twentyseven hours after inception it is there i will show you the truth  a letter heretofore unpublished from herrera to madame lavalle tells us how the masters prophecy was verified  i will not destroy its simplicity or its significance by any attempt to quote note well though that herreras preoccupation throughout that day and night of superhuman strain is always for the masters bodily health and comfort  at such a time he writes i forced the master to take the broth or i made him put on the fur coat as you told me nor is tinsley see pp 184 85 less concerned he prepares the nourishment he cooks eternally imperturbably suspended in the chaos of which the master interprets the meaning tinsley bowed down with the laurels of both hemispheres raises himself to yet nobler heights in his capacity of a devoted chef it is almost unbelievable and yet men write of the master as cold aloof selfcontained such characters do not elicit the joyous and unswerving devotion which lavalle commanded throughout life truly we have changed very little in the course of the ages the secrets of earth and sky and the links that bind them we felicitate ourselves we are on the road to discover but our neighbours heart and mind we misread we misjudge we condemn now as ever let all then who love a man read these most human tender and wise volumes                        transcribers note these advertisements appeared in the format   that

master     of earth and water air and fire            but never reached his hearts desire              the apple trees cut down     a deal in cotton  long and long ago when devadatta was king of benares i wrote some tales concerning strickland of the punjab police who married miss youghal and adam his son strickland has finished his indian service and lives now at a place in england called westonsupermare where his wife plays the organ in one of the churches semioccasionally he comes up to london and occasionally his wife makes him visit his friends otherwise he plays golf and follows the harriers for his figures sake  if you remember that infant who told a tale to eustace cleever the novelist you will remember that he became a baronet with a vast estate he has owing to cookery a little lost his figure but he never loses his friends i have found a wing of his house turned into a hospital for sick men and there i once spent a week in the company of two dismal nurses and a specialist in sprue another time the place was full of schoolboyssons of angloindians whom the infant had collected for the holidays and they nearly broke his keepers heart  but my last visit was better the infant called me up by wire and i fell into the arms of a friend of mine colonel al corkran so that the years departed from us and we praised allah who had not yet terminated the delights nor separated the companions  said corkran when he had explained how it felt to command a native infantry regiment on the border the stricks are coming for tonightwith their boy  i remember him the little fellow i wrote a story about i said is he in the service  no strick got him into the centroeuroafrica protectorate hes assistantcommissioner at dupewherever that is somaliland aint it stalky asked the infant  stalky puffed out his nostrils scornfully youre only three thousand miles out look at the atlas  anyhow hes as rotten full of fever as the rest of you said the infant at length on the big divan and hes bringing a native servant with him stalky be an athlete and tell ipps to put him in the stable room  why is he a yaolike the fellow wade brought herewhen your housekeeper had fits stalky often visits the infant and has seen some odd things  no hes one of old stricklands punjabi policemenand quite europeani believe  hooray havent talked punjabi for three monthsand a punjabi from central africa ought to be amusin  we heard the chuff of the motor in the porch and the first to enter was agnes strickland whom the infant makes no secret of adoring  he is devoted in a fat mans placid way to at least eight designing women but she nursed him once through a bad bout of peshawur fever and when she is in the house it is more than all hers  you didnt send rugs enough she began adam might have taken a chill  its quite warm in the tonneau why did you let him ride in front  because he wanted to she replied with the mothers smile and we were introduced to the shadow of a young man leaning heavily on the shoulder of a bearded punjabi mohammedan  that is all that came home of him said his father to me there was nothing in it of the child with whom i had journeyed to dalhousie centuries since  and what is this uniform stalky asked of imam din the servant who came to attention on the marble floor  the uniform of the protectorate troops sahib though i am the little sahibs bodyservant it is not seemly for us white men to be attended by folk dressed altogether as servants  andand you white men wait at table on horseback stalky pointed to the mans spurs  these i added for the sake of honour when i came to england said imam din adam smiled the ghost of a little smile that i began to remember and we put him on the big couch for refreshments stalky asked him how much leave he had and he said six months  but hell take another six on medical certificate said agnes anxiously adam knit his brows  you dont want toeh i know wonder what my second in command is doing stalky tugged his moustache and fell to thinking of his sikhs  ah said the infant ive only a few thousand pheasants to look after come along and dress for dinner were just ourselves what flower is your honours ladyship commanding for the table  just ourselves she said looking at the crotons in the great hall then lets have marigolds the little cemetery ones  so it was ordered  now marigolds to us mean hot weather discomfort parting and death that smell in our nostrils and adams servant in waiting we naturally fell back more and more on the old slang recalling at each glass those who had gone before we did not sit at the big table but in the bay window overlooking the park where they were carting the last of the hay when twilight fell we would not have candles but waited for the moon and continued our talk in the dusk that makes one remember  young adam was not interested in our past except where it had touched his future i think his mother held his hand beneath the table imam dinshoeless out of respect to the floorsbrought him his medicine poured it drop by drop and asked for orders  wait to take him to his cot when he grows weary said his mother and imam din retired into the shadow by the ancestral portraits  now what dyou expect to get out of your country the infant asked whenour india laid aside we talked adams africa it roused him at once  rubbernutsgumsand so on he said but our real future is cotton i grew fifty acres of it last year in my district  my district said his father hear him mummy  i did though i wish i could show you the sample some manchester chaps said it was as good as any sea island cotton on the market  but what made you a cottonplanter my son she asked  my chief said every man ought to have a shouk a hobby of sorts and he took the trouble to ride a day out of his way to show me a belt of black soil that was just the thing for cotton  ah what was your chief like stalky asked in his silkiest tones  the best man aliveabsolutely he lets you blow your own nose yourself the people call himadam jerked out some heathen phrasethat means the man with the stone eyes you know  im glad of that because ive heard from other quarters stalkys sentence burned like a slow match but the explosion was not long delayed other quarters adam threw out a thin hand every dog has his fleas if you listen to them of course the shake of his head was as i remembered it among his fathers policemen twenty years before and his mothers eyes shining through the dusk called on me to adore it i kicked stalky on the shin one must not mock a young mans first love or loyalty  a lump of raw cotton appeared on the table  i thought there might be a need therefore i packed it between our shirts said the voice of imam din  does he know as much english as that cried the infant who had forgotten his east  we all admired the cotton for adams sake and indeed it was very long and glossy  itsits only an experiment he said were such awful paupers we cant even pay for a mailcart in my district we use a biscuitbox on two bicycle wheels i only got the money for thathe patted the stuffby a pure fluke  how much did it cost asked strickland  with seed and machineryabout two hundred pounds i had the labour done by cannibals  that sounds promising stalky reached for a fresh cigarette  no thank you said agnes ive been at westonsupermare a little too long for cannibals ill go to the musicroom and try over next sundays hymns  she lifted the boys hand lightly to her lips and tripped across the acres of glimmering floor to the musicroom that had been the infants ancestors banqueting hall her grey and silver dress disappeared under the musicians gallery two electrics broke out and she stood backed against the lines of gilded pipes  theres an abominable selfplaying attachment here she called  me the infant answered his napkin on his shoulder thats how i play parsifal  i prefer the direct expression take it away ipps  we heard old ipps skating obediently all over the floor  now for the direct expression said stalky and moved on the burgundy recommended by the faculty to enrich feverthinned blood  its nothing much only the belt of cottonsoil my chief showed me ran right into the sheshaheli country we havent been able to prove cannibalism against that tribe in the courts but when a sheshaheli offers you four pounds of womans breast tattoo marks and all skewered up in a plantain leaf before breakfast you  naturally burn the villages before lunch said stalky  adam shook his head no troops he sighed i told my chief about it and he said we must wait till they chopped a white man he advised me if ever i felt like it not to commit aa barren felo de se but to let the sheshaheli do it then he could report and then we could mop em up  most immoral thats how we got stalky quoted the name of a province won by just such a sacrifice  yes but the beasts dominated one end of my cottonbelt like anything they chivied me out of it when i went to take soil for analysisme and imam din  sahib is there a need the voice came out of the darkness and the eyes shone over adams shoulder ere it ceased  none the name was taken in talk adam abolished him with a turn of the finger i couldnt make a casus belli of it just then because my chief had taken all the troops to hammer a gang of slave kings up north did you ever hear of our war against ibn makarrah he precious nearly lost us the protectorate at one time though hes an ally of ours now  wasnt he rather a pernicious brute even as they go said stalky wade told me about him last year  well his nickname all through the country was the merciful and he didnt get that for nothing none of our people ever breathed his proper name they said he or that one and they didnt say it aloud either he fought us for eight months  i remember there was a paragraph about it in one of the papers i said  we broke him though nothe slavers dont come our way because our men have the reputation of dying too much the first month after theyre captured that knocks down profits you see  what about your charming friends the sheshahelis said the infant  theres no market for sheshaheli people would as soon buy crocodiles i believe before we annexed the country ibn makarrah dropped down on em onceto train his young menand simply hewed em in pieces the bulk of my people are agriculturists just the right stamp for cottongrowers whats mother playingonce in royal  the organ that had been crooning as happily as a woman over her babe restored steadied to a tune  magnificent oh magnificent said the infant loyally i had never heard him sing but once and then though it was early in the tolerant morning his mess had rolled him into a lotus pond  how did you get your cannibals to work for you asked strickland  they got converted to civilization after my chief smashed ibn makarrahjust at the time i wanted em you see my chief had promised me in writing that if i could scrape up a surplus he would not bag it for his roads this time but i might have it for my cotton game i only needed two hundred pounds our revenues didnt run to it  what is your revenue stalky asked in the vernacular  with huttax traders game and mining licenses not more than fourteen thousand rupees every penny of it earmarked months ahead adam sighed  also there is a fine for dogs straying in the sahibs camp last year it exceeded three rupees imam din said quietly  well i thought that was fair they howled so we were rather strict on fines i worked up my native clerkbulaki ramto a ferocious pitch of enthusiasm he used to calculate the profits of our cottonscheme to three points of decimals after office i tell you i envied your magistrates here hauling money out of motorists every week i had managed to make our ordinary revenue and expenditure just about meet and i was crazy to get the odd two hundred pounds for my cotton that sort of thing grows on a chap when hes aloneand talks aloud  hullo have you been there already the father said and adam nodded  yes used to spout what i could remember of marmion to a tree sir well then my luck turned one evening an englishspeaking nigger came in towing a corpse by the feet you get used to little things like that he said hed found it and please would i identify because if it was one of ibn makarrahs men there might be a reward it was an old mohammedan with a strong dash of araba smallboned baldheaded chap and i was just wondering how it had kept so well in our climate when it sneezed you ought to have seen the nigger he fetched a howl and bolted likelike the dog in tom sawyer when he sat on the whatsitsname beetle he yelped as he ran and the corpse went on sneezing i could see it had been sarkied thats a sort of gumpoison pater which attacks the nerve centres our chief medical officer is writing a monograph about it so imam din and i emptied out the corpse one time with my shaving soap and trade gunpowder and hot water  id seen a case of sarkie before so when the skin peeled off his feet and he stopped sneezing i knew hed live he was bad though lay like a log for a week while imam din and i massaged the paralysis out of him then he told us he was a hajjihad been three times to meccacome in from french africa and that hed met the nigger by the waysidejust like a case of thuggee in indiaand the nigger had poisoned him that seemed reasonable enough by what i knew of coast niggers  you believed him said his father keenly  there was no reason i shouldnt the nigger never came back and the old man stayed with me for two months adam returned you know what the best type of a mohammedan gentleman can be pater he was that  none finer none finer was the answer  except a sikh stalky grunted  hed been to bombay he knew french africa inside out he could quote poetry and the koran all day long he played chessyou dont know what that meant to melike a master we used to talk about the regeneration of turkey and the sheikulislam between moves oh everything under the sun we talked about he was awfully openminded he believed in slavery of course but he quite saw that it would have to die out thats why he agreed with me about developing the resources of the district by cottongrowing you know  you talked of that too said strickland  rather we discussed it for hours you dont know what it meant to me a wonderful man imam din was not our hajji marvellous  most marvellous it was all through the hajji that we found the money for our cottonplay imam din had moved i fancy behind stricklands chair  yes it must have been dead against his convictions too he brought me news when i was down with fever at dupe that one of ibn makarrahs men was parading through my district with a bunch of slavesin the fork  whats the matter with the fork that you cant abide it said stalky adams voice had risen at the last word  local etiquette sir he replied too earnest to notice stalkys atrocious pun if a slaver runs slaves through british territory he ought to pretend that theyre his servants hawkin em about in the forkthe forked stick that you put round their necks you knowis insolencesame as not backing your topsails in the old days besides it unsettles the district  i thought you said slavers didnt come your way i put in  they dont but my chief was smoking em out of the north all that season and they were bolting into french territory any road they could find my orders were to take no notice so long as they circulated but open slavedealing in the fork was too much i couldnt go myself so i told a couple of our makalali police and imam din to make talk with the gentleman one time it was rather risky and it might have been expensive but it turned up trumps they were back in a few days with the slaver he didnt show fight and a whole crowd of witnesses and we tried him in my bedroom and fined him properly just to show you how demoralized the brute must have been arabs often go dotty after a defeat hed snapped up four or five utterly useless sheshaheli and was offering em to all and sundry along the road why he offered em to you didnt he imam din  i was witness that he offered maneaters for sale said imam din  luckily for my cottonscheme that landed him both ways you see he had slaved and exposed slaves for sale in british territory that meant the double fine if i could get it out of him  what was his defence said strickland late of the punjab police  as far as i rememberbut i had a temperature of 104 degrees at the timehed mistaken the meridians of longitude thought he was in french territory said hed never do it again if wed let him off with a fine i could have shaken hands with the brute for that he paid up cash like a motorist and went off one time  did you see him  yees didnt i imam din  assuredly the sahib both saw and spoke to the slaver and the sahib also made a speech to the maneaters when he freed them and they swore to supply him with labour for all his cottonplay the sahib leaned on his own servants shoulder the while  i remember something of that i remember bulaki ram giving me the papers to sign and i distinctly remember him locking up the money in the safetwo hundred and ten beautiful english sovereigns you dont know what that meant to me i believe it cured my fever and as soon as i could i staggered off with the hajji to interview the sheshaheli about labour then i found out why they had been so keen to work it wasnt gratitude their big village had been hit by lightning and burned out a week or two before and they lay flat in rows around me asking me for a job i gave it em  and so you were very happy his mother had stolen up behind us you liked your cotton dear she tidied the lump away  by jove i was happy adam yawned now if any one he looked at the infant cares to put a little money into the scheme itll be the making of my district i cant give you figures sir but i assure  youll take your arsenic and imam dinll take you up to bed and ill come and tuck you in  agnes leaned forward her rounded elbows on his shoulders hands joined across his dark hair and isnt he a darling she said to us with just the same heartrending lift to the left eyebrow and the same break of her voice as sent strickland mad among the horses in the year 84 we were quiet when they were gone we waited till imam din returned to us from above and coughed at the door as only darkhearted asia can  now said strickland tell us what truly befell son of my servant  all befell as our sahib has said onlyonly there was an arrangementa little arrangement on account of his cottonplay  tell sit i beg your pardon infant said strickland  but the infant had already made the sign and we heard imam din hunker down on the floor one gets little out of the east at attention  when the fever came on our sahib in our roofed house at dupe he began the hajji listened intently to his talk he expected the names of women though i had already told him that our virtue was beyond belief or compare and that our sole desire was this cottonplay being at last convinced the hajji breathed on our sahibs forehead to sink into his brain news concerning a slavedealer in his district who had made a mock of the law sahib imam din turned to strickland our sahib answered to those false words as a horse of blood answers to the spur he sat up he issued orders for the apprehension of the slavedealer then he fell back then we left him  aloneservant of my son and son of my servant said his father  there was an old woman which belonged to the hajji she had come in with the hajjis moneybelt the hajji told her that if our sahib died she would die with him and truly our sahib had given me orders to depart  being mad with fevereh  what could we do sahib this cottonplay was his hearts desire he talked of it in his fever therefore it was his hearts desire that the hajji went to fetch doubtless the hajji could have given him money enough out of hand for ten cottonplays but in this respect also our sahibs virtue was beyond belief or compare great ones do not exchange moneys therefore the hajji saidand i helped with my counselthat we must make arrangements to get the money in all respects conformable with the english law it was great trouble to us butthe law is the law and the hajji showed the old woman the knife by which she would die if our sahib died so i accompanied the hajji  knowing who he was said strickland  no fearing the man a virtue went out from him overbearing the virtue of lesser persons the hajji told bulaki ram the clerk to occupy the seat of government at dupe till our return bulaki ram feared the hajji because the hajji had often gloatingly appraised his skill in figures at five thousand rupees upon any slaveblock the hajji then said to me come and we will make the maneaters play the cottongame for my delights delight the hajji loved our sahib with the love of a father for his son of a saved for his saviour of a great one for a great one but i said we cannot go to that sheshaheli place without a hundred rifles we have here five the hajji said i have untied as knot in my headhandkerchief which will be more to us than a thousand i saw that he had so loosed it that it lay flagwise on his shoulder then i knew that he was a great one with virtue in him  we came to the highlands of the sheshaheli on the dawn of the second dayabout the time of the stirring of the cold wind the hajji walked delicately across the open place where their filth is and scratched upon the gate which was shut when it opened i saw the maneaters lying on their cots under the eaves of the huts they rolled off they rose up one behind the other the length of the street and the fear on their faces was as leaves whitening to a breeze the hajji stood in the gate guarding his skirts from defilement the hajji said i am here once again give me six and yoke up they zealously then pushed to us with poles six and yoked them with a heavy tree the hajji then said fetch fire from the morning hearth and come to windward the wind is strong on those headlands at sunrise so when each had emptied his crock of fire in front of that which was before him the broadside of the town roared into flame and all went the hajji then said at the end of a time there will come here the white man ye once chased for sport he will demand labour to plant such and such stuff ye are that labour and your spawn after you they said lifting their heads a very little from the edge of the ashes we are that labour and our spawn after us the hajji said what is also my name they said thy name is also the merciful the hajji said praise then my mercy and while they did this the hajji walked away i following  the infant made some noise in his throat and reached for more burgundy  about noon one of our six fell dead fright only frights sahib none hadnone couldtouch him since they were in pairs and the other of the fork was mad and sang foolishly we waited for some heathen to do what was needful there came at last angari men with goats the hajji said what do ye see they said oh our lord we neither see nor hear the hajji said but i command ye to see and to hear and to say they said oh our lord it is to our commanded eyes as though slaves stood in a fork the hajji said so testify before the officer who waits you in the town of dupe they said what shall come to us after the hajji said the just reward for the informer but if ye do not testify then a punishment which shall cause birds to fall from the trees in terror and monkeys to scream for pity hearing this the angari men hastened to dupe the hajji then said to me are those things sufficient to establish our case or must i drive in a village full i said that three witnesses amply established any case but as yet i said the hajji had not offered his slaves for sale it is true as our sahib said just now there is one fine for catching slaves and yet another for making to sell them and it was the double fine that we needed sahib for our sahibs cottonplay we had forearranged all this with bulaki ram who knows the english law and i thought the hajji remembered but he grew angry and cried out o god refuge of the afflicted must i who am what i am peddle this dogs meat by the roadside to gain his delight for my hearts delight none the less he admitted it was the english law and so he offered me the sixfivein a small voice with an averted head the sheshaheli do not smell of sour milk as heathen should they smell like leopards sahib this is because they eat men  maybe said strickland but where were thy wits one witness is not sufficient to establish the fact of a sale  what could we do sahib there was the hajjis reputation to consider we could not have called in a heathen witness for such a thing and moreover the sahib forgets that the defendant himself was making this case he would not contest his own evidence otherwise i know the law of evidence well enough  so then we went to dupe and while bulaki ram waited among the angari men i ran to see our sahib in bed his eyes were very bright and his mouth was full of upsidedown orders but the old woman had not loosened her hair for death the hajji said be quick with my trial i am not job the hajji was a learned man we made the trial swiftly to a sound of soothing voices round the bed yetyet because no man can be sure whether a sahib of that blood sees or does not see we made it strictly in the manner of the forms of the english law only the witnesses and the slaves and the prisoner we kept without for his noses sake  then he did not see the prisoner said strickland  i stood by to shackle up an angari in case he should demand it but by gods favour he was too far fevered to ask for one it is quite true he signed the papers it is quite true he saw the money put away in the safetwo hundred and ten english pounds and it is quite true that the gold wrought on him as a strong cure but as to his seeing the prisoner and having speech with the maneatersthe hajji breathed all that on his forehead to sink into his sick brain a little as ye have heard has remained ah but when the fever broke and our sahib called for the finebook and the thin little picturebooks from europe with the pictures of ploughs and hoes and cotton3dmillsah then he laughed as he used to laugh sahib it was his hearts desire this cottonplay the hajji loved him as who does not it was a little little arrangement sahib of whichis it necessary to tell all the world  and when didst thou know who the hajji was said strickland  not for a certainty till he and our sahib had returned from their visit to the sheshaheli country it is quite true as our sahib says the maneaters lay flat around his feet and asked for spades to cultivate cotton that very night when i was cooking the dinner the hajji said to me i go to my own place though god knows whether the man with the stone eyes have left me an ox a slave or a woman i said thou art then that one the hajji said i am ten thousand rupees reward into thy hand shall we make another lawcase and get more cotton machines for the boy i said what dog am i to do this may god prolong thy life a thousand years the hajji said who has seen tomorrow god has given me as it were a son in my old age and i praise him see that the breed is not lost  he walked then from the cookingplace to our sahibs officetable under the tree where our sahib held in his hand a blue envelope of service newly come in by runner from the north at this fearing evil news for the hajji i would have restrained him but he said we be both great ones neither of us will fail our sahib looked up to invite the hajji to approach before he opened the letter but the hajji stood off till our sahib had well opened and well read the letter then the hajji said is it permitted to say farewell our sahib stabbed the letter on the file with a deep and joyful breath and cried a welcome the hajji said i go to my own place and he loosed from his neck a chained heart of ambergris set in soft gold and held it forth our sahib snatched it swiftly in the closed fist down turned and said if thy name be written hereon it is needless for a name is already engraved on my heart the hajji said and on mine also is a name engraved but there is no name on the amulet the hajji stooped to our sahibs feet but our sahib raised and embraced him and the hajji covered his mouth with his shouldercloth because it worked and so he went away  and what order was in the service letter stalky murmured  only an order for our sahib to write a report on some new cattle sickness but all orders come in the same make of envelope we could not tell what order it might have been  when he opened the lettermy sonmade he no sign a cough an oath strickland asked  none sahib i watched his hands they did not shake afterward he wiped his face but he was sweating before from the heat  did he know did he know who the hajji was said the infant in english  i am a poor man who can say what a sahib of that get knows or does not know but the hajji is right the breed should not be lost it is not very hot for little children in dupe and as regards nurses my sisters cousin at jull  hm that is the boys own concern i wonder if his chief ever knew said strickland  assuredly said imam din on the night before our sahib went down to the sea the great sahibthe man with the stone eyesdined with him in his camp i being in charge of the table they talked a long while and the great sahib said what didst thou think of that one we do not say ibn makarrah yonder our sahib said which one the great sahib said that one which taught thy maneaters to grow cotton for thee he was in thy district three months to my certain knowledge and i looked by every runner that thou wouldst send me in his head our sahib said if his head had been needed another man should have been appointed to govern my district for he was my friend the great sahib laughed and said if i had needed a lesser man in thy place be sure i would have sent him as if i had needed the head of that one be sure i would have sent men to bring it to me but tell me now by what means didst thou twist him to thy use and our profit in this cottonplay our sahib said by god i did not use that man in any fashion whatever he was my friend the great sahib said toh vac bosh tell our sahib shook his head as he doesas he did when a childand they looked at each other like swordplay men in the ring at a fair the great sahib dropped his eyes first and he said so be it i should perhaps have answered thus in my youth no matter i have made treaty with that one as an ally of the state some day he shall tell me the tale then i brought in fresh coffee and they ceased but i do not think that one will tell the great sahib more than our sahib told him  wherefore i asked  because they are both great ones and i have observed in my life that great ones employ words very little between each other in their dealings still less when they speak to a third concerning those dealings also they profit by silence now i think that the mother has come down from the room and i will go rub his feet till he sleeps  his ears had caught agness step at the stairhead and presently she passed us on her way to the music room humming the magnificat     the new knighthood              who gives him the bath               i said the wet             rank junglesweat               ill give him the bath              wholl sing the psalms               we said the palms             ere the hot wind

hes worth               ill put to the proof              wholl choose him for knight               i said his mother             before any other               my very own knight           and after this fashion adventure to seek          was sir galahad madeas it might be last week     the puzzler  i had not seen penfentenyou since the middle nineties when he was minister of ways and woodsides in de thouars first administration last summer though he nominally held the same portfolio he was his colonys premier in all but name and the idol of his own province which is two and a half times the size of england politically his creed was his growing country and he came over to england to develop a great idea in her behalf  believing that he had put it in train i made haste to welcome him to my house for a week  that he was chased to my door by his own agentgeneral in a motor that they turned my study into a cabinet meeting which i was not invited to attend that the local telegraph all but broke down beneath the strain of hundred word coded cables and that i practically broke into the house of a stranger to get him telephonic facilities on a sunday are things i overlook what i objected to was his ingratitude while i thus tore up england to help him so i said why on earth didnt you see your opposite number in town instead of bringing your office work here  eh who said he looking up from his fourth cable since lunch  see the english minister for ways and woodsides  i saw him said penfentenyou without enthusiasm  it seemed that he had called twice on the gentleman but without an appointmenti thought if i wasnt big enough my business wasand each time had found him engaged a third party intervening suggested that a meeting might be arranged if due notice were given  then said penfentenyou i called at the office at ten oclock  but theyd be in bed i cried  one of the babies was awake he told me thatthat my sort of questions he slapped the pile of cableswere only taken between 11 and 2 pm so i waited  and when you got to business i asked  he made a gesture of despair it was like talking to children theyd never heard of it  and your opposite number  penfentenyou described him  hush you mustnt talk like that i shuddered hes one of the best of good fellows you should meet him socially  ive done that too he said have you  heaven forbid i cried but thats the proper thing to say  oh he said all the proper things only i thought as this was england that theyd more or less have the hang of all thegeneral hangtogether of my idea but i had to explain it from the beginning  ah theyd probably mislaid the papers i said and i told him the story of a threemillion pound insurrection caused by a deputy undersecretary sitting upon a mass of greenlabelled correspondence instead of reading it  i wonder it doesnt happen every week the answered dyou mind my having the agentgeneral to dinner again tonight ill wire and he can motor down  the agentgeneral arrived two hours later a patient and expostulating person visibly torn between the pulling devil of a rampant colony and the placid baker of a largely uninterested england but with penfentenyou behind him he had worked for he told us that lord lundiethe law lord was the final authority on the legal and constitutional aspects of the great idea and to him it must be referred  good heavens alive thundered penfentenyou i told you to get that settled last christmas  it was the middle of the houseparty season said the agentgeneral mildly lord lundies at credence green nowhe spends his holidays there its only forty miles off  shant i disturb his holiness said penfentenyou heavily perhaps my sort of questions he snorted maynt be discussed except at midnight  oh dont be a child i said  what this country needs said penfentenyou is and for ten minutes he trumpeted rebellion  what you need is to pay for your own protection i cut in when he drew breath and i showed him a yellowish paper supplied gratis by government which is called schedule d to my merciless delight he had never seen the thing before and i completed my victory over him and all the colonies with a brasseys naval annual and a statesmans year book  the agentgeneral interposed with agentgeneralities but they were merely provocateurs about ties of sentiment  they be blowed said penfentenyou whats the good of sentiment towards a kindergarten  quite so ties of common funk are the things that bind us together and the sooner you new nations realize it the better what you need is an annual invasion then youd grow up  thank you thank you said the agentgeneral thats what i am always trying to tell my people  but my dear fool penfentenyou almost wept do you pretend that these bananafingered amateurs at home are grown up  you poor serious pagan man i retorted if you take em that way youll wreck your great idea  will you take him to lord lundies tomorrow said the agentgeneral promptly  i suppose i must i said if you wont  not me im going home said the agentgeneral and departed i am glad that i am no colonys agentgeneral  penfentenyou continued to argue about naval contributions till 115 am though i was victor from the first  at ten oclock i got him and his correspondence into the motor and he had the decency to ask whether he had been unpolished overnight i replied that i waited an apology this he made excuse for renewed arguments and used wayside shows as illustrations of the decadence of england  for example we burst a tyre within a mile of credence green and to save time walked into the beautifully kept little village his eye was caught by a building of paleblue tin stencilled calvinist chapel before whose shuttered windows an italian organgrinder with a petticoated monkey was playing dolly grey  yes thats it snapped the egoist thats a parable of the general situation in england and look at those brutes a huge household removals van was halted at a publichouse the men in charge were drinking beer from blue and white mugs it seemed to me a pretty sight but penfentenyou said it represented our national attitude  lord lundies summer restingplace we learned was a farm a little out of the village up a hill round which curled a high hedged road only an initiated few spend their holidays at credence green and they have trained the householders to keep the place select penfentenyou made a grievance of this as we walked up the lane followed at a distance by the organgrinder  suppose he is having a houseparty he said anythings possible in this insane land  just at that minute we found ourselves opposite an empty villa its roof was of black slate with bright unweathered ridgetiling its walls were of bloodcoloured brick cornered and banded with vermiculated stucco work and there was cobalt magenta and purest applegreen windowglass on either side of the front door the whole was fenced from the road by a low brickpillared flint wall topped with a castiron gothic rail picked out in blue and gold  tight beds of geranium calceolaria and lobelia speckled the glassplat from whose centre rose one of the finest araucarias its other name by the way is monkeypuzzler that it has ever been my lot to see it must have been full thirty feet high and its foliage exquisitely answered the iron railings such bijou ne plus ultras replete with all the amenities do not as i pointed out to penfentenyou transpire outside of england  a hedge swinging sharp right flanked the garden and above it on a slope of daisydotted meadows we could see lord lundies tiled and halftimbered summer farmhouse of a sudden we heard voices behind the treethe fine full tones of the unembarrassed english speaking to their equalsthat tore through the hedge like sleet through rafters  that it is not called monkeypuzzler for nothing i willingly concedethis was a rich and rolling notebut on the other hand  i submit me lud that the name implies that it might could would or should be ascended by a monkey and not that the ascent is a physical impossibility i believe one of our south american spider monkeys wouldnt hesitate by jove it might be worth trying if  this was a crisper voice than the first a third higherpitched and full of pleasant affectations broke in  oh practical men there is no ape here why do you waste one of gods own days on unprofitable discussion give me a match  ive a good mind to make you demonstrate in your own person come on bubbles well make jimmy climb  there was a sound of scuffling broken by squeaks from jimmy of the high voice i turned back and drew penfentenyou into the side of the flanking hedge i remembered to have read in a society paper that lord lundies lesser name was bubbles  what are they doing penfentenyou said sharply drunk  just playing superabundant vitality of the race you know well watch em i answered the noise ceased  my deliver jimmy gasped the ram caught in the thicket andim the only one who can talk neapolitan leggo my collar he cried aloud in a foreign tongue and was answered from the gate  its the calvinistic organgrinder i whispered i had already found a practicable break at the bottom of the hedge theyre going to try to make the monkey climb i believe  herelet me look penfentenyou flung himself down and rooted till he too broke a peephole we lay side by side commanding the entire garden at ten yards range  you know em said penfentenyou as i made some noise or other  by sight only the big fellow in flannels is lord lundie the lightbuilt one with the yellow beard painted his picture at the last academy hes a swell ra james loman  and the brown chap with the hands  tomling sir christopher tomling the south american engineer who built the  san juan viaduct i know said penfentenyou we ought to have had him with us do you think a monkey would climb the tree  the organgrinder at the gate fenced his beast with one arm as jimmytalked  dont show off your futile accomplishments said lord lundie tell him its an experiment interest him  shut up bubbles you arent in court jimmy replied this needs delicacy giuseppe says  interest the monkey the brown engineer interrupted he wont climb for love cut up to the house and get some biscuits bubblessugar ones and an orange or two no need to tell our womenfolk  the huge white figure lobbed off at a trot which would not have disgraced a boy of seventeen i gathered from something jimmy let fall that the three had been at harrow together  that tomling has a head on his shoulders muttered penfentenyou pity we didnt get him for the colony but the question is will the monkey climb  be quick jimmy tell the man well give him five bob for the loan of the beast now run the organ under the tree and well dress it when bubbles comes back sir christopher cried  ive often wondered said penfentenyou whether it would puzzle a monkey he had forgotten the needs of his growing nation and was earnestly parting the whitethorn stems with his fingers                                  giuseppe and jimmy did as they were told the monkey following them with a wary and malignant eye  heres a discovery said jimmy the singing part of this organ comes off the wheels he spoke volubly to the proprietor oh its so as giuseppe can take it to his room o nights and play it dyou hear that the organgrinder after his days crime plays his accursed machine for love for love chris and michael angelo was one of em  dont jaw tell him to take the beasts petticoat off said sir christopher tomling  lord lundie returned very little winded through a gap higher up the hedge  theyre all out thank goodness he cried but ive raided what i could macrons glaces candied fruit and a bag of oranges  excellent said the worldrenowned contractor  jimmy youre the lightweight jump up on the organ and impale these things on the leaves as i hand em  i see said jimmy capering like a springbuck upward and onward eh first hell reach out forhow infernal prickly these leaves arethis biscuit next well lure him onthats about the reach of his armwith the marron glare and then hell open out this orange how human how like your ignoble career bubbles  with care and elaboration they ornamented that trees lower branches with sugartopped biscuits oranges bits of banana and marrons glares till it looked very apes path to paradise  unchain the gyascutis said sir christopher commandingly giuseppe placed the monkey atop of the organ where the beast misunderstanding stood on his head  hes throwing himself on the mercy of the court me lud said jimmy nonow hes interested now hes reaching after higher things what wouldnt i give to have here he mentioned a name not unhonoured in british art ambition plucking apples of sodom the monkey had pricked himself and was swearing genius hampered by convention oh theres a whole bushelful of allegories in it  give him time hes balancing the probabilities said lord lundie  the three closed round the monkeyhanging on his every motion with an earnestness almost equal to ours the great judges headseamed and vertical forehead iron mouth and pikelike underjaw all set on that thick neck rising out of the white flannelled collarwas thrown against the puckered green silk of the organfront as it might have been a cameo of titus jimmy with raised eyes and parted lips fingered his grizzled chestnut beard and i was near enough tonote the capable beauty of his hands sir christopher stood a little apart his arms folded behind his back one heavy brown boot thrust forward chin in as curbed and black eyebrows lowered to shade the keen eyes  giuseppes dark face between flashing earrings a twisted rag of red and yellow silk round his throat turned from the reaching yearning monkey to the pink and white biscuits spiked on the bronzed leafage and upon them all fell the serious and workmanlike sun of an english summer forenoon  fils de saint louis montez au ciel said lord lundie suddenly in a voice that made me think of black caps i do not know what the monkey thought because at that instant he leaped off the organ and disappeared  there was a clash of broken glass behind the tree  the monkeys face distorted with passion appeared at an upper window of the house and a starred hole in the stainedglass window to the left of the front door showed the first steps of his upward path  weve got to catch him cried sir christopher come along  they pushed at the door which was unlocked  yes but consider the ethics of the case said jimmy isnt this burglary or something bubbles  settle that when hes caught said sir christopher were responsible for the beast  a furious clanging of bells broke out of the empty house followed by muffed gurglings and trumpetings  what the deuce is that i asked half aloud  the plumbing of course said penfentenyou what a pity i believe hed have climbed if lord lundie hadnt put him off  wait a moment chris said jimmy the interpreter guiseppe says he may answer to the music of his infancy giuseppe therefore will go in with the organ orpheus with his lute you know avante orpheus theres no neapolitan for bathroom but i fancy your friend is there  im not going into another mans house with a hurdygurdy said lord lundie recoiling as giuseppe unshipped the working mechanism of the organ it developed a hangdown leg from its wheels slipped a strap round his shoulders and gave the handle a twist  dont be a cad bubbles was jimmys answer you couldnt leave us now if you were on the woolsack play orpheus the cadi accompanies                                        with a whoop a buzz and a crash the organ sprang to life under the hand of giuseppe and the procession passed through the rainedtoimitatewalnut front door a moment later we saw the monkey ramping on the roof  hell be all over the township in a minute if we dont head him said penfentenyou leaping to his feet and crashing into the garden we headed him with pebbles till he retired through a window to the tuneful reminder that he had left a lot of little things behind him as we passed the front door it swung open and showed jimmy the artist sitting at the bottom of a newlycleaned staircase he waggled his hands at us and when we entered we saw that the man was stricken speechless his eyes grew redred like a ferretsand what little breath he had whistled shrilly at first we thought it was a fit and then we saw that it was mirththe inopportune mirth of the artistic temperament  the house palpitated to an infamous melody punctuated by the stump of the barrelorgans one leg as giuseppe above moved from room to room after his rebel slave now and again a floor shook a little under the combined rushes of lord lundie and sir christopher tomling who gave many and contradictory orders but when they could they cursed jimmy with splendid thoroughness  have you anything to do with the house panted jimmy at last because were using it just now he gulped and im ahkeeping cave  all right said penfentenyou and shut the hall door  jimmy you unspeakable blackguard jimmy you cur you coward lord lundies voice overbore the flood of melody come up here giussieppes saying something we dont understand  jimmy listened and interpreted between hiccups  he says youd better play the organ bubbles and let him do the stalking the monkey knows him  by jove hes quite right said sir christopher from the landing take it bubbles at once  my god said lord lundie in horror  the chase reverberated over our heads from the attics to the first floor and back again bodies and voices met in collision and argument and once or twice the organ hit walls and doors then it broke forth in a new manner  hes playing it said jimmy i know his acute justinian ear are you fond of music  i think lord lundie plays very well for a beginner i ventured  ah thats the trained legal intellect like mastering a brief i havent got it he wiped his eyes and shook  hi said penfentenyou looking through the stained glass window down the garden whats that                                        a household removals van in charge of four men had halted at the gate a husband and his wife householders beyond questionquavered irresolutely up the path he looked tired she was certainly cross in all this haphazard world the last couple to understand a scientific experiment  i laid hands on jimmythe clamour above drowning speech and with penfentenyous aid propped him against the window that he should see  he saw nodded fell as an umbrella can fall and kneeling beat his forehead on the shut door penfentenyou slid the bolt  the furniture men reinforced the two figures on the path and advanced spreading generously  hadnt we better warn them upstairs i suggested  no ill die first said jimmy im pretty near it now besides they called me names  i turned from the artist to the administrator  coeteris paribus i think wed better be going said penfentenyou dealer in crises  tatake me with you said jimmy ive no reputation to lose but id like to watch em fromeroutside the picture  theres always a modus viviendi penfentenyou murmured and tiptoed along the hall to a back door which he opened quite silently we passed into a tangle of gooseberry bushes where at his statesmanlike example we crawled on all fours and regained the hedge  here we lay up secure in our alibi  but your firmthe woman was wailing to the furniture removals menyour firm promised me everything should be in yesterday and its today you should have been here yesterday  the last tenants aint out yet lydy said one of them  lord lundie was rapidly improving in technique though organgrinding unlike the law is more of a calling than a trade and he hung occasionally on a dead centre giuseppe i think was singing but i could not understand the drift of sir christophers remarks they were spanish  the woman said something we did not catch  you might ave sublet it the man insisted or your gentleman ere might  but i didnt send for the police at once  i wouldnt do that lydy theyre only fruit pickers on a beano they arent particular where they sleep  dyou mean theyve been sleeping there i only had it cleaned last week get them out  oh if you say so well ave em out of it in two twos alf fetch me the spare swinglebar  dont youll knock the paint off the door get them out  what the ell else am i trying to do for you lydy the man answered with pathos but the woman wheeled on her mate  edward theyre all drunk here and theyre all mad there do something she said  edward took one short step forward and sighed hullo in the direction of the turbulent house the woman walked up and down the very figure of domestic tragedy the furniture men swayed a little on their heels and  got him the shout rang through all the windows at once it was followed by a bloodhoundlike bay from sir christopher a maniacal prestissimo on the organ and loud cries for jimmy but jimmy at my side rolled his congested eyeballs owlwise  i never knew them he said im an orphan                                        the front door opened and the three came forth to shortlived triumph i had never before seen a law lord dressed as for tennis with a stumpleg barrelorgan strapped to his shoulder but it is a shy bird in this plumage lord lundie strove to disembarrass himself of his accoutrements much as an illtrained punch and judy dog tries to escape backwards through his frilled collar sir christopher covered with limewash cherished a bleeding thumb and the almost crazy monkey tore at giuseppes hair  the men on both sides reeled but the woman stood her ground idiots she said and once more idiots  i could have gladdened a few convicts of my acquaintance with a photograph of lord lundie at that instant  madam he began wonderfully preserving the roll in his voice it was a monkey  sir christopher sucked his thumb and nodded  take it away and go she replied go away  i would have gone and gladly on this permission but these still strong men must ever be justifying themselves lord lundie turned to the husband who for the first time spoke  i have rented this house i am moving in he said  we ought to have been in yesterday the woman interrupted  yes we ought to have been in yesterday have you slept there overnight said the man peevishly  no i assure you we havent said lord lundie  then go away go quite away cried the woman  they wentin single file down the path they went silently restrapping the organ on its wheels and rechaining the monkey to the organ  damn it all said penfentenyou they do face the music and they do stick by each other in private life  ties of common funk i answered giuseppe ran to the gate and fled back to the possible world lord lundie and sir christopher constrained by tradition paced slowly  then it came to pass that the woman who walked behind them lifted up her eyes and beheld the tree which they had dressed  stop she called and they stopped who did that  there was no answer the eternal bad boy in every man hung its head before the eternal mother in every woman  who put these disgusting things there she repeated  suddenly penfentenyou premier of his colony in all but name left jimmy and me and appeared at the gate if he is not turned out of office that is how he will appear on the day of armageddon  well done you he cried zealously and doffed his hat to the woman have you any children madam he demanded  yes two they should have been here today the firm promised  then were not a minute too soon that monkey escaped it was a very dangerous beast might have frightened your children into fits all the organgrinders fault a most lucky thing these gentlemen caught it when they did i hope you arent badly mauled sir christopher shaken as i was i wanted to get away and laugh i could not but admire the scoundrels consummate tact in leading his second highest trump an ass would have introduced lord lundie and they would not have believed him  it took the trick the couple smiled and gave respectful thanks for their deliverance by such hands from such perils  not in the least said lord lundie anybodyany father would have done as much and pray dont apologize your mistake was quite natural a furniture man sniggered here and lord lundie rolled an eye of doom on their ranks by the way if you have trouble with these personsthey seem to have taken as much as is good for themplease let me know ergood morning  they turned into the lane  heavens said jimmy brushing himself down whos that real man with the real head and we hurried after them for they were running unsteadily squeaking like rabbits as they ran we overtook them in a little nut wood half a mile up the road where they had turned aside and were rolling so we rolled with them and ceased not till we had arrived at the extremity of exhaustion  youyou saw it all then said lord lundie rebuttoning his nineteeninch collar  i saw it was a vital question from the first responded penfentenyou and blew his nose  it was by the way dyou mind telling me your name   summa penfentenyous great idea has gone through a little chipped at the edges but in fine and farreaching shape his opposite number worked at it like a mulea bewildered mule beaten from behind coaxed from in front and propped on either soft side by lord lundie of the compressed mouth and the searing tongue  sir christopher tomling has been ravished from the argentine where after all he was but preparing traderoutes for hostile peoples and now adorns the forefront of penfentenyous advisory board this was an unforeseen extra as was jimmys gratis fulllengthit will be in this years academy of penfentenyou who has returned to his own place  now and again from afar off between the slam and bump of his shifting scenery the glare of his manipulated limelight and the controlled rolling of his thunderdrums i catch his voice lifted in encouragement and advice to his fellowcountrymen he is quite sound on ties of sentiment andalone of colonial statesmen ventures to talk of the ties of common funk  herein i have my reward     the puzzler   the celt in all his variants from builth to ballyhoo  his mental processes are plainone knows what he will do  and can logically predicate his finish by his start  but the englishah the englishthey are quite a race apart   their psychology is bovine their outlook crude and rare  they abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw  but the straw that they were tickled withthe chaff that        they were fed with  they convert into a weavers beam to break their foemans head      with    for undemocratic reasons and for motives not of state   they arrive at their conclusionslargely inarticulate   being void of selfexpression they confide their views to none   but sometimes in a smokingroom one learns why things were       done    in telegraphic sentences half swallowed at the ends   they hint a matters inwardnessand there the matter ends   and while the celt is talking from valencia to kirkwall   the englishah the englishdont say anything at all     little foxes  a tale of the gihon hunt  a fox came out of his earth on the banks of the great river gihon which waters ethiopia he saw a white man riding through the dry dhurrastalks and that his destiny might be fulfilled barked at him  the rider drew rein among the villagers round his stirrup  what said he is that  that said the sheikh of the village is a fox o excellency our governor  it is not then a jackal  no jackal but abu hussein the father of cunning  also the white man spoke half aloud i am mudir of this province  it is true they cried ya saart el mudir o excellency our governor  the great river gihon well used to the moods of kings slid between his milewide banks toward the sea while the governor praised god in a loud and searching cry never before heard by the river  when he had lowered his right forefinger from behind his right ear the villagers talked to him of their cropsbarley dhurrah millet onions and the like the governor stood in his stirrups north he looked up a strip of green cultivation a few hundred yards wide that lay like a carpet between the river and the tawny line of the desert sixty miles that strip stretched before him and as many behind at every halfmile a groaning waterwheel lifted the soft water from the river to the crops by way of a mudbuilt aqueduct a foot or so wide was the waterchannel five foot or more high was the bank on which it ran and its base was broad in proportion abu hussein misnamed the father of cunning drank from the river below his earth and his shadow was long in the low sun he could not understand the loud cry which the governor had cried  the sheikh of the village spoke of the crops from which the rulers of all lands draw revenue but the governors eyes were fixed between his horses ears on the nearest waterchannel  very like a ditch in ireland he murmured and smiled dreaming of a razortopped bank in distant kildare  encouraged by that smile the sheikh continued when crops fail it is necessary to remit taxation then it is a good thing o excellency our governor that you come and see the crops which have failed and discover that we have not lied  assuredly the governor shortened his reins the horse cantered on rose at the embankment of the waterchannel changed leg cleverly on top and hopped down in a cloud of golden dust  abu hussein from his earth watched with interest he had never before seen such things  assuredly the governor repeated and came back by the way he had gone it is always best to see for ones self  an ancient and still bulletspeckled sternwheel steamer with a barge lashed to her side came round the river bend she whistled to tell the governor his dinner was ready and the horse seeing his fodder piled on the barge whinnied back  moreover the sheikh added in the days of the oppression the emirs and their creatures dispossessed many people of their lands all up and down the river our people are waiting to return to their lawful fields  judges have been appointed to settle that matter said the governor they will presently come in steamers and hear the witnesses  wherefore did the judges kill the emirs we would rather be judged by the men who executed gods judgment on the emirs we would rather abide by your decision o excellency our governor  the governor nodded it was a year since he had seen the emirs stretched close and still round the reddened sheepskin where lay el mahdi the prophet of god now there remained no trace of their dominion except the old steamer once part of a dervish flotilla which was his house and office she sidled into the shore lowered a plank and the governor followed his horse aboard  lights burned on her till late dully reflected in the river that tugged at her mooringropes the governor read not for the first time the administration reports of one john jorrocks mfh  we shall need he said suddenly to his inspector about ten couple ill get em when i go home youll be whip baker  the inspector who was not yet twentyfive signified his assent in the usual manner while abu hussein barked at the vast desert moon  ha said the governor coming out in his pyjamas well be giving you capivi in another three months my friend                                 it was four as a matter of fact ere a steamer with a melodious bargeful of hounds anchored at that landing the inspector leaped down among them and the homesick wanderers received him as a brother  everybody fed em everything on board ship but theyre real dainty hounds at bottom the governor explained thats royal youve got hold ofthe pick of the bunchand the bitch thats got hold of youshes a little excitedis may queen merriman out of cottesmore maudlin you know  i know grand old betch with the tan eyebrows the inspector cooed oh ben i shall take an interest in life now hark to em o hark  abu hussein under the high bank went about his nights work an eddy carried his scent to the barge and three villages heard the crash of music that followed even then abu hussein did not know better than to bark in reply  well what about my province the governor asked  not so bad the inspector answered with royals head between his knees of course all the villages want remission of taxes but as far as i can see the whole countrys stinkin with foxes our trouble will be choppin em in cover ive got a list of the only villages entitled to any remission what dyou call this flatsided bluemottled beast with the jowl  beagleboy i have my doubts about him do you think we can get two days a week  easy and as many byes as you please the sheikh of this village here tells me that his barley has failed and he wants a fifty per cent remission  well begin with him tomorrow and look at his crops as we go nothing like personal supervision said the governor  they began at sunrise the pack flew off the barge in every direction and after gambols dug like terriers at abu husseins many earths then they drank themselves potbellied on gihon water while the governor and the inspector chastised them with whips scorpions were added for may queen nosed one and was removed to the barge lamenting mystery a puppy alas met a snake and the bluemottled beagleboy never a dainty hound ate that which he should have passed by only royal of the belvoir tan head and the sad discerning eyes made any attempt to uphold the honour of england before the watching village  you cant expect everything said the governor after breakfast  we got it thougheverything except foxes have you seen may queens nose said the inspector  and mysterys dead well keep em coupled next time till we get well in among the crops i say what a babbling bodysnatcher that beagleboy is ought to be drowned  they bury people so damn casual hereabouts give him another chance the inspector pleaded not knowing that he should live to repent most bitterly  talkin of chances said the governor this sheikh lies about his barley bein a failure if its high enough to hide a hound at this time of year its all right and he wants a fifty per cent remission you said  you didnt go on past the melon patch where i tried to turn wanderer its all burned up from there on to the desert his other waterwheel has broken down too the inspector replied  very good well split the difference and allow him twentyfive per cent off wherell we meet tomorrow  theres some trouble among the villages down the river about their landtitles its good goin ground there too the inspector said  the next meet then was some twenty miles down the river and the pack were not enlarged till they were fairly among the fields abu hussein was there in forcefour of him four delirious hunts of four minutes eachfour hounds per foxended in four earths just above the river all the village looked on  we forgot about the earths the banks are riddled with em thisll defeat us said the inspector  wait a moment the governor drew forth a sneezing hound ive just remembered im governor of these parts  then turn out a black battalion to stop for us well need em old man  the governor straightened his back give ear o people he cried i make a new law  the villagers closed in he called  henceforward i will give one dollar to the man on whose land abu hussein is found and another dollarhe held up the cointo the man on whose land these dogs shall kill him but to the man on whose land abu hussein shall run into a hole such as is this hole i will give not dollars but a most unmeasurable beating is it understood  our excellency a man stepped forth on my land abu hussein was found this morning is it not so brothers  none denied the governor tossed him over four dollars without a word  on my land they all went into their holes cried another therefore i must be beaten  not so the land is mine and mine are the beatings  this second speaker thrust forward his shoulders already bared and the villagers shouted  hullo two men anxious to be licked there must be some swindle about the land said the governor then in the local vernacular what are your rights to the beating  as a riverreach changes beneath a slant of the sun that which had been a scattered mob changed to a court of most ancient justice the hounds tore and sobbed at abu husseins hearthstone all unnoticed among the legs of the witnesses and gihon also accustomed to laws purred approval  you will not wait till the judges come up the river to settle the dispute said the governor at last  no shouted all the village save the man who had first asked to be beaten we will abide by our excellencys decision let our excellency turn out the creatures of the emirs who stole our land in the days of the oppression  and thou sayest the governor turned to the man who had first asked to be beaten  i say 1 will wait till the wise judges come down in the steamer then i will bring my many witnesses he replied  he is rich he will bring many witnesses the village sheikh muttered  no need thy own mouth condemns thee the governor cried no man lawfully entitled to his land would wait one hour before entering upon it stand aside the man fell back and the village jeered him  the second claimant stooped quickly beneath the lifted huntingcrop the village rejoiced  oh such an one son of such an one said the governor prompted by the sheikh learn from the day when i send the order to block up all the holes where abu hussein may hide onthyland  the light flicks ended the man stood up triumphant by that accolade had the supreme government acknowledged his title before all men  while the village praised the perspicacity of the governor a naked pockmarked child strode forward to the earth and stood on one leg unconcerned as a young stork  hal he said hands behind his back this should be blocked up with bundles of dhurra stalksor better bundles of thorns  better thorns said the governor thick ends innermost  the child nodded gravely and squatted on the sand  an evil day for thee abu hussein he shrilled into the mouth of the earth a day of obstacles to thy flagitious returns in the morning  who is it the governor asked the sheikh it thinks  farag the fatherless his people were slain in the days of the oppression the man to whom our excellency has awarded the land is as it were his maternal uncle  will it come with me and feed the big dogs said the governor  the other peering children drew back run they cried our excellency will feed farag to the big dogs  i will come said farag and i will never go he threw his arm round royals neck and the wise beast licked his face  binjamin by jove the inspector cried  no said the governor i believe he has the makings of a james pigg  farag waved his hand to his uncle and led royal on to the barge the rest of the pack followed                                 gihon that had seen many sports learned to know the hunt barge well he met her rounding his bends on grey december dawns to music wild and lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of dervish drums when high above royals tenor bell sharper even than lying beagleboys falsetto break farag chanted deathless war against abu hussein and all his seed at sunrise the river would shoulder her carefully into her place and listen to the rush and scutter of the pack fleeing up the gangplank and the tramp of the governors arab behind them they would pass over the brow into the dewless crops where gihon low and shrunken could only guess what they were about when abu hussein flew down the bank to scratch at a stopped earth and flew back into the barley again as farag had foretold it was evil days for abu hussein ere he learned to take the necessary steps and to get away crisply sometimes gihon saw the whole procession of the hunt silhouetted against the morningblue bearing him company for many merry miles at every half mile the horses and the donkeys jumped the waterchannelsup on change your leg and off again like figures in a zoetrope till they grew small along the line of waterwheels then gibon waited their rustling return through the crops and took them to rest on his bosom at ten oclock while the horses ate and farag slept with his head on royals flank the governor and his inspector worked for the good of the hunt and his province  after a little time there was no need to beat any man for neglecting his earths the steamers destination was telegraphed from waterwheel to waterwheel and the villagers stopped out and put to according if an earth were overlooked it meant some dispute as to the ownership of the land and then and there the hunt checked and settled it in this wise the governor and the inspector side by side but the latter half a horses length to the rear both bareshouldered claimants well in front the villagers halfmooned behind them and farag with the pack who quite understood the performance sitting down on the left twenty minutes were enough to settle the most complicated case for as the governor said to a judge on the steamer one gets at the truth in a huntingfield a heap quicker than in your lawcourts  but when the evidence is conflicting the judge suggested  watch the field theyll throw tongue fast enough if youre running a wrong scent youve never had an appeal from one of my decisions yet  the sheikhs on horsebackthe lesser folk on clever donkeysthe children so despised by farag soon understood that villages which repaired their waterwheels and channels stood highest in the governors favour he bought their barley for his horses  channels he said are necessary that we may all jump them they are necessary moreover for the crops let there be many wheels and sound channelsand much good barley  without money replied an aged sheikh there are no waterwheels  i will lend the money said the governor  at what interest o our excellency  take you two of may queens puppies to bring up in your village in such a manner that they do not eat filth nor lose their hair nor catch fever from lying in the sun but become wise hounds  like rayyalnot like bigglebai already it was an insult along the river to compare a man to the shifty anthropophagous bluemottled harrier  certainly like rayyalnot in the least like bigglebai that shall be the interest on the loan let the puppies thrive and the waterwheel be built and i shall be content said the governor  the wheel shall be built but o our excellency if by gods favour the pups grow to be wellsmelters not filtheaters not unaccustomed to their names not lawless who will do them and me justice at the time of judging the young dogs  hounds man hounds hawands o sheikh we call them in their manhood  the hawands when they are judged at the shaho i have unfriends down the river to whom our excellency has also entrusted hawands to bring up  puppies man pahpeaz we call them o sheikh in their childhood  pahpeat my enemies may judge my pahpeaz unjustly at the shaho this must be thought of  i see the obstacle hear now if the new waterwheel is built in a month without oppression thou o sheikh shalt be named one of the judges to judge the pahpeaz at the shaho is it understood  understood we will build the wheel i and my seed are responsible for the repayment of the loan where are my pahpeaz if they eat fowls must they on any account eat the feathers  on no account must they eat the feathers farag in the barge will tell thee how they are to live  there is no instance of any default on the governors personal and unauthorized loans for which they called him the father of waterwheels but the first puppyshow at the capital needed enormous tact and the presence of a black battalion ostentatiously drilling in the barrack square to prevent trouble after the prizegiving  but who can chronicle the glories of the gihon huntor their shames who remembers the kill in the marketplace when the governor bade the assembled sheikhs and warriors observe how the hounds would instantly devour the body of abu hussein but how when he had scientifically broken it up the weary pack turned from it in loathing and farag wept because he said the worlds face had been blackened what men who have not yet ridden beyond the sound of any horn recall the midnight run which endedbeagleboy leadingamong tombs the hasty whipoff and the oath taken abo e bones to forget the worry the desert run when abu hussein forsook the cultivation and made a sixmile point to earth in a desolate khorwhen strange armed riders on camels swooped out of a ravine and instead of giving battle offered to take the tired hounds home on their beasts which they did and vanished  above all who remembers the death of royal when a certain sheikh wept above the body of the stainless hound as it might have been his sonsand that day the hunt rode no more the badlykept logbook says little of this but at the end of their second season fortynine brace appears the dark entry new blood badly wanted they are beginning to listen to beagleboy                                 the inspector attended to the matter when his leave fell due  remember said the governor you must get us the best blood in englandreal dainty houndsexpense no object but dont trust your own judgment present my letters of introduction and take what they give you  the inspector presented his letters in a society where they make much of horses more of hounds and are tolerably civil to men who can ride they passed him from house to house mounted him according to his merits and fed him after five years of goat chop and worcester sauce perhaps a thought too richly  the seat or castle where he made his great coup does not much matter four masters of foxhounds were at table and in a mellow hour the inspector told them stories of the gihon hunt he ended ben said i wasnt to trust my own judgment about hounds but i think there ought to be a special tariff for empiremakers  as soon as his hosts could speak they reassured him on this point  and now tell us about your first puppyshow all over again said one  and about the earthstoppin was that all bens own invention said another  wait a moment said a large cleanshaven mannot an mfhat the end of the table are your villagers habitually beaten by your governor when they fail to stop foxes holes  the tone and the phrase were enough even if as the inspector confessed afterwards the big blue doublechinned man had not looked so like beagleboy he took him on for the honour of ethiopia  we only hunt twice a weeksometimes three times ive never known a man chastised more than four times a week unless theres a bye  the large looselipped man flung his napkin down came round the table cast himself into the chair next the inspector and leaned forward earnestly so that he breathed in the inspectors face  chastised with what he said  with the kourbashon the feet a kourbash is a strip of old hippohide with a sort of keel on it like the cutting edge of a boars tusk but we use the rounded side for a first offender  and do any consequences follow this sort of thing for the victim i meannot for you  very rarely let me be fair ive never seen a man die under the lash but gangrene may set up if the kourbash has been pickled  pickled in what all the table was still and interested  in copperas of course didnt you know that said the inspector  thank god i didnt the large man sputtered visibly  the inspector wiped his face and grew bolder  you mustnt think were careless about our earthstoppers weve a hunt fund for hot tar tars a splendid dressing if the toenails arent beaten off but huntin as large a country as we do we maynt be back at that village for a month and if the dressings aint renewed and gangrene sets in often as not you find your man pegging about on his stumps weve a wellknown local name for em down the river we call em the mudirs cranes you see i persuaded the governor only to bastinado on one foot  on one foot the mudirs cranes the large man turned purple to the top of his bald head would you mind giving me the local word for mudirs cranes  from a too wellstocked memory the inspector drew one short adhesive word which surprises by itself even unblushing ethiopia he spelt it out saw the large man write it down on his cuff and withdraw then the inspector translated a few of its significations and implications to the four masters of foxhounds he left three days later with eight couple of the best hounds in englanda free and a friendly and an ample gift from four packs to the gihon hunt he had honestly meant to undeceive the large blue mottled man but somehow forgot about it  the new draft marks a new chapter in the hunts history from an isolated phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent institution with brickbuilt kennels ashore and an influence social political and administrative coterminous with the boundaries of the province ben the governor departed to england where he kept a pack of real dainty hounds but never ceased to long for the old lawless lot his successors were exofficio masters of the gihon hunt as all inspectors were whips for one reason farag the kennel huntsman in khaki and puttees would obey nothing under the rank of an excellency and the hounds would obey no one but farag for another the best way of estimating crop returns and revenue was by riding straight to hounds for a third though judges down the river issued signed and sealed landtitles to all lawful owners yet public opinion along the river never held any such title valid till it had been confirmed according to precedent by the governors hunting crop in the hunting field above the wilfully neglected earth true the ceremony had been cut down to three mere taps on the shoulder but governors who tried to evade that much found themselves and their office compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses who took up their time with lawsuits and worse still neglected the puppies the older sheikhs indeed stood out for the unmeasurable beatings of the old daysthe sharper the punishment they argued the surer the title but here the hand of modern progress was against them and they contented themselves with telling tales of ben the first governor whom they called the father of waterwheels and of that heroic age when men horses and hounds were worth following  this same modern progress which brought dog biscuit and brass watertaps to the kennels was at work all over the world forces activities and movements sprang into being agitated themselves coalesced and in one political avalanche overwhelmed a bewildered and not in the least intending it england the echoes of the new era were borne into the province on the wings of inexplicable cables the gihon hunt read speeches and sentiments and policies which amazed them and they thanked god prematurely that their province was too far off too hot and too hard worked to be reached by those speakers or their policies but they with others underestimated the scope and purpose of the new era  one by one the provinces of the empire were hauled up and baited hit and held lashed under the belly and forced back on their haunches for the amusement of their new masters in the parish of westminster one by one they fell away sore and angry to compare stripes with each other at the ends of the uneasy earth even so the gihon hunt like abu hussein in the old days did not understand then it reached them through the press that they habitually flogged to death good revenuepaying cultivators who neglected to stop earths but that the few the very few who did not die under hippohide whips soaked in copperas walked about on their gangrenous anklebones and were known in derision as the mudirs cranes the charges were vouched for in the house of commons by a mr lethabie groombride who had formed a committee and was disseminating literature the province groaned the inspectornow an inspector of inspectorswhistled he had forgotten the gentleman who sputtered in peoples faces  he shouldnt have looked so like beagleboy was his sole defence when he met the governor at breakfast on the steamer after a meet  you shouldnt have joked with an animal of that class said peter the governor look what farag has brought me  it was a pamphlet signed on behalf of a committee by a lady secretary but composed by some person who thoroughly understood the language of the province after telling the tale of the beatings it recommended all the beaten to institute criminal proceedings against their governor and as soon as might be to rise against english oppression and tyranny such documents were new in ethiopia in those days  the inspector read the last half page butbut he stammered this is impossible white men dont write this sort of stuff  dont they just said the governor they get made cabinet ministers for doing it too i went home last year i know  itll blow over said the inspector weakly  not it groombride is coming down here to investigate the matter in a few days  for himself  the imperial governments behind him perhaps youd like to look t my orders the governor laid down an uncoded cable the whiplash to it ran you will afford mr groombride every facility for his inquiry and will be held responsible that no obstacles are put in his way to the fullest possible examination of any witnesses which he may consider necessary he will be accompanied by his own interpreter who must not be tampered with  thats to megovernor of the province said peter the governor  it seems about enough the inspector answered  farag kennelhuntsman entered the saloon as was his privilege  my uncle who was beaten by the father of waterwheels would approach o excellency he said and there are others on the bank  admit said the governor  there tramped aboard sheikhs and villagers to the number of seventeen in each mans hand was a copy of the pamphlet in each mans eye terror and uneasiness of the sort that governors spend and are spent to clear away farags uncle now sheikh of the village spoke it is written in this book excellency that the beatings whereby we hold our lands are all valueless it is written that every man who received such a beating from the father of waterwheels who slow the emirs should instantly begin a lawsuit because the title to his land is not valid  it is so written we do not wish lawsuits we wish to hold the land as it was given to us after the days of the oppression they cried  the governor glanced at the inspector this was serious to cast doubt on the ownership of land means in ethiopia the letting in of waters and the getting out of troops  your titles are good said the governor the inspector confirmed with a nod  then what is the meaning of these writings which came from down the river where the judges are farags uncle waved his copy by whose order are we ordered to slay you o excellency our governor  it is not written that you are to slay me  not in those very words but if we leave an earth unstopped it is the same as though we wished to save abu hussein from the hounds these writings say abolish your rulers how can we abolish except we kill we hear rumours of one who comes from down the river soon to lead us to kill  fools said the governor your titles are good this is madness  it is so written they answered like a pack  listen said the inspector smoothly i know who caused the writings to be written and sent he is a man of a bluemottled jowl in aspect like bigglebai who ate unclean matters he will come up the river and will give tongue about the beatings  will he impeach our landtitles an evil day for him  go slow baker the governor whispered theyll kill him if they get scared about their land  i tell a parable the inspector lit a cigarette declare which of you took to walk the children of milkmaid  melikmeid first or second said farag quickly  the secondthe one which was lamed by the thorn  nono melikmeid the second strained her shoulder leaping my waterchannel a sheikh cried melikmeid the first was lamed by the thorns on the day when our excellency fell thrice  truetrue the second melikmeids mate was malvolio the pied hound said the inspector  i had two of the second melikmeids pups said farags uncle they died of the madness in their ninth month  and how did they do before they died said the inspector  they ran about in the sun and slavered at the mouth till they died  wherefore  god knows he sent the madness it was no fault of mine  thy own mouth hath answered thee the inspector laughed it is with men as it is with dogs god afflicts some with a madness it is no fault of ours if such men run about in the sun and froth at the mouth the man who is coming will emit spray from his mouth in speaking and will always edge and push in towards his hearers when ye see and hear him ye will understand that he is afflicted of god being mad he is in gods hands  but our titlesare our titles to our lands good the crowd repeated  your titles are in my handsthey are good said the governor  and he who wrote the writings is an afflicted of god said farags uncle  the inspector hath said it cried the governor ye will see when the man comes o sheikhs and men have we ridden together and walked puppies together and bought and sold barley for the horses that after these years we should run riot on the scent of a madmanan afflicted of god  but the hunt pays us to kill mad jackals said farags uncle and he who questions my titles to my land  aahh ware riot the governors huntingcrop cracked like a threepounder by allah he thundered if the afflicted of god come to any harm at your hands i myself will shoot every hound and every puppy and the hunt shall ride no more on your heads be it go in peace and tell the others  the hunt shall ride no more said farags uncle then how can the land be governed nono o excellency our governor we will not harm a hair on the head of the afflicted of god he shall be to us as is abu husseins wife in the breeding season  when they were gone the governor mopped his forehead  we must put a few soldiers in every village this groombride visits baker tell em to keep out of sight and have an eye on the villagers hes trying em rather high  o excellency said the smooth voice of farag laying the field and country life square on the table is the afflicted of god who resembles bigglebai one with the man whom the inspector met in the great house in england and to whom he told the tale of the mudirs cranes  the same man farag said the inspector  i have often heard the inspector tell the tale to our excellency at feedingtime in the kennels but since i am in the government service i have never told it to my people may i loose that tale among the villages                                 the governor nodded no harm said he  the details of mr groombrides arrival with his interpreter whom he proposed should eat with him at the governors table his allocution to the governor on the new movement and the sins of imperialism i purposely omit at three in the afternoon mr groombride said i will go out now and address your victims in this village  wont you find it rather hot said the governor they generally take a nap till sunset at this time of year  mr groombrides large loose lips set that he replied pointedly would be enough to decide me i fear you have not quite mastered your instructions may i ask you to send for my interpreter i hope he has not been tampered with by your subordinates  he was a yellowish boy called abdul who had well eaten and drunk with farag the inspector by the way was not present at the meal  at whatever risk i shall go unattended said mr groombride your presence would cow themfrom giving evidence abdul my good friend would you very kindly open the umbrella  he passed up the gangplank to the village and with no more prelude than a salvation army picket in a portsmouth slum cried oh my brothers  he did not guess how his path had been prepared the village was widely awake farag in loose flowing garments quite unlike a kennel huntsmans khaki and puttees leaned against the wall of his uncles house come and see the afflicted of god he cried musically whose face indeed resembles that of bigglebai  the village came and decided that on the whole farag was right  i cant quite catch what they are saying said mr groombride  they saying they very much pleased to see you sar adbul interpreted  then i do think they might have sent a deputation to the steamer but i suppose they were frightened of the officials tell them not to be frightened abdul  he says you are not to be frightened abdul explained a child here sputtered with laughter refrain from mirth farag cried the afflicted of god is the guest of the excellency our governor we are responsible for every hair of his head  he has none a voice spoke he has the white and the shining mange  now tell them what i have come for abdul and please keep the umbrella well up i think i shall reserve myself for my little vernacular speech at the end  approach look listen abdul chanted the afflicted of god will now make sport presently he will speak in your tongue and will consume you with mirth i have been his servant for three weeks i will tell you about his undergarments and his perfumes for his head  he told them at length  and didst thou take any of his perfume bottles said farag at the end  i am his servant i took two abdul replied  ask him said farags uncle what he knows about our landtitles ye young men are all alike he waved a pamphlet mr groombride smiled to see how the seed sown in london had borne fruit by gihon lo all the seniors held copies of the pamphlet  he knows less than a buffalo he told me on the steamer that he was driven out of his own land by demahkerazi which is a devil inhabiting crowds and assemblies said abdul  allah between us and evil a woman cackled from the darkness of a hut come in children he may have the evil eye  no my aunt said farag no afflicted of god has an evil eye wait till ye hear his mirthprovoking speech which he will deliver i have heard it twice from abdul  they seem very quick to grasp the point how far have you got abdul  all about the beatings sar they are highly interested  dont forget about the local selfgovernment and please hold the umbrella over me it is hopeless to destroy unless one first builds up  he may not have the evil eye farags uncle grunted but his devil led him too certainly to question my landtitle ask him whether he still doubts my landtitle  or mine or mine cried the elders  what odds he is an afflicted of god farag called remember the tale i told you  yes but he is an englishman and doubtless of influence or our excellency would not entertain him bid the downcountry jackass ask him  sar said abdul these people much fearing they may be turned out of their land in consequence of your remarks therefore they ask you to make promise no bad consequences following your visit  mr groombride held his breath and turned purple then he stamped his foot  tell them he cried that if a hair of any one of their heads is touched by any official on any account whatever all england shall ring with it good god what callous oppression the dark places of the earth are full of cruelty he wiped his face and throwing out his arms cried tell them oh tell the poor serfs not to be afraid of me tell them i come to redress their wrongsnot heaven knows to add to their burden  the longdrawn gurgle of the practised public speaker pleased them much  that is how the new watertap runs out in the kennel said farag the excellency our governor entertains him that he may make sport make him say the mirthmoving speech  what did he say about my landtitles farags uncle was not to be turned  he says farag interpreted that he desires nothing better than that you should live on your lands in peace he talks as though he believed himself to be governor  well we here are all witnesses to what he has said now go forward with the sport farags uncle smoothed his garments how diversely hath allah made his creatures on one he bestows strength to slay emirs another he causes to go mad and wander in the sun like the afflicted sons of melikmeid  yes and to emit spray from the mouth as the inspector told us all will happen as the inspector foretold said farag i have never yet seen the inspector thrown out during any run  i think abdul plucked at mr groombrides sleeves i think perhaps it is better now sar if you give your fine little native speech they not understanding english but much pleased at your condescensions  condescensions mr groombride spun round if they only knew how i felt towards them in my heart if i could express a tithe of my feelings i must stay here and learn the language hold up the umbrella abdull i think my little speech will show them i know something of their vie intime  it was a short simple carefully learned address and the accent supervised by abdul on the steamer allowed the hearers to guess its meaning which was a request to see one of the mudirs cranes since the desire of the speakers life the object to which he would consecrate his days was to improve the condition of the mudirs cranes but first he must behold them with his own eyes would then his brethren whom he loved show him a mudirs crane whom he desired to love  once twice and again in his peroration he repeated his demand using alwaysthat they might see he was acquainted with their local argotusing always i say the word which the inspector had given him in england long agothe short adhesive word which by itself surprises even unblushing ethiopia  there are limits to the sublime politeness of an ancient people a bulky bluechinned man in white clothes his name redlettered across his lower shirtfront spluttering from under a greenlined umbrella almost tearful appeals to be introduced to the unintroducible naming loudly the unnameable dancing as it seemed in perverse joy at mere mention of the unmentionablefound those limits there was a moments hush and then such mirth as gihon through his centuries had never hearda roar like to the roar of his own cataracts in flood children cast themselves on the ground and rolled back and forth cheering and whooping strong men their faces hidden in their clothes swayed in silence till the agony became insupportable and they threw up their heads and bayed at the sun women mothers and virgins shrilled shriek upon mounting shriek and slapped their thighs as it might have been the roll of musketry when they tried to draw breath some halfstrangled voice would quack out the word and the riot began afresh last to fall was the citytrained abdul he held on to the edge of apoplexy then collapsed throwing the umbrella from him  mr groombride should not be judged too harshly exercise and strong emotion under a hot sun the shock of public ingratitude for the moment rued his spirit he furled the umbrella and with t beat the prostrate abdul crying that he had been betrayed in which posture the inspector on horseback followed by the governor suddenly found him                                 thats all very well said the inspector when he had taken abduls dramatically dying depositions on the steamer but you cant hammer a native merely because he laughs at you i see nothing for it but the law to take its course  you might reduce the charge toertampering with an interpreter said the governor mr groombride was too far gone to be comforted  its the publicity that i fear he wailed is there no possible means of hushing up the affair you dont know what a questiona single question in the house means to a man of my positionthe ruin of my political career i assure you  i shouldnt have imagined it said the governor thoughtfully  and though perhaps i ought not to say it i am not without honour in my own countryor influence a word in season as you know your excellency it might carry an official far  the governor shuddered  yes that had to come too he said to himself well look here if i tell this man of yours to withdraw the charge against you you can go to gehenna for aught i care the only condition i make is that if you writei suppose thats part of your business about your travels you dont praise me  so far mr groombride has loyally adhered to this understanding     gallios song            all day long to the judgmentseat            the crazed provincials drew           all day long at their rulers feet            howled for the blood of the jew           insurrection with one accord            banded itself and woke           and paul was about to open his mouth            when achaias deputy spoke            whether the god descend from above            or the man ascend upon high           whether this maker of tents be jove            or a younger deity           i will be no judge between your gods            and your godless bickerings           lictor drive them hence with rods            i care for none of these things            were it a question of lawful due            or a labourers hire denied           reason

your claims            i care for none of these things            one thing only i see most clear            as i pray you also see           claudius caesar hath set me here            romes deputy to be           it is her peace that ye go to break            not mine nor any kings           but touching your clamour of conscience sake            i care for none of these things     the house surgeon  on an evening after easter day i sat at a table in a homeward bound steamers smokingroom where half a dozen of us told ghost stories as our party broke up a man playing patience in the next alcove said to me i didnt quite catch the end of that last story about the curse on the familys firstborn  it turned out to be drains i explained as soon as new ones were put into the house the curse was lifted i believe i never knew the people myself  ah ive had my drains up twice im on gravel too  you dont mean to say youve a ghost in your house why didnt you join our party  any more orders gentlemen before the bar closes the steward interrupted  sit down again and have one with me said the patience player no it isnt a ghost our trouble is more depression than anything else  how interesting then its nothing any one can see  itsits nothing worse than a little depression and the odd part is that there hasnt been a death in the house since it was builtin 1863 the lawyer said so that decided memy good lady rather and he made me pay an extra thousand for it  how curious unusual too i said  yes aint it it was built for three sistersmoultrie was the namethree old maids they all lived together the eldest owned it i bought it from her lawyer a few years ago and if ive spent a pound on the place first and last i must have spent five thousand electric light new servants wing gardenall that sort of thing a man and his family ought to be happy after so much expense aint it he looked at me through the bottom of his glass  does it affect your family much  my good ladyshes a greek by the wayand myself are middleaged we can bear up against depression but its hard on my little girl i say little but shes twenty we send her visiting to escape it she almost lived at hotels and hydros last year but that isnt pleasant for her she used to be a canarya perfect canaryalways singing you ought to hear her she doesnt sing now that sort of things unwholesome for the young aint it  cant you get rid of the place i suggested  not except at a sacrifice and we are fond of it just suits us three wed love it if we were allowed  what do you mean by not being allowed  i mean because of the depression it spoils everything  whats it like exactly  i couldnt very well explain it must be seen to be appreciated as the auctioneers say now i was much impressed by the story you were telling just now  it wasnt true i said  my tale is true if you would do me the pleasure to come down and spend a night at my little place youd learn more than you would if i talked till morning very likely twouldnt touch your good self at all you might beimmune aint it on the other hand if this influenzainfluence does happen to affect you why i think it will be an experience  while he talked he gave me his card and i read his name was l maxwell mleod esq of holmescroft a city address was tucked away in a corner  my business he added used to be furs if you are interested in fursive given thirty years of my life to em  youre very kind i murmured  far from it i assure you i can meet you next saturday afternoon anywhere in london you choose to name and ill be only too happy to motor you down it ought to be a delightful run at this time of year the rhododendrons will be out i mean it you dont know how truly i mean it very probablyit wont affect you at all andi think i may say i have the finest collection of narwhal tusks in the world all the best skins and horns have to go through london and l maxwell mleod he knows where they come from and where they go to thats his business  for the rest of the voyage upchannel mr mleod talked to me of the assembling preparation and sale of the rarer furs and told me things about the manufacture of furlined coats which quite shocked me somehow or other when we landed on wednesday i found myself pledged to spend that weekend with him at holmescroft  on saturday he met me with a wellgroomed motor and ran me out in an hour and a half to an exclusive residential district of dustless roads and elegantly designed country villas each standing in from three to five acres of perfectly appointed land he told me land was selling at eight hundred pounds the acre and the new golf links whose queen anne pavilion we passed had cost nearly twentyfour thousand pounds to create  holmescroft was a large twostoried low creepercovered residence a verandah at the south side gave on to a garden and two tennis courts separated by a tasteful iron fence from a most parklike meadow of five or six acres where two jersey cows grazed tea was ready in the shade of a promising copper beech and i could see groups on the lawn of young men and maidens appropriately clothed playing lawn tennis in the sunshine  a pretty scene aint it said mr mleod my good ladys sitting under the tree and thats my little girl in pink on the far court but ill take you to your room and you can see em all later  he led me through a wide parquetfloored hall furnished in pale lemon with huge cloisonnee vases an ebonized and gold grand piano and banks of pot flowers in benares brass bowls up a pale oak staircase to a spacious landing where there was a green velvet settee trimmed with silver the blinds were down and the light lay in parallel lines on the floors  he showed me my room saying cheerfully you may be a little tired one often is without knowing it after a run through traffic dont come down till you feel quite restored we shall all be in the garden  my room was rather warm and smelt of perfumed soap i threw up the window at once but it opened so close to the floor and worked so clumsily that i came within an ace of pitching out where i should certainly have ruined a rather lopsided laburnum below as i set about washing off the journeys dust i began to feel a little tired but i reflected i had not come down here in this weather and among these new surroundings to be depressed so i began to whistle  and it was just then that i was aware of a little grey shadow as it might have been a snowflake seen against the light floating at an immense distance in the background of my brain it annoyed me and i shook my head to get rid of it then my brain telegraphed that it was the forerunner of a swiftstriding gloom which there was yet time to escape if i would force my thoughts away from it as a man leaping for life forces his body forward and away from the fall of a wall but the gloom overtook me before i could take in the meaning of the message i moved toward the bed every nerve already aching with the foreknowledge of the pain that was to be dealt it and sat down while my amazed and angry soul dropped gulf by gulf into that horror of great darkness which is spoken of in the bible and which as auctioneers say must be experienced to be appreciated  despair upon despair misery upon misery fear after fear each causing their distinct and separate woe packed in upon me for an unrecorded length of time until at last they blurred together and i heard a click in my brain like the click in the ear when one descends in a diving bell and i knew that the pressures were equalised within and without and that for the moment the worst was at an end but i knew also that at any moment the darkness might come down anew and while i dwelt on this speculation precisely as a man torments a raging tooth with his tongue it ebbed away into the little grey shadow on the brain of its first coming and once more i heard my brain which knew what would recur telegraph to every quarter fox help release or diversion  the door opened and mleod reappeared i thanked him politely saying i was charmed with my room anxious to meet mrs mleod much refreshed with my wash and so on and so forth beyond a little stickiness at the corners of my mouth it seemed to me that i was managing my words admirably the while that i myself cowered at the bottom of unclimbable pits mleod laid his hand on my shoulder and said youve got it now already aint it  yes i answered its making me sick  it will pass off when you come outside i give you my word it will then pass off come  i shambled out behind him and wiped my forehead in the hall  you musnt mind he said i expect the run tired you my good lady is sitting there under the copper beech  she was a fat woman in an apricotcoloured gown with a heavily powdered face against which her black longlashed eyes showed like currants in dough i was introduced to many fine ladies and gentlemen of those parts magnificently appointed landaus and covered motors swept in and out of the drive and the air was gay with the merry outcries of the tennis players  as twilight drew on they all went away and i was left alone with mr and mrs mleod while tall menservants and maidservants took away the tennis and tea things miss mleod had walked a little down the drive with a lighthaired young man who apparently knew everything about every south american railway stock he had told me at tea that these were the days of financial specialisation  i think it went off beautifully my dear said mr mleod to his wife and to me you feel all right now aint it of course you do  mrs mleod surged across the gravel her husband skipped nimbly before her into the south verandah turned a switch and all holmescroft was flooded with light  you can do that from your room also he said as they went in there is something in money aint it  miss mleod came up behind me in the dusk we have not yet been introduced she said but i suppose you are staying the night  your father was kind enough to ask me i replied  she nodded yes i know and you know too dont you i saw your face when you came to shake hands with mamma you felt the depression very soon it is simply frightful in that bedroom sometimes what do you think it isbewitchment in greece where i was a little girl it might have been but not in england do you think or do you  cheer up thea it will all come right he insisted  no papa she shook her dark head nothing is right while it comes  it is nothing that we ourselves have ever done in our lives that i will swear to you said mrs mleod suddenly and we have changed our servants several times so we know it is not them  never mind let us enjoy ourselves while we can said mr mleod opening the champagne  but we did not enjoy ourselves the talk failed there were long silences  i beg your pardon i said for i thought some one at my elbow was about to speak  ah that is the other thing said miss mleod her mother groaned  we were silent again and in a few seconds it must have been a live grief beyond wordsnot ghostly dread or horror but aching helpless griefoverwhelmed us each i felt according to his or her nature and held steady like the beam of a burning glass behind that pain i was conscious there was a desire on somebodys part to explain something on which some tremendously important issue hung  meantime i rolled bread pills and remembered my sins mleod considered his own reflection in a spoon his wife seemed to be praying and the girl fidgetted desperately with hands and feet till the darkness passed onas though the malignant rays of a burningglass had been shifted from us  there said miss mleod half rising now you see what makes a happy home oh sell itsell it father mine and let us go away  but ive spent thousands on it you shall go to harrogate next week thea dear  im only just back from hotels i am so tired of packing  cheer up thea it is over you know it does not often come here twice in the same night i think we shall dare now to be comfortable  he lifted a dishcover and helped his wife and daughter his face was lined and fallen like an old mans after debauch but his hand did not shake and his voice was clear as he worked to restore us by speech and action he reminded me of a greymuzzled collie herding demoralised sheep  after dinner we sat round the diningroom fire the drawingroom might have been under the shadow for aught we knew talking with the intimacy of gipsies by the wayside or of wounded comparing notes after a skirmish by eleven oclock the three between them had given me every name and detail they could recall that in any way bore on the house and what they knew of its history  we went to bed in a fortifying blaze of electric light my one fear was that the blasting gust of depression would returnthe surest way of course to bring it i lay awake till dawn breathing quickly and sweating lightly beneath what de quincey inadequately describes as the oppression of inexpiable guilt now as soon as the lovely day was broken i fell into the most terrible of all dreamsthat joyous one in which all past evil has not only been wiped out of our lives but has never been committed and in the very bliss of our assured innocence before our loves shriek and change countenance we wake to the day we have earned  it was a coolish morning but we preferred to breakfast in the south verandah the forenoon we spent in the garden pretending to play games that come out of boxes such as croquet and clock golf but most of the time we drew together and talked the young man who knew all about south american railways took miss mleod for a walk in the afternoon and at five mleod thoughtfully whirled us all up to dine in town  now dont say you will tell the psychological society and that you will come again said miss mleod as we parted because i know you will not  you should not say that said her mother you should say goodbye mr perseus come again  not him the girl cried he has seen the medusas head  looking at myself in the restaurants mirrors it seemed to me that i had not much benefited by my weekend next morning i wrote out all my holmescroft notes at fullest length in the hope that by so doing i could put it all behind me but the experience worked on my mind as they say certain imperfectly understood rays work on the body  i am less calculated to make a sherlock holmes than any man i know for i lack both method and patience yet the idea of following up the trouble to its source fascinated me i had no theory to go on except a vague idea that i had come between two poles of a discharge and had taken a shock meant for some one else this was followed by a feeling of intense irritation i waited cautiously on myself expecting to be overtaken by horror of the supernatural but my self persisted in being humanly indignant exactly as though it had been the victim of a practical joke it was in great pains and upheavalsthat i felt in every fibre but its dominant idea to put it coarsely was to get back a bit of its own by this i knew that i might go forward if i could find the way  after a few days it occurred to me to go to the office of mr jmm baxterthe solicitor who had sold holmescroft to mleod i explained i had some notion of buying the place would he act for me in the matter  mr baxter a large greyish throatyvoiced man showed no enthusiasm i sold it to mr mleod he said it ud scarcely do for me to start on the runningdown tack now but i can recommend  i know hes asking an awful price i interrupted and atop of it he wants an extra thousand for what he calls your clean bill of health  mr baxter sat up in his chair i had all his attention  your guarantee with the house dont you remember it  yes yes that no death had taken place in the house since it was built i remember perfectly  he did not gulp as untrained men do when they lie but his jaws moved stickily and his eyes turning towards the deed boxes on the wall dulled i counted seconds one two threeone two three up to ten a man i knew can live through ages of mental depression in that time  i remember perfectly his mouth opened a little as though it had tasted old bitterness  of course that sort of thing doesnt appeal to me i went on i dont expect to buy a house free from death  certainly not no one does but it was mr mleods fancyhis wifes rather i believe and since we could meet itit was my duty to my clients at whatever cost to my own feelingsto make him pay  thats really why i came to you i understood from him you knew the place well  oh yes always did it originally belonged to some connections of mine  the misses moultrie i suppose how interesting they must have loved the place before the country round about was built up  they were very fond of it indeed  i dont wonder so restful and sunny i dont see how they could have brought themselves to part with it  now it is one of the most constant peculiarities of the english that in polite conversationand i had striven to be politeno one ever does or sells anything for mere moneys sake  miss agnesthe youngestfell ill he spaced his words a little and as they were very much attached to each other that broke up the home  naturally i fancied it must have been something of that kind one doesnt associate the staffordshire moultries my demon of irresponsibility at that instant created em withwith being hard up  i dont know whether were related to them he answered importantly we may be for our branch of the family comes from the midlands  i give this talk at length because i am so proud of my first attempt at detective work when i left him twenty minutes later with instructions to move against the owner of holmescroft with a view to purchase i was more bewildered than any doctor watson at the opening of a story  why should a middleaged solicitor turn plovers egg colour and drop his jaw when reminded of so innocent and festal a matter as that no death had ever occurred in a house that he had sold if i knew my english vocabulary at all the tone in which he said the youngest sister fell ill meant that she had gone out of her mind that might explain his change of countenance and it was just possible that her demented influence still hung about holmescroft but the rest was beyond me  i was relieved when i reached mleods city office and could tell him what i had donenot what i thought  mleod was quite willing to enter into the game of the pretended purchase but did not see how it would help if i knew baxter  hes the only living soul i can get at who was connected with holmescroft i said  ah living soul is good said mleod at any rate our little girl will be pleased that you are still interested in us wont you come down some day this week  how is it there now i asked  he screwed up his face simply frightful he said thea is at droitwich  i should like it immensely but i must cultivate baxter for the present youll be sure and keep him busy your end wont you  he looked at me with quiet contempt do not be afraid i shall be a good jew i shall be my own solicitor  before a fortnight was over baxter admitted ruefully that mleod was better than most firms in the business we buyers were coy argumentative shocked at the price of holmescroft inquisitive and cold by turns but mr mleod the seller easily met and surpassed us and mr baxter entered every letter telegram and consultation at the proper rates in a cinematographfilm of a bill at the end of a month he said it looked as though mleod thanks to him were really going to listen to reason i was many pounds out of pocket but i had learned something of mr baxter on the human side i deserved it never in my life have i worked to conciliate amuse and flatter a human being as i worked over my solicitor  it appeared that he golfed therefore i was an enthusiastic beginner anxious to learn twice i invaded his office with a bag mleod lent it full of the spelicans needed in this detestable game and a vocabulary to match the third time the ice broke and mr baxter took me to his links quite ten miles off where in a maze of tramway lines railroads and nurserymaids we skelped our divotted way round nine holes like barges plunging through head seas he played vilely and had never expected to meet any one worse but as he realised my form i think he began to like me for he took me in hand by the two hours together after a fortnight he could give me no more than a stroke a hole and when with this allowance i once managed to beat him by one he was honestly glad and assured me that i should be a golfer if i stuck to it i was sticking to it for my own ends but now and again my conscience pricked me for the man was a nice man between games he supplied me with odd pieces of evidence such as that he had known the moultries all his life being their cousin and that miss mary the eldest was an unforgiving woman who would never let bygones be i naturally wondered what she might have against him and somehow connected him unfavourably with mad agnes  people ought to forgive and forget he volunteered one day between rounds specially where in the nature of things they cant be sure of their deductions dont you think so  it all depends on the nature of the evidence on which one forms ones judgment i answered  nonsense he cried im lawyer enough to know that theres nothing in the world so misleading as circumstantial evidence never was  why have you ever seen men hanged on it  hanged people have been supposed to be eternally lost on it his face turned grey again i dont know how it is with you but my consolation is that god must know he must things that seem on the face of em like murder or say suicide may appear different to god heh  thats what the murderer and the suicide can always hopei suppose  i have expressed myself clumsily as usual the facts as god knows emmay be differenteven after the most clinching evidence ive always said thatboth as a lawyer and a man but some people wonti dont want to judge emwell say they cantbelieve it whereas i say theres always a working chancea certaintythat the worst hasnt happened he stopped and cleared his throat now lets come on this time next week i shall be taking my holiday  what links i asked carelessly while twins in a perambulator got out of our line of fire  a potty little ninehole affair at a hydro in the midlands my cousins stay there always will not but what the fourth and the seventh holes take some doing you could manage it though he said encouragingly youre doing much better its only your approach shots that are weak  youre right i cant approach for nuts i shall go to pieces while youre awaywith no one to coach me i said mournfully  i havent taught you anything he said delighted with the compliment  i owe all ive learned to you anyhow when will you come back  look here he began i dont know your engagements but ive no one to play with at burry mills never have why couldnt you take a few days off and join me there i warn you it will be rather dull its a throat and gout placebaths massage electricity and so forth but the fourth and the seventh holes really take some doing  im for the game i answered valiantly heaven well knowing that i hated every stroke and word of it  thats the proper spirit as their lawyer i must ask you not to say anything to my cousins about holmescroft it upsets em always did but speaking as man to man it would be very pleasant for me if you could see your way to  i saw it as soon as decency permitted and thanked him sincerely according to my now welldeveloped theory he had certainly misappropriated his aged cousins monies under power of attorney and had probably driven poor agnes moultrie out of her wits but i wished that he was not so gentle and goodtempered and innocent eyed  before i joined him at burry mills hydro i spent a night at holmescroft miss mleod had returned from her hydro and first we made very merry on the open lawn in the sunshine over the manners and customs of the english resorting to such places she knew dozens of hydros and warned me how to behave in them while mr and mrs mleod stood aside and adored her  ah thats the way she always comes back to us he said pity it wears off so soon aint it you ought to hear her sing with mirth thou pretty bird  we had the house to face through the evening and there we neither laughed nor sung the gloom fell on us as we entered and did not shift till ten oclock when we crawled out as it were from beneath it  it has been bad this summer said mrs mleod in a whisper after we realised that we were freed sometimes i think the house will get up and cry outit is so bad  how  have you forgotten what comes after the depression  so then we waited about the small fire and the dead air in the room presently filled and pressed down upon us with the sensation but words are useless here as though some dumb and bound power were striving against gag and bond to deliver its soul of an articulate word it passed in a few minutes and i fell to thinking about mr baxters conscience and agnes moultrie gone mad in the welllit bedroom that waited me these reflections secured me a night during which i rediscovered how from purely mental causes a man can be physically sick but the sickness was bliss compared to my dreams when the birds waked on my departure mleod gave me a beautiful narwhals horn much as a nurse gives a child sweets for being brave at a dentists  theres no duplicate of it in the world he said else it would have come to old max mleod and he tucked it into the motor miss mleod on the far side of the car whispered have you found out anything mr perseus  i shook my head  then i shall be chained to my rock all my life she went on only dont tell papa  i supposed she was thinking of the young gentleman who specialised in south american rails for i noticed a ring on the third finger of her left hand  i went straight from that house to burry mills hydro keen for the first time in my life on playing golf which is guaranteed to occupy the mind baxter had taken me a room communicating with his own and after lunch introduced me to a tall horseheaded elderly lady of decided manners whom a whitehaired maid pushed along in a bathchair through the parklike grounds of the hydro she was miss mary moultrie and she coughed and cleared her throat just like baxter she sufferedshe told me it was a moultrie castemarkfrom some obscure form of chronic bronchitis complicated with spasm of the glottis and in a dead flat voice with a sunken eye that looked and saw not told me what washes gargles pastilles and inhalations she had proved most beneficial from her i was passed on to her younger sister miss elizabeth a small and withered thing with twitching lips victim she told me to very much the same sort of throat but secretly devoted to another set of medicines when she went away with baxter and the bathchair i fell across a major of the indian army with gout in his glassy eyes and a stomach which he had taken all round the continent he laid everything before me and him i escaped only to be confided in by a matron with a tendency to follicular tonsilitis and eczema baxter waited hand and foot on his cousins till five oclock trying as i saw to atone for his treatment of the dead sister miss mary ordered him about like a dog  i warned you it would be dull he said when we met in the smokingroom  its tremendously interesting i said but how about a look round the links  unluckily damp always affects my eldest cousin ive got to buy her a new bronchitiskettle arthurs broke her old one yesterday  we slipped out to the chemists shop in the town and he bought a large glittering tin thing whose workings he explained  im used to this sort of work i come up here pretty often he said ive the family throat too  youre a good man i said a very good man  he turned towards me in the evening light among the beeches and his face was changed to what it might have been a generation before  you see he said huskily there was the youngestagnes before she fell ill you know but she didnt like leaving her sisters never would he hurried on with his oddshaped load and left me among the ruins of my black theories the man with that face had done agnes moultrie no wrong  we never played our game i was waked between two and three in the morning from my hygienic bed by baxter in an ulster over orange and white pyjamas which i should never have suspected from his character  my cousin has had some sort of a seizure he said will you come i dont want to wake the doctor dont want to make a scandal quick  so i came quickly and led by the whitehaired arthurs in a jacket and petticoat entered a doublebedded room reeking with steam and friars balsam the electrics were all on miss maryi knew her by her heightwas at the open window wrestling with miss elizabeth who gripped her round the knees  miss marys hand was at her own throat which was streaked with blood  shes done it shes done it too miss elizabeth panted hold her help me  oh i say women dont cut their throats baxter whispered  my god has she cut her throat the maid cried out and with no warning rolled over in a faint baxter pushed her under the washbasins and leaped to hold the gaunt woman who crowed and whistled as she struggled toward the window he took her by the shoulder and she struck out wildly  all right shes only cut her hand he said wet towel quick  while i got that he pushed her backward her strength seemed almost as great as his i swabbed at her throat when i could and found no mark then helped him to control her a little miss elizabeth leaped back to bed wailing like a child  tie up her hand somehow said baxter dont let it drip about the place shehe stepped on broken glass in his slippers she must have smashed a pane  miss mary lurched towards the open window again dropped on her knees her head on the sill and lay quiet surrendering the cut hand to me  what did she do baxter turned towards miss elizabeth in the far bed  she was going to throw herself out of the window was the answer i stopped her and sent arthurs for you oh we can never hold up our heads again  miss mary writhed and fought for breath baxter found a shawl which he threw over her shoulders  nonsense said he that isnt like mary but his face worked when he said it  you wouldnt believe about aggie john perhaps you will now said miss elizabeth i saw her do it and shes cut her throat too  she hasnt i said its only her hand  miss mary suddenly broke from us with an indescribable grunt flew rather than ran to her sisters bed and there shook her as one furious schoolgirl would shake another  no such thing she croaked how dare you think so you wicked little fool  get into bed mary said baxter youll catch a chill  she obeyed but sat up with the grey shawl round her lean shoulders glaring at her sister im better now she panted arthurs let me sit out too long wheres arthurs the kettle  never mind arthurs said baxter you get the kettle i hastened to bring it from the side table now mary as god sees you tell me what youve done  his lips were dry and he could not moisten them with his tongue  miss mary applied herself to the mouth of the kettle and between indraws of steam said the spasm came on just now while i was asleep i was nearly choking to death so i went to the window ive done it often before without waking any one bessies such an old maid about draughts i tell you i was choking to death i couldnt manage the catch and i nearly fell out that window opens too low i cut my hand trying to save myself who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief i wish you had had my throat bessie i never was nearer dying she scowled on us all impartially while her sister sobbed  from the bottom of the bed we heard a quivering voice is she dead have they took her away oh i never could bear the sight o blood  arthurs said miss mary you are an hireling go away  it is my belief that arthurs crawled out on all fours but i was busy picking up broken glass from the carpet  then baxter seated by the side of the bed began to crossexamine in a voice i scarcely recognised no one could for an instant have doubted the genuine rage of miss mary against her sister her cousin or her maid and that a doctor should have been called in for she did me the honour of calling me doctorwas the last drop she was choking with her throat had rushed to the window for air had near pitched out and in catching at the window bars had cut her hand over and over she made this clear to the intent baxter then she turned on her sister and tonguelashed her savagely  you mustnt blame me miss bessie faltered at last you know what we think of night and day  im coming to that said baxter listen to me what you did mary misled four people into thinking youyou meant to do away with yourself  isnt one suicide in the family enough oh god help and pity us you couldnt have believed that she cried  the evidence was complete now dont you think baxters finger wagged under her nosecant you think that poor aggie did the same thing at holmescroft when she fell out of the window  she had the same throat said miss elizabeth exactly the same symptoms dont you remember mary  which was her bedroom i asked of baxter in an undertone  over the south verandah looking on to the tennis lawn  i nearly fell out of that very window when i was at holmescroftopening it to get some air the sill doesnt come much above your knees i said  you hear that mary mary do you hear what this gentleman says wont you believe that what nearly happened to you must have happened to poor aggie that night for gods sakefor her sakemary wont you believe  there was a long silence while the steam kettle puffed  if i could have proofif i could have proof said she and broke into most horrible tears  baxter motioned to me and i crept away to my room and lay awake till morning thinking more specially of the dumb thing at holmescroft which wished to explain itself i hated miss mary as perfectly as though i had known her for twenty years but i felt that alive or dead i should not like her to condemn me  yet at midday when i saw miss mary in her bathchair arthurs behind and baxter and miss elizabeth on either side in the parklike grounds of the hydro i found it difficult to arrange my words  now that you know all about it said baxter aside after the first strangeness of our meeting was over its only fair to tell you that my poor cousin did not die in holmescroft at all she was dead when they found her under the window in the morning just dead  under that laburnum outside the window i asked for i suddenly remembered the crooked evil thing  exactly she broke the tree in falling but no death has ever taken place in the house so far as we were concerned you can make yourself quite easy on that point mr mleods extra thousand for what you called the clean bill of health was something toward my cousins estate when we sold it was my duty as their lawyer to get it for themat any cost to my own feelings  i know better than to argue when the english talk about their duty so i agreed with my solicitor  their sisters death must have been a great blow to your cousins i went on the bathchair was behind me  unspeakable baxter whispered they brooded on it day and night no wonder if their theory of poor aggie making away with herself was correct she was eternally lost  do you believe that she made away with herself  no thank god never have and after what happened to mary last night i see perfectly what happened to poor aggie she had the family throat too by the way mary thinks you are a doctor otherwise she wouldnt like your having been in her room  very good is she convinced now about her sisters death  shed give anything to be able to believe it but shes a hard woman and brooding along certain lines makes one groovy i have sometimes been afraid of her reasonon the religious side dont you know elizabeth doesnt matter brain of a hen always had  here arthurs summoned me to the bathchair and the ravaged face beneath its knitted shetland wool hood of miss mary moultrie  i need not remind you i hope of the seal of secrecyabsolute secrecyin your profession she began thanks to my cousins and my sisters stupidity you have found out she blew her nose  please dont excite her sir said arthurs at the back  but my dear miss moultrie i only know what ive seen of course but it seems to me that what you thought was a tragedy in your sisters case turns out on your own evidence so to speak to have been an accidenta dreadfully sad onebut absolutely an accident  do you believe that too she cried or are you only saying it to comfort me  i believe it from the bottom of my heart come down to holmescroft for an hourfor half an hour and satisfy yourself  of what you dont understand i see the house every dayevery night i am always there in spiritwaking or sleeping i couldnt face it in reality  but you must i said if you go there in the spirit the greater need for you to go there in the flesh go to your sisters room once more and see the windowi nearly fell out of it myself itsits awfully low and dangerous that would convince you i pleaded  yet aggie had slept in that room for years she interrupted  youve slept in your room here for a long time havent you but you nearly fell out of the window when you were choking  that is true that is one thing true she nodded and i might have been killed asperhaps aggie was killed  in that case your own sister and cousin and maid would have said you had committed suicide miss moultrie come down to holmescroft and go over the place just once  you are lying she said quite quietly you dont want me to come down to see a window it is something else i warn you we are evangelicals we dont believe in prayers for the dead as the tree falls  yes i daresay but you persist in thinking that your sister committed suicide  no no i have always prayed that i might have misjudged her  arthurs at the bathchair spoke up oh miss mary you would ave it from the first that poor miss aggie ad made away with herself an of course miss bessie took the notion from you only mastermister john stood outandand id ave taken my bible oath you was making away with yourself last night  miss mary leaned towards me one finger on my sleeve  if going to holmescroft kills me she said you will have the murder of a fellowcreature on your conscience for all eternity  ill risk it i answered remembering what torment the mere reflection of her torments had cast on holmescroft and remembering above all the dumb thing that filled the house with its desire to speak i felt that there might be worse things  baxter was amazed at the proposed visit but at a nod from that terrible woman went off to make arrangements then i sent a telegram to mleod bidding him and his vacate holmescroft for that afternoon miss mary should be alone with her dead as i had been alone  i expected untold trouble in transporting her but to do her justice the promise given for the journey she underwent it without murmur spasm or unnecessary word miss bessie pressed in a corner by the window wept behind her veil and from time to time tried to take hold of her sisters hand baxter wrapped himself in his newly found happiness as selfishly as a bridegroom for he sat still and smiled  so long as i know that aggie didnt make away with herself he explained i tell you frankly i dont care what happened shes as hard as a rockmary always was she wont die  we led her out on to the platform like a blind woman and so got her into the fly the halfhour crawl to holmescroft was the most racking experience of the day mleod had obeyed my instructions there was no one visible in the house or the gardens and the front door stood open  miss mary rose from beside her sister stepped forth first and entered the hall  come bessie she cried  i darent oh i darent  come her voice had altered i felt baxter start theres nothing to be afraid of  good heavens said baxter shes running up the stairs wed better follow  lets wait below shes going to the room  we heard the door of the bedroom i knew open and shut and we waited in the lemoncoloured hall heavy with the scent of flowers  ive never been into it since it was sold baxter sighed what a lovely restful plate it is poor aggie used to arrange the flowers  restful i began but stopped of a sudden for i felt all over my bruised soul that baxter was speaking truth it was a light spacious airy house full of the sense of wellbeing and peaceabove all things of peace i ventured into the diningroom where the thoughtful mleods had left a small fire there was no terror there present or lurking and in the drawingroom which for good reasons we had never cared to enter the sun and the peace and the scent of the flowers worked together as is fit in an inhabited house when i returned to the hall baxter was sweetly asleep on a couch looking most unlike a middleaged solicitor who had spent a broken night with an exacting cousin  there was ample time for me to review it allto felicitate myself upon my magnificent acumen barring some errors about baxter as a thief and possibly a murderer before the door above opened and baxter evidently a light sleeper sprang awake  ive had a heavenly little nap he said rubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands like a child good lord thats not their step  but it was i had never before been privileged to see the shadow turned backward on the dialthe years ripped bodily off poor human shouldersold sunken eyes filled and alightharsh lips moistened and human  john miss mary called i know now aggie didnt do it and she didnt do it echoed miss mary  i did not think it wrong to say a prayer miss mary continued not for her soul but for our peace then i was convinced  then we got conviction the younger sister piped  weve misjudged poor aggie john but i feel she knows now wherever she is she knows that we know she is guiltless  yes she knows i felt it too said miss elizabeth  i never doubted said john baxter whose face was beautiful at that hour not from the first never have  you never offered me proof john now thank god it will not be the same any more i can think henceforward of aggie without sorrow she tripped absolutely tripped across the hall what ideas these jews have of arranging furniture she spied me behind a big cloisonnee vase ive seen the window she said remotely you took a great risk in advising me to undertake such a journey however as it turns out i forgive you and i pray you may never know what mental anguish means bessie look at this peculiar piano do you suppose doctor these people would offer one tea i miss mine  i will go and see i said and explored mleods newbuilt servants wing it was in the servants hall that i unearthed the mleod family bursting with anxiety  tea for three quick i said if you ask me any questions now i shall have a fit so mrs mleod got it and i was butler amid murmured apologies from baxter still smiling and selfabsorbed and the cold disapproval of miss mary who thought the pattern of the china vulgar however she ate well and even asked me whether i would not like a cup of tea for myself  they went away in the twilightthe twilight that i had once feared they were going to an hotel in london to rest after the fatigues of the day and as their fly turned down the drive i capered on the door step with the alldarkened house behind me  then i heard the uncertain feet of the mleods and bade them not to turn on the lights but to feelto feel what i had done for the shadow was gone with the dumb desire in the air they drew short but afterwards deeper breaths like bathers entering chill water separated one from the other moved about the hall tiptoed upstairs raced down and then miss mleod and i believe her mother though she denies this embraced me i know mleod did  it was a disgraceful evening to say we rioted through the house is to put it mildly we played a sort of blind mans buff along the darkest passages in the unlighted drawingroom and little diningroom calling cheerily to each other after each exploration that here and here and here the troublehad removed itself we came up to the bedroommine for the night againand sat the women on the bed and we men on chairs drinking in blessed draughts of peace and comfort and cleanliness of soul while i told them my tale in full and received fresh praise thanks and blessings  when the servants returned from their days outing gave us a supper of cold fried fish mleod had sense enough to open no wine we had been practically drunk since nightfall and grew incoherent on water and milk  i like that baxter said mleod hes a sharp man the death wasnt in the house but he ran it pretty close aint it  and the joke of it is that he supposes i want to buy the place from you i said are you selling  not for twice what i paid for itnow said mleod ill keep you in furs all your life but not our holmescroft  nonever our holmescroft said miss mleod well ask him here on tuesday mamma they squeezed each others hands  now tell me said mrs mleodthat tall one i saw out of the scullery windowdid she tell you she was always here in the spirit i hate her she made all this trouble it was not her house after she had sold it what do you think  i suppose i answered she brooded over what she believed was her sisters suicide night and dayshe confessed she didand her thoughts being concentrated on this place they felt like alike a burning glass  burning glass is good said mleod  i said it was like a light of blackness turned on us cried the girl twiddling her ring that must have been when the tall one thought worst about her sister and the house  ah the poor aggie said mrs mleod the poor aggie trying to tell every one it was not so no wonder we felt something wished to say something thea max do you remember that night  we need not remember any more mleod interrupted it is not our trouble they have told each other now  do you think then said miss mleod that those two the living ones were actually told somethingupstairsin your in the room  i cant say at any rate they were made happy and they ate a big tea afterwards as your father says it is not our trouble any longerthank god  amen said mleod now thea let us have some music after all these months with mirth thou pretty bird aint it you ought to hear that  and in the halflighted hall thea sang an old english song that i had never heard before           with mirth thou pretty bird rejoice          thy makers praise enhanced          lift up thy shrill and pleasant voice          thy god is high advanced          thy food before he did provide          and gives it in a fitting side          wherewith be thou sufficed          why shouldst thou now unpleasant be          thy wrath against god venting          that he a little bird made thee          thy silly head tormenting          because he made thee not a man          oh peace he hath well thought thereon          therewith be thou sufficed     the rabbis song           if thought can reach to heaven            on heaven let it dwell          for fear that thought be given            like power to reach to hell          for fear the desolation            and darkness of thy mind          perplex an habitation            which thou hast left behind           let nothing linger after            no whispering ghost remain          in wall or beam or rafter            of any hate or pain          cleanse and call home thy spirit            deny her leave to cast          on aught thy heirs inherit            the shadow of her past           for think in all thy sadness            what road our griefs may take          whose brain reflect our madness            or whom our terrors shake          for think lest any languish            by cause of thy distress          the arrows of our anguish            fly farther than we guess            our lives our tears as water            are spilled upon the ground          god giveth no man quarter            yet god a means hath found          though faith and hope have vanished            and even love grows dim          a means whereby his banished            be not expelled from him
