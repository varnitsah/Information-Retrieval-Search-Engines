61790968	heartbreak house  a fantasia in the russian manner on english themes   by bernard shaw   19131916     heartbreak house and horseback hall   where heartbreak house stands  heartbreak house is not merely the name of the play which follows this preface it is cultured leisured europe before the war when the play was begun not a shot had been fired and only the professional diplomatists and the very few amateurs whose hobby is foreign policy even knew that the guns were loaded a russian playwright tchekov had produced four fascinating dramatic studies of heartbreak house of which three the cherry orchard uncle vanya and the seagull had been performed in england tolstoy in his fruits of enlightenment had shown us through it in his most ferociously contemptuous manner tolstoy did not waste any sympathy on it it was to him the house in which europe was stifling its soul and he knew that our utter enervation and futilization in that overheated drawingroom atmosphere was delivering the world over to the control of ignorant and soulless cunning and energy with the frightful consequences which have now overtaken it tolstoy was no pessimist he was not disposed to leave the house standing if he could bring it down about the ears of its pretty and amiable voluptuaries and he wielded the pickaxe with a will he treated the case of the inmates as one of opium poisoning to be dealt with by seizing the patients roughly and exercising them violently until they were broad awake tchekov more of a fatalist had no faith in these charming people extricating themselves they would he thought be sold up and sent adrift by the bailiffs and he therefore had no scruple in exploiting and even flattering their charm    the inhabitants  tchekovs plays being less lucrative than swings and roundabouts got no further in england where theatres are only ordinary commercial affairs than a couple of performances by the stage society we stared and said how russian they did not strike me in that way just as ibsens intensely norwegian plays exactly fitted every middle and professional class suburb in europe these intensely russian plays fitted all the country houses in europe in which the pleasures of music art literature and the theatre had supplanted hunting shooting fishing flirting eating and drinking the same nice people the same utter futility the nice people could read some of them could write and they were the sole repositories of culture who had social opportunities of contact with our politicians administrators and newspaper proprietors or any chance of sharing or influencing their activities but they shrank from that contact they hated politics they did not wish to realize utopia for the common people they wished to realize their favorite fictions and poems in their own lives and when they could they lived without scruple on incomes which they did nothing to earn the women in their girlhood made themselves look like variety theatre stars and settled down later into the types of beauty imagined by the previous generation of painters they took the only part of our society in which there was leisure for high culture and made it an economic political and as far as practicable a moral vacuum and as nature abhorring the vacuum immediately filled it up with sex and with all sorts of refined pleasures it was a very delightful place at its best for moments of relaxation in other moments it was disastrous for prime ministers and their like it was a veritable capua    horseback hall  but where were our front benchers to nest if not here the alternative to heartbreak house was horseback hall consisting of a prison for horses with an annex for the ladies and gentlemen who rode them hunted them talked about them bought them and sold them and gave ninetenths of their lives to them dividing the other tenth between charity churchgoing as a substitute for religion and conservative electioneering as a substitute for politics it is true that the two establishments got mixed at the edges exiles from the library the music room and the picture gallery would be found languishing among the stables miserably discontented and hardy horsewomen who slept at the first chord of schumann were born horribly misplaced into the garden of klingsor but sometimes one came upon horsebreakers and heartbreakers who could make the best of both worlds as a rule however the two were apart and knew little of one another so the prime minister folk had to choose between barbarism and capua and of the two atmospheres it is hard to say which was the more fatal to statesmanship   revolution on the shelf  heartbreak house was quite familiar with revolutionary ideas on paper it aimed at being advanced and freethinking and hardly ever went to church or kept the sabbath except by a little extra fun at weekends when you spent a friday to tuesday in it you found on the shelf in your bedroom not only the books of poets and novelists but of revolutionary biologists and even economists without at least a few plays by myself and mr granville barker and a few stories by mr h g wells mr arnold bennett and mr john galsworthy the house would have been out of the movement you would find blake among the poets and beside him bergson butler scott haldane the poems of meredith and thomas hardy and generally speaking all the literary implements for forming the mind of the perfect modern socialist and creative evolutionist it was a curious experience to spend sunday in dipping into these books and the monday morning to read in the daily paper that the country had just been brought to the verge of anarchy because a new home secretary or chief of police without an idea in his head that his greatgrandmother might not have had to apologize for had refused to recognize some powerful trade union just as a gondola might refuse to recognize a 20000ton liner  in short power and culture were in separate compartments the barbarians were not only literally in the saddle but on the front bench in the house of commons with nobody to correct their incredible ignorance of modern thought and political science but upstarts from the countinghouse who had spent their lives furnishing their pockets instead of their minds both however were practised in dealing with money and with men as far as acquiring the one and exploiting the other went and although this is as undesirable an expertness as that of the medieval robber baron it qualifies men to keep an estate or a business going in its old routine without necessarily understanding it just as bond street tradesmen and domestic servants keep fashionable society going without any instruction in sociology    the cherry orchard  the heartbreak people neither could nor would do anything of the sort with their heads as full of the anticipations of mr h g wells as the heads of our actual rulers were empty even of the anticipations of erasmus or sir thomas more they refused the drudgery of politics and would have made a very poor job of it if they had changed their minds not that they would have been allowed to meddle anyhow as only through the accident of being a hereditary peer can anyone in these days of votes for everybody get into parliament if handicapped by a serious modern cultural equipment but if they had their habit of living in a vacuum would have left them helpless end ineffective in public affairs even in private life they were often helpless wasters of their inheritance like the people in tchekovs cherry orchard even those who lived within their incomes were really kept going by their solicitors and agents being unable to manage an estate or run a business without continual prompting from those who have to learn how to do such things or starve  from what is called democracy no corrective to this state of things could be hoped it is said that every people has the government it deserves it is more to the point that every government has the electorate it deserves for the orators of the front bench can edify or debauch an ignorant electorate at will thus our democracy moves in a vicious circle of reciprocal worthiness and unworthiness    natures long credits  natures way of dealing with unhealthy conditions is unfortunately not one that compels us to conduct a solvent hygiene on a cash basis she demoralizes us with long credits and reckless overdrafts and then pulls us up cruelly with catastrophic bankruptcies take for example common domestic sanitation a whole city generation may neglect it utterly and scandalously if not with absolute impunity yet without any evil consequences that anyone thinks of tracing to it in a hospital two generations of medical students way tolerate dirt and carelessness and then go out into general practice to spread the doctrine that fresh air is a fad and sanitation an imposture set up to make profits for plumbers then suddenly nature takes her revenge she strikes at the city with a pestilence and at the hospital with an epidemic of hospital gangrene slaughtering right and left until the innocent young have paid for the guilty old and the account is balanced and then she goes to sleep again and gives another period of credit with the same result  this is what has just happened in our political hygiene political science has been as recklessly neglected by governments and electorates during my lifetime as sanitary science was in the days of charles the second in international relations diplomacy has been a boyishly lawless affair of family intrigues commercial and territorial brigandage torpors of pseudogoodnature produced by laziness and spasms of ferocious activity produced by terror but in these islands we muddled through nature gave us a longer credit than she gave to france or germany or russia to british centenarians who died in their beds in 1914 any dread of having to hide underground in london from the shells of an enemy seemed more remote and fantastic than a dread of the appearance of a colony of cobras and rattlesnakes in kensington gardens in the prophetic works of charles dickens we were warned against many evils which have since come to pass but of the evil of being slaughtered by a foreign foe on our own doorsteps there was no shadow nature gave us a very long credit and we abused it to the utmost but when she struck at last she struck with a vengeance for four years she smote our firstborn and heaped on us plagues of which egypt never dreamed they were all as preventable as the great plague of london and came solely because they had not been prevented they were not undone by winning the war the earth is still bursting with the dead bodies of the victors    the wicked half century  it is difficult to say whether indifference and neglect are worse than false doctrine but heartbreak house and horseback hall unfortunately suffered from both for half a century before the war civilization had been going to the devil very precipitately under the influence of a pseudoscience as disastrous as the blackest calvinism calvinism taught that as we are predestinately saved or damned nothing that we can do can alter our destiny still as calvinism gave the individual no clue as to whether he had drawn a lucky number or an unlucky one it left him a fairly strong interest in encouraging his hopes of salvation and allaying his fear of damnation by behaving as one of the elect might be expected to behave rather than as one of the reprobate but in the middle of the nineteenth century naturalists and physicists assured the world in the name of science that salvation and damnation are all nonsense and that predestination is the central truth of religion inasmuch as human beings are produced by their environment their sins and good deeds being only a series of chemical and mechanical reactions over which they have no control such figments as mind choice purpose conscience will and so forth are they taught mere illusions produced because they are useful in the continual struggle of the human machine to maintain its environment in a favorable condition a process incidentally involving the ruthless destruction or subjection of its competitors for the supply assumed to be limited of subsistence available we taught prussia this religion and prussia bettered our instruction so effectively that we presently found ourselves confronted with the necessity of destroying prussia to prevent prussia destroying us and that has just ended in each destroying the other to an extent doubtfully reparable in our time  it may be asked how so imbecile and dangerous a creed ever came to be accepted by intelligent beings i will answer that question more fully in my next volume of plays which will be entirely devoted to the subject for the present i will only say that there were better reasons than the obvious one that such sham science as this opened a scientific career to very stupid men and all the other careers to shameless rascals provided they were industrious enough it is true that this motive operated very powerfully but when the new departure in scientific doctrine which is associated with the name of the great naturalist charles darwin began it was not only a reaction against a barbarous pseudoevangelical teleology intolerably obstructive to all scientific progress but was accompanied as it happened by discoveries of extraordinary interest in physics chemistry and that lifeless method of evolution which its investigators called natural selection howbeit there was only one result possible in the ethical sphere and that was the banishment of conscience from human affairs or as samuel butler vehemently put it of mind from the universe    hypochondria  now heartbreak house with butler and bergson and scott haldane alongside blake and the other major poets on its shelves to say nothing of wagner and the tone poets was not so completely blinded by the doltish materialism of the laboratories as the uncultured world outside but being an idle house it was a hypochondriacal house always running after cures it would stop eating meat not on valid shelleyan grounds but in order to get rid of a bogey called uric acid and it would actually let you pull all its teeth out to exorcise another demon named pyorrhea it was superstitious and addicted to tablerapping materialization seances clairvoyance palmistry crystalgazing and the like to such an extent that it may be doubted whether ever before in the history of the world did soothsayers astrologers and unregistered therapeutic specialists of all sorts flourish as they did during this half century of the drift to the abyss the registered doctors and surgeons were hard put to it to compete with the unregistered they were not clever enough to appeal to the imagination and sociability of the heartbreakers by the arts of the actor the orator the poet the winning conversationalist they had to fall back coarsely on the terror of infection and death they prescribed inoculations and operations whatever part of a human being could be cut out without necessarily killing him they cut out and he often died unnecessarily of course in consequence from such trifles as uvulas and tonsils they went on to ovaries and appendices until at last no ones inside was safe they explained that the human intestine was too long and that nothing could make a child of adam healthy except short circuiting the pylorus by cutting a length out of the lower intestine and fastening it directly to the stomach as their mechanist theory taught them that medicine was the business of the chemists laboratory and surgery of the carpenters shop and also that science by which they meant their practices was so important that no consideration for the interests of any individual creature whether frog or philosopher much less the vulgar commonplaces of sentimental ethics could weigh for a moment against the remotest offchance of an addition to the body of scientific knowledge they operated and vivisected and inoculated and lied on a stupendous scale clamoring for and actually acquiring such legal powers over the bodies of their fellowcitizens as neither king pope nor parliament dare ever have claimed the inquisition itself was a liberal institution compared to the general medical council    those who do not know how to live must make a merit of dying  heartbreak house was far too lazy and shallow to extricate itself from this palace of evil enchantment it rhapsodized about love but it believed in cruelty it was afraid of the cruel people and it saw that cruelty was at least effective cruelty did things that made money whereas love did nothing but prove the soundness of larochefoucaulds saying that very few people would fall in love if they had never read about it heartbreak house in short did not know how to live at which point all that was left to it was the boast that at least it knew how to die a melancholy accomplishment which the outbreak of war presently gave it practically unlimited opportunities of displaying thus were the firstborn of heartbreak house smitten and the young the innocent the hopeful expiated the folly and worthlessness of their elders   war delirium  only those who have lived through a firstrate war not in the field but at home and kept their heads can possibly understand the bitterness of shakespeare and swift who both went through this experience the horror of peer gynt in the madhouse when the lunatics exalted by illusions of splendid talent and visions of a dawning millennium crowned him as their emperor was tame in comparison i do not know whether anyone really kept his head completely except those who had to keep it because they had to conduct the war at first hand i should not have kept my own as far as i did keep it if i had not at once understood that as a scribe and speaker i too was under the most serious public obligation to keep my grip on realities but this did not save me from a considerable degree of hyperaesthesia there were of course some happy people to whom the war meant nothing all political and general matters lying outside their little circle of interest but the ordinary warconscious civilian went mad the main symptom being a conviction that the whole order of nature had been reversed all foods he felt must now be adulterated all schools must be closed no advertisements must be sent to the newspapers of which new editions must appear and be bought up every ten minutes travelling must be stopped or that being impossible greatly hindered all pretences about fine art and culture and the like must be flung off as an intolerable affectation and the picture galleries and museums and schools at once occupied by war workers the british museum itself was saved only by a hairs breadth the sincerity of all this and of much more which would not be believed if i chronicled it may be established by one conclusive instance of the general craziness men were seized with the illusion that they could win the war by giving away money and they not only subscribed millions to funds of all sorts with no discoverable object and to ridiculous voluntary organizations for doing what was plainly the business of the civil and military authorities but actually handed out money to any thief in the street who had the presence of mind to pretend that he or she was collecting it for the annihilation of the enemy swindlers were emboldened to take offices label themselves antienemy leagues and simply pocket the money that was heaped on them attractively dressed young women found that they had nothing to do but parade the streets collectingbox in hand and live gloriously on the profits many months elapsed before as a first sign of returning sanity the police swept an antienemy secretary into prison pour encourages les autres and the passionate penny collecting of the flag days was brought under some sort of regulation    madness in court  the demoralization did not spare the law courts soldiers were acquitted even on fully proved indictments for wilful murder until at last the judges and magistrates had to announce that what was called the unwritten law which meant simply that a soldier could do what he liked with impunity in civil life was not the law of the land and that a victoria cross did not carry with it a perpetual plenary indulgence unfortunately the insanity of the juries and magistrates did not always manifest itself in indulgence no person unlucky enough to be charged with any sort of conduct however reasonable and salutary that did not smack of war delirium had the slightest chance of acquittal there were in the country too a certain number of people who had conscientious objections to war as criminal or unchristian the act of parliament introducing compulsory military service thoughtlessly exempted these persons merely requiring them to prove the genuineness of their convictions those who did so were very illadvised from the point of view of their own personal interest for they were persecuted with savage logicality in spite of the law whilst those who made no pretence of having any objection to war at all and had not only had military training in officers training corps but had proclaimed on public occasions that they were perfectly ready to engage in civil war on behalf of their political opinions were allowed the benefit of the act on the ground that they did not approve of this particular war for the christians there was no mercy in cases where the evidence as to their being killed by ill treatment was so unequivocal that the verdict would certainly have been one of wilful murder had the prejudice of the coroners jury been on the other side their tormentors were gratuitously declared to be blameless there was only one virtue pugnacity only one vice pacifism that is an essential condition of war but the government had not the courage to legislate accordingly and its law was set aside for lynch law  the climax of legal lawlessness was reached in france the greatest socialist statesman in europe jaures was shot and killed by a gentleman who resented his efforts to avert the war m clemenceau was shot by another gentleman of less popular opinions and happily came off no worse than having to spend a precautionary couple of days in bed the slayer of jaures was recklessly acquitted the wouldbe slayer of m clemenceau was carefully found guilty there is no reason to doubt that the same thing would have happened in england if the war had begun with a successful attempt to assassinate keir hardie and ended with an unsuccessful one to assassinate mr lloyd george    the long arm of war  the pestilence which is the usual accompaniment of war was called influenza whether it was really a war pestilence or not was made doubtful by the fact that it did its worst in places remote from the battlefields notably on the west coast of north america and in india but the moral pestilence which was unquestionably a war pestilence reproduced this phenomenon one would have supposed that the war fever would have raged most furiously in the countries actually under fire and that the others would be more reasonable belgium and flanders where over large districts literally not one stone was left upon another as the opposed armies drove each other back and forward over it after terrific preliminary bombardments might have been pardoned for relieving their feelings more emphatically than by shrugging their shoulders and saying cest la guerre england inviolate for so many centuries that the swoop of war on her homesteads had long ceased to be more credible than a return of the flood could hardly be expected to keep her temper sweet when she knew at last what it was to hide in cellars and underground railway stations or lie quaking in bed whilst bombs crashed houses crumbled and aircraft guns distributed shrapnel on friend and foe alike until certain shop windows in london formerly full of fashionable hats were filled with steel helmets slain and mutilated women and children and burnt and wrecked dwellings excuse a good deal of violent language and produce a wrath on which many suns go down before it is appeased yet it was in the united states of america where nobody slept the worse for the war that the war fever went beyond all sense and reason in european courts there was vindictive illegality in american courts there was raving lunacy it is not for me to chronicle the extravagances of an ally let some candid american do that i can only say that to us sitting in our gardens in england with the guns in france making themselves felt by a throb in the air as unmistakeable as an audible sound or with tightening hearts studying the phases of the moon in london in their bearing on the chances whether our houses would be standing or ourselves alive next morning the newspaper accounts of the sentences american courts were passing on young girls and old men alike for the expression of opinions which were being uttered amid thundering applause before huge audiences in england and the more private records of the methods by which the american war loans were raised were so amazing that they put the guns and the possibilities of a raid clean out of our heads for the moment    the rabid watchdogs of liberty  not content with these rancorous abuses of the existing law the war maniacs made a frantic rush to abolish all constitutional guarantees of liberty and wellbeing the ordinary law was superseded by acts under which newspapers were seized and their printing machinery destroyed by simple police raids a la russe and persons arrested and shot without any pretence of trial by jury or publicity of procedure or evidence though it was urgently necessary that production should be increased by the most scientific organization and economy of labor and though no fact was better established than that excessive duration and intensity of toil reduces production heavily instead of increasing it the factory laws were suspended and men and women recklessly overworked until the loss of their efficiency became too glaring to be ignored remonstrances and warnings were met either with an accusation of progermanism or the formula remember that we are at war now i have said that men assumed that war had reversed the order of nature and that all was lost unless we did the exact opposite of everything we had found necessary and beneficial in peace but the truth was worse than that the war did not change mens minds in any such impossible way what really happened was that the impact of physical death and destruction the one reality that every fool can understand tore off the masks of education art science and religion from our ignorance and barbarism and left us glorying grotesquely in the licence suddenly accorded to our vilest passions and most abject terrors ever since thucydides wrote his history it has been on record that when the angel of death sounds his trumpet the pretences of civilization are blown from mens heads into the mud like hats in a gust of wind but when this scripture was fulfilled among us the shock was not the less appalling because a few students of greek history were not surprised by it indeed these students threw themselves into the orgy as shamelessly as the illiterate the christian priest joining in the war dance without even throwing off his cassock first and the respectable school governor expelling the german professor with insult and bodily violence and declaring that no english child should ever again be taught the language of luther and goethe were kept in countenance by the most impudent repudiations of every decency of civilization and every lesson of political experience on the part of the very persons who as university professors historians philosophers and men of science were the accredited custodians of culture it was crudely natural and perhaps necessary for recruiting purposes that german militarism and german dynastic ambition should be painted by journalists and recruiters in black and red as european dangers as in fact they are leaving it to be inferred that our own militarism and our own political constitution are millennially democratic which they certainly are not but when it came to frantic denunciations of german chemistry german biology german poetry german music german literature german philosophy and even german engineering as malignant abominations standing towards british and french chemistry and so forth in the relation of heaven to hell it was clear that the utterers of such barbarous ravings had never really understood or cared for the arts and sciences they professed and were profaning and were only the appallingly degenerate descendants of the men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries who recognizing no national frontiers in the great realm of the human mind kept the european comity of that realm loftily and even ostentatiously above the rancors of the battlefield tearing the garter from the kaisers leg striking the german dukes from the roll of our peerage changing the kings illustrious and historically appropriate surname for the war was the old war of guelph against ghibelline with the kaiser as archghibelline to that of a traditionless locality one felt that the figure of st george and the dragon on our coinage should be replaced by that of the soldier driving his spear through archimedes but by that time there was no coinage only paper money in which ten shillings called itself a pound as confidently as the people who were disgracing their country called themselves patriots    the sufferings of the sane  the mental distress of living amid the obscene din of all these carmagnoles and corobberies was not the only burden that lay on sane people during the war there was also the emotional strain complicated by the offended economic sense produced by the casualty lists the stupid the selfish the narrowminded the callous and unimaginative were spared a great deal blood and destruction shall be so in use that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infantes quartered by the hands of war was a shakespearean prophecy that very nearly came true for when nearly every house had a slaughtered son to mourn we should all have gone quite out of our senses if we had taken our own and our friends bereavements at their peace value it became necessary to give them a false value to proclaim the young life worthily and gloriously sacrificed to redeem the liberty of mankind instead of to expiate the heedlessness and folly of their fathers and expiate it in vain we had even to assume that the parents and not the children had made the sacrifice until at last the comic papers were driven to satirize fat old men sitting comfortably in club chairs and boasting of the sons they had given to their country  no one grudged these anodynes to acute personal grief but they only embittered those who knew that the young men were having their teeth set on edge because their parents had eaten sour political grapes then think of the young men themselves many of them had no illusions about the policy that led to the war they went clearsighted to a horribly repugnant duty men essentially gentle and essentially wise with really valuable work in hand laid it down voluntarily and spent months forming fours in the barrack yard and stabbing sacks of straw in the public eye so that they might go out to kill and maim men as gentle as themselves these men who were perhaps as a class our most efficient soldiers frederick keeling for example were not duped for a moment by the hypocritical melodrama that consoled and stimulated the others they left their creative work to drudge at destruction exactly as they would have left it to take their turn at the pumps in a sinking ship they did not like some of the conscientious objectors hold back because the ship had been neglected by its officers and scuttled by its wreckers the ship had to be saved even if newton had to leave his fluxions and michael angelo his marbles to save it so they threw away the tools of their beneficent and ennobling trades and took up the bloodstained bayonet and the murderous bomb forcing themselves to pervert their divine instinct for perfect artistic execution to the effective handling of these diabolical things and their economic faculty for organization to the contriving of ruin and slaughter for it gave an ironic edge to their tragedy that the very talents they were forced to prostitute made the prostitution not only effective but even interesting so that some of them were rapidly promoted and found themselves actually becoming artists in wax with a growing relish for it like napoleon and all the other scourges of mankind in spite of themselves for many of them there was not even this consolation they stuck it and hated it to the end    evil in the throne of good  this distress of the gentle was so acute that those who shared it in civil life without having to shed blood with their own hands or witness destruction with their own eyes hardly care to obtrude their own woes nevertheless even when sitting at home in safety it was not easy for those who had to write and speak about the war to throw away their highest conscience and deliberately work to a standard of inevitable evil instead of to the ideal of life more abundant i can answer for at least one person who found the change from the wisdom of jesus and st francis to the morals of richard iii and the madness of don quixote extremely irksome but that change had to be made and we are all the worse for it except those for whom it was not really a change at all but only a relief from hypocrisy  think too of those who though they had neither to write nor to fight and had no children of their own to lose yet knew the inestimable loss to the world of four years of the life of a generation wasted on destruction hardly one of the epochmaking works of the human mind might not have been aborted or destroyed by taking their authors away from their natural work for four critical years not only were shakespeares and platos being killed outright but many of the best harvests of the survivors had to be sown in the barren soil of the trenches and this was no mere british consideration to the truly civilized man to the good european the slaughter of the german youth was as disastrous as the slaughter of the english fools exulted in german losses they were our losses as well imagine exulting in the death of beethoven because bill sykes dealt him his death blow    straining at the gnat and swallowing the camel  but most people could not comprehend these sorrows there was a frivolous exultation in death for its own sake which was at bottom an inability to realize that the deaths were real deaths and not stage ones again and again when an air raider dropped a bomb which tore a child and its mother limb from limb the people who saw it though they had been reading with great cheerfulness of thousands of such happenings day after day in their newspapers suddenly burst into furious imprecations on the huns as murderers and shrieked for savage and satisfying vengeance at such moments it became clear that the deaths they had not seen meant no more to them than the mimic death of the cinema screen sometimes it was not necessary that death should be actually witnessed it had only to take place under circumstances of sufficient novelty and proximity to bring it home almost as sensationally and effectively as if it had been actually visible  for example in the spring of 1915 there was an appalling slaughter of our young soldiers at neuve chapelle and at the gallipoli landing i will not go so far as to say that our civilians were delighted to have such exciting news to read at breakfast but i cannot pretend that i noticed either in the papers or in general intercourse any feeling beyond the usual one that the cinema show at the front was going splendidly and that our boys were the bravest of the brave suddenly there came the news that an atlantic liner the lusitania had been torpedoed and that several wellknown firstclass passengers including a famous theatrical manager and the author of a popular farce had been drowned among others the others included sir hugh lane but as he had only laid the country under great obligations in the sphere of the fine arts no great stress was laid on that loss immediately an amazing frenzy swept through the country men who up to that time had kept their heads now lost them utterly killing saloon passengers what next was the essence of the whole agitation but it is far too trivial a phrase to convey the faintest notion of the rage which possessed us to me with my mind full of the hideous cost of neuve chapelle ypres and the gallipoli landing the fuss about the lusitania seemed almost a heartless impertinence though i was well acquainted personally with the three bestknown victims and understood better perhaps than most people the misfortune of the death of lane i even found a grim satisfaction very intelligible to all soldiers in the fact that the civilians who found the war such splendid british sport should get a sharp taste of what it was to the actual combatants i expressed my impatience very freely and found that my very straightforward and natural feeling in the matter was received as a monstrous and heartless paradox when i asked those who gaped at me whether they had anything to say about the holocaust of festubert they gaped wider than before having totally forgotten it or rather having never realized it they were not heartless anymore than i was but the big catastrophe was too big for them to grasp and the little one had been just the right size for them i was not surprised have i not seen a public body for just the same reason pass a vote for £30000 without a word and then spend three special meetings prolonged into the night over an item of seven shillings for refreshments    little minds and big battles  nobody will be able to understand the vagaries of public feeling during the war unless they bear constantly in mind that the war in its entire magnitude did not exist for the average civilian he could not conceive even a battle much less a campaign to the suburbs the war was nothing but a suburban squabble to the miner and navvy it was only a series of bayonet fights between german champions and english ones the enormity of it was quite beyond most of us its episodes had to be reduced to the dimensions of a railway accident or a shipwreck before it could produce any effect on our minds at all to us the ridiculous bombardments of scarborough and ramsgate were colossal tragedies and the battle of jutland a mere ballad the words after thorough artillery preparation in the news from the front meant nothing to us but when our seaside trippers learned that an elderly gentleman at breakfast in a weekend marine hotel had been interrupted by a bomb dropping into his eggcup their wrath and horror knew no bounds they declared that this would put a new spirit into the army and had no suspicion that the soldiers in the trenches roared with laughter over it for days and told each other that it would do the blighters at home good to have a taste of what the army was up against sometimes the smallness of view was pathetic a man would work at home regardless of the call to make the world safe for democracy his brother would be killed at the front immediately he would throw up his work and take up the war as a family blood feud against the germans sometimes it was comic a wounded man entitled to his discharge would return to the trenches with a grim determination to find the hun who had wounded him and pay him out for it  it is impossible to estimate what proportion of us in khaki or out of it grasped the war and its political antecedents as a whole in the light of any philosophy of history or knowledge of what war is i doubt whether it was as high as our proportion of higher mathematicians but there can be no doubt that it was prodigiously outnumbered by the comparatively ignorant and childish remember that these people had to be stimulated to make the sacrifices demanded by the war and that this could not be done by appeals to a knowledge which they did not possess and a comprehension of which they were incapable when the armistice at last set me free to tell the truth about the war at the following general election a soldier said to a candidate whom i was supporting if i had known all that in 1914 they would never have got me into khaki and that of course was precisely why it had been necessary to stuff him with a romance that any diplomatist would have laughed at thus the natural confusion of ignorance was increased by a deliberately propagated confusion of nursery bogey stories and melodramatic nonsense which at last overreached itself and made it impossible to stop the war before we had not only achieved the triumph of vanquishing the german army and thereby overthrowing its militarist monarchy but made the very serious mistake of ruining the centre of europe a thing that no sane european state could afford to do    the dumb capables and the noisy incapables  confronted with this picture of insensate delusion and folly the critical reader will immediately counterplead that england all this time was conducting a war which involved the organization of several millions of fighting men and of the workers who were supplying them with provisions munitions and transport and that this could not have been done by a mob of hysterical ranters this is fortunately true to pass from the newspaper offices and political platforms and club fenders and suburban drawingrooms to the army and the munition factories was to pass from bedlam to the busiest and sanest of workaday worlds it was to rediscover england and find solid ground for the faith of those who still believed in her but a necessary condition of this efficiency was that those who were efficient should give all their time to their business and leave the rabble raving to its hearts content indeed the raving was useful to the efficient because as it was always wide of the mark it often distracted attention very conveniently from operations that would have been defeated or hindered by publicity a precept which i endeavored vainly to popularize early in the war if you have anything to do go and do it if not for heavens sake get out of the way was only half carried out certainly the capable people went and did it but the incapables would by no means get out of the way they fussed and bawled and were only prevented from getting very seriously into the way by the blessed fact that they never knew where the way was thus whilst all the efficiency of england was silent and invisible all its imbecility was deafening the heavens with its clamor and blotting out the sun with its dust it was also unfortunately intimidating the government by its blusterings into using the irresistible powers of the state to intimidate the sensible people thus enabling a despicable minority of wouldbe lynchers to set up a reign of terror which could at any time have been broken by a single stern word from a responsible minister but our ministers had not that sort of courage neither heartbreak house nor horseback hall had bred it much less the suburbs when matters at last came to the looting of shops by criminals under patriotic pretexts it was the police force and not the government that put its foot down there was even one deplorable moment during the submarine scare in which the government yielded to a childish cry for the maltreatment of naval prisoners of war and to our great disgrace was forced by the enemy to behave itself and yet behind all this public blundering and misconduct and futile mischief the effective england was carrying on with the most formidable capacity and activity the ostensible england was making the empire sick with its incontinences its ignorances its ferocities its panics and its endless and intolerable blarings of allied national anthems in season and out the esoteric england was proceeding irresistibly to the conquest of europe    the practical business men  from the beginning the useless people set up a shriek for practical business men by this they meant men who had become rich by placing their personal interests before those of the country and measuring the success of every activity by the pecuniary profit it brought to them and to those on whom they depended for their supplies of capital the pitiable failure of some conspicuous samples from the first batch we tried of these poor devils helped to give the whole public side of the war an air of monstrous and hopeless farce they proved not only that they were useless for public work but that in a wellordered nation they would never have been allowed to control private enterprise    how the fools shouted the wise men down  thus like a fertile country flooded with mud england showed no sign of her greatness in the days when she was putting forth all her strength to save herself from the worst consequences of her littleness most of the men of action occupied to the last hour of their time with urgent practical work had to leave to idler people or to professional rhetoricians the presentation of the war to the reason and imagination of the country and the world in speeches poems manifestoes picture posters and newspaper articles i have had the privilege of hearing some of our ablest commanders talking about their work and i have shared the common lot of reading the accounts of that work given to the world by the newspapers no two experiences could be more different but in the end the talkers obtained a dangerous ascendancy over the rank and file of the men of action for though the great men of action are always inveterate talkers and often very clever writers and therefore cannot have their minds formed for them by others the average man of action like the average fighter with the bayonet can give no account of himself in words even to himself and is apt to pick up and accept what he reads about himself and other people in the papers except when the writer is rash enough to commit himself on technical points it was not uncommon during the war to hear a soldier or a civilian engaged on war work describing events within his own experience that reduced to utter absurdity the ravings and maunderings of his daily paper and yet echo the opinions of that paper like a parrot thus to escape from the prevailing confusion and folly it was not enough to seek the company of the ordinary man of action one had to get into contact with the master spirits this was a privilege which only a handful of people could enjoy for the unprivileged citizen there was no escape to him the whole country seemed mad futile silly incompetent with no hope of victory except the hope that the enemy might be just as mad only by very resolute reflection and reasoning could he reassure himself that if there was nothing more solid beneath their appalling appearances the war could not possibly have gone on for a single day without a total breakdown of its organization    the mad election  happy were the fools and the thoughtless men of action in those days the worst of it was that the fools were very strongly represented in parliament as fools not only elect fools but can persuade men of action to elect them too the election that immediately followed the armistice was perhaps the maddest that has ever taken place soldiers who had done voluntary and heroic service in the field were defeated by persons who had apparently never run a risk or spent a farthing that they could avoid and who even had in the course of the election to apologize publicly for bawling pacifist or progerman at their opponent party leaders seek such followers who can always be depended on to walk tamely into the lobby at the party whips orders provided the leader will make their seats safe for them by the process which was called in derisive reference to the war rationing system giving them the coupon other incidents were so grotesque that i cannot mention them without enabling the reader to identify the parties which would not be fair as they were no more to blame than thousands of others who must necessarily be nameless the general result was patently absurd and the electorate disgusted at its own work instantly recoiled to the opposite extreme and cast out all the coupon candidates at the earliest byeelections by equally silly majorities but the mischief of the general election could not be undone and the government had not only to pretend to abuse its european victory as it had promised but actually to do it by starving the enemies who had thrown down their arms it had in short won the election by pledging itself to be thriftlessly wicked cruel and vindictive and it did not find it as easy to escape from this pledge as it had from nobler ones the end as i write is not yet but it is clear that this thoughtless savagery will recoil on the heads of the allies so severely that we shall be forced by the sternest necessity to take up our share of healing the europe we have wounded almost to death instead of attempting to complete her destruction    the yahoo and the angry ape  contemplating this picture of a state of mankind so recent that no denial of its truth is possible one understands shakespeare comparing man to an angry ape swift describing him as a yahoo rebuked by the superior virtue of the horse and wellington declaring that the british can behave themselves neither in victory nor defeat yet none of the three had seen war as we have seen it shakespeare blamed great men saying that could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would neer be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder what would shakespeare have said if he had seen something far more destructive than thunder in the hand of every village laborer and found on the messines ridge the craters of the nineteen volcanoes that were let loose there at the touch of a finger that might have been a childs finger without the result being a whit less ruinous shakespeare may have seen a stratford cottage struck by one of joves thunderbolts and have helped to extinguish the lighted thatch and clear away the bits of the broken chimney what would he have said if he had seen ypres as it is now or returned to stratford as french peasants are returning to their homes today to find the old familiar signpost inscribed to stratford 1 mile and at the end of the mile nothing but some holes in the ground and a fragment of a broken churn here and there would not the spectacle of the angry ape endowed with powers of destruction that jove never pretended to have beggared even his command of words  and yet what is there to say except that war puts a strain on human nature that breaks down the better half of it and makes the worse half a diabolical virtue better for us if it broke it down altogether for then the warlike way out of our difficulties would be barred to us and we should take greater care not to get into them in truth it is as byron said not difficult to die and enormously difficult to live that explains why at bottom peace is not only better than war but infinitely more arduous did any hero of the war face the glorious risk of death more bravely than the traitor bolo faced the ignominious certainty of it bolo taught us all how to die can we say that he taught us all how to live hardly a week passes now without some soldier who braved death in the field so recklessly that he was decorated or specially commended for it being haled before our magistrates for having failed to resist the paltriest temptations of peace with no better excuse than the old one that a man must live strange that one who sooner than do honest work will sell his honor for a bottle of wine a visit to the theatre and an hour with a strange woman all obtained by passing a worthless cheque could yet stake his life on the most desperate chances of the battlefield does it not seem as if after all the glory of death were cheaper than the glory of life if it is not easier to attain why do so many more men attain it at all events it is clear that the kingdom of the prince of peace has not yet become the kingdom of this world his attempts at invasion have been resisted far more fiercely than the kaisers successful as that resistance has been it has piled up a sort of national debt that is not the less oppressive because we have no figures for it and do not intend to pay it a blockade that cuts off the grace of our lord is in the long run less bearable than the blockades which merely cut off raw materials and against that blockade our armada is impotent in the blockaders house he has assured us there are many mansions but i am afraid they do not include either heartbreak house or horseback hall    plague on both your houses  meanwhile the bolshevist picks and petards are at work on the foundations of both buildings and though the bolshevists may be buried in the ruins their deaths will not save the edifices unfortunately they can be built again like doubting castle they have been demolished many times by successive greathearts and rebuilt by simple sloth and presumption by feeble mind and much afraid and by all the jurymen of vanity fair another generation of secondary education at our ancient public schools and the cheaper institutions that ape them will be quite sufficient to keep the two going until the next war for the instruction of that generation i leave these pages as a record of what civilian life was during the war a matter on which history is usually silent fortunately it was a very short war it is true that the people who thought it could not last more than six months were very signally refuted by the event as sir douglas haig has pointed out its waterloos lasted months instead of hours but there would have been nothing surprising in its lasting thirty years if it had not been for the fact that the blockade achieved the amazing feat of starving out europe which it could not possibly have done had europe been properly organized for war or even for peace the war would have lasted until the belligerents were so tired of it that they could no longer be compelled to compel themselves to go on with it considering its magnitude the war of 191418 will certainly be classed as the shortest in history the end came so suddenly that the combatant literally stumbled over it and yet it came a full year later than it should have come if the belligerents had not been far too afraid of one another to face the situation sensibly germany having failed to provide for the war she began failed again to surrender before she was dangerously exhausted her opponents equally improvident went as much too close to bankruptcy as germany to starvation it was a bluff at which both were bluffed and with the usual irony of war it remains doubtful whether germany and russia the defeated will not be the gainers for the victors are already busy fastening on themselves the chains they have struck from the limbs of the vanquished    how the theatre fared  let us now contract our view rather violently from the european theatre of war to the theatre in which the fights are sham fights and the slain rising the moment the curtain has fallen go comfortably home to supper after washing off their rosepink wounds it is nearly twenty years since i was last obliged to introduce a play in the form of a book for lack of an opportunity of presenting it in its proper mode by a performance in a theatre the war has thrown me back on this expedient heartbreak house has not yet reached the stage i have withheld it because the war has completely upset the economic conditions which formerly enabled serious drama to pay its way in london the change is not in the theatres nor in the management of them nor in the authors and actors but in the audiences for four years the london theatres were crowded every night with thousands of soldiers on leave from the front these soldiers were not seasoned london playgoers a childish experience of my own gave me a clue to their condition when i was a small boy i was taken to the opera i did not then know what an opera was though i could whistle a good deal of opera music i had seen in my mothers album photographs of all the great opera singers mostly in evening dress in the theatre i found myself before a gilded balcony filled with persons in evening dress whom i took to be the opera singers i picked out one massive dark lady as alboni and wondered how soon she would stand up and sing i was puzzled by the fact that i was made to sit with my back to the singers instead of facing them when the curtain went up my astonishment and delight were unbounded    the soldier at the theatre front  in 1915 i saw in the theatres men in khaki in just the same predicament to everyone who had my clue to their state of mind it was evident that they had never been in a theatre before and did not know what it was at one of our great variety theatres i sat beside a young officer not at all a rough specimen who even when the curtain rose and enlightened him as to the place where he had to look for his entertainment found the dramatic part of it utterly incomprehensible he did not know how to play his part of the game he could understand the people on the stage singing and dancing and performing gymnastic feats he not only understood but intensely enjoyed an artist who imitated cocks crowing and pigs squeaking but the people who pretended that they were somebody else and that the painted picture behind them was real bewildered him in his presence i realized how very sophisticated the natural man has to become before the conventions of the theatre can be easily acceptable or the purpose of the drama obvious to him  well from the moment when the routine of leave for our soldiers was established such novices accompanied by damsels called flappers often as innocent as themselves crowded the theatres to the doors it was hardly possible at first to find stuff crude enough to nurse them on the best musichall comedians ransacked their memories for the oldest quips and the most childish antics to avoid carrying the military spectators out of their depth i believe that this was a mistake as far as the novices were concerned shakespeare or the dramatized histories of george barnwell maria martin or the demon barber of fleet street would probably have been quite popular with them but the novices were only a minority after all the cultivated soldier who in time of peace would look at nothing theatrical except the most advanced postibsen plays in the most artistic settings found himself to his own astonishment thirsting for silly jokes dances and brainlessly sensuous exhibitions of pretty girls the author of some of the most grimly serious plays of our time told me that after enduring the trenches for months without a glimpse of the female of his species it gave him an entirely innocent but delightful pleasure merely to see a flapper the reaction from the battlefield produced a condition of hyperaesthesia in which all the theatrical values were altered trivial things gained intensity and stale things novelty the actor instead of having to coax his audiences out of the boredom which had driven them to the theatre in an ill humor to seek some sort of distraction had only to exploit the bliss of smiling men who were no longer under fire and under military discipline but actually clean and comfortable and in a mood to be pleased with anything and everything that a bevy of pretty girls and a funny man or even a bevy of girls pretending to be pretty and a man pretending to be funny could do for them  then could be seen every night in the theatres oldfashioned farcical comedies in which a bedroom with four doors on each side and a practicable window in the middle was understood to resemble exactly the bedroom in the flats beneath and above all three inhabited by couples consumed with jealousy when these people came home drunk at night mistook their neighbors flats for their own and in due course got into the wrong beds it was not only the novices who found the resulting complications and scandals exquisitely ingenious and amusing nor their equally verdant flappers who could not help squealing in a manner that astonished the oldest performers when the gentleman who had just come in drunk through the window pretended to undress and allowed glimpses of his naked person to be descried from time to time    heartbreak house  men who had just read the news that charles wyndham was dying and were thereby sadly reminded of pink dominos and the torrent of farcical comedies that followed it in his heyday until every trick of that trade had become so stale that the laughter they provoked turned to loathing these veterans also when they returned from the field were as much pleased by what they knew to be stale and foolish as the novices by what they thought fresh and clever    commerce in the theatre  wellington said that an army moves on its belly so does a london theatre before a man acts he must eat before he performs plays he must pay rent in london we have no theatres for the welfare of the people they are all for the sole purpose of producing the utmost obtainable rent for the proprietor if the twin flats and twin beds produce a guinea more than shakespeare out goes shakespeare and in come the twin flats and the twin beds if the brainless bevy of pretty girls and the funny man outbid mozart out goes mozart    unser shakespeare  before the war an effort was made to remedy this by establishing a national theatre in celebration of the tercentenary of the death of shakespeare a committee was formed and all sorts of illustrious and influential persons lent their names to a grand appeal to our national culture my play the dark lady of the sonnets was one of the incidents of that appeal after some years of effort the result was a single handsome subscription from a german gentleman like the celebrated swearer in the anecdote when the cart containing all his household goods lost its tailboard at the top of the hill and let its contents roll in ruin to the bottom i can only say i cannot do justice to this situation and let it pass without another word    the higher drama put out of action  the effect of the war on the london theatres may now be imagined the beds and the bevies drove every higher form of art out of it rents went up to an unprecedented figure at the same time prices doubled everywhere except at the theatre payboxes and raised the expenses of management to such a degree that unless the houses were quite full every night profit was impossible even bare solvency could not be attained without a very wide popularity now what had made serious drama possible to a limited extent before the war was that a play could pay its way even if the theatre were only half full until saturday and threequarters full then a manager who was an enthusiast and a desperately hard worker with an occasional grantinaid from an artistically disposed millionaire and a due proportion of those rare and happy accidents by which plays of the higher sort turn out to be potboilers as well could hold out for some years by which time a relay might arrive in the person of another enthusiast thus and not otherwise occurred that remarkable revival of the british drama at the beginning of the century which made my own career as a playwright possible in england in america i had already established myself not as part of the ordinary theatre system but in association with the exceptional genius of richard mansfield in germany and austria i had no difficulty the system of publicly aided theatres there court and municipal kept drama of the kind i dealt in alive so that i was indebted to the emperor of austria for magnificent productions of my works at a time when the sole official attention paid me by the british courts was the announcement to the englishspeaking world that certain plays of mine were unfit for public performance a substantial setoff against this being that the british court in the course of its private playgoing paid no regard to the bad character given me by the chief officer of its household  howbeit the fact that my plays effected a lodgment on the london stage and were presently followed by the plays of granville barker gilbert murray john masefield st john hankin lawrence housman arnold bennett john galsworthy john drinkwater and others which would in the nineteenth century have stood rather less chance of production at a london theatre than the dialogues of plato not to mention revivals of the ancient athenian drama and a restoration to the stage of shakespeares plays as he wrote them was made economically possible solely by a supply of theatres which could hold nearly twice as much money as it cost to rent and maintain them in such theatres work appealing to a relatively small class of cultivated persons and therefore attracting only from half to threequarters as many spectators as the more popular pastimes could nevertheless keep going in the hands of young adventurers who were doing it for its own sake and had not yet been forced by advancing age and responsibilities to consider the commercial value of their time and energy too closely the war struck this foundation away in the manner i have just described the expenses of running the cheapest westend theatres rose to a sum which exceeded by twentyfive per cent the utmost that the higher drama can as an ascertained matter of fact be depended on to draw thus the higher drama which has never really been a commercially sound speculation now became an impossible one accordingly attempts are being made to provide a refuge for it in suburban theatres in london and repertory theatres in the provinces but at the moment when the army has at last disgorged the survivors of the gallant band of dramatic pioneers whom it swallowed they find that the economic conditions which formerly made their work no worse than precarious now put it out of the question altogether as far as the west end of london is concerned    church and theatre  i do not suppose many people care particularly we are not brought up to care and a sense of the national importance of the theatre is not born in mankind the natural man like so many of the soldiers at the beginning of the war does not know what a theatre is but please note that all these soldiers who did not know what a theatre was knew what a church was and they had been taught to respect churches nobody had ever warned them against a church as a place where frivolous women paraded in their best clothes where stories of improper females like potiphars wife and erotic poetry like the song of songs were read aloud where the sensuous and sentimental music of schubert mendelssohn gounod and brahms was more popular than severe music by greater composers where the prettiest sort of pretty pictures of pretty saints assailed the imagination and senses through stainedglass windows and where sculpture and architecture came to the help of painting nobody ever reminded them that these things had sometimes produced such developments of erotic idolatry that men who were not only enthusiastic amateurs of literature painting and music but famous practitioners of them had actually exulted when mobs and even regular troops under express command had mutilated church statues smashed church windows wrecked church organs and torn up the sheets from which the church music was read and sung when they saw broken statues in churches they were told that this was the work of wicked godless rioters instead of as it was the work partly of zealots bent on driving the world the flesh and the devil out of the temple and partly of insurgent men who had become intolerably poor because the temple had become a den of thieves but all the sins and perversions that were so carefully hidden from them in the history of the church were laid on the shoulders of the theatre that stuffy uncomfortable place of penance in which we suffer so much inconvenience on the slenderest chance of gaining a scrap of food for our starving souls when the germans bombed the cathedral of rheims the world rang with the horror of the sacrilege when they bombed the little theatre in the adelphi and narrowly missed bombing two writers of plays who lived within a few yards of it the fact was not even mentioned in the papers in point of appeal to the senses no theatre ever built could touch the fane at rheims no actress could rival its virgin in beauty nor any operatic tenor look otherwise than a fool beside its david its picture glass was glorious even to those who had seen the glass of chartres it was wonderful in its very grotesques who would look at the blondin donkey after seeing its leviathans in spite of the adamadelphian decoration on which miss kingston had lavished so much taste and care the little theatre was in comparison with rheims the gloomiest of little conventicles indeed the cathedral must from the puritan point of view have debauched a million voluptuaries for every one whom the little theatre had sent home thoughtful to a chaste bed after mr chestertons magic or brieuxs les avaries perhaps that is the real reason why the church is lauded and the theatre reviled whether or no the fact remains that the lady to whose public spirit and sense of the national value of the theatre i owed the first regular public performance of a play of mine had to conceal her action as if it had been a crime whereas if she had given the money to the church she would have worn a halo for it and i admit as i have always done that this state of things may have been a very sensible one i have asked londoners again and again why they pay half a guinea to go to a theatre when they can go to st pauls or westminster abbey for nothing their only possible reply is that they want to see something new and possibly something wicked but the theatres mostly disappoint both hopes if ever a revolution makes me dictator i shall establish a heavy charge for admission to our churches but everyone who pays at the church door shall receive a ticket entitling him or her to free admission to one performance at any theatre he or she prefers thus shall the sensuous charms of the church service be made to subsidize the sterner virtue of the drama    the next phase  the present situation will not last although the newspaper i read at breakfast this morning before writing these words contains a calculation that no less than twentythree wars are at present being waged to confirm the peace england is no longer in khaki and a violent reaction is setting in against the crude theatrical fare of the four terrible years soon the rents of theatres will once more be fixed on the assumption that they cannot always be full nor even on the average half full week in and week out prices will change the higher drama will be at no greater disadvantage than it was before the war and it may benefit first by the fact that many of us have been torn from the fools paradise in which the theatre formerly traded and thrust upon the sternest realities and necessities until we have lost both faith in and patience with the theatrical pretences that had no root either in reality or necessity second by the startling change made by the war in the distribution of income it seems only the other day that a millionaire was a man with £50000 a year today when he has paid his income tax and super tax and insured his life for the amount of his death duties he is lucky if his net income is 10000 pounds though his nominal property remains the same and this is the result of a budget which is called a respite for the rich at the other end of the scale millions of persons have had regular incomes for the first time in their lives and their men have been regularly clothed fed lodged and taught to make up their minds that certain things have to be done also for the first time in their lives hundreds of thousands of women have been taken out of their domestic cages and tasted both discipline and independence the thoughtless and snobbish middle classes have been pulled up short by the very unpleasant experience of being ruined to an unprecedented extent we have all had a tremendous jolt and although the widespread notion that the shock of the war would automatically make a new heaven and a new earth and that the dog would never go back to his vomit nor the sow to her wallowing in the mire is already seen to be a delusion yet we are far more conscious of our condition than we were and far less disposed to submit to it revolution lately only a sensational chapter in history or a demagogic claptrap is now a possibility so imminent that hardly by trying to suppress it in other countries by arms and defamation and calling the process antibolshevism can our government stave it off at home  perhaps the most tragic figure of the day is the american president who was once a historian in those days it became his task to tell us how after that great war in america which was more clearly than any other war of our time a war for an idea the conquerors confronted with a heroic task of reconstruction turned recreant and spent fifteen years in abusing their victory under cover of pretending to accomplish the task they were doing what they could to make impossible alas hegel was right when he said that we learn from history that men never learn anything from history with what anguish of mind the president sees that we the new conquerors forgetting everything we professed to fight for are sitting down with watering mouths to a good square meal of ten years revenge upon and humiliation of our prostrate foe can only be guessed by those who know as he does how hopeless is remonstrance and how happy lincoln was in perishing from the earth before his inspired messages became scraps of paper he knows well that from the peace conference will come in spite of his utmost no edict on which he will be able like lincoln to invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty god he led his people to destroy the militarism of zabern and the army they rescued is busy in cologne imprisoning every german who does not salute a british officer whilst the government at home asked whether it approves replies that it does not propose even to discontinue this zabernism when the peace is concluded but in effect looks forward to making germans salute british officers until the end of the world that is what war makes of men and women it will wear off and the worst it threatens is already proving impracticable but before the humble and contrite heart ceases to be despised the president and i being of the same age will be dotards in the meantime there is for him another history to write for me another comedy to stage perhaps after all that is what wars are for and what historians and playwrights are for if men will not learn until their lessons are written in blood why blood they must have their own for preference    the ephemeral thrones and the eternal theatre  to the theatre it will not matter whatever bastilles fall the theatre will stand apostolic hapsburg has collapsed all highest hohenzollern languishes in holland threatened with trial on a capital charge of fighting for his country against england imperial romanoff said to have perished miserably by a more summary method of murder is perhaps alive or perhaps dead nobody cares more than if he had been a peasant the lord of hellas is level with his lackeys in republican switzerland prime ministers and commandersinchief have passed from a brief glory as solons and caesars into failure and obscurity as closely on one anothers heels as the descendants of banquo but euripides and aristophanes shakespeare and moliere goethe and ibsen remain fixed in their everlasting seats    how war muzzles the dramatic poet  as for myself why it may be asked did i not write two plays about the war instead of two pamphlets on it the answer is significant you cannot make war on war and on your neighbor at the same time war cannot bear the terrible castigation of comedy the ruthless light of laughter that glares on the stage when men are heroically dying for their country it is not the time to show their lovers and wives and fathers and mothers how they are being sacrificed to the blunders of boobies the cupidity of capitalists the ambition of conquerors the electioneering of demagogues the pharisaism of patriots the lusts and lies and rancors and bloodthirsts that love war because it opens their prison doors and sets them in the thrones of power and popularity for unless these things are mercilessly exposed they will hide under the mantle of the ideals on the stage just as they do in real life  and though there may be better things to reveal it may not and indeed cannot be militarily expedient to reveal them whilst the issue is still in the balance truth telling is not compatible with the defence of the realm we are just now reading the revelations of our generals and admirals unmuzzled at last by the armistice during the war general a in his moving despatches from the field told how general b had covered himself with deathless glory in such and such a battle he now tells us that general b came within an ace of losing us the war by disobeying his orders on that occasion and fighting instead of running away as he ought to have done an excellent subject for comedy now that the war is over no doubt but if general a had let this out at the time what would have been the effect on general bs soldiers and had the stage made known what the prime minister and the secretary of state for war who overruled general a thought of him and what he thought of them as now revealed in raging controversy what would have been the effect on the nation that is why comedy though sorely tempted had to be loyally silent for the art of the dramatic poet knows no patriotism recognizes no obligation but truth to natural history cares not whether germany or england perish is ready to cry with brynhild lassuns verderben lachend zu grunde gehn sooner than deceive or be deceived and thus becomes in time of war a greater military danger than poison steel or trinitrotoluene that is why i had to withhold heartbreak house from the footlights during the war for the germans might on any night have turned the last act from play into earnest and even then might not have waited for their cues  june 1919     heartbreak house     act i  the hilly country in the middle of the north edge of sussex looking very pleasant on a fine evening at the end of september is seen through the windows of a room which has been built so as to resemble the after part of an oldfashioned highpooped ship with a stern gallery for the windows are ship built with heavy timbering and run right across the room as continuously as the stability of the wall allows a row of lockers under the windows provides an unupholstered windowseat interrupted by twin glass doors respectively halfway between the stern post and the sides another door strains the illusion a little by being apparently in the ships port side and yet leading not to the open sea but to the entrance hall of the house between this door and the stern gallery are bookshelves there are electric light switches beside the door leading to the hall and the glass doors in the stern gallery against the starboard wall is a carpenters bench the vice has a board in its jaws and the floor is littered with shavings overflowing from a wastepaper basket a couple of planes and a centrebit are on the bench in the same wall between the bench and the windows is a narrow doorway with a half door above which a glimpse of the room beyond shows that it is a shelved pantry with bottles and kitchen crockery  on the starboard side but close to the middle is a plain oak drawingtable with drawingboard tsquare straightedges set squares mathematical instruments saucers of water color a tumbler of discolored water indian ink pencils and brushes on it the drawingboard is set so that the draughtsmans chair has the window on its left hand on the floor at the end of the table on its right is a ships fire bucket on the port side of the room near the bookshelves is a sofa with its back to the windows it is a sturdy mahogany article oddly upholstered in sailcloth including the bolster with a couple of blankets hanging over the back between the sofa and the drawingtable is a big wicker chair with broad arms and a low sloping back with its back to the light a small but stout table of teak with a round top and gate legs stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase it is the only article in the room that suggests not at all convincingly a womans hand in

emerging from the hollow is the cupola of an observatory between the observatory and the house is a flagstaff on a little esplanade with a hammock on the east side and a long garden seat on the west

of the temple shakespeare in it and her finger stuck in the page she has been reading  a clock strikes six  the young lady turns and looks at her watch she rises with an air of one who waits and is almost at the end of her patience she is a pretty girl slender fair and intelligent looking nicely but not expensively dressed evidently not a smart idler  with a sigh of weary resignation she comes to the draughtsmans chair sits down and begins to read shakespeare presently the book sinks to her lap her eyes close and she dozes into a slumber  an elderly womanservant comes in from the hall with three unopened bottles of rum on a tray she passes through and disappears in the pantry without noticing the young lady she places the bottles on the shelf and fills her tray with empty bottles as she returns with these the young lady lets her book drop awakening herself and startling the womanservant so that she all but lets the tray fall  the womanservant god bless us the young lady picks up the book and places it on the table sorry to wake you miss im sure but you are a stranger to me what might you be waiting here for now  the young lady waiting for somebody to show some signs of knowing

utterword who bursts in much flustered lady utterword a blonde is very handsome very well dressed and so precipitate in speech and action that the first impression erroneous is one of comic silliness  lady utterword oh is that you nurse how are you you dont look a day older is nobody at home where is hesione doesnt she expect me where are the servants whose luggage is that on the steps wheres papa

placidly no lovey she goes out with the teatray  lady utterword sitting down with a flounce on the sofa i know what you must feel oh this house this house i come back to it after twentythree years and it is just the same the luggage lying on the steps the servants spoilt and impossible nobody at home to receive anybody no regular meals nobody ever hungry because they are always gnawing bread and butter or munching apples and what is worse the same disorder in ideas in talk in feeling when i was a child i was used to it i had never known anything better though i was unhappy and longed all the timeoh how i longedto be respectable to be a lady to live as others did not to have to think of everything for myself i married at nineteen to escape from it my husband is sir hastings utterword who

father my sister my nephews and nieces one ought to you know and i was looking forward to it and now the state of the house the way im received the casual impudence of that woman guinness our old nurse really hesione might at least have been here some preparation might have been made for me you must excuse my going on in this way but i am really very much hurt and annoyed and disillusioned and if i had realized it was to be like this i wouldnt have come i have a great mind to go away without another word she is on the point of weeping  ellie also very miserable nobody has been here to receive me either i thought i ought to go away too but how can i lady utterword my luggage is on the steps and the station fly has gone  the captain emerges from the pantry with a tray of chinese lacquer and a very fine teaset on it he rests it provisionally on the end of the table snatches away the drawingboard which he stands on the floor against table legs and puts the tray in the space thus cleared ellie pours out a cup greedily  the captain your tea young lady what another lady i must fetch another cup he makes for the pantry  lady utterword rising from the sofa suffused with emotion papa dont you know me im your daughter  the captain nonsense my daughters upstairs asleep he vanishes through the half door  lady utterword retires to the window to conceal her tears  ellie going to her with the cup dont be so distressed have this cup of tea he is very old and very strange he has been just like that to me i know how dreadful it must be my own father is all the world to me oh im sure he didnt mean it  the captain returns with another cup  the captain now we are complete he places it on the tray  lady utterword hysterically papa you cant have forgotten me i am ariadne im little paddy patkins wont you kiss me she goes to him and throws her arms round his neck  the captain woodenly enduring her embrace how can you be ariadne you are a middleaged woman well preserved madam but no longer young  lady utterword but think of all the years and years i have been away papa i have had to grow old like other people  the captain disengaging himself you should grow out of kissing strange men they may be striving to attain the seventh degree of concentration  lady utterword but im your daughter you havent seen me for years  the captain so much the worse when our relatives are at home we have to think of all their good points or it would be impossible to endure them but when they are away we console ourselves for their absence by dwelling on their vices that is how i have come to think my absent daughter ariadne a perfect fiend so do not try to ingratiate yourself here by impersonating her he walks firmly away to the other side of the room  lady utterword ingratiating myself indeed with dignity very well papa she sits down at the drawingtable and pours out tea for herself  the captain i am neglecting my social duties you remember dunn billy dunn  lady utterword do you mean that villainous sailor who robbed you  the captain introducing ellie his daughter he sits down on the sofa  ellie protesting no  nurse guinness returns with fresh tea  the captain take that hogwash away do you hear  nurse youve actually remembered about the tea to ellie oh miss he didnt forget you after all you have made an impression  the captain gloomily youth beauty novelty they are badly wanted in this house i am excessively old hesione is only moderately young her children are not youthful  lady utterword how can children be expected to be youthful in this house almost before we could speak we were filled with notions that might have been all very well for pagan philosophers of fifty but were certainly quite unfit for respectable people of any age  nurse you were always for respectability miss addy  lady utterword nurse will you please remember that i am lady utterword and not miss addy nor lovey nor darling nor doty do you hear  nurse yes ducky all right ill tell them all they must call you my lady she takes her tray out with undisturbed placidity  lady utterword what comfort what sense is there in having servants with no manners  ellie rising and coming to the table to put down her empty cup lady utterword do you think mrs hushabye really expects me  lady utterword oh dont ask me you can see for yourself that ive just arrived her only sister after twentythree years absence and it seems that i am not expected  the captain what does it matter whether the young lady is expected or not she is welcome there are beds there is food ill find a room for her myself he makes for the door  ellie following him to stop him oh pleasehe goes out lady utterword i dont know what to do your father persists in believing that my father is some sailor who robbed him  lady utterword you had better pretend not to notice it my father is a very clever man but he always forgot things and now that he is old of course he is worse and i must warn you that it is sometimes very hard to feel quite sure that he really forgets  mrs hushabye bursts into the room tempestuously and embraces ellie she is a couple of years older than lady utterword and even better looking she has magnificent black hair eyes like the fishpools of heshbon and a nobly modelled neck short at the back and low between her shoulders in front unlike her sister she is uncorseted and dressed anyhow in a rich robe of black pile that shows off her white skin and statuesque contour  mrs hushabye ellie my darling my pettikins kissing her how long have you been here ive been at home all the time i was putting flowers and things in your room and when i just sat down for a moment to try how comfortable the armchair was i went off to sleep papa woke me and told me you were here fancy your finding no one and being neglected and abandoned kissing her again my poor love she deposits ellie on the sofa meanwhile ariadne has left the table and come over to claim her share of attention oh youve brought someone with you introduce me  lady utterword hesione is it possible that you dont know me  mrs hushabye conventionally of course i remember your face quite well where have we met  lady utterword didnt papa tell you i was here oh this is really too much she throws herself sulkily into the big chair  mrs hushabye papa  lady utterword yes papa our papa you unfeeling wretch rising angrily ill go straight to a hotel  mrs hushabye seizing her by the shoulders my goodness gracious goodness you dont mean to say that youre addy  lady utterword i certainly am addy and i dont think i can be so changed that you would not have recognized me if you had any real affection for me and papa didnt think me even worth mentioning  mrs hushabye what a lark sit down she pushes her back into the chair instead of kissing her and posts herself behind it you do look a swell youre much handsomer than you used to be youve made the acquaintance of ellie of course she is going to marry a perfect hog of a millionaire for the sake of her father who is as poor as a church mouse and you must help me to stop her  ellie oh please hesione  mrs hushabye my pettikins the mans coming here today with your father to begin persecuting you and everybody will see the state of the case in ten minutes so whats the use of making a secret of it  ellie he is not a hog hesione you dont know how wonderfully good he was to my father and how deeply grateful i am to him  mrs hushabye to lady utterword her father is a very remarkable man addy his name is mazzini dunn mazzini was a celebrity of some kind who knew ellies grandparents they were both poets like the brownings and when her father came into the world mazzini said another soldier born for freedom so they christened him mazzini and he has been fighting for freedom in his quiet way ever since thats why he is so poor  ellie i am proud of his poverty  mrs hushabye of course you are pettikins why not leave him in it and marry someone you love  lady utterword rising suddenly and explosively hesione are you going to kiss me or are you not  mrs hushabye what do you want to be kissed for  lady utterword i dont want to be kissed but i do want you to behave properly and decently we are sisters we have been separated for twentythree years you ought to kiss me  mrs hushabye tomorrow morning dear before you make up i hate the smell of powder  lady utterword oh you unfeelingshe is interrupted by the return of the captain  the captain to ellie your room is ready ellie rises the sheets were damp but i have changed them he makes for the garden door on the port side  lady utterword oh what about my sheets  the captain halting at the door take my advice air them or take them off and sleep in blankets you shall sleep in ariadnes old room  lady utterword indeed i shall do nothing of the sort that little hole i am entitled to the best spare room  the captain continuing unmoved she married a numskull she told me she would marry anyone to get away from home  ladt utterword you are pretending not to know me on purpose i will leave the house  mazzini dunn enters from the hall he is a little elderly man with bulging credulous eyes and earnest manners he is dressed in a blue serge jacket suit with an unbuttoned mackintosh over it and carries a soft black hat of clerical cut  ellie at last captain shotover here is my father  the captain this nonsense not a bit like him he goes away through the garden shutting the door sharply behind him  lady utterword i will not be ignored and pretended to be somebody else i will have it out with papa now this instant to mazzini excuse me she follows the captain out making a hasty bow to mazzini who returns it  mrs hushabye hospitably shaking hands how good of you to come mr dunn you dont mind papa do you he is as mad as a hatter you know but quite harmless and extremely clever you will have some delightful talks with him  mazzini i hope so to ellie so here you are ellie dear he draws her arm affectionately through his i must thank you mrs hushabye for your kindness to my daughter im afraid she would have had no holiday if you had not invited her  mrs hushabye not at all very nice of her to come and attract young people to the house for us  mazzini smiling im afraid ellie is not interested in young men mrs hushabye her taste is on the graver solider side  mrs hushabye with a sudden rather hard brightness in her manner wont you take off your overcoat mr dunn you will find a cupboard for coats and hats and things in the corner of the hall  mazzini hastily releasing ellie yesthank youi had better he goes out  mrs hushabye emphatically the old brute  ellie who  mrs hushabye who him he it pointing after mazzini graver solider tastes indeed  ellie aghast you dont mean that you were speaking like that of my father  mrs hushabye i was you know i was  ellie with dignity i will leave your house at once she turns to the door  mrs hushabye if you attempt it ill tell your father why  ellie turning again oh how can you treat a visitor like this mrs hushabye  mrs hushabye i thought you were going to call me hesione  ellie certainly not now  mrs hushabye very well ill tell your father  ellie distressed oh  mrs hushabye if you turn a hairif you take his part against me and against your own heart for a moment ill give that born soldier of freedom a piece of my mind that will stand him on his selfish old head for a week  ellie hesione my father selfish how little you know  she is interrupted by mazzini who returns excited and perspiring  mazzini ellie mangan has come i thought youd like to know excuse me mrs hushabye the strange old gentleman  mrs hushabye papa quite so  mazzini oh i beg your pardon of course i was a little confused by his manner he is making mangan help him with something in the garden and he wants me too  a powerful whistle is heard  the captains voice bosun ahoy the whistle is repeated  mazzini flustered oh dear i believe he is whistling for me he hurries out  mrs hushabye now my father is a wonderful man if you like  ellie hesione listen to me you dont understand my father and mr mangan were boys together mr ma  mrs hushabye i dont care what they were we must sit down if you are going to begin as far back as that she snatches at ellies waist and makes her sit down on the sofa beside her now pettikins tell me all about mr mangan they call him boss mangan dont they he is a napoleon of industry and disgustingly rich isnt he why isnt your father rich  ellie my poor father should never have been in business his parents were poets and they gave him the noblest ideas but they could not afford to give him a profession  mrs hushabye fancy your grandparents with their eyes in fine frenzy rolling and so your poor father had to go into business hasnt he succeeded in it  ellie he always used to say he could succeed if he only had some capital he fought his way along to keep a roof over our heads and bring us up well but it was always a struggle always the same difficulty of not having capital enough i dont know how to describe it to you  mrs hushabye poor ellie i know pulling the devil by the tail  ellie hurt oh no not like that it was at least dignified  mrs hushabye that made it all the harder didnt it i shouldnt have pulled the devil by the tail with dignity i should have pulled hardbetween her teeth hard well go on  ellie at last it seemed that all our troubles were at an end mr mangan did an extraordinarily noble thing out of pure friendship for my father and respect for his character he asked him how much capital he wanted and gave it to him i dont mean that he lent it to him or that he invested it in his business he just simply made him a present of it wasnt that splendid of him  mrs hushabye on condition that you married him  ellie oh no no no this was when i was a child he had never even seen me he never came to our house it was absolutely disinterested pure generosity  mrs hushabye oh i beg the gentlemans pardon well what became of the money  ellie we all got new clothes and moved into another house and i went to another school for two years  mrs hushabye only two years  ellie that was all for at the end of two years my father was utterly ruined  mrs hushabye how  ellie i dont know i never could understand but it was dreadful when we were poor my father had never been in debt but when he launched out into business on a large scale he had to incur liabilities when the business went into liquidation he owed more money than mr mangan had given him  mrs hushabye bit off more than he could chew i suppose  ellie i think you are a little unfeeling about it  mrs hushabye my pettikins you mustnt mind my way of talking i was quite as sensitive and particular as you once but i have picked up so much slang from the children that i am really hardly presentable i suppose your father had no head for business and made a mess of it  ellie oh that just shows how entirely you are mistaken about him the business turned out a great success it now pays fortyfour per cent after deducting the excess profits tax  mrs hushabye then why arent you rolling in money  ellie i dont know it seems very unfair to me you see my father was made bankrupt it nearly broke his heart because he had persuaded several of his friends to put money into the business he was sure it would succeed and events proved that he was quite right but they all lost their money it was dreadful i dont know what we should have done but for mr mangan  mrs hushabye what did the boss come to the rescue again after all his money being thrown away  ellie he did indeed and never uttered a reproach to my father he bought what was left of the businessthe buildings and the machinery and thingsfrom the official trustee for enough money to enable my father to pay sixandeightpence in the pound and get his discharge everyone pitied papa so much and saw so plainly that he was an honorable man that they let him off at sixandeightpence instead of ten shillings then mr mangan started a company to take up the business and made my father a manager in it to save us from starvation for i wasnt earning anything then  mrs hushabye quite a romance and when did the boss develop the tender passion  ellie oh that was years after quite lately he took the chair one night at a sort of peoples concert i was singing there as an amateur you know half a guinea for expenses and three songs with three encores he was so pleased with my singing that he asked might he walk home with me i never saw anyone so taken aback as he was when i took him home and introduced him to my father his own manager it was then that my father told me how nobly he had behaved of course it was considered a great chance for me as he is so rich andandwe drifted into a sort of understandingi suppose i should call it an engagementshe is distressed and cannot go on  mrs hushabye rising and marching about you may have drifted into it but you will bounce out of it my pettikins if i am to have anything to do with it  ellie hopelessly no its no use i am bound in honor and gratitude i will go through with it  mrs hushabye behind the sofa scolding down at her you know of course that its not honorable or grateful to marry a man you dont love do you love this mangan man  ellie yes at least  mrs hushabye i dont want to know about at least i want to know the worst girls of your age fall in love with all sorts of impossible people especially old people  ellie i like mr mangan very much and i shall always be  mrs hushabye impatiently completing the sentence and prancing away intolerantly to starboard grateful to him for his kindness to dear father i know anybody else  ellie what do you mean  mrs hushabye anybody else are you in love with anybody else  ellie of course not  mrs hushabye humph the book on the drawingtable catches her eye she picks it up and evidently finds the title very unexpected she looks at ellie and asks quaintly quite sure youre not in love with an actor  ellie no no why what put such a thing into your head  mrs hushabye this is yours isnt it why else should you be reading othello  ellie my father taught me to love shakespeare  mrs hushaye flinging the book down on the table really your father does seem to be about the limit  ellie naively do you never read shakespeare hesione that seems to me so extraordinary i like othello  mrs hushabye do you indeed he was jealous wasnt he  ellie oh not that i think all the part about jealousy is horrible but dont you think it must have been a wonderful experience for desdemona brought up so quietly at home to meet a man who had been out in the world doing all sorts of brave things and having terrible adventures and yet finding something in her that made him love to sit and talk with her and tell her about them  mrs hushabye thats your idea of romance is it  ellie not romance exactly it might really happen  ellies eyes show that she is not arguing but in a daydream mrs hushabye watching her inquisitively goes deliberately back to the sofa and resumes her seat beside her  mrs hushabye ellie darling have you noticed that some of those stories that othello told desdemona couldnt have happened  ellie oh no shakespeare thought they could have happened  mrs hushabye hm desdemona thought they could have happened but they didnt  ellie why do you look so enigmatic about it you are such a sphinx i never know what you mean  mrs hushabye desdemona would have found him out if she had lived you know i wonder was that why he strangled her  ellie othello was not telling lies  mrs hushabye how do you know  ellie shakespeare would have said if he was hesione there are men who have done wonderful things men like othello only of course white and very handsome and  mrs hushabye ah now were coming to it tell me all about him i knew there must be somebody or youd never have been so miserable about mangan youd have thought it quite a lark to marry him  ellie blushing vividly hesione you are dreadful but i dont want to make a secret of it though of course i dont tell everybody besides i dont know him  mrs hushabye dont know him what does that mean  ellie well of course i know him to speak to  mrs hushabye but you want to know him ever so much more intimately eh  ellie no no i know him quitealmost intimately  mrs hushabye you dont know him and you know him almost intimately how lucid  ellie i mean that he does not call on us ii got into conversation with him by chance at a concert  mrs hushabye you seem to have rather a gay time at your concerts ellie  ellie not at all we talk to everyone in the greenroom waiting for our turns i thought he was one of the artists he looked so splendid but he was only one of the committee i happened to tell him that i was copying a picture at the national gallery i make a little money that way i cant paint much but as its always the same picture i can do it pretty quickly and get two or three pounds for it it happened that he came to the national gallery one day  mrs hushabye one students day paid sixpence to stumble about through a crowd of easels when he might have come in next day for nothing and found the floor clear quite by accident  ellie triumphantly no on purpose he liked talking to me he knows lots of the most splendid people fashionable women who are all in love with him but he ran away from them to see me at the national gallery and persuade me to come with him for a drive round richmond park in a taxi  mrs hushabye my pettikins you have been going it its wonderful what you good girls can do without anyone saying a word  ellie i am not in society hesione if i didnt make acquaintances in that way i shouldnt have any at all  mrs hushabye well no harm if you know how to take care of yourself may i ask his name  ellie slowly and musically marcus darnley  mrs hushabye echoing the music marcus darnley what a splendid name  ellie oh im so glad you think so i think so too but i was afraid it was only a silly fancy of my own  mrs hushabye hm is he one of the aberdeen darnleys  ellie nobody knows just fancy he was found in an antique chest  mrs hushabye a what  ellie an antique chest one summer morning in a rose garden after a night of the most terrible thunderstorm  mrs hushabye what on earth was he doing in the chest did he get into it because he was afraid of the lightning  ellie oh no no he was a baby the name marcus darnley was embroidered on his baby clothes and five hundred pounds in gold  mrs hushabye looking hard at her ellie  ellie the garden of the viscount  mrs hushabye de rougemont  ellie innocently no de larochejaquelin a french family a vicomte his life has been one long romance a tiger  mrs hushabye slain by his own hand  ellie oh no nothing vulgar like that he saved the life of the tiger from a hunting party one of king edwards hunting parties in india the king was furious that was why he never had his military services properly recognized but he doesnt care he is a socialist and despises rank and has been in three revolutions fighting on the barricades  mrs hushabye how can you sit there telling me such lies you ellie of all people and i thought you were a perfectly simple straightforward good girl  ellie rising dignified but very angry do you mean you dont believe me  mrs hushabye of course i dont believe you youre inventing every word of it do you take me for a fool  ellie stares at her her candor is so obvious that mrs hushabye is puzzled  ellie goodbye hesione im very sorry i see now that it sounds very improbable as i tell it but i cant stay if you think that way about me  mrs hushabye catching her dress you shant go i couldnt be so mistaken i know too well what liars are like somebody has really told you all this  ellie flushing hesione dont say that you dont believe him i couldnt bear that  mrs hushabye soothing her of course i believe him dearest but you should have broken it to me by degrees drawing her back to her seat now tell me all about him are you in love with him  ellie oh no im not so foolish i dont fall in love with people im not so silly as you think  mrs hushabye i see only something to think aboutto give some interest and pleasure to life  ellie just so thats all really  mrs hushabye it makes the hours go fast doesnt it no tedious waiting to go to sleep at nights and wondering whether you will have a bad night how delightful it makes waking up in the morning how much better than the happiest dream all life transfigured no more wishing one had an interesting book to read because life is so much happier than any book no desire but to be alone and not to have to talk to anyone to be alone and just think about it  ellie embracing her hesione you are a witch how do you know oh you are the most sympathetic woman in the world  mrs hushabye caressing her pettikins my pettikins how i envy you and how i pity you  ellie pity me oh why  a very handsome man of fifty with mousquetaire moustaches wearing a rather dandified curly brimmed hat and carrying an elaborate walkingstick comes into the room from the hall and stops short at sight of the women on the sofa  ellie seeing him and rising in glad surprise oh hesione this is mr marcus darnley  mrs hushabye rising what a lark he is my husband  ellie but nowshe stops suddenly then turns pale and sways  mrs hushabye catching her and sitting down with her on the sofa steady my pettikins  the man with a mixture of confusion and effrontery depositing his hat and stick on the teak table my real name miss dunn is hector hushabye i leave you to judge whether that is a name any sensitive man would care to confess to i never use it when i can possibly help it i have been away for nearly a month and i had no idea you knew my wife or that you were coming here i am none the less delighted to find you in our little house  ellie in great distress i dont know what to do please may i speak to papa do leave me i cant bear it  mrs hushabye be off hector  hector i  mrs hushabye quick quick get out  hector if you think it betterhe goes out taking his hat with him but leaving the stick on the table  mrs hushabye laying ellie down at the end of the sofa now pettikins he is gone theres nobody but me you can let yourself go dont try to control yourself have a good cry  ellie raising her head damn  mrs hushabye splendid oh what a relief i thought you were going to be brokenhearted never mind me damn him again  ellie i am not damning him i am damning myself for being such a fool rising how could i let myself be taken in so she begins prowling to and fro her bloom gone looking curiously older and harder  mrs hushabye cheerfully why not pettikins very few young women can resist hector i couldnt when i was your age he is really rather splendid you know  ellie turning on her splendid yes splendid looking of course but how can you love a liar  mrs hushabye i dont know but you can fortunately otherwise there wouldnt be much love in the world  ellie but to lie like that to be a boaster a coward  mrs hushabye rising in alarm pettikins none of that if you please if you hint the slightest doubt of hectors courage he will go straight off and do the most horribly dangerous things to convince himself that he isnt a coward he has a dreadful trick of getting out of one thirdfloor window and coming in at another just to test his nerve he has a whole drawerful of albert medals for saving peoples lives  ellie he never told me that  mrs hushabye he never boasts of anything he really did he cant bear it and it makes him shy if anyone else does all his stories are madeup stories  ellie coming to her do you mean that he is really brave and really has adventures and yet tells lies about things that he never did and that never happened  mrs hushabye yes pettikins i do people dont have their virtues and vices in sets they have them anyhow all mixed  ellie staring at her thoughtfully theres something odd about this house hesione and even about you i dont know why im talking to you so calmly i have a horrible fear that my heart is broken but that heartbreak is not like what i thought it must be  mrs hushabye fondling her its only life educating you pettikins how do you feel about boss mangan now  ellie disengaging herself with an expression of distaste oh how can you remind me of him hesione  mrs hushabye sorry dear i think i hear hector coming back you dont mind now do you dear  ellie not in the least i am quite cured  mazzini dunn and hector come in from the hall  hector as he opens the door and allows mazzini to pass in one second more and she would have been a dead woman  mazzini dear dear what an escape ellie my

father  ellie turning at bay with her back to the carpenters bench scornfully selfpossessed it was not thrown away he believes it i should not have believed it  mazzini benevolently ellie is very naughty mr hushabye of course she does not really think that he goes to the bookshelves and inspects the titles of the volumes  boss mangan comes in from the hall followed by the captain mangan carefully frockcoated as for church or for a dihectors meeting is about fiftyfive with a careworn mistrustful expression standing a little on an entirely imaginary dignity with a dull complexion straight lustreless hair and features so entirely commonplace that it is impossible to describe them  captain shotover to mrs hushabye introducing the newcomer says his name is mangan not ablebodied  mrs hushabye graciously how do you do mr mangan  mangan shaking hands very pleased  captain shotover dunns lost his muscle but recovered his nerve men seldom do after three attacks of delirium tremens he goes into the pantry  mrs hushabye i congratulate you mr dunn  mazzini dazed i am a lifelong teetotaler  mrs hushabye you will find it far less trouble to let papa have his own way than try to explain  mazzini but three attacks of delirium tremens really  mrs hushabye to mangan do you know my husband mr mangan she indicates hector  mangan going to hector who meets him with outstretched hand

that i didnt bring it off thats the sort of man i am and there will be a better understanding between us when you make up your mind to that captain  captain shotover you frequent picture palaces  mangan perhaps i do who told you  captain shotover talk like a man not like a movie you mean that you make a hundred thousand a year  mangan i dont boast but when i meet a man that makes a hundred thousand a year i take off my hat to that man and stretch out my hand to him and call him brother  captain shotover then you also make a hundred thousand a year hey  mangan no i cant say that fifty thousand perhaps  captain shotover his half brother only he turns away from mangan with his usual abruptness and collects the empty teacups on the chinese tray  mangan irritated see here captain

off take my advice marry a west indian negress they make excellent wives i was married to one myself for two years  mangan well i am damned  captain shotover i thought so i was too for many years the negress redeemed me  mangan feebly this is queer i ought to walk out of this house  captain shotover why  mangan well many men would be offended by your style of talking  captain shotover nonsense its the other sort of talking that makes quarrels nobody ever quarrels with me  a gentleman whose firstrate tailoring and frictionless manners proclaim the wellbred west ender comes in from the hall he has an engaging air of being young and unmarried but on close inspection is found to be at least over forty  the gentleman excuse my intruding in this fashion but there is no knocker on the door and the bell does not seem to ring  captain shotover why should there be a knocker why should the bell ring the door is open  the gentleman precisely so i ventured to come in  captain shotover quite right

the pantry and addressing ellie your father has washed himself  ellie quite selfpossessed he often does captain shotover  captain shotover a strange conversion i saw him through the pantry window  mazzini dunn enters through the port window door newly washed and brushed and stops smiling benevolently between mangan and mrs hushabye  mrs hushabye introducing mr mazzini dunn lady utoh i forgot

a thief a pirate and a murderer  mazzini i assure you you are mistaken  captain shotover an adventurous life but what does it end in respectability a ladylike daughter the language and appearance of a city missionary let it be a warning to all of you he goes out through the garden  dunn i hope nobody here believes that i am a thief a pirate or a murderer mrs hushabye will you excuse me a moment i must really go and explain he follows the captain  mrs hushabye as he goes its no use youd really better but dunn has vanished we had better all go out and look for some tea we never have regular tea but you can always get some when you want the servants keep it stewing all day the kitchen veranda is the best place to ask may i show you she goes to the starboard door  randall going with her thank you i dont think ill take any tea this afternoon but if you will show me the garden  mrs hushabye theres nothing to see in the garden except papas observatory and a gravel pit with a cave where he keeps dynamite and things of that sort however its pleasanter out of doors so come along  randall dynamite isnt that rather risky  mrs hushabye well we dont sit in the gravel pit when theres a thunderstorm  lady utterorrd thats something new what is the dynamite for  hector to blow up the human race if it goes too far he is trying to discover a psychic ray that will explode all the explosive at the well of a mahatma  ellie the captains tea is delicious mr utterword  mrs hushabye stopping in the doorway do you mean to say that youve had some of my fathers tea that you got round him before you were ten minutes in the house  ellie i did  mrs hushabye you little devil she goes out with randall  mangan wont you come miss ellie  ellie im too tired ill take a book up to my room

utterword they look at ellie waiting for her to go  ellie looking at the title of a book do you like stories of adventure lady utterword  lady utterword patronizingly of course dear  ellie then ill leave you to mr hushabye she goes out through the hall  hector that girl is mad about tales of adventure the lies i have to tell her  lady utterword not interested in ellie when you saw me what did you mean by saying that you thought and then stopping short what did you think  hector folding his arms and looking down at her magnetically may i tell you  lady utterword of course  hector it will not sound very civil i was on the point of saying i thought you were a plain woman  lady utterword oh for shame hector what right had you to notice whether i am plain or not  hector listen to me ariadne until today i have seen only photographs of you and no photograph can give the strange fascination of the daughters of that supernatural old man there is some damnable quality in them that destroys mens moral sense and carries them beyond honor and dishonor you know that dont you  lady utterword perhaps i do hector but let me warn you once for all that i am a rigidly conventional woman you may think because im a shotover that im a bohemian because we are all so horribly bohemian but im not i hate and loathe bohemianism no child brought up in a strict puritan household ever suffered from puritanism as i suffered from our bohemianism  hector our children are like that they spend their holidays in the houses of their respectable schoolfellows  lady utterword i shall invite them for christmas  hector their absence leaves us both without our natural chaperones  lady utterword children are certainly very inconvenient sometimes but intelligent people can always manage unless they are bohemians  hector you are no bohemian but you are no puritan either your attraction is alive and powerful what sort of woman do you count yourself  lady utterword i am a woman of the world hector and i can assure you that if you will only take the trouble always to do the perfectly correct thing and to say the perfectly correct thing you can do just what you like an illconducted careless woman gets simply no chance an illconducted careless man is never allowed within arms length of any woman worth knowing  hector i see you are neither a bohemian woman nor a puritan woman you are a dangerous woman  lady utterword on the contrary i am a safe woman  hector you are a most accursedly attractive woman mind i am not making love to you i do not like being attracted but you had better know how i feel if you are going to stay here  lady utterword you are an exceedingly clever ladykiller hector and terribly handsome i am quite a good player myself at that game is it quite understood that we are only playing  hector quite i am deliberately playing the fool out of sheer worthlessness  lady utterword rising brightly well you are my brotherinlaw hesione asked you to kiss me he seizes her in his arms and kisses her strenuously oh that was a little more than play brotherinlaw she pushes him suddenly away you shall not do that again  hector in effect you got your claws deeper into me than i intended  mrs hubhabye coming in from the garden dont let me disturb you i only want a cap to put on daddiest the sun is setting and hell catch cold she makes for the door leading to the hall  lady utterword your husband is quite charming darling he has actually condescended to kiss me at last i shall go into the garden its cooler now she goes out by the port door  mrs hushabye take care dear child i dont believe any man can kiss addy without falling in love with her she goes into the hall  hector striking himself on the chest fool goat  mrs hushabye comes back with the captains cap  hector your sister is an extremely enterprising old girl wheres miss dunn  mrs hushabye mangan says she has gone up to her room for a nap addy wont let you talk to ellie she has marked you for her own  hector she has the diabolical family fascination i began making love to her automatically what am i to do i cant fall in love and i cant hurt a womans feelings by telling her so when she falls in love with me and as women are always falling in love with my moustache i get landed in all sorts of tedious and terrifying flirtations in which im not a bit in earnest  mrs hushabye oh neither is addy she has never been in love in her life though she has always been trying to fall in head over ears she is worse than you because you had one real go at least with me  hector that was a confounded madness i cant believe that such an amazing experience is common it has left its mark on me i believe that is why i have never been able to repeat it  mrs hushabye laughing and caressing his arm we were frightfully in love with one another hector it was such an enchanting dream that i have never been able to grudge it to you or anyone else since i have invited all sorts of pretty women to the house on the chance of giving you another turn but it has never come off  hector i dont know that i want it to come off it was damned dangerous you fascinated me but i loved you so it was heaven this sister of yours fascinates me but i hate her so it is hell i shall kill her if she persists  mrs hushabye nothing will kill addy she is as strong as a horse releasing him now i am going off to fascinate somebody  hector the foreign office toff randall  mrs hushabye goodness gracious no why should i fascinate him  hector i presume you dont mean the bloated capitalist mangan  mrs hushabye hm i think he had better be fascinated by me than by ellie she is going into the garden when the captain comes in from it with some sticks in his hand what have you got there daddiest  captain shotover dynamite  mrs hushabye youve been to the gravel pit dont drop it about the house theres a dear she goes into the garden where the evening light is now very red  hector listen o sage how long dare you concentrate on a feeling without risking having it fixed in your consciousness all the rest of your life  captain shotover ninety minutes an hour and a half he goes into the pantry  hector left alone contracts his brows and falls into a daydream he does not move for some time then he folds his arms then throwing his hands behind him and gripping one with the other he strides tragically once to and fro suddenly he snatches his walking stick from the teak table and draws it for it is a swordstick he fights a desperate duel with an imaginary antagonist and after many vicissitudes runs him through the body up to the hilt he sheathes his sword and throws it on the sofa falling into another reverie as he does so he looks straight into the eyes of an imaginary woman seizes her by the arms and says in a deep and thrilling tone do you love me the captain comes out of the pantry at this moment and hector caught with his arms stretched out and his fists clenched has to account for his attitude by going through a series of gymnastic exercises  captain shotover that sort of strength is no good you will never be as strong as a gorilla  hector what is the dynamite for  captain shotover to kill fellows like mangan  hector no use they will always be able to buy more dynamite than you  captain shotover i will make a dynamite that he cannot explode  hector and that you can eh  captain shotover yes when i have attained the seventh degree of concentration  hector whats the use of that you never do attain it  captain shotover what then is to be done are we to be kept forever in the mud by these hogs to whom the universe is nothing but a machine for greasing their bristles and filling their snouts  hector are mangans bristles worse than randalls lovelocks  captain shotover we must win powers of life and death over them both i refuse to die until i have invented the means  hector who are we that we should judge them  captain shotover what are they that they should judge us yet they do unhesitatingly there is enmity between our seed and their seed they know it and act on it strangling our souls they believe in themselves when we believe in ourselves we shall kill them  hector it is the same seed you forget that your pirate has a very nice daughter mangans son may be a plato randalls a shelley what was my father  captain shotover the damnedst scoundrel i ever met he replaces the drawingboard sits down at the table and begins to mix a wash of color  hector precisely well dare you kill his innocent grandchildren  captain shotover they are mine also  hector just sowe are members one of another he throws himself carelessly on the sofa i tell you i have often thought of this killing of human vermin many men have thought of it decent men are like daniel in the lions den their survival is a miracle and they do not always survive we live among the mangans and randalls and billie dunns as they poor devils live among the disease germs and the doctors and the lawyers and the parsons and the restaurant chefs and the tradesmen and the servants and all the rest of the parasites and blackmailers what are our terrors to theirs give me the power to kill them and ill spare them in sheer  captain shotover cutting in sharply fellow feeling  hector no i should kill myself if i believed that i must believe that my spark small as it is is divine and that the red light over their door is hell fire i should spare them in simple magnanimous pity  captain shotover you cant spare them until you have the power to kill them at present they have the power to kill you there are millions of blacks over the water for them to train and let loose on us theyre going to do it theyre doing it already  hector they are too stupid to use their power  captain shotover throwing down his brush and coming to the end of the sofa do not deceive yourself they do use it we kill the better half of ourselves every day to propitiate them the knowledge that these people are there to render all our aspirations barren prevents us having the aspirations and when we are tempted to seek their destruction they bring forth demons to delude us disguised as pretty daughters and singers and poets and the like for whose sake we spare them  hector sitting up and leaning towards him may not hesione be such a demon brought forth by you lest i should slay you  captain shotover that is possible she has used you up and left you nothing but dreams as some women do  hector vampire women demon women  captain shotover men think the world well lost for them and lose it accordingly who are the men that do things the husbands of the shrew and of the drunkard the men with the thorn in the flesh walking distractedly away towards the pantry i must think these things out turning suddenly but i go on with the dynamite none the less i will discover a ray mightier than any xray a mind ray that will explode the ammunition in the belt of my adversary before he can point his gun at me and i must hurry i am old i have no time to waste in talk he is about to go into the pantry and hector is making for the hall when hesione comes back  mrs hushabye daddiest you and hector must come and help me to entertain all these people what on earth were you shouting about  hector stopping in the act of turning the door handle he is madder than usual  mrs hushabye we all are  hector i must change he resumes his door opening  mrs hushabye stop stop come back both of you come back they return reluctantly money is running short  hector money where are my april dividends  mrs hushabye where is the snow that fell last year  captain shotover where is all the money you had for that patent lifeboat i invented  mrs hushabye five hundred pounds and i have made it last since easter  captain shotover since easter barely four months monstrous extravagance i could live for seven years on 500 pounds  mrs hushabye not keeping open house as we do here daddiest  captain shotover only 500 pounds for that lifeboat i got twelve thousand for the invention before that  mrs hushabye yes dear but that was for the ship with the magnetic keel that sucked up submarines living at the rate we do you cannot afford lifesaving inventions cant you think of something that will murder half europe at one bang  captain shotover no i am ageing fast my mind does not dwell on slaughter as it did when i was a boy why doesnt your husband invent something he does nothing but tell lies to women  hector well that is a form of invention is it not however you are right i ought to support my wife  mrs hushabye indeed you shall do nothing of the sort i should never see you from breakfast to dinner i want my husband  hector bitterly i might as well be your lapdog  mrs hushabye do you want to be my breadwinner like the other poor husbands  hector no by thunder what a damned creature a husband is anyhow  mrs hushabye to the captain what about that harpoon cannon  captain shotover no use it kills whales not men  mrs hushabye why not you fire the harpoon out of a cannon it sticks in the enemys general you wind him in and there you are  hector you are your fathers daughter hesione  captain shotover there is something in it not to wind in generals they are not dangerous but one could fire a grapnel and wind in a machine gun or even a tank i will think it out  mrs hushabye squeezing the captains arm affectionately saved you are a darling daddiest now we must go back to these dreadful people and entertain them  captain shotover they have had no dinner dont forget that  hector neither have i and it is dark it must be all hours  mrs hushabye oh guinness will produce some sort of dinner for them the servants always take jolly good care that there is food in the house  captain shotover raising a strange wail in the darkness what a house what a daughter  mrs hushabye raving what a father  hector following suit what a husband  captain shotover is there no thunder in heaven  hector is there no beauty no bravery on earth  mrs hushabye what do men want they have their food their firesides their clothes mended and our love at the end of the day why are they not satisfied why do they envy us the pain with which we bring them into the world and make strange dangers and torments for themselves to be even with us  captain shotover weirdly chanting        i builded a house for my daughters and opened the doors             thereof       that men might come for their choosing and their betters             spring from their love       but one of them married a numskull  hector taking up the rhythm        the other a liar wed  mrs hushabye completing the stanza        and now must she lie beside him even as she made her bed  lady utterword calling from the garden hesione hesione where are you  hector the cat is on the tiles  mrs hushabye coming darling coming she goes quickly into the garden  the captain goes back to his place at the table  hector going out into the hall shall i turn up the lights for you  captain shotover no give me deeper darkness money is not made in the light     act ii  the same room with the lights turned up and the curtains drawn ellie comes in followed by mangan both are dressed for dinner she strolls to the drawingtable he comes between the table and the wicker chair  mangan what a dinner i dont call it a dinner i call it a meal  ellie i am accustomed to meals mr mangan and very lucky to get them besides the captain cooked some maccaroni for me  mangan shuddering liverishly too rich i cant eat such things i suppose its because i have to work so much with my brain thats the worst of being a man of business you are always thinking thinking thinking by the way now that we are alone may i take the opportunity to come to a little understanding with you  ellie settling into the draughtsmans seat certainly i should like to  mangan taken aback should you that surprises me for i thought i noticed this afternoon that you avoided me all you could not for the first time either  ellie i was very tired and upset i wasnt used to the ways of this extraordinary house please forgive me  mangan oh thats all right i dont mind but captain shotover has been talking to me about you you and me you know  ellie interested the captain what did he say  mangan well he noticed the difference between our ages  ellie he notices everything  mangan you dont mind then  ellie of course i know quite well that our engagement  mangan oh you call it an engagement  ellie well isnt it  mangan oh yes yes no doubt it is if you hold to it this is the first time youve used the word and i didnt quite know where we stood thats all he sits down in the wicker chair and resigns himself to allow her to lead the conversation you were saying  ellie was i i forget tell me do you like this part of the country i heard you ask mr hushabye at dinner whether there are any nice houses to let down here  mangan i like the place the air suits me i shouldnt be surprised if i settled down here  ellie nothing would please me better the air suits me too and i want to be near hesione  mangan with growing uneasiness the air may suit us but the question is should we suit one another have you thought about that  ellie mr mangan we must be sensible mustnt we its no use pretending that we are romeo and juliet but we can get on very well together if we choose to make the best of it your kindness of heart will make it easy for me  mangan leaning forward with the beginning of something like deliberate unpleasantness in his voice kindness of heart eh i ruined your father didnt i  ellie oh not intentionally  mangan yes i did ruined him on purpose  ellie on purpose  mangan not out of illnature you know and youll admit that i kept a job for him when i had finished with him but business is business and i ruined him as a matter of business  ellie i dont understand how that can be are you trying to make me feel that i need not be grateful to you so that i may choose freely  mangan rising aggressively no i mean what i say  ellie but how could it possibly do you any good to ruin my father the money he lost was yours  mangan with a sour laugh was mine it is mine miss ellie and all the money the other fellows lost too he shoves his hands into his pockets and shows his teeth i just smoked them out like a hive of bees what do you say to that a bit of shock eh  ellie it would have been this morning now you cant think how little it matters but its quite interesting only you must explain it to me i dont understand it propping her elbows on the drawingboard and her chin on her hands she composes herself to listen with a combination of conscious curiosity with unconscious contempt which provokes him to more and more unpleasantness and an attempt at patronage of her ignorance  mangan of course you dont understand what do you know about business you just listen and learn your fathers business was a new business and i dont start new businesses i let other fellows start them they put all their money and their friends money into starting them they wear out their souls and bodies trying to make a success of them theyre what you call enthusiasts but the first dead lift of the thing is too much for them and they havent enough financial experience in a year or so they have either to let the whole show go bust or sell out to a new lot of fellows for a few deferred ordinary shares that is if theyre lucky enough to get anything at all as likely as not the very same thing happens to the new lot they put in more money and a couple of years more work and then perhaps they have to sell out to a third lot if its really a big thing the third lot will have to sell out too and leave their work and their money behind them and thats where the real business man comes in where i come in but im cleverer than some i dont mind dropping a little money to start the process i took your fathers measure i saw that he had a sound idea and that he would work himself silly for it if he got the chance i saw that he was a child in business and was dead certain to outrun his expenses and be in too great a hurry to wait for his market i knew that the surest way to ruin a man who doesnt know how to handle money is to give him some i explained my idea to some friends in the city and they found the money for i take no risks in ideas even when theyre my own your father and the friends that ventured their money with him were no more to me than a heap of squeezed lemons youve been wasting your gratitude my kind heart is all rot im sick of it when i see your father beaming at me with his moist grateful eyes regularly wallowing in gratitude i sometimes feel i must tell him the truth or burst what stops me is that i know he wouldnt believe me hed think it was my modesty as you did just now hed think anything rather than the truth which is that hes a blamed fool and i am a man that knows how to take care of himself he throws himself back into the big chair with large self approval now what do you think of me miss ellie  ellie dropping her hands how strange that my mother who knew nothing at all about business should have been quite right about you she always said not before papa of course but to us childrenthat you were just that sort of man  mangan sitting up much hurt oh did she and yet shed have let you marry me  ellie well you see mr mangan my mother married a very good manfor whatever you may think of my father as a man of business he is the soul of goodnessand she is not at all keen on my doing the same  mangan anyhow you dont want to marry me now do you  ellie very calmly oh i think so why not  mangan rising aghast why not  ellie i dont see why we shouldnt get on very well together  mangan well but look here you knowhe stops quite at a loss  ellie patiently well  mangan well i thought you were rather particular about peoples characters  ellie if we women were particular about mens characters we should never get married at all mr mangan  mangan a child like you talking of we women what next youre not in earnest  ellie yes i am arent you  mangan you mean to hold me to it  ellie do you wish to back out of it  mangan oh no not exactly back out of it  ellie well  he has nothing to say with a long whispered whistle he drops into the wicker chair and stares before him like a beggared gambler but a cunning look soon comes into his face he leans over towards her on his right elbow and speaks in a low steady voice  mangan suppose i told you i was in love with another woman  ellie echoing him suppose i told you i was in love with another man  mangan bouncing angrily out of his chair im not joking  ellie who told you i was  mangan i tell you im serious youre too young to be serious but youll have to believe me i want to be near your friend mrs hushabye im in love with her now the murders out  ellie i want to be near your friend mr hushabye im in love with him she rises and adds with a frank air now we are in one anothers confidence we shall be real friends thank you for telling me  mangan almost beside himself do you think ill be made a convenience of like this  ellie come mr mangan you made a business convenience of my father well a womans business is marriage why shouldnt i make a domestic convenience of you  mangan because i dont choose see because im not a silly gull like your father thats why  ellie with serene contempt you are not good enough to clean my fathers boots mr mangan and i am paying you a great compliment in condescending to make a convenience of you as you call it of course you are free to throw over our engagement if you like but if you do youll never enter hesiones house again i will take care of that  mangan gasping you little devil youve done me on the point of collapsing into the big chair again he recovers himself wait a bit though youre not so cute as you think you cant beat boss mangan as easy as that suppose i go straight to mrs hushabye and tell her that youre in love with her husband  ellie she knows it  mangan you told her  ellie she told me  mangan clutching at his bursting temples oh this is a crazy house or else im going clean off my chump is she making a swop with youshe to have your husband and you to have hers  ellie well you dont want us both do you  mangan throwing himself into the chair distractedly my brain wont stand it my heads going to split help help me to hold it quick hold it squeeze it save me ellie comes behind his chair clasps his head hard for a moment then begins to draw her hands from his forehead back to his ears thank you drowsily thats very refreshing waking a little dont you hypnotize me though ive seen men made fools of by hypnotism  ellie steadily be quiet ive seen men made fools of without hypnotism  mangan humbly you dont dislike touching me i hope you never touched me before i noticed  ellie not since you fell in love naturally with a grownup nice woman who will never expect you to make love to her and i will never expect him to make love to me  mangan he may though  ellie making her passes rhythmically hush go to sleep do you hear you are to go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep be quiet deeply deeply quiet sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep  he falls asleep ellie steals away turns the light out and goes into the garden  nurse guinness opens the door and is seen in the light which comes in from the hall  guinness speaking to someone outside mr mangans not here duckie theres no one here its all dark  mrs hushabye without try the garden mr dunn and i will be in my boudoir show him the way  guinness yes ducky she makes for the garden door in the dark stumbles over the sleeping mangan and screams ahoo o lord sir i beg your pardon im sure i didnt see you in the dark who is it she goes back to the door and turns on the light oh mr mangan sir i hope i havent hurt you plumping into your lap like that coming to him i was looking for you sir mrs hushabye says will you please noticing that he remains quite insensible oh my good lord i hope i havent killed him sir mr mangan sir she shakes him and he is rolling inertly off the chair on the floor when she holds him up and props him against the cushion miss hessy miss hessy quick doty darling miss hessy mrs hushabye comes in from the hall followed by mazzini dunn oh miss hessy ive been and killed him  mazzini runs round the back of the chair to mangans right hand and sees that the nurses words are apparently only too true  mazzini what tempted you to commit such a crime woman  mrs hushabye trying not to laugh do you mean you did it on purpose  guinness now is it likely id kill any man on purpose i fell over him in the dark and im a pretty tidy weight he never spoke nor moved until i shook him and then he would have dropped dead on the floor isnt it tiresome  mrs hushabye going past the nurse to mangans side and inspecting him less credulously than mazzini nonsense he is not dead he is only asleep i can see him breathing  guinness but why wont he wake  mazzini speaking very politely into mangans ear mangan my dear mangan he blows into mangans ear  mrs hushabye thats no good she shakes him vigorously mr mangan wake up do you hear he begins to roll over oh nurse nurse hes falling help me  nurse guinness rushes to the rescue with mazzinis assistance mangan is propped safely up again  guinness behind the chair bending over to test the case with her nose would he be drunk do you think pet  mrs hushabye had he any of papas rum  mazzini it cant be that he is most abstemious i am afraid he drank too much formerly and has to drink too little now you know mrs hushabye i really think he has been hypnotized  guinness hip no what sir  mazzini one evening at home after we had seen a hypnotizing performance the children began playing at it and ellie stroked my head i assure you i went off dead asleep and they had to send for a professional to wake me up after i had slept eighteen hours they had to carry me upstairs and as the poor children were not very strong they let me slip and i rolled right down the whole flight and never woke up mrs hushabye splutters oh you may laugh mrs hushabye but i might have been killed  mrs hushabye i couldnt have helped laughing even if you had been mr dunn so ellie has hypnotized him what fun  mazzini oh no no no it was such a terrible lesson to her nothing would induce her to try such a thing again  mrs hushabye then who did it i didnt  mazzini i thought perhaps the captain might have done it unintentionally he is so fearfully magnetic i feel vibrations whenever he comes close to me  guinness the captain will get him out of it anyhow sir ill back him for that ill go fetch him she makes for the pantry  mrs hushabye wait a bit to mazzini you say he is all right for eighteen hours  mazzini well i was asleep for eighteen hours  mrs hushabye were you any the worse for it  mazzini i dont quite remember they had poured brandy down my throat you see and  mrs hushabye quite anyhow you survived nurse darling go and ask miss dunn to come to us here say i want to speak to her particularly you will find her with mr hushabye probably  guinness i think not ducky miss addy is with him but ill find her and send her to you she goes out into the garden  mrs hushabye calling mazzinis attention to the figure on the chair now mr dunn look just look look hard do you still intend to sacrifice your daughter to that thing  mazzini troubled you have completely upset me mrs hushabye by all you have said to me that anyone could imagine that ii a consecrated soldier of freedom if i may say socould sacrifice ellie to anybody or anyone or that i should ever have dreamed of forcing her inclinations in any way is a most painful blow to mywell i suppose you would say to my good opinion of myself  mrs hushabye rather stolidly sorry  mazzini looking forlornly at the body what is your objection to poor mangan mrs hushabye he looks all right to me but then i am so accustomed to him  mrs hushabye have you no heart have you no sense look at the brute think of poor weak innocent ellie in the clutches of this slavedriver who spends his life making thousands of rough violent workmen bend to his will and sweat for him a man accustomed to have great masses of iron beaten into shape for him by steamhammers to fight with women and girls over a halfpenny an hour ruthlessly a captain of industry i think you call him dont you are you going to fling your delicate sweet helpless child into such a beasts claws just because he will keep her in an expensive house and make her wear diamonds to show how rich he is  mazzini staring at her in wideeyed amazement bless you dear mrs hushabye what romantic ideas of business you have poor dear mangan isnt a bit like that  mrs hushabye scornfully poor dear mangan indeed  mazzini but he doesnt know anything about machinery he never goes near the men he couldnt manage them he is afraid of them i never can get him to take the least interest in the works he hardly knows more about them than you do people are cruelly unjust to mangan they think he is all rugged strength just because his manners are bad  mrs hushabye do you mean to tell me he isnt strong enough to crush poor little ellie  mazzini of course its very hard to say how any marriage will turn out but speaking for myself i should say that he wont have a dogs chance against ellie you know ellie has remarkable strength of character i think it is because i taught her to like shakespeare when she was very young  mrs hushabye contemptuously shakespeare the next thing you will tell me is that you could have made a great deal more money than mangan she retires to the sofa and sits down at the port end of it in the worst of humors  mazzini following her and taking the other end no im no good at making money i dont care enough for it somehow im not ambitious that must be it mangan is wonderful about money he thinks of nothing else he is so dreadfully afraid of being poor i am always thinking of other things even at the works i think of the things we are doing and not of what they cost and the worst of it is poor mangan doesnt know what to do with his money when he gets it he is such a baby that he doesnt know even what to eat and drink he has ruined his liver eating and drinking the wrong things and now he can hardly eat at all ellie will diet him splendidly you will be surprised when you come to know him better he is really the most helpless of mortals you get quite a protective feeling towards him  mrs hushabye then who manages his business pray  mazzini i do and of course other people like me  mrs hushabye footling people you mean  mazzini i suppose youd think us so  mrs hushabye and pray why dont you do without him if youre all so much cleverer  mazzini oh we couldnt we should ruin the business in a year ive tried and i know we should spend too much on everything we should improve the quality of the goods and make them too dear we should be sentimental about the hard cases among the work people but mangan keeps us in order he is down on us about every extra halfpenny we could never do without him you see he will sit up all night thinking of how to save sixpence wont ellie make him jump though when she takes his house in hand  mrs hushabye then the creature is a fraud even as a captain of industry  mazzini i am afraid all the captains of industry are what you call frauds mrs hushabye of course there are some manufacturers who really do understand their own works but they dont make as high a rate of profit as mangan does i assure you mangan is quite a good fellow in his way he means well  mrs hushabye he doesnt look well he is not in his first youth is he  mazzini after all no husband is in his first youth for very long mrs hushabye and men cant afford to marry in their first youth nowadays  mrs hushabye now if i said that it would sound witty why cant you say it wittily what on earth is the matter with you why dont you inspire everybody with confidence with respect  mazzini humbly i think that what is the matter with me is that i am poor you dont know what that means at home mind i dont say they have ever complained theyve all been wonderful theyve been proud of my poverty theyve even joked about it quite often but my wife has had a very poor time of it she has been quite resigned  mrs hushabye shuddering involuntarily  mazzini there you see mrs hushabye i dont want ellie to live on resignation  mrs hushabye do you want her to have to resign herself to living with a man she doesnt love  mazzini wistfully are you sure that would be worse than living with a man she did love if he was a footling person  mrs hushabye relaxing her contemptuous attitude quite interested in mazzini now you know i really think you must love ellie very much for you become quite clever when you talk about her  mazzini i didnt know i was so very stupid on other subjects  mrs hushabye you are sometimes  mazzini turning his head away for his eyes are wet i have learnt a good deal about myself from you mrs hushabye and im afraid i shall not be the happier for your plain speaking but if you thought i needed it to make me think of ellies happiness you were very much mistaken  mrs hushabye leaning towards him kindly have i been a beast  mazzini pulling himself together it doesnt matter about me mrs hushabye i think you like ellie and that is enough for me  mrs hushabye im beginning to like you a little i perfectly loathed you at first i thought you the most odious selfsatisfied boresome elderly prig i ever met  mazzini resigned and now quite cheerful i daresay i am all that i never have been a favorite with gorgeous women like you they always frighten me  mrs hushabye pleased am i a gorgeous woman mazzini i shall fall in love with you presently  mazzini with placid gallantry no you wont hesione but you would be quite safe would you believe it that quite a lot of women have flirted with me because i am quite safe but they get tired of me for the same reason  mrs hushabye mischievously take care you may not be so safe as you think  mazzini oh yes quite safe you see i have been in love really the sort of love that only happens once softly thats why ellie is such a lovely girl  mrs hushabye well really you are coming out are you quite sure you wont let me tempt you into a second grand passion  mazzini quite it wouldnt be natural the fact is you dont strike on my box mrs hushabye and i certainly dont strike on yours  mrs hushabye i see your marriage was a safety match  mazzini what a very witty application of the expression i used i should never have thought of it  ellie comes in from the garden looking anything but happy  mrs hushabye rising oh here is ellie at last she goes behind the sofa  ellie on the threshold of the starboard door guinness said you wanted me you and papa  mrs hushabye you have kept us waiting so long that it almost came towell never mind your father is a very wonderful man she ruffles his hair affectionately the only one i ever met who could resist me when i made myself really agreeable she comes to the big chair on mangans left come here i have something to show you ellie strolls listlessly to the other side of the chair look  ellie contemplating mangan without interest i know he is only asleep we had a talk after dinner and he fell asleep in the middle of it  mrs hushabye you did it ellie you put him asleep  mazzini rising quickly and coming to the back of the chair oh i hope not did you ellie  ellie wearily he asked me to  mazzini but its dangerous you know what happened to me  ellie utterly indifferent oh i daresay i can wake him if not somebody else can  mrs hushabye it doesnt matter anyhow because i have at last persuaded your father that you dont want to marry him  ellie suddenly coming out of her listlessness much vexed but why did you do that hesione i do want to marry him i fully intend to marry him  mazzini are you quite sure ellie mrs hushabye has made me feel that i may have been thoughtless and selfish about it  ellie very clearly and steadily papa when mrs hushabye takes it on herself to explain to you what i think or dont think shut your ears tight and shut your eyes too hesione knows nothing about me she hasnt the least notion of the sort of person i am and never will i promise you i wont do anything i dont want to do and mean to do for my own sake  mazzini you are quite quite sure  ellie quite quite sure now you must go away and leave me to talk to mrs hushabye  mazzini but i should like to hear shall i be in the way  ellie inexorable i had rather talk to her alone  mazzini affectionately oh well i know what a nuisance parents are dear i will be good and go he goes to the garden door by the way do you remember the address of that professional who woke me up dont you think i had better telegraph to him  mrs hushabye moving towards the sofa its too late to telegraph tonight  mazzini i suppose so i do hope hell wake up in the course of the night he goes out into the garden  ellie turning vigorously on hesione the moment her father is out of the room hesione what the devil do you mean by making mischief with my father about mangan  mrs hushabye promptly losing her temper dont you dare speak to me like that you little minx remember that you are in my house  ellie stuff why dont you mind your own business what is it to you whether i choose to marry mangan or not  mrs hushabye do you suppose you can bully me you miserable little matrimonial adventurer  ellie every woman who hasnt any money is a matrimonial adventurer its easy for you to talk you have never known what it is to want money and you can pick up men as if they were daisies i am poor and respectable  mrs hushabye interrupting ho respectable how did you pick up mangan how did you pick up my husband you have the audacity to tell me that i am aaa  ellie a siren so you are you were born to lead men by the nose if you werent marcus would have waited for me perhaps  mrs hushabye suddenly melting and half laughing oh my poor ellie my pettikins my unhappy darling i am so sorry about hector but what can i do its not my fault id give him to you if i could  ellie i dont blame you for that  mrs hushabye what a brute i was to quarrel with you and call you names do kiss me and say youre not angry with me  ellie fiercely oh dont slop and gush and be sentimental dont you see that unless i can be hardas hard as nailsi shall go mad i dont care a damn about your calling me names do you think a woman in my situation can feel a few hard words  mrs hushabye poor little woman poor little situation  ellie i suppose you think youre being sympathetic you are just foolish and stupid and selfish you see me getting a smasher right in the face that kills a whole part of my life the best part that can never come again and you think you can help me over it by a little coaxing and kissing when i want all the strength i can get to lean on something iron something stony i dont care how cruel it is you go all mushy and want to slobber over me im not angry im not unfriendly but for gods sake do pull yourself together and dont think that because youre on velvet and always have been women who are in hell can take it as easily as you  mrs hushabye shrugging her shoulders very well she sits down on the sofa in her old place but i warn you that when i am neither coaxing and kissing nor laughing i am just wondering how much longer i can stand living in this cruel damnable world you object to the siren well i drop the siren you want to rest your wounded bosom against a grindstone well folding her arms here is the grindstone  ellie sitting down beside her appeased thats better you really have the trick of falling in with everyones mood but you dont understand because you are not the sort of woman for whom there is only one man and only one chance  mrs hushabye i certainly dont understand how your marrying that object indicating mangan will console you for not being able to marry hector  ellie perhaps you dont understand why i was quite a nice girl this morning and am now neither a girl nor particularly nice  mrs hushabye oh yes i do its because you have made up your mind to do something despicable and wicked  ellie i dont think so hesione i must make the best of my ruined house  mrs hushabye pooh youll get over it your house isnt ruined  ellie of course i shall get over it you dont suppose im going to sit down and die of a broken heart i hope or be an old maid living on a pittance from the sick and indigent roomkeepers association but my heart is broken all the same what i mean by that is that i know that what has happened to me with marcus will not happen to me ever again in the world for me there is marcus and a lot of other men of whom one is just the same as another well if i cant have love thats no reason why i should have poverty if mangan has nothing else he has money  mrs hushabye and are there no young men with money  ellie not within my reach besides a young man would have the right to expect love from me and would perhaps leave me when he found i could not give it to him rich young men can get rid of their wives you know pretty cheaply but this object as you call him can expect nothing more from me than i am prepared to give him  mrs hushabye he will be your owner remember if he buys you he will make the bargain pay him and not you ask your father  ellie rising and strolling to the chair to contemplate their subject you need not trouble on that score hesione i have more to give boss mangan than he has to give me it is i who am buying him and at a pretty good price too i think women are better at that sort of bargain than men i have taken the bosss measure and ten boss mangans shall not prevent me doing far more as i please as his wife than i have ever been able to do as a poor girl stooping to the recumbent figure shall they boss i think not she passes on to the drawingtable and leans against the end of it facing the windows i shall not have to spend most of my time wondering how long my gloves will last anyhow  mrs hushabye rising superbly ellie you are a wicked sordid little beast and to think that i actually condescended to fascinate that creature there to save you from him well let me tell you this if you make this disgusting match you will never see hector again if i can help it  ellie unmoved i nailed mangan by telling him that if he did not marry me he should never see you again she lifts herself on her wrists and seats herself on the end of the table  mrs hushabye recoiling oh  ellie so you see i am not unprepared for your playing that trump against me well you just try it thats all i should have made a man of marcus not a household pet  mrs hushabye flaming you dare  ellie looking almost dangerous set him thinking about me if you dare  mrs hushabye well of all the impudent little fiends i ever met hector says there is a certain point at which the only answer you can give to a man who breaks all the rules is to knock him down what would you say if i were to box your ears  ellie calmly i should pull your hair  mrs hushabye mischievously that wouldnt hurt me perhaps it comes off at night  ellie so taken aback that she drops off the table and runs to her oh you dont mean to say hesione that your beautiful black hair is false  mrs hushabye patting it dont tell hector he believes in it  ellie groaning oh even the hair that ensnared him false everything false  mrs hushabye pull it and try other women can snare men in their hair but i can swing a baby on mine aha you cant do that goldylocks  ellie heartbroken no you have stolen my babies  mrs hushabye pettikins dont make me cry you know what you said about my making a household pet of him is a little true perhaps he ought to have waited for you would any other woman on earth forgive you  ellie oh what right had you to take him all for yourself pulling herself together there you couldnt help it neither of us could help it he couldnt help it no dont say anything more i cant bear it let us wake the object she begins stroking mangans head reversing the movement with which she put him to sleep wake up do you hear you are to wake up at once wake up wake up wake  mangan bouncing out of the chair in a fury and turning on them wake up so you think ive been asleep do you he kicks the chair violently back out of his way and gets between them you throw me into a trance so that i cant move hand or footi might have been buried alive its a mercy i wasntand then you think i was only asleep if youd let me drop the two times you rolled me about my nose would have been flattened for life against the floor but ive found you all out anyhow i know the sort of people im among now ive heard every word youve said you and your precious father and to mrs hushabye you too so im an object am i im a thing am i im a fool that hasnt sense enough to feed myself properly am i im afraid of the men that would starve if it werent for the wages i give them am i im nothing but a disgusting old skinflint to be made a convenience of by designing women and fool managers of my works am i im  mrs hushabye with the most elegant aplomb shshshshsh mr mangan you are bound in honor to obliterate from your mind all you heard while you were pretending to be asleep it was not meant for you to hear  mangan pretending to be asleep do you think if i was only pretending that id have sprawled there helpless and listened to such unfairness such lies such injustice and plotting and backbiting and slandering of me if i could have up and told you what i thought of you i wonder i didnt burst  mrs hushabye sweetly you dreamt it all mr mangan we were only saying how beautifully peaceful you looked in your sleep that was all wasnt it ellie believe me mr mangan all those unpleasant things came into your mind in the last half second before you woke ellie rubbed your hair the wrong way and the disagreeable sensation suggested a disagreeable dream  mangan doggedly i believe in dreams  mrs hushabye so do i but they go by contraries dont they  mangan depths of emotion suddenly welling up in him i shant forget to my dying day that when you gave me the glad eye that time in the garden you were making a fool of me that was a dirty low mean thing to do you had no right to let me come near you if i disgusted you it isnt my fault if im old and havent a moustache like a bronze candlestick as your husband has there are things no decent woman would do to a manlike a man hitting a woman in the breast  hesione utterly shamed sits down on the sofa and covers her face with her hands mangan sits down also on his chair and begins to cry like a child ellie stares at them mrs hushabye at the distressing sound he makes takes down her hands and looks at him she rises and runs to him  mrs hushabye dont cry i cant bear it have i broken your heart i didnt know you had one how could i  mangan im a man aint i  mrs hushabye half coaxing half rallying altogether tenderly oh no not what i call a man only a boss just that and nothing else what business has a boss with a heart  mangan then youre not a bit sorry for what you did nor ashamed  mrs hushabye i was ashamed for the first time in my life when you said that about hitting a woman in the breast and i found out what id done my very bones blushed red youve had your revenge boss arent you satisfied  mangan serve you right do you hear serve you right youre just cruel cruel  mrs hushabye yes cruelty would be delicious if one could only find some sort of cruelty that didnt really hurt by the way sitting down beside him on the arm of the chair whats your name its not really boss is it  mangan shortly if you want to know my names alfred  mrs hushabye springs up alfred ellie he was christened after tennyson  mangan rising i was christened after my uncle and never had a penny from him damn him what of it  mrs hushabye it comes to me suddenly that you are a real person that you had a mother like anyone else putting her hands on his shoulders and surveying him little alf  mangan well you have a nerve  mrs hushabye and you have a heart alfy a whimpering little heart but a real one releasing him suddenly now run and make it up with ellie she has had time to think what to say to you which is more than i had she goes out quickly into the garden by the port door  mangan that woman has a pair of hands that go right through you  ellie still in love with her in spite of all we said about you  mangan are all women like you two do they never think of anything about a man except what they can get out of him you werent even thinking that about me you were only thinking whether your gloves would last  ellie i shall not have to think about that when we are married  mangan and you think i am going to marry you after what i heard there  ellie you heard nothing from me that i did not tell you before  mangan perhaps you think i cant do without you  ellie i think you would feel lonely without us all now after coming to know us so well  mangan with something like a yell of despair am i never to have the last word  captain shotover appearing at the starboard garden door there is a soul in torment here what is the matter  mangan this girl doesnt want to spend her life wondering how long her gloves will last  captain shotover passing through dont wear any i never do he goes into the pantry  lady utterword appearing at the port garden door in a handsome dinner dress is anything the matter  ellie this gentleman wants to know is he never to have the last word  lady utterword coming forward to the sofa i should let him have it my dear the important thing is not to have the last word but to have your own way  mangan she wants both  lady utterword she wont get them mr mangan providence always has the last word  mangan desperately now you are going to come religion over me in this house a mans mind might as well be a football im going he makes for the hall but is stopped by a hail from the captain who has just emerged from his pantry  captain shotover whither away boss mangan  mangan to hell out of this house let that be enough for you and all here  captain shotover you were welcome to come you are free to go the wide earth the high seas the spacious skies are waiting for you outside  lady utterword but your things mr mangan your bag your comb and brushes your pyjamas  hector who has just appeared in the port doorway in a handsome arab costume why should the escaping slave take his chains with him  mangan thats right hushabye keep the pyjamas my lady and much good may they do you  hector advancing to lady utterwords left hand let us all go out into the night and leave everything behind us  mangan you stay where you are the lot of you i want no company especially female company  ellie let him go he is unhappy here he is angry with us  captain shotover go boss mangan and when you have found the land where there is happiness and where there are no women send me its latitude and longitude and i will join you there  lady utterword you will certainly not be comfortable without your luggage mr mangan  ellie impatient go go why dont you go it is a heavenly night you can sleep on the heath take my waterproof to lie on it is hanging up in the hall  hector breakfast at nine unless you prefer to breakfast with the captain at six  ellie good night alfred  hector alfred he runs back to the door and calls into the garden randall mangans christian name is alfred  randall appearing in the starboard doorway in evening dress then hesione wins her bet  mrs hushabye appears in the port doorway she throws her left arm round hectors neck draws him with her to the back of the sofa and throws her right arm round lady utterwords neck  mrs hushabye they wouldnt believe me alf  they contemplate him  mangan is there any more of you coming in to look at me as if i was the latest thing in a menagerie  mrs hushabye you are the latest thing in this menagerie  before mangan can retort a fall of furniture is heard from upstairs then a pistol shot and a yell of pain the staring group breaks up in consternation  mazzinis voice from above help a burglar help  hector his eyes blazing a burglar  mrs hushabye no hector youll be shot but it is too late he has dashed out past mangan who hastily moves towards the bookshelves out of his way  captain shotover blowing his whistle all hands aloft he strides out after hector  lady utterword my diamonds she follows the captain  randall rushing after her no ariadne let me  ellie oh is papa shot she runs out  mrs hushabye are you frightened alf  mangan no it aint my house thank god  mrs hushabye if they catch a burglar shall we have to go into court as witnesses and be asked all sorts of questions about our private lives  mangan you wont be believed if you tell the truth  mazzini terribly upset with a duelling pistol in his hand comes from the hall and makes his way to the drawingtable  mazzini oh my dear mrs hushabye i might have killed him he throws the pistol on the table and staggers round to the chair i hope you wont believe i really intended to  hector comes in marching an old and villainous looking man before him by the collar he plants him in the middle of the room and releases him  ellie follows and immediately runs across to the back of her fathers chair and pats his shoulders  randall entering with a poker keep your eye on this door mangan ill look after the other he goes to the starboard door and stands on guard there  lady utterword comes in after randall and goes between mrs hushabye and mangan  nurse guinness brings up the rear and waits near the door on mangans left  mrs hushabye what has happened  mazzini your housekeeper told me there was somebody upstairs and gave me a pistol that mr hushabye had been practising with i thought it would frighten him but it went off at a touch  the burglar yes and took the skin off my ear precious near took the top off my head why dont you have a proper revolver instead of a thing like that that goes off if you as much as blow on it  hector one of my duelling pistols sorry  mazzini he put his hands up and said it was a fair cop  the burglar so it was send for the police  hector no by thunder it was not a fair cop we were four to one  mrs hushabye what will they do to him  the burglar ten years beginning with solitary ten years off my life i shant serve it all im too old it will see me out  lady utterword you should have thought of that before you stole my diamonds  the burglar well youve got them back lady havent you can you give me back the years of my life you are going to take from me  mrs hushabye oh we cant bury a man alive for ten years for a few diamonds  the burglar ten little shining diamonds ten long black years  lady utterword think of what it is for us to be dragged through the horrors of a criminal court and have all our family affairs in the papers if you were a native and hastings could order you a good beating and send you away i shouldnt mind but here in england there is no real protection for any respectable person  the burglar im too old to be giv a hiding lady send for the police and have done with it its only just and right you should  randall who has relaxed his vigilance on seeing the burglar so pacifically disposed and comes forward swinging the poker between his fingers like a well folded umbrella it is neither just nor right that we should be put to a lot of inconvenience to gratify your moral enthusiasm my friend you had better get out while you have the chance  the burglar inexorably no i must work my sin off my conscience this has come as a sort of call to me let me spend the rest of my life repenting in a cell i shall have my reward above  mangan exasperated the very burglars cant behave naturally in this house  hector my good sir you must work out your salvation at somebody elses expense nobody here is going to charge you  the burglar oh you wont charge me wont you  hector no im sorry to be inhospitable but will you kindly leave the house  the burglar right ill go to the police station and give myself up he turns resolutely to the door but hector stops him  hector                       oh no you mustnt do that  randall speaking together  no no clear out man cant you and                                dont be a fool  mrs hushabye

utterly ridiculous are we to be forced to prosecute this man when we dont want to  the burglar am i to be robbed of my salvation to save you the trouble of spending a day at the sessions is that justice is it right is it fair to me  mazzini rising and leaning across the table persuasively as if it were a pulpit desk or a shop counter come come let me show you how you can turn your very crimes to account why not set up as a locksmith you must know more about locks than most honest men  the burglar thats true sir but i couldnt set up as a locksmith under twenty pounds  randall well you can easily steal twenty pounds you will find it in the nearest bank  the burglar horrified oh what a thing for a gentleman to put into the head of a poor criminal scrambling out of the bottomless pit as it were oh shame on you sir oh god forgive you he throws himself into the big chair and covers his face as if in prayer  lady utterword really randall  hector it seems to me that we shall have to take up a collection for this inopportunely contrite sinner  lady utterword but twenty pounds is ridiculous  the burglar looking up quickly i shall have to buy a lot of tools lady  lady utterword nonsense you have your burgling kit  the burglar whats a jimmy and a centrebit and an acetylene welding plant and a bunch of skeleton keys i shall want a forge and a smithy and a shop and fittings i cant hardly do it for twenty  hector my worthy friend we havent got twenty pounds  the burglar now master of the situation you can raise it among you cant you  mrs hushabye give him a sovereign hector and get rid of him  hector giving him a pound there off with you  the burglar rising and taking the money very ungratefully i wont promise nothing you have more on you than a quid all the lot of you i mean  lady utterword vigorously oh let us prosecute him and have done with it i have a conscience too i hope and i do not feel at all sure that we have any right to let him go especially if he is going to be greedy and impertinent  the burglar quickly all right lady all right ive no wish to be anything but agreeable good evening ladies and gentlemen and thank you kindly  he is hurrying out when he is confronted in the doorway by captain shotover  captain shotover fixing the burglar with a piercing regard whats this are there two of you  the burglar falling on his knees before the captain in abject terror oh my good lord what have i done dont tell me its your house ive broken into captain shotover  the captain seizes him by the collar drags him to his feet and leads him to the middle of the group hector falling back beside his wife to make way for them  captain shotover turning him towards ellie is that your daughter he releases him  the burglar well how do i know captain you know the sort of life you and me has led any young lady of that age might be my daughter anywhere in the wide world as you might say  captain shotover to mazzini you are not billy dunn this is billy dunn why have you imposed on me  the burglar indignantly to mazzini have you been giving yourself out to be me you that nigh blew my head off shooting yourself in a manner of speaking  mazzini my dear captain shotover ever since i came into this house i have done hardly anything else but assure you that i am not mr william dunn but mazzini dunn a very different person  the burglar he dont belong to my branch captain theres two sets in the family the thinking dunns and the drinking dunns each going their own ways im a drinking dunn hes a thinking dunn but that didnt give him any right to shoot me  captain shotover so youve turned burglar have you  the burglar no captain i wouldnt disgrace our old sea calling by such a thing i am no burglar  lady utterword what were you doing with my diamonds  guinness what did you break into the house for if youre no burglar  randall mistook the house for your own and came in by the wrong window eh  the burglar well its no use my telling you a lie i can take in most captains but not captain shotover because he sold himself to the devil in zanzibar and can divine water spot gold explode a cartridge in your pocket with a glance of his eye and see the truth hidden in the heart of man but im no burglar  captain shotover are you an honest man  the burglar i dont set up to be better than my fellowcreatures and never did as you well know captain but what i do is innocent and pious i enquire about for houses where the right sort of people live i work it on them same as i worked it here i break into the house put a few spoons or diamonds in my pocket make a noise get caught and take up a collection and you wouldnt believe how hard it is to get caught when youre actually trying to i have knocked over all the chairs in a room without a soul paying any attention to me in the end i have had to walk out and leave the job  randall when that happens do you put back the spoons and diamonds  the burglar well i dont fly in the face of providence if thats what you want to know  captain shotover guinness you remember this man  guinness i should think i do seeing i was married to him the blackguard  hesione  exclaiming  married to him lady utterword  together  guinness  the burglar it wasnt legal ive been married to no end of women no use coming that over me  captain shotover take him to the forecastle he flings him to the door with a strength beyond his years  guinness i suppose you mean the kitchen they wont have him there do you expect servants to keep company with thieves and all sorts  captain shotover landthieves and waterthieves are the same flesh and blood ill have no boatswain on my quarterdeck off with you both  the burglar yes captain he goes out humbly  mazzini will it be safe to have him in the house like that  guinness why didnt you shoot him sir if id known who he was id have shot him myself she goes out  mrs hushabye do sit down everybody she sits down on the sofa  they all move except ellie mazzini resumes his seat randall sits down in the windowseat near the starboard door again making a pendulum of his poker and studying it as galileo might have done hector sits on his left in the middle mangan forgotten sits in the port corner lady utterword takes the big chair captain shotover goes into the pantry in deep abstraction they all look after him and lady utterword coughs consciously  mrs hushabye so billy dunn was poor nurses little romance i knew there had been somebody  randall they will fight their battles over again and enjoy themselves immensely  lady utterword irritably you are not married and you know nothing about it randall hold your tongue  randall tyrant  mrs hushabye well we have had a very exciting evening everything will be an anticlimax after it wed better all go to bed  randall another burglar may turn up  mazzini oh impossible i hope not  randall why not there is more than one burglar in england  mrs hushabye what do you say alf  mangan huffily oh i dont matter im forgotten the burglar has put my nose out of joint shove me into a corner and have done with me  mrs hushabye jumping up mischievously and going to him would you like a walk on the heath alfred with me  ellie go mr mangan it will do you good hesione will soothe you  mrs hushabye slipping her arm under his and pulling him upright come alfred there is a moon its like the night in tristan and isolde she caresses his arm and draws him to the port garden door  mangan writhing but yielding how you can have the facethe hearthe breaks down and is heard sobbing as she takes him out  lady utterword what an extraordinary way to behave what is the matter with the man  ellie in a strangely calm voice staring into an imaginary distance his heart is breaking that is all the captain appears at the pantry door listening it is a curious sensation the sort of pain that goes mercifully beyond our powers of feeling when your heart is broken your boats are burned nothing matters any more it is the end of happiness and the beginning of peace  lady utterword suddenly rising in a rage to the astonishment of the rest how dare you  hector good heavens whats the matter  randall in a warning whisper tchtchtch steady  ellie surprised and haughty i was not addressing you particularly lady utterword and i am not accustomed to being asked how dare i  lady utterword of course not anyone can see how badly you have been brought up  mazzini oh i hope not lady utterword really  lady utterword i know very well what you meant the impudence  ellie what on earth do you mean  captain shotover advancing to the table she means that her heart will not break she has been longing all her life for someone to break it at last she has become afraid she has none to break  lady utterword flinging herself on her knees and throwing her arms round him papa dont say you think ive no heart  captain shotover raising her with grim tenderness if you had no heart how could you want to have it broken child  hector rising with a bound lady utterword you are not to be trusted you have made a scene he runs out into the garden through the starboard door  lady utterword oh hector hector she runs out after him  randall only nerves i assure you he rises and follows her waving the poker in his agitation ariadne ariadne for gods sake be careful you willhe is gone  mazzini rising how distressing can i do anything i wonder  captain shotover promptly taking his chair and setting to work at the drawingboard no go to bed goodnight  mazzini bewildered oh perhaps you are right  ellie goodnight dearest she kisses him  mazzini goodnight love he makes for the door but turns aside to the bookshelves ill just take a book he takes one goodnight he goes out leaving ellie alone with the captain  the captain is intent on his drawing ellie standing sentry over his chair contemplates him for a moment  ellie does nothing ever disturb you captain shotover  captain shotover ive stood on the bridge for eighteen hours in a typhoon life here is stormier but i can stand it  ellie do you think i ought to marry mr mangan  captain shotover never looking up one rock is as good as another to be wrecked on  ellie i am not in love with him  captain shotover who said you were  ellie you are not surprised  captain shotover surprised at my age  ellie it seems to me quite fair he wants me for one thing i want him for another  captain shotover money  ellie yes  captain shotover well one turns the cheek the other kisses it one provides the cash the other spends it  ellie who will have the best of the bargain i wonder  captain shotover you these fellows live in an office all day you will have to put up with him from dinner to breakfast but you will both be asleep most of that time all day you will be quit of him and you will be shopping with his money if that is too much for you marry a seafaring man you will be bothered with him only three weeks in the year perhaps  ellie that would be best of all i suppose  captain shotover its a dangerous thing to be married right up to the hilt like my daughters husband the man is at home all day like a damned soul in hell  ellie i never thought of that before  captain shotover if youre marrying for business you cant be too businesslike  ellie why do women always want other womens husbands  captain shotover why do horsethieves prefer a horse that is brokenin to one that is wild  ellie with a short laugh i suppose so what a vile world it is  captain shotover it doesnt concern me im nearly out of it  ellie and im only just beginning  captain shotover yes so look ahead  ellie well i think i am being very prudent  captain shotover i didnt say prudent i said look ahead  ellie whats the difference  captain shotover its prudent to gain the whole world and lose your own soul but dont forget that your soul sticks to you if you stick to it but the world has a way of slipping through your fingers  ellie wearily leaving him and beginning to wander restlessly about the room im sorry captain shotover but its no use talking like that to me oldfashioned people are no use to me oldfashioned people think you can have a soul without money they think the less money you have the more soul you have young people nowadays know better a soul is a very expensive thing to keep much more so than a motor car  captain shotover is it how much does your soul eat  ellie oh a lot it eats music and pictures and books and mountains and lakes and beautiful things to wear and nice people to be with in this country you cant have them without lots of money that is why our souls are so horribly starved  captain shotover mangans soul lives on pigs food  ellie yes money is thrown away on him i suppose his soul was starved when he was young but it will not be thrown away on me it is just because i want to save my soul that i am marrying for money all the women who are not fools do  captain shotover there are other ways of getting money why dont you steal it  ellie because i dont want to go to prison  captain shotover is that the only reason are you quite sure honesty has nothing to do with it  ellie oh you are very very oldfashioned captain does any modern girl believe that the legal and illegal ways of getting money are the honest and dishonest ways mangan robbed my father and my fathers friends i should rob all the money back from mangan if the police would let me as they wont i must get it back by marrying him  captain shotover i cant argue im too old my mind is made up and finished all i can tell you is that oldfashioned or newfashioned if you sell yourself you deal your soul a blow that all the books and pictures and concerts and scenery in the world wont heal he gets up suddenly and makes for the pantry  ellie running after him and seizing him by the sleeve then why did you sell yourself to the devil in zanzibar  captain shotover stopping startled what  ellie you shall not run away before you answer i have found out that trick of yours if you sold yourself why shouldnt i  captain shotover i had to deal with men so degraded that they wouldnt obey me unless i swore at them and kicked them and beat them with my fists foolish people took young thieves off the streets flung them into a training ship where they were taught to fear the cane instead of fearing god and thought theyd made men and sailors of them by private subscription i tricked these thieves into believing id sold myself to the devil it saved my soul from the kicking and swearing that was damning me by inches  ellie releasing him i shall pretend to sell myself to boss mangan to save my soul from the poverty that is damning me by inches  captain shotover riches will damn you ten times deeper riches wont save even your body  ellie oldfashioned again we know now that the soul is the body and the body the soul they tell us they are different because they want to persuade us that we can keep our souls if we let them make slaves of our bodies i am afraid you are no use to me captain  captain shotover what did you expect a savior eh are you oldfashioned enough to believe in that  ellie no but i thought you were very wise and might help me now i have found you out you pretend to be busy and think of fine things to say and run in and out to surprise people by saying them and get away before they can answer you  captain shotover it confuses me to be answered it discourages me i cannot bear men and women i have to run away i must run away now he tries to  ellie again seizing his arm you shall not run away from me i can hypnotize you you are the only person in the house i can say what i like to i know you are fond of me sit down she draws him to the sofa  captain shotover yielding take care i am in my dotage old men are dangerous it doesnt matter to them what is going to happen to the world  they sit side by side on the sofa she leans affectionately against him with her head on his shoulder and her eyes half closed  ellie dreamily i should have thought nothing else mattered to old men they cant be very interested in what is going to happen to themselves  captain shotover a mans interest in the world is only the overflow from his interest in himself when you are a child your vessel is not yet full so you care for nothing but your own affairs when you grow up your vessel overflows and you are a politician a philosopher or an explorer and adventurer in old age the vessel dries up there is no overflow you are a child again i can give you the memories of my ancient wisdom mere scraps and leavings but i no longer really care for anything but my own little wants and hobbies i sit here working out my old ideas as a means of destroying my fellowcreatures i see my daughters and their men living foolish lives of romance and sentiment and snobbery i see you the younger generation turning from their romance and sentiment and snobbery to money and comfort and hard common sense i was ten times happier on the bridge in the typhoon or frozen into arctic ice for months in darkness than you or they have ever been you are looking for a rich husband at your age i looked for hardship danger horror and death that i might feel the life in me more intensely i did not let the fear of death govern my life and my reward was i had my life you are going to let the fear of poverty govern your life and your reward will be that you will eat but you will not live  ellie sitting up impatiently but what can i do i am not a sea captain i cant stand on bridges in typhoons or go slaughtering seals and whales in greenlands icy mountains they wont let women be captains do you want me to be a stewardess  captain shotover there are worse lives the stewardesses could come ashore if they liked but they sail and sail and sail  ellie what could they do ashore but marry for money i dont want to be a stewardess i am too bad a sailor think of something else for me  captain shotover i cant think so long and continuously i am too old i must go in and out he tries to rise  ellie pulling him back you shall not you are happy here arent you  captain shotover i tell you its dangerous to keep me i cant keep awake and alert  ellie what do you run away for to sleep  captain shotover no to get a glass of rum  ellie frightfully disillusioned is that it how disgusting do you like being drunk  captain shotover no i dread being drunk more than anything in the world to be drunk means to have dreams to go soft to be easily pleased and deceived to fall into the clutches of women drink does that for you when you are young but when you are old very very old like me the dreams come by themselves you dont know how terrible that is you are young you sleep at night only and sleep soundly but later on you will sleep in the afternoon later still you will sleep even in the morning and you will awake tired tired of life you will never be free from dozing and dreams the dreams will steal upon your work every ten minutes unless you can awaken yourself with rum i drink now to keep sober but the dreams are conquering rum is not what it was i have had ten glasses since you came and it might be so much water go get me another guinness knows where it is you had better see for yourself the horror of an old man drinking  ellie you shall not drink dream i like you to dream you must never be in the real world when we talk together  captain shotover i am too weary to resist or too weak i am in my second childhood i do not see you as you really are i cant remember what i really am i feel nothing but the accursed happiness i have dreaded all my life long the happiness that comes as life goes the happiness of yielding and dreaming instead of resisting and doing the sweetness of the fruit that is going rotten  ellie you dread it almost as much as i used to dread losing my dreams and having to fight and do things but that is all over for me my dreams are dashed to pieces i should like to marry a very old very rich man i should like to marry you i had much rather marry you than marry mangan are you very rich  captain shotover no living from hand to mouth and i have a wife somewhere in jamaica a black one my first wife unless shes dead  ellie what a pity i feel so happy with you she takes his hand almost unconsciously and pats it i thought i should never feel happy again  captain shotover why  ellie dont you know  captain shotover no  ellie heartbreak i fell in love with hector and didnt know he was married  captain shotover heartbreak are you one of those who are so sufficient to themselves that they are only happy when they are stripped of everything even of hope  ellie gripping the hand it seems so for i feel now as if there was nothing i could not do because i want nothing  captain shotover thats the only real strength thats genius thats better than rum  ellie throwing away his hand rum why did you spoil it  hector and randall come in from the garden through the starboard door  hector i beg your pardon we did not know there was anyone here  ellie rising that means that you want to tell mr randall the story about the tiger come captain i want to talk to my father and you had better come with me  captain shotover rising nonsense the man is in bed  ellie aha ive caught you my real father has gone to bed but the father you gave me is in the kitchen you knew quite well all along come she draws him out into the garden with her through the port door  hector thats an extraordinary girl she has the ancient mariner on a string like a pekinese dog  randall now that they have gone shall we have a friendly chat  hector you are in what is supposed to be my house i am at your disposal  hector sits down in the draughtsmans chair turning it to face randall who remains standing leaning at his ease against the carpenters bench  randall i take it that we may be quite frank i mean about lady utterword  hector you may i have nothing to be frank about i never met her until this afternoon  randall straightening up what but you are her sisters husband  hector well if you come to that you are her husbands brother  randall but you seem to be on intimate terms with her  hector so do you  randall yes but i am on intimate terms with her i have known her for years  hector it took her years to get to the same point with you that she got to with me in five minutes it seems  randall vexed really ariadne is the limit he moves away huffishly towards the windows  hector coolly she is as i remarked to hesione a very enterprising woman  randall returning much troubled you see hushabye you are what women consider a goodlooking man  hector i cultivated that appearance in the days of my vanity and hesione insists on my keeping it up she makes me wear these ridiculous things indicating his arab costume because she thinks me absurd in evening dress  randall still you do keep it up old chap now i assure you i have not an atom of jealousy in my disposition  hector the question would seem to be rather whether your brother has any touch of that sort  randall what hastings oh dont trouble about hastings he has the gift of being able to work sixteen hours a day at the dullest detail and actually likes it that gets him to the top wherever he goes as long as ariadne takes care that he is fed regularly he is only too thankful to anyone who will keep her in good humor for him  hector and as she has all the shotover fascination there is plenty of competition for the job eh  randall angrily she encourages them her conduct is perfectly scandalous i assure you my dear fellow i havent an atom of jealousy in my composition but she makes herself the talk of every place she goes to by her thoughtlessness its nothing more she doesnt really care for the men she keeps hanging about her but how is the world to know that its not fair to hastings its not fair to me  hector her theory is that her conduct is so correct  randall correct she does nothing but make scenes from morning till night you be careful old chap she will get you into trouble that is she would if she really cared for you  hector doesnt she  randall not a scrap she may want your scalp to add to her collection but her true affection has been engaged years ago you had really better be careful  hector do you suffer much from this jealousy  randall jealousy i jealous my dear fellow havent i told you that there is not an atom of  hector yes and lady utterword told me she never made scenes well dont waste your jealousy on my moustache never waste jealousy on a real man it is the imaginary hero that supplants us all in the long run besides jealousy does not belong to your easy manoftheworld pose which you carry so well in other respects  randall really hushabye i think a man may be allowed to be a gentleman without being accused of posing  hector it is a pose like any other in this house we know all the poses our game is to find out the man under the pose the man under your pose is apparently ellies favorite othello  randall some of your games in this house are damned annoying let me tell you  hector yes i have been their victim for many years i used to writhe under them at first but i became accustomed to them at last i learned to play them  randall if its all the same to you i had rather you didnt play them on me you evidently dont quite understand my character or my notions of good form  hector is it your notion of good form to give away lady utterword  randall a childishly plaintive note breaking into his huff i have not said a word against lady utterword this is just the conspiracy over again  hector what conspiracy  randall you know very well sir a conspiracy to make me out to be pettish and jealous and childish and everything i am not everyone knows i am just the opposite  hector rising something in the air of the house has upset you it often does have that effect he goes to the garden door and calls lady utterword with commanding emphasis ariadne  lady utterword at some distance yes  randall what are you calling her for i want to speak  lady utterword arriving breathless yes you really are a terribly commanding person whats the matter  hector i do not know how to manage your friend randall no doubt you do  lady utterword randall have you been making yourself ridiculous as usual i can see it in your face really you are the most pettish creature  randall you know quite well ariadne that i have not an ounce of pettishness in my disposition i have made myself perfectly pleasant here i have remained absolutely cool and imperturbable in the face of a burglar imperturbability is almost too strong a point of mine but putting his foot down with a stamp and walking angrily up and down the room i insist on being treated with a certain consideration i will not allow hushabye to take liberties with me i will not stand your encouraging people as you do  hector the man has a rooted delusion that he is your husband  lady utterword i know he is jealous as if he had any right to be he compromises me everywhere he makes scenes all over the place randall i will not allow it i simply will not allow it you had no right to discuss me with hector i will not be discussed by men  hector be reasonable ariadne your fatal gift of beauty forces men to discuss you  lady utterword oh indeed what about your fatal gift of beauty  hector how can i help it  lady utterword you could cut off your moustache i cant cut off my nose i get my whole life messed up with people falling in love with me and then randall says i run after men  randall i  lady utterword yes you do you said it just now why cant you think of something else than women napoleon was quite right when he said that women are the occupation of the idle man well if ever there was an idle man on earth his name is randall utterword  randall ariad  lady utterword overwhelming him with a torrent of words oh yes you are its no use denying it what have you ever done what good are you you are as much trouble in the house as a child of three you couldnt live without your valet  randall this is  lady utterword laziness you are laziness incarnate you are selfishness itself you are the most uninteresting man on earth you cant even gossip about anything but yourself and your grievances and your ailments and the people who have offended you turning to hector do you know what they call him hector  hector  speaking  please dont tell me randall  together  ill not stand it  lady utterword randall the rotter that is his name in good society  randall shouting ill not bear it i tell you will you listen to me you infernalhe chokes  lady utterword well go on what were you going to call me an infernal what which unpleasant animal is it to be this time  randall foaming there is no animal in the world so hateful as a woman can be you are a maddening devil hushabye you will not believe me when i tell you that i have loved this demon all my life but god knows i have paid for it he sits down in the draughtsmans chair weeping  lady utterword standing over him with triumphant contempt crybaby  hector gravely coming to him my friend the shotover sisters have two strange powers over men they can make them love and they can make them cry thank your stars that you are not married to one of them  lady utterword haughtily and pray hector  hector suddenly catching her round the shoulders swinging her right round him and away from randall and gripping her throat with the other hand ariadne if you attempt to start on me ill choke you do you hear the catandmouse game with the other sex is a good game but i can play your head off at it he throws her not at all gently into the big chair and proceeds less fiercely but firmly it is true that napoleon said that woman is the occupation of the idle man but he added that she is the relaxation of the warrior well i am the warrior so take care  lady utterword not in the least put out and rather pleased by his violence my dear hector i have only done what you asked me to do  hector how do you make that out pray  lady utterword you called me in to manage randall didnt you you said you couldnt manage him yourself  hector well what if i did i did not ask you to drive the man mad  lady utterword he isnt mad thats the way to manage him if you were a mother youd understand  hector mother what are you up to now  lady utterword its quite simple when the children got nerves and were naughty i smacked them just enough to give them a good cry and a healthy nervous shock they went to sleep and were quite good afterwards well i cant smack randall he is too big so when he gets nerves and is naughty i just rag him till he cries he will be all right now look he is half asleep already which is quite true  randall waking up indignantly im not you are most cruel ariadne sentimentally but i suppose i must forgive you as usual he checks himself in the act of yawning  lady utterword to hector is the explanation satisfactory dread warrior  hector some day i shall kill you if you go too far i thought you were a fool  lady utterword laughing everybody does at first but i am not such a fool as i look she rises complacently now randall go to bed you will be a good boy in the morning  randall only very faintly rebellious ill go to bed when i like it isnt ten yet  lady utterword it is long past ten see that he goes to bed at once hector she goes into the garden  hector is there any slavery on earth viler than this slavery of men to women  randall rising resolutely ill not speak to her tomorrow ill not speak to her for another week ill give her such a lesson ill go straight to bed without bidding her goodnight he makes for the door leading to the hall  hector you are under a spell man old shotover sold himself to the devil in zanzibar the devil gave him a black witch for a wife and these two demon daughters are their mystical progeny i am tied to hesiones apronstring but im her husband and if i did go stark staring mad about her at least we became man and wife but why should you let yourself be dragged about and beaten by ariadne as a toy donkey is dragged about and beaten by a child what do you get by it are you her lover  randall you must not misunderstand me in a higher sensein a platonic sense  hector psha platonic sense she makes you her servant and when payday comes round she bilks you that is what you mean  randall feebly well if i dont mind i dont see what business it is of yours besides i tell you i am going to punish her you shall see i know how to deal with women im really very sleepy say goodnight to mrs hushabye for me will you like a good chap goodnight he hurries out  hector poor wretch oh women women women he lifts his fists in invocation to heaven fall fall and crush he goes out into the garden     act iii  in the garden hector as he comes out through the glass door of the poop finds lady utterword lying voluptuously in the hammock on the east side of the flagstaff in the circle of light cast by the electric arc which is like a moon in its opal globe beneath the head of the hammock a campstool on the other side of the flagstaff on the long garden seat captain shotover is asleep with ellie beside him leaning affectionately against him on his right hand on his left is a deck chair behind them in the gloom hesione is strolling about with mangan it is a fine still night moonless  lady utterword what a lovely night it seems made for us  hector the night takes no interest in us what are we to the night he sits down moodily in the deck chair  ellie dreamily nestling against the captain its beauty soaks into my nerves in the night there is peace for the old and hope for the young  hector is that remark your own  ellie no only the last thing the captain said before he went to sleep  captain shotover im not asleep  hector randall is also mr mazzini dunn mangan too probably  mangan no  hector oh you are there i thought hesione would have sent you to bed by this time  mrs hushabye coming to the back of the garden seat into the light with mangan i think i shall he keeps telling me he has a presentiment that he is going to die i never met a man so greedy for sympathy  mangan plaintively but i have a presentiment i really have and you wouldnt listen  mrs hushabye i was listening for something else there was a sort of splendid drumming in the sky did none of you hear it it came from a distance and then died away  mangan i tell you it was a train  mrs hushabye and i tell you alf there is no train at this hour the last is nine fortyfive  mangan but a goods train  mrs hushabye not on our little line they tack a truck on to the passenger train what can it have been hector  hector heavens threatening growl of disgust at us useless futile creatures fiercely i tell you one of two things must happen either out of that darkness some new creation will come to supplant us as we have supplanted the animals or the heavens will fall in thunder and destroy us  lady utterword in a cool instructive manner wallowing comfortably in her hammock we have not supplanted the animals hector why do you ask heaven to destroy this house which could be made quite comfortable if hesione had any notion of how to live dont you know what is wrong with it  hector we are wrong with it there is no sense in us we are useless dangerous and ought to be abolished  lady utterword nonsense hastings told me the very first day he came here nearly twentyfour years ago what is wrong with the house  captain shotover what the numskull said there was something wrong with my house  lady utterword i said hastings said it and he is not in the least a numskull  captain shotover whats wrong with my house  lady utterword just what is wrong with a ship papa wasnt it clever of hastings to see that  captain shotover the mans a fool theres nothing wrong with a ship  lady utterword yes there is  mrs hushabye but what is it dont be aggravating addy  lady utterword guess  hector demons daughters of the witch of zanzibar demons  lady utterword not a bit i assure you all this house needs to make it a sensible healthy pleasant house with good appetites and sound sleep in it is horses  mrs hushabye horses what rubbish  lady utterword yes horses why have we never been able to let this house because there are no proper stables go anywhere in england where there are natural wholesome contented and really nice english people and what do you always find that the stables are the real centre of the household and that if any visitor wants to play the piano the whole room has to be upset before it can be opened there are so many things piled on it i never lived until i learned to ride and i shall never ride really well because i didnt begin as a child there are only two classes in good society in england the equestrian classes and the neurotic classes it isnt mere convention everybody can see that the people who hunt are the right people and the people who dont are the wrong ones  captain shotover there is some truth in this my ship made a man of me and a ship is the horse of the sea  lady utterword exactly how hastings explained your being a gentleman  captain shotover not bad for a numskull bring the man here with you next time i must talk to him  lady utterword why is randall such an obvious rotter he is well bred he has been at a public school and a university he has been in the foreign office he knows the best people and has lived all his life among them why is he so unsatisfactory so contemptible why cant he get a valet to stay with him longer than a few months just because he is too lazy and pleasureloving to hunt and shoot he strums the piano and sketches and runs after married women and reads literary books and poems he actually plays the flute but i never let him bring it into my house if he would onlyshe is interrupted by the melancholy strains of a flute coming from an open window above she raises herself indignantly in the hammock randall you have not gone to bed have you been listening the flute replies pertly how vulgar go to bed instantly randall how dare you the window is slammed down she subsides how can anyone care for such a creature  mrs hushabye addy do you think ellie ought to marry poor alfred merely for his money  mangan much alarmed whats that mrs hushabye are my affairs to be discussed like this before everybody  lady utterword i dont think randall is listening now  mangan everybody is listening it isnt right  mrs hushabye but in the dark what does it matter ellie doesnt mind do you ellie  ellie not in the least what is your opinion lady utterword you have so much good sense  mangan but it isnt right itmrs hushabye puts her hand on his mouth oh very well  lady utterword how much money have you mr mangan  mangan reallyno i cant stand this  lady utterword nonsense mr mangan it all

table you cannot refuse to show your own  mrs hushabye come alf out with it how much  mangan baited out of all prudence well if you want to know i have no money and never had any  mrs hushabye alfred you mustnt tell naughty stories  mangan im not telling you stories im telling you the raw truth  lady utterword then what do you live on mr mangan  mangan travelling expenses and a trifle of commission  captain shotover what more have any of us but travelling expenses for our lifes journey  mrs hushabye but you have factories and capital and things  mangan people think i have people think im an industrial napoleon thats why miss ellie wants to marry me but i tell you i have nothing  ellie do you mean that the factories are like marcuss tigers that they dont exist  mangan they exist all right enough but theyre not mine they belong to syndicates and shareholders and all sorts of lazy goodfornothing capitalists i get money from such people to start the factories i find people like miss dunns father to work them and keep a tight hand so as to make them pay of course i make them keep me going pretty well but its a dogs life and i dont own anything  mrs hushabye alfred alfred you are making a poor mouth of it to get out of marrying ellie  mangan im telling the truth about my money for the first time in my life and its the first time my word has ever been doubted  lady utterword how sad why dont you go in for politics mr mangan  mangan go in for politics where have you been living i am in politics  lady utterword im sure i beg your pardon i never heard of you  mangan let me tell you lady utterword that the prime minister of this country asked me to join the government without even going through the nonsense of an election as the dictator of a great public department  lady utterword as a conservative or a liberal  mangan no such nonsense as a practical business man they all burst out laughing what are you all laughing at  mrs husharye oh alfred alfred  ellie you who have to get my father to do everything for you  mrs hushabye you who are afraid of your own workmen  hector you with whom three women have been playing cat and mouse all the evening  lady utterword you must have given an immense sum to the party funds mr mangan  mangan not a penny out of my own pocket the syndicate found the money they knew how useful i should be to them in the government  lady utterword this is most interesting and unexpected mr mangan and what have your administrative achievements been so far  mangan achievements well i dont know what you call achievements but ive jolly well put a stop to the games of the other fellows in the other departments every man of them thought he was going to save the country all by himself and do me out of the credit and out of my chance of a title i took good care that if they wouldnt let me do it they shouldnt do it themselves either i may not know anything about my own machinery but i know how to stick a ramrod into the other fellows and now they all look the biggest fools going  hector and in heavens name what do you look like  mangan i look like the fellow that was too clever for all the others dont i if that isnt a triumph of practical business what is  hector is this england or is it a madhouse  lady utterword do you expect to save the country mr mangan  mangan well who else will will your mr randall save it  lady utterword randall the rotter certainly not  mangan will your brotherinlaw save it with his moustache and his fine talk  hector yes if they will let me  mangan sneering ah will they let you  hector no they prefer you  mangan very well then as youre in a world where im appreciated and youre not youd best be civil to me hadnt you who else is there but me  lady utterword there is hastings get rid of your ridiculous sham democracy and give hastings the necessary powers and a good supply of bamboo to bring the british native to his senses he will save the country with the greatest ease  captain shotover it had better be lost any fool can govern with a stick in his hand i could govern that way it is not gods way the man is a numskull  lady utterword the man is worth all of you rolled into one what do you say miss dunn  ellie i think my father would do very well if people did not put upon him and cheat him and despise him because he is so good  mangan contemptuously i think i see mazzini dunn getting into parliament or pushing his way into the government weve not come to that yet thank god what do you say mrs hushabye  mrs hushabye oh i say it matters very little which of you governs the country so long as we govern you  hector we who is we pray  mrs hushabye the devils granddaughters dear the lovely women  hector raising his hands as before fall i say and deliver us from the lures of satan  ellie there seems to be nothing real in the world except my father and shakespeare marcuss tigers are false mr mangans millions are false there is nothing really strong and true about hesione but her beautiful black hair and lady utterwords is too pretty to be real the one thing that was left to me was the captains seventh degree of concentration and that turns out to be  captain shotover rum  lady utterword placidly a good deal of my hair is quite genuine the duchess of dithering offered me fifty guineas for this touching her forehead under the impression that it was a transformation but it is all natural except the color  mangan wildly look here im going to take off all my clothes he begins tearing off his coat  lady utterword  in consternation    mr mangan  captain shotover                       whats that  hector                                ha ha do do  ellie                                  please dont  mrs hushabye catching his arm and stopping him alfred for shame are you mad  mangan shame what shame is there in this house lets all strip stark naked we may as well do the thing thoroughly when were about it weve stripped ourselves morally naked well let us strip ourselves physically naked as well and see how we like it i tell you i cant bear this i was brought up to be respectable i dont mind the women dyeing their hair and the men drinking its human nature but its not human nature to tell everybody about it every time one of you opens your mouth i go like this he cowers as if to avoid a missile afraid of what will come next how are we to have any selfrespect if we dont keep it up that were better than we really are  lady utterword i quite sympathize with you mr mangan i have been through it all and i know by experience that men and women are delicate plants and must be cultivated under glass our family habit of throwing stones in all directions and letting the air in is not only unbearably rude but positively dangerous still there is no use catching physical colds as well as moral ones so please keep your clothes on  mangan ill do as i like not what you tell me am i a child or a grown man i wont stand this mothering tyranny ill go back to the city where im respected and made much of  mrs hushabye goodbye alf think of us sometimes in the city think of ellies youth  ellie think of hesiones eyes and hair  captain shotover think of this garden in which you are not a dog barking to keep the truth out  hector think of lady utterwords beauty her good sense her style  lady utterword flatterer think mr mangan whether you can really do any better for yourself elsewhere that is the essential point isnt it  mangan surrendering all right all right im done have it your own way only let me alone i dont know whether im on my head or my heels when you all start on me like this ill stay ill marry her ill do anything for a quiet life are you satisfied now  ellie no i never really intended to make you marry me mr mangan never in the depths of my soul i only wanted to feel my strength to know that you could not escape if i chose to take you  mangan indignantly what do you mean to say you are going to throw me over after my acting so handsome  lady utterword i should not be too hasty miss dunn you can throw mr mangan over at any time up to the last moment very few men in his position go bankrupt you can live very comfortably on his reputation for immense wealth  ellie i cannot commit bigamy lady utterword  mrs hushabye                          bigamy whatever on earth are                                         you talking about ellie  lady utterword exclaiming altogether  bigamy what do you mean miss                                         dunn  mangan                                 bigamy do you mean to say                                         youre married already  hector                                 bigamy this is some enigma  ellie only half an hour ago i became captain shotovers white wife  mrs hushabye ellie what nonsense where  ellie in heaven where all true marriages are made  lady utterword really miss dunn really papa  mangan he told me i was too old and him a mummy  hector quoting shelley       their altar the grassy earth outspreads       and their priest the muttering wind  ellie yes i ellie dunn give my broken heart and my strong sound soul to its natural captain my spiritual husband and second father  she draws the captains arm through hers and pats his hand the captain remains fast asleep  mrs hushabye oh thats very clever of you pettikins very clever alfred you could never have lived up to ellie you must be content with a little share of me  mangan snifflng and wiping his eyes it isnt kindhis emotion chokes him  lady utterword you are well out of it mr mangan miss dunn is the most conceited young woman i have met since i came back to england  mrs hushabye oh ellie isnt conceited are you pettikins  ellie i know my strength now hesione  mangan brazen i call you brazen  mrs hushabye tut tut alfred dont be rude dont you feel how lovely this marriage night is made in heaven arent you happy you and hector open your eyes addy and ellie look beautiful enough to please the most fastidious man we live and love and have not a care in the world we women have managed all that for you why in the name of common sense do you go on as if you were two miserable wretches  captain shotover i tell you happiness is no good you can be happy when you are only half alive i am happier now i am half dead than ever i was in my prime but there is no blessing on my happiness  ellie her face lighting up life with a blessing that is what i want now i know the real reason why i couldnt marry mr mangan there would be no blessing on our marriage there is a blessing on my broken heart there is a blessing on your beauty hesione there is a blessing on your fathers spirit even on the lies of marcus there is a blessing but on mr mangans money there is none  mangan i dont understand a word of that  ellie neither do i but i know it means something  mangan dont say there was any difficulty about the blessing i was ready to get a bishop to marry us  mrs hushabye isnt he a fool pettikins  hector fiercely do not scorn the man we are all fools  mazzini in pyjamas and a richly colored silk dressing gown comes from the house on lady utterwords side  mrs hushabye oh here comes the only man who ever resisted me whats the matter mr dunn is the house on fire  mazzini oh no nothings the matter but really its impossible to go to sleep with such an interesting conversation going on under ones window and on such a beautiful night too i just had to come down and join you all what has it all been about  mrs hushabye oh wonderful things soldier of freedom  hector for example mangan as a practical business man has tried to undress himself and has failed ignominiously whilst you as an idealist have succeeded brilliantly  mazzini i hope you dont mind my being like this mrs hushabye he sits down on the campstool  mrs hushabye on the contrary i could wish you always like that  lady utterword your daughters match is off mr dunn it seems that mr mangan whom we all supposed to be a man of property owns absolutely nothing  mazzini well of course i knew that lady utterword but if people believe in him and are always giving him money whereas they dont believe in me and never give me any how can i ask poor ellie to depend on what i can do for her  mangan dont you run away with this idea that i have nothing i  hector oh dont explain we understand you have a couple of thousand pounds in exchequer bills 50000 shares worth tenpence a dozen and half a dozen tabloids of cyanide of potassium to poison yourself with when you are found out thats the reality of your millions  mazzini oh no no no he is quite honest the businesses are genuine and perfectly legal  hector disgusted yah not even a great swindler  mangan so you think but ive been too many for some honest men for all that  lady utterword there is no pleasing you mr mangan you are determined to be neither rich nor poor honest nor dishonest  mangan there you go again ever since i came into this silly house i have been made to look like a fool though im as good a man in this house as in the city  ellie musically yes this silly house this strangely happy house this agonizing house this house without foundations i shall call it heartbreak house  mrs hushabye stop ellie or i shall howl like an animal  mangan breaks into a low snivelling  mrs husahbye there you have set alfred off  ellie i like him best when he is howling  captain shotover silence mangan subsides into silence i say let the heart break in silence  hector do you accept that name for your house  captain shotover it is not my house it is only my kennel  hector we have been too long here we do not live in this house we haunt it  lady utterword heart torn it is dreadful to think how you have been here all these years while i have gone round the world i escaped young but it has drawn me back it wants to break my heart too but it shant i have left you and it behind it was silly of me to come back i felt sentimental about papa and hesione and the old place i felt them calling to me  mazzini but what a very natural and kindly and charming human feeling lady utterword  lady utterword so i thought mr dunn but i know now that it was only the last of my influenza i found that i was not remembered and not wanted  captain shotover you left because you did not want us was there no heartbreak in that for your father you tore yourself up by the roots and the ground healed up and brought forth fresh plants and forgot you what right had you to come back and probe old wounds  mrs hushabye you were a complete stranger to me at first addy but now i feel as if you had never been away  lady utterword thank you hesione but the influenza is quite cured the place may be heartbreak house to you miss dunn and to this gentleman from the city who seems to have so little selfcontrol but to me it is only a very illregulated and rather untidy villa without any stables  hector inhabited by  ellie a crazy old sea captain and a young singer who adores him  mrs hushabye a sluttish female trying to stave off a double chin and an elderly spread vainly wooing a born soldier of freedom  mazzini oh really mrs hushabye  mangan a member of his majestys government that everybody sets down as a nincompoop dont forget him lady utterword  lady utterword and a very fascinating gentleman whose chief occupation is to be married to my sister  hector all heartbroken imbeciles  mazzini oh no surely if i may say so rather a favorable specimen of what is best in our english culture you are very charming people most advanced unprejudiced frank humane unconventional democratic freethinking and everything that is delightful to thoughtful people  mrs hushabye you do us proud mazzini  mazzini i am not flattering really where else could i feel perfectly at ease in my pyjamas i sometimes dream that i am in very distinguished society and suddenly i have nothing on but my pyjamas sometimes i havent even pyjamas and i always feel overwhelmed with confusion but here i dont mind in the least it seems quite natural  lady utterword an infallible sign that you are now not in really distinguished society mr dunn if you were in my house you would feel embarrassed  mazzini i shall take particular care to keep out of your house lady utterword  lady utterword you will be quite wrong mr dunn i should make you very comfortable and you would not have the trouble and anxiety of wondering whether you should wear your purple and gold or your green and crimson dressinggown at dinner you complicate life instead of simplifying it by doing these ridiculous things  ellie your house is not heartbreak house is it lady utterword  hector yet she breaks hearts easy as her house is that poor devil upstairs with his flute howls when she twists his heart just as mangan howls when my wife twists his  lady utterword that is because randall has nothing to do but have his heart broken it is a change from having his head shampooed catch anyone breaking hastings heart  captain shotover the numskull wins after all  lady utterword i shall go back to my numskull with the greatest satisfaction when i am tired of you all clever as you are  mangan huffily i never set up to be clever  lady utterword i forgot you mr mangan  mangan well i dont see that quite either  lady utterword you may not be clever mr mangan but you are successful  mangan but i dont want to be regarded merely as a successful man i have an imagination like anyone else i have a presentiment  mrs hushabye oh you are impossible alfred here i am devoting myself to you and you think of nothing but your ridiculous presentiment you bore me come and talk poetry to me under the stars she drags him away into the darkness  mangan tearfully as he disappears yes its all very well to make fun of me but if you only knew  hector impatiently how is all this going to end  mazzini it wont end mr hushabye life doesnt end it goes on  ellie oh it cant go on forever im always expecting something i dont know what it is but life must come to a point sometime  lady utterword the point for a young woman of your age is a baby  hector yes but damn it i have the same feeling and i cant have a baby  lady utterword by deputy hector  hector but i have children all that is over and done with for me and yet i too feel that this cant last we sit here talking and leave everything to mangan and to chance and to the devil think of the powers of destruction that mangan and his mutual admiration gang wield its madness its like giving a torpedo to a badly brought up child to play at earthquakes with  mazzini i know i used often to think about that when i was young  hector think whats the good of thinking about it why didnt you do something  mazzini but i did i joined societies and made speeches and wrote pamphlets that was all i could do but you know though the people in the societies thought they knew more than mangan most of them wouldnt have joined if they had known as much you see they had never had any money to handle or any men to manage every year i expected a revolution or some frightful smashup it seemed impossible that we could blunder and muddle on any longer but nothing happened except of course the usual poverty and crime and drink that we are used to nothing ever does happen its amazing how well we get along all things considered  lady utterword perhaps somebody cleverer than you and mr mangan was at work all the time  mazzini perhaps so though i was brought up not to believe in anything i often feel that there is a great deal to be said for the theory of an overruling providence after all  lady utterword providence i meant hastings  mazzini oh i beg your pardon lady utterword  captain shotover every drunken skipper trusts to providence but one of the ways of providence with drunken skippers is to run them on the rocks  mazzini very true no doubt at sea but in politics i assure you they only run into jellyfish nothing happens  captain shotover at sea nothing happens to the sea nothing happens to the sky the sun comes up from the east and goes down to the west the moon grows from a sickle to an arc lamp and comes later and later until she is lost in the light as other things are lost in the darkness after the typhoon the flyingfish glitter in the sunshine like birds its amazing how they get along all things considered nothing happens except something not worth mentioning  ellie what is that o captain o my captain  captain shotover savagely nothing but the smash of the drunken skippers ship on the rocks the splintering of her rotten timbers the tearing of her rusty plates the drowning of the crew like rats in a trap  ellie moral dont take rum  captain shotover vehemently that is a lie child let a man drink ten barrels of rum a day he is not a drunken skipper until he is a drifting skipper whilst he can lay his course and stand on his bridge and steer it he is no drunkard it is the man who lies drinking in his bunk and trusts to providence that i call the drunken skipper though he drank nothing but the waters of the river jordan  ellie splendid and you havent had a drop for an hour you see you dont need it your own spirit is not dead  captain shotover echoes nothing but echoes the last shot was fired years ago  hector and this ship that we are all in this souls prison we call england  captain shotover the captain is in his bunk drinking bottled ditchwater and the crew is gambling in the forecastle she will strike and sink and split do you think the laws of god will be suspended in favor of england because you were born in it  hector well i dont mean to be drowned like a rat in a trap i still have the will to live what am i to do  captain shotover do nothing simpler learn your business as an englishman  hector and what may my business as an englishman be pray  captain shotover navigation learn it and live or leave it and be damned  ellie quiet quiet youll tire yourself  mazzini i thought all that once captain but i assure you nothing will happen  a dull distant explosion is heard  hector starting up what was that  captain shotover something happening he blows his whistle breakers ahead  the light goes out  hector furiously who put that light out who dared put that light out  nurse guinness running in from the house to the middle of the esplanade i did sir the police have telephoned to say well be summoned if we dont put that light out it can be seen for miles  hector it shall be seen for a hundred miles he dashes into the house  nurse guinness the rectory is nothing but a heap of bricks they say unless we can give the rector a bed he has nowhere to lay his head this night  captain shotover the church is on the rocks breaking up i told him it would unless it headed for gods open sea  nurse guinness and you are all to go down to the cellars  captain shotover go there yourself you and all the crew batten down the hatches  nurse guinness and hide beside the coward i married ill go on the roof first the lamp lights up again there mr hushabyes turned it on again  the burglar hurrying in and appealing to nurse guinness here wheres the way to that gravel pit the bootboy says theres a cave in the gravel pit them cellars is no use wheres the gravel pit captain  nurse guinness go straight on past the flagstaff until you fall into it and break your dirty neck she pushes him contemptuously towards the flagstaff and herself goes to the foot of the hammock and waits there as it were by ariadnes cradle  another and louder explosion is heard the burglar stops and stands trembling  ellie rising that was nearer  captain shotover the next one will get us he rises stand by all hands for judgment  the burglar oh my lordy god he rushes away frantically past the flagstaff into the gloom  mrs hushabye emerging panting from the darkness who was that running away she comes to ellie did you hear the explosions and the sound in the sky its splendid its like an orchestra its like beethoven  ellie by thunder hesione it is beethoven  she and hesione throw themselves into one anothers arms in wild excitement the light increases  mazzini anxiously the light is getting brighter  nurse guinness looking up at the house its mr hushabye turning on all the lights in the house and tearing down the curtains  randall rushing in in his pyjamas distractedly waving a flute ariadne my soul my precious go down to the cellars i beg and implore you go down to the cellars  lady utterword quite composed in her hammock the governors wife in the cellars with the servants really randall  randall but what shall i do if you are killed  lady utterword you will probably be killed too randall now play your flute to show that you are not afraid and be good play us keep the home fires burning  nurse guinness grimly theyll keep the home fires burning for us them up there  randall having tried to play my lips are trembling i cant get a sound  mazzini i hope poor mangan is safe  mrs hushabye he is hiding in the cave in the gravel pit  captain shotover my dynamite drew him there it is the hand of god  hector returning from the house and striding across to his former place there is not half light enough we should be blazing to the skies  ellie tense with excitement set fire to the house marcus  mrs hushabye my house no  hector i thought of that but it would not be ready in time  captain shotover the judgment has come courage will not save you but it will show that your souls are still live  mrs hushabye shsh listen do you hear it now its magnificent  they all turn away from the house and look up listening  hector gravely miss dunn you can do no good here we of this house are only moths flying into the candle you had better go down to the cellar  ellie scornfully i dont think  mazzini ellie dear there is no disgrace in going to the cellar an officer would order his soldiers to take cover mr hushabye is behaving like an amateur mangan and the burglar are acting very sensibly and it is they who will survive  ellie let them i shall behave like an amateur but why should you run any risk  mazzini think of the risk those poor fellows up there are running  nurse guinness think of them indeed the murdering blackguards what next  a terrific explosion shakes the earth they reel back into their seats or clutch the nearest support they hear the falling of the shattered glass from the windows  mazzini is anyone hurt  hector where did it fall  nurse guinness in hideous triumph right in the gravel pit i seen it serve un right i seen it she runs away towards the gravel pit laughing harshly  hector one husband gone  captain shotover thirty pounds of good dynamite wasted  mazzini oh poor mangan  hector are you immortal that you need pity him our turn next  they wait in silence and intense expectation hesione and ellie hold each others hand tight  a distant explosion is heard  mrs hushabye relaxing her grip oh they have passed us  lady utterword the danger is over randall go to bed  captain shotover turn in all hands the ship is safe he sits down and goes asleep  ellie disappointedly safe  hector disgustedly yes safe and how damnably dull the world has become again suddenly he sits down  mazzini sitting down i was quite wrong after all it is we who have survived and mangan and the burglar  hector the two burglars  lady utterword the two practical men of business  mazzini both gone and the poor clergyman will have to get a new house  mrs hushabye but what a glorious experience i hope theyll come again tomorrow night  ellie radiant at the prospect oh i hope so  randall at last succeeds in keeping the home fires burning on his flute
