 part i     the spirit of sweetwater  chapter i   one spring day a young man of good mental furnishing and very slender purse walked over the shoulder of mount mogallon and down the trail to gold creek he walked because the stage fare seemed too high  two years and four months later he was pointed out to strangers by the people of sweetwater springs that is richard clement the sole owner of the witch a mine valued at three millions of dollars this in itself was truly an epic  sweetwater springs was a village in a cañon out of which rose two wonderful springs of water whose virtues were known throughout the land the village was wedged in the cañon which ran to the mighty breast of mogallon like a fold in a kings robe  the village and its life centered around the pavilion which roofed the spring and clement spent his evenings there in order to see the people at least as they joyously thronged about the musicstand and sipped the beautiful water which the utes long long ago called sweet water and visited with reverence and hope of returning health  since the coming of his great wealth clement had not allowed himself a days vacation and he had grown ten years older in that time there were untimely signs of age in his hair and in the troubled lines of his face he was a young man but he looked a strong and stern and careworn man to those whose attention was called to him he was a conscientious man and the possession of great wealth was not without its gravities  for the first time he felt it safe to leave his mine in other hands he had a longing to mix with his kind once more and in his heart was the secret hope that somewhere among the women of the springs he might find a girl to take to wife he arranged his vacation for july not because it was ever hot at the creek but because he knew the springs swarmed at that time with girls from the states it would have troubled him had any one put these ideas into words and accused him of really seeking a bride  he was a selfunconscious man naturally and he hardly realized yet how widely his name had gone as the possessor of millions he supposed himself an unnoticed atom as he stood at the spring on the second night of his stay in the village of a certainty many did not know him but they saw him for he was a striking figurea handsome figurethough that had never concerned him he was in fact feeling his own insignificance  he was standing there in shadow looking out somberly upon the streams of people as they came to take their evening draught at the wonderful water of the effervescing spring the sun had gone behind the high peaks to the west and a delicious dry coolness was in the cañon  it seemed to clement to be a very fashionable and leisurely throngso long had he been absent from people either modish or easeful he felt himself to be hopelessly outside all this youth and brilliancy and merriment and he looked upon it all with a certain wistfulness  he perceived at length that the strollers were not all of the same conditions there were rough brown cowboys from la junta and cajon and miners in rough dress down from the gulches for a night but mainly the promenaders appealed to him with elegance of dress and manner  many of the ladies came without hats which added to the charm of their eyes and hair some of them looked twice at the tall man with the big mustache and broad hat who seemed to be watching for some tardy friend  as he studied them his memory freshened and he came to understand them better he analyzed them into familiar types this was a banker and his wife from some small townthe wife fussy and consequential the husband coldly dignified this group was composed of a doctor and his daughters behind them came a merchant from some nebraska townhe rough of exterior his children dainty of dress and very pretty occasionally a group of collegebred girls came up without escortalert selfhelpful and serene they saw clement at once and studied him carefully as they drank their beauty cup at the circular bench before the spring all goodlooking men had interest to them  all classes came a varied stream yet they were western and of the welltodo condition for the larger part  the deft boy swung the glasses of water on his tripartite dipper with ceaseless splash and clink there was a pleasant murmur of talk in which an eastern listener would have heard the r sound welldefined there were many couples seated about the pavilion on the benches and railings it was all busy yet tranquil each loiterer had fed had taken his draught of healing waterand this was the hour of pleasant gossip and repose clement fell at last to analyzing the action of the boy who supplied the water at the pool he slammed the glasses into the pool and set them on the bench with a click as regular as a pump occasionally however he was indifferent with some of his customers he handled the glasses as if they contained nectar thus indicating his generous patrons once he stopped and dipped the glass into the pool with his own handa doubtful actionand extended it with a bow to a young lady who said thank you so sweetly that he blushed and stammered in reply  all this fixed clements attention and as the young girl lifted the glass in her slim hand he wondered how she had escaped his notice for a single moment a woman at his side said sighfully there is that consumptive girl again she hasnt long to stay she was as pale as fragile and as lovely as the mountain columbine her face was thin and her head shapely but her eyes they burned like rarest topazdeep dark and sad clement shivered as he felt them fixed upon him and yet he could not turn away as he should have done  he gazed at her with a sudden feeling which was not awe nor compassion nor love but was all of these he felt in his soul the subtlest sadness in all the worldthe sadness of a strong man who looks upon a beautiful young girl who is dying  extremest languor was in every movement she was dressed in dark soft garmentsvery simple and graceful in effect and her bearing was that of one accustomed to willing service from others her smile was as sad as her eyes which had in them the deathshadow  clements action the unwavering selfforgetful intentness of his look arrested her attention and she returned his gaze for an instant and then turned away and took the arm of an elderly gentleman who stood beside her she moved slowly as an invalid walks when for the first time she is permitted a short walk in the outdoor air leaning heavily on her companion  the big miner roused himself and stood straight and tall hesitating whether to follow or nota sudden singular pain in his heart as if he were losing something very close to his life  he obeyed the impulse to follow and moved down the path just out of reach of observation he fancied as he made way through the crowd he grew aware again of his heavy limbs of his great height of his swinging useless hands it had been so long since he had mingled with a holiday company he appeared as selfconscious as a boy  once the fair invalid turned and looked back but she was too far away for him to discern the expression of her face he was not possessed of selfesteem enough to believe she had turned to look for him  he followed them in their slow pace till they turned in at the doorway of the principal hotel of the village they entered at the ladies door while he kept on to the main entrance and rotunda there was no elevator in the house and the invalid paused a moment before attempting the stairway it was pitiful to see her effort to make light of it all to her companion who was quite evidently her father she smiled at him even while she pressed one slim hand against her bosom  clement longed to take her in his arms and carry her up the stairwayit seemed the thing most worth doing in all the worldbut he could only lean against the desk and see them go slowly stair by stair out of sight  who are they he asked of the clerk whom he detected also watching them with almost the same breathless interest  chicago merchant g b ross thats his daughter shes pretty far goneconsumption i reckon it looks tough to see a girl like that go off youd think now  clement did not remain to hear the clerk moralize further he went immediately to his own hotel paid his bill and ordered his baggage sent to the other house he wondered at himself for this overpowering interest in a sick girl and at his plan to see her again  he reasoned that he would be able to see her at breakfast time provided she came down to breakfast and provided he hit upon the same hour of eating he began to calculate upon the probable hour when she would come down it was astounding how completely she occupied his thought already  he struck off up the cañon where no sound was other than the roar of the wild little stream which seemed to lift its voice in wilder clamor as the night fell its presence helped him to think out his situation he had grown selfanalytical during his life in the camp where he was alone so far as his finer feelings were concerned and he had come to believe in many strange things which he said nothing about to any friend he had  he had come to believe in fate and also in intuition a powerful impulse to do he counted higher than reason that is to say if he had a powerful impulse to run a shaft in a certain direction he would so act no matter if his reason declared dead against it the hidden and uncontrollable processes of his mind had given him the secret of the witchs gold had led him right in his shafting and in his selection of friends and assistantsand had made him a millionaire at thirtyseven years of age he was prone to overvalue the intuitional side of his nature probablyan error common among practical men  fate was with him luck raised to a higher power what was to be would be the unexpected happened the expected hoped for labored for did not always happen all around him men stumbled upon mines while other men more skilful more observant failed the luck was against them  it was quite in harmony with his nature that he should be absorbed in the singular and powerful impulse he had to seek an acquaintance with that poor dying girl  dying at that word he rebelled god would not take so beautiful a creature away from earth men needed her to teach them gentleness and submission more than this he had an almost uncontrollable impulse to go to her and putting aside doctors say to her  i am the one to heal you  he had never had an impulse to heal before but the fact that it was unaccountable and powerful and definite fitted in with his successes he gave it careful thought it must mean something because it had never come to him before and because it rose out of the mysterious depths of his brain  she must not die the wind the mountains the clear air the good sweet water the fragrant pines the splendid sunthese things must help her and i perhaps i too can help her  back in the glare of the hotel rotunda with its rows of bored men sitting stolidly smoking idly talking his impulse and his resolution seemed very unmanly and preposterous it is so easy to lose faith in the elemental in the midst of the superficial and ephemeral of daily habit     chapter ii   clement was an early riser and notwithstanding his restless night was astir at six the whole world had changed for him it was no longer a question of ore and amalgams it was a question of when he should see again that sad slender woman with the hopeless smile  he had now a great fear that she would not be able to come down to breakfast at all but as her coming was his only hope of seeing her he clung to it eight oclock seemed to him to be the latest hour that any one not absolutely bedridden would think of breakfasting and at four minutes past the hour he entered the diningroom  the negro waiter tried to seat him near the door but he pushed on down the hall toward a little group near one of the sunny windows which he took to be the sick girl and her father and so it proved  his seat at a table next to theirs brought her profile between him and the window and the light around her head seemed to glorify her till she shone like a figure in a church window she seemed not concerned with earth he was more deeply moved than ever before in his life but he concealed itthe only sign of emotion was in the tremor of his hands  he studied the sick girl as closely as he could without seeming to stare she was even more lovely than he had thought his eyes accustomed only to rough women found in her beauty that which was flowerlike seraphic  her face was very thin and her neck too slender to uphold the heavy masses of her brown hair her hands were only less expressive of suffering than her face the father was as bluff and portly and irascible as she was patient and gentle he bullied the waiter because he did not know how else to express his anxiety  waiter this steak is burnedits hard as sole leather take it back and bring me  please dont father the trouble is with me i have no desire for food she smiled at the waiter so sweetly that he nodded as if to say i dont mind him miss  the father turned his attention to the country  yes there is another fraud i was told it would help your appetite and here you are with less than when you left hot springs if id had my way  she laid a hand on his arm and when he turned toward her his eyes were dim with tears he blew his nose and coughed and looked away after the manner of men and suffered in silence  once she turned and looked at clement and her eyes had a mystical impersonal look as though she saw him afar off not as an individual but as a type of some admirable elemental creature he could not fathom her attitude toward him but he thought he saw in her every action the expression of a soul that had relinquished its hold on things of the earth her desire to live was no longer personal she did all that she did for her father and her friends wholly to please them  the desire to aid her came upon clement againso powerful it carried with it an unwavering belief that he could help her  what was his newlyacquired wealth good for if he could not aid her wealth yeshis blood he looked at his great brown hand and at his big veins full of blood why should she die when he had so much life  meanwhile his common sense had not entirely fled him he perceived that they were not poor and he reflected that they had probably tried all climates and all the resources of medical science also that the father had quite as much red blood in his veins as any other man and these considerations gave him thought as he watched them rise and go out upon the little veranda  clement was not a markedly humble person under ordinary conditions he had a fashion of pushing rather heedlessly straight to his purposewhich now was to speak to her to meet her face to face to touch her hand and to offer his aid naturally he sought the fathers acquaintance first this was not difficult for the waiters in the diningroom had been pointing him out to the guests as mr clement the meyonaire minah the newspaper correspondents had made his name a familiar one to the whole united states as one of the sudden multimillionaires of gold creek  the porter had passed the word to the head waiter and the head waiter had whispered it to one or two others it was almost as exciting as having a presidential candidate enter the room clement was too new in his riches however to realize the extent of all this bustle about him  when he rose to go one waiter removed his chair another helped him lay his napkin down a third brushed his coat and the head usher kindly showed him where the door opened into the hallway it was wonderful to clement but he laid it to the management of the hotel  there were limits to his insanity and he did not follow the girl out on the veranda but when mr ross came down a few minutes later to get a cigar clement plucked the proprietor of the hotel by the arm  introduce me to mr ross wont you  the landlord beamed certainly mr clement he took mr ross by the lapel familiarly ah goodmorning mr ross mr ross let me introduce my friend mr clement mr clement you may have heard of as the owner of the witch and the old wisconse  mr ross shook hands he was not exactly uncivil but he was coolvery cool i have heard of mr clement he said he softened a little as he got a good look at the powerful cleareyed young fellow  the landlord expanded like one who has accomplished a good deed i thought so i thought so mr clement let me say is a square business man whatever he offers you is worth the price he winked at clement as he turned away  clement began i beg your pardon mr ross for taking this liberty but i wanted to know you and took the first chance that offered i have no mine to selli want to know youthats all i wanted to meet somebody outside the mining interest i saw you and your daughter at the pavilion last night she seems to be notvery strong he hesitated in his attempt to describe his impression of her  the fathers theme was touched upon now no poor girl she is in bad condition but i think shes better the air seems not to have made her worse at any rate i havent much faith in climate but i believe she has improved since we left kansas city and began to rise  he had a marvelous listener in clement and they consumed three cigars apiece while he told of the doctors he had tried and of the different kinds of air and water they had sought  his eyes were wet and his voice was tremulous  the fact is mr clement she dont seem to care about livingthats what scares me shes just as sweet and lovely as an angel she responds to any suggestion very well papa but i can see she does it for me she herself has lost all hope it aint even thatshe has lost care about it she is indifferent she is going away from me just because i cant rouse her  he frankly broke down and stopped and clement felt his throat swell too tight for speech at the moment  they sat for a time in silence at last clement said  mr ross you dont know me except as a lucky manbut i have a favor to ask it is to meet your daughter  there was something very winning in the young mans voice and manner and mr ross could see no objection to it and it might interest ellice to meet this man who had stumbled upon a gold mine very well suppose we go up now he said almost without hesitation  the girl was alone seated in an easychair in the sunher head only in shadow the father spoke in a low and very tender voice ellice i want to present mr clement mr clement my daughter ellice  the impossible had come to pass as clement bent down and took her hand and looked into her eyes his heart seemed to stop deathstill for a few secondsthen something new and inexplicable took possession of him and he stood before her calm and cleareyed dont move he commanded i will draw a chair near you  mr ross said they had been having a long talk and she listened smiling the while that hopeless smile then the father rose and said where is aunt sarah i want to go down to the telegraph office  the girl spoke in the quiet tranquil voice of one to whom such things have no importance i dont know papa a moment ago she was saying something to me and now she is gone that is all i know never mind shell be here in a moment  ill be back in ten minutes  i am all right papa if i need anything mr clement can call aunt  there was a pause after mr ross went then she added in the same gentle emotionless way poor papa he is a martyr to me he thinks he must sit by me always i think he fears i may die while he is gone  clement leaned forward till his eyes were on a level with those of the girl and his voice was very calm and penetrating as he said  what can i do for you miss ross i have the profoundest conviction that i can do you good  a startled look came into the big brown eyes she looked at him as a babe might striving to comprehend  he went on here i am a millionaire a strong young manwhat can i do for you  i think i understand you she said slowly its very good of you but you can do nothing  it is impossible he broke forth in answer and his voice gave her a perceptible shock there must be something i can do if it will help you there is my armits blood is yours he stammered a little it isnt right that one so young and beautiful should die we wont let you die there must be something i can do this wind and sunand the good water will work with us to do you good  his voice moved her and she smiled with the tears on her lashes it does me good just to look at you you are so big and brown i saw you at the spring last night perhaps i have come at last she cougheda weak flat sound which made him shudder  she tried to reassure him really i have coughed less than at any time during the last five months  he faced her again miss ross i felt last night a sudden desire to help you i believed i had the power to help youi dont know whyim not a healer he smiled for the first time but i felt perfectly sure i could do you good i feel that way now i never had such a feeling toward any person before it is just as strange to me as it is to you  she was looking at him now with musing eyes  that is the curious part of it she said it doesnt seem strange at all it seems as if i had been wanting to hear your voiceas if i had known of you all my life she tried to suppress her coughing and he was in agony during the paroxysm the nurse came hurrying out and while he waited at one side clement felt that if he could have taken her by the hands he could have prevented it it was a singular conviction but it was most definite and had a peculiar air of actuality  when she lay quiet he approached again and said ill go now i must not tire you but remember im going to come and see you and im going to do you good every time i see you i am going to will to you some of my vitalitymy love of life for i love lifeit is beautiful to live  she gave him her hand and he bowed and left her  she lay quietly after he went away and smiled a little wan smile which made her pallor the more pitiful it was all so romantic and wonderfulthis big mans coming he was so unspoiled and so direct of manner she had the hope he would come again and it seemed not impossible that he might help her his voice was so stirring and his hands so big and strong  yet she was beyond the reach of even the conjectures of passion she had come to a certain exterior resignation to her fate the world had lost its poignant interestit was now a pageant upon which she was looking for the last time yet she was too tired too indifferent to lift her hand to stay it in its course even had it been within her power  at times however she rebelled at her fate there were hours even yet when she lay alone in her bed hearing her fathers regular stertorous breathing till a great wave of longing to live swept upon her and she was forced to turn her face to her pillow to stifle her mingled coughing and sobbing  oh father let me live i want to live like other women oh dear father grant me a little life  these waves of passionate rebellion left her weaker sadder more indifferent than ever and as coldly pallid almost as if death had already claimed her  on the night following clements talk with her she fell asleep while musing upon one minds influence upon another perhaps if she could only believe she might be helped perhaps he was sent to help her it had been long since such a personality had stood before herindeed no such man had ever touched her hand or looked into her eyes  he came down out of the mountain heights with the elemental vigor of wind and sun and soil about him like an aura a man of great natural refinement he had grown strong and simple and masterful in his close contact with nature the clay that might have brutalized another nature had made him a mystic  there was something mysterious in his eyes in the clasp of his hand the world was all inexplicable to her anyhow perhaps god had sent him to help her just as he sends healing water down from the mountain peaks  in thinking these things she fell asleep and it seemed at once that she was well again and that she was dressing for a walk clement had called for her to climb the mountains with him and she was making preparation to go working swiftly and unhesitatinglyand it seemed deliciously sweet to be swift and active once more she had put on a short walkingskirt and leggins and was nearly ready she stood before the glass to put on her cap and as she saw how round and pink her cheeks were she hardly recognized herself  she seemed to hear his impatient feet outside on the veranda and she smiled to think how typical it all was of husbands and wivesand at that thought her face grew pinker and she turned awayshe didnt want her own eyes to see how she flushed  but suddenly all warmthall flushingleft her she turned cold with a familiar creep and weakness she could not proceed her glove was half on but her strength was not sufficient to pull it further she could not lift her feet  his steady strong tramp up and down the veranda continued but she was in the grasp of her old enemy a terrible fear and an agony of desire seized her she wanted to go out into the bright sunlight with him but she could neither move nor whisper all her resolution her hope fell away and her heart was heavy and cold it was all over he would wait for a while and then go away and she would stand there desolate helpless inert as clay with life dark and empty before her  oh if he would only call me was her last breath of resolution  once twice the feet went up and down the veranda then they paused before her door  are you ready his voice called  she struggled to speak but could only whisper yes  the door swung quickly open and he stood there in the streaming sunlight of the morningso tall he was he seemed to fill the doorwayand he smiled and extended his hands  come he said the sturdy old mountains are wonderfully grand this morning  his hand closed over hers and the sunlight fell upon her warming her to the heart but before she could lift her eyes to the shining peaks she awoke and found that the morning sun had stolen its way through a halfopened shutter and lay upon her hand  at first she was ready to weep with sadness and despair but as she thought upon it she came to see in the dream a good omen it had been long since she had dreamed a vision of perfect health with no touch of impotence at its close there was something of hope in this vision a mans hand had broken the spell of weakness     part ii     april days       days of witchery subtly sweet     when every hill and tree finds heart     when winter and spring like lovers meet     in the mist of noon and part         in the april days      nights when the woodfrogs faintly peep     treep treepand then are still     and the woodpeckers martial voices sweep     like bugleblasts from hill to hill         through the breathless haze      days when the soil is warm with rain     and through the wood the shy wind steals     rich with the pine and the poplar smell     and the joyous soul like a dancer reels         through the broadening days                 from prairie songs     chapter i   this dream gave to clement in ellices eyes a glamour of mystery and powerbeyond the subtlety of words and she met him in a spirit of awe and wonder such as a child might feel to find one of its dreamheroes actually beside the fireside in the full sunlight of the morning the fear and agony and joy of the nights vision gave a singular charm to the meeting  it startled her to find she still retained the capability of being moved by the sound of a mans voice it seemed like a wave of returning life  her heart quickened as she saw him enter the diningroom and look around for herand when his eyes fell upon her a light filled his face which was akin to the morning she did not attempt to analyze the emotion thus revealed but she could not help seeing that he looked the embodiment of health and happiness  he wore a suit of light brown corduroy with laced miners boots and they became him very well  he smiled down at her as he drew near  you are better this morning i can see that  it was exactly as if he knew of her dream and that the walk had been actual and a flush of pink crept into her faceso faint it was no one noticed itwhile it seemed to her that her cheeks were scarlet what magic was this which made her flushshe whom death had claimed as his own  mr ross invited clement to sit with them as she hoped he would clement had indeed intended to force the invitation im going for a gallop this morning he said in explanation of his dress i wish you could go too he added addressing ellice  mr ross introduced him to the elderly woman mr clement let me present you to my sister miss ross  miss ross was plump like her brother and a handsome woman but irritable like him she complained also of the altitude and of the chill shadows neither father nor aunt formed a suitable companion for the sick girl  clement was the antidote his whole manner of treatment was of the hopeful buoyant sort he spoke of the magnificent weather of the mountains of the purity of the water  after i get back from my ride i wish youd let me come and talk with you perhaps he added youll be able to walk a little way with me  he made the breakfast almost cheerful by his presence and went away saying  ill be back by ten oclock and i shall expect to find you ready for a walk  miss ross was astonished both at his assurance and at ellices singular interest and apparent acquiescence  well that is a most extraordinary man i wonder if thats the western way  i wish i were able to do as he says the girl said quietly the old people looked up in astonishment  aunt sarah i want you to help me dress im going to try to walk a little  not with that man the aunt inquired in protest  yes aunt her voice was vibrant with fixed purpose  but think how you would look leaning on his arm  auntie dear i have gone long past that point it doesnt matter how it looks i cannot live merely to please the world he has asked me and if i can i will go  mr ross broke in why of course what harm can it do id let her lean on the arm of cherokee bill if she wanted to they all smiled at this and he added the trouble has been she didnt want to do anything at all and now she shall do what she likes  it all seemed very coarse and common now and she could not tell them the secret of the dream that had so impressed her and of her growing faith that this strong man could help her back to health and life she only smiled in her slow faint way and made preparation to go with him who meant so much to her  he met her on the veranda in a handsome prince albert suit of gray with a broadbrimmed gray hat to match he looked like some of the pictures of western congressmen she had seen only more refined and gentle he wore his coat unbuttoned and it had the effect of draping his tall erect frame and the hat suited well with the large lines of his nose and chin it seemed to her she had never seen a more striking and picturesque figure  ill carry you down the stairs if youll say the word he said as they paused a moment at the topmost step  oh no i can walk if you will give me time  time time is money i cant afford it he stooped and lifted her in his right arm and before she could protest he was half way down the stairway he laughed at the horrified face of the aunt he was following impulses now as they walked side by side slowlyshe not without considerable effortup toward the spring he said abruptly but tenderly  you must think youre betterthats half the battle see that stream some day im going to show you where it starts do you know if you drink of that water up at its source above timberline it will cure you  she saw his intent and said im afraid ill be cured before i get to the spring  im going to make it my aim in life to see you drink at that pool his directness and simplicity stimulated her like some mediæval elixir he made her forget her pain they did not talk much until they were seated on one of the benches near the fountain  sit in the sun he commanded dont be afraid of the sun you hear people talk about the suns rays breeding disease the sun never does that it gives life beware of the shadow he added and she knew he meant her mental indifference they had a long talk on the bench he told her of his family of himself  you see he said father had only a small business though he managed to educate me and later my brother but when he died it had less value for i couldnt hold the trade he had and times were harder i kept brother at college during his last two years and when he came out i gave the business to him and got out he was about to marry and the business wouldnt support us both i was always inclined to adventure anyway gold creek was in everybodys mouth so i came here  oh that was a wonderful time the walk across the mountains was like a story to me i liked the newness of everything in the camp it was glorious to hear the hammers ringing and see the new pine buildings going upand the tent and shanties it was rough here then but i had little to do with that i staked out my claim and went to digging i knew very little about mining but they were striking it all around me and so i kept on besideshere he looked at her in a curiously shy wayive always had a superstition that just when things were worst with me they were soonest to turn to the best so i dug away my tunnel went into the hill on a slight upraise and i could do the work alone you see i had so little money i didnt want to waste a cent  but it all went at last for powder and the sharpening of picks and for assayingtill one morning in august i found myself without money and without food  he paused there and his face grew dark with remembered despair and she shuddered  it must be terrible to be without food and money  no one knows what it means till he experiences it i worked all day without food it seemed as if i must strike it then besides i took a sort of morbid pleasure in abusing myselfas if i were to blame i had been living on canned beans and flapjacks and coffee without milk or sugar and i was weak and sickbut it all had to end about four oclock i dropped my pick and staggered out to the light it was impossible to do anything more  there were tears in her eyes now for his voice unconsciously took on the anguish of that despair  i sat there looking out toward the mountains and down on the camp the blasts were booming from all hillsthe men were going home with their dinnerpails flashing red in the setting suns light it was terrible to think of them going home to supper it seemed impossible that i should be sitting there starving and the grass so green the sunset so beautiful i can see it all now as it looked then the old sangre de christo range it was like a wall of glistening marble that night  well i sat there till my hunger gnawed me into action then i staggered down the trail i saw how foolish i had been to go on day after day hoping hoping until the last cent was gone i hadnt money enough to pay the extra postage on a letter which was at the office the clerk gave me the letter and paid the shortage himself the letter was from my sister telling me how peaceful and plentiful life was at home and it made me crazy she asked me how many nuggets i had found you can judge how that hurt me i reeled down the street for i must eat or die i knew that  oh how horrible the girl said softly  there was one eatinghouse at which i always took my supper it was kept by an irish woman a big hearty woman whose husband was a prospectoror had been biddy kellys was famous for its home cooking i went by the door twice for i couldnt bring myself to go in and ask for a meal you dont know how hard that isits very queer if a man has money he can ask for credit or a meal but if he is broke hell starve first i could see biddy waiting on the tablesthe smell that came out was the most delicious yet tantalizing odor of beefstewit made me faint with hunger  his voice grew weak and his throat dry as he spoke  when i did enter dan looked up and said respectfully goodevenin mr clement and i felt so ashamed of my errand i turned to run everything whirled thenand when i got my bearings again dan had me on one arm and biddy was holding a bowl of soup to my lips  the girl sighed oh she was good wasnt she  they fed me for they could see i was starving and i told them about the mineand well some way i got them to grubstake me that night  what is that  that is they agreed to furnish me food and money for tools and share in profits dan went to work with me and do you know it ended in ruining them both we organized a company called the biddy mining company i was president and dan was vicepresident and biddy was treasurer biddy kept us going by her eatinghouse but eventually we wanted machinery and we mortgaged the eatinghouse and the money went into that hole in the ground but i knew we would succeed i could hear voices call me come comewhenever i was alone i could hear them plainly  his eyes turned upon her were full of mystery  i have always felt the stir of life around me in the dark and there in that mineafter we struck the spring of wateri thought i heard voices all the time in the plash of the water i suppose it seemed like insanity for i ruined dan and biddy without mercy i couldnt stop i was sure if we could only hold out a little while we would reach it but we didnt biddy had to go to work as a cook and dan and i went out to try to borrow some money i couldnt bear to let in somebody else after all the heat and toil dan and biddy and i had endured but it had to be done we took in a fellow from iowa by the name of eldred and went to work again  one day after our blast i was the first to enter and the moment that i saw the heap of rock i knew we had opened the vein my wildest dreams were realized  and then your troubles ended the girl said tenderly  nofor now a strange thing happened the assayer tried our ore again and again and found it very rich but when we shipped to the mills we got almost no returns we tried every process but the gold seemed to slip away from us finally i took a carload and went with it to see what was the matter i followed it till it came out on the platesthat is where they catch the gold by the use of quicksilver spread on copper platesand it seemed all right i scraped some of it up and put it into a small vial to take home with me when i got home the company assembled to hear my report and when i took out the amalgam to show it to them it had turned to a queer yellowgreen liquid i was astounded but dan and biddy crossed themselves its witchs gold biddy said dan have no more to do with it and witchs gold it was they gave up right there and went back to work in the camp eldred cursed me for getting him into it and so they left me to fight it out alone i was like a monomaniaci never thought of giving up i begged a little money from my brother and bought in all the stock of the biddy mining company and went to work to solve the mystery of the amalgam i was a good pupil in chemistry at college and i put my whole life and brain into that mystery and i solved it i found a way to treat it so all the gold was saved that made me rich i called the mine the witch and it has made me what you see  it is like a fairy tale what became of your faithful friends dan and biddy  i made dan my foreman of the mine and i built an eatinghouse and hotel for biddy they are with me yet eldred i bought out on the same terms as the rest  he had a sudden sensation of heat in his face as he passed the chasm between the withdrawal of dan and biddy from the firm and his solution of the amalgam he did not care to dwell upon that because eldred had sued him to recover his stock claiming that it was bought in under false pretenses neither did he care to enter into the stormy time which followed the sudden leap of the witch from a haunted hole in the ground to a cave of diamonds he hurried on to the end while she listened in absorbed interest like a child to a wonder story  she sighed in the worldold manner of women and said  and ii have done nothing worth telling i ruined my health by careless living at school and here i am a cumberer of the earth  some men would have hastened to be complimentary but clement remained silent he was trying to understand her mood that he might meet it in a helpful way  but if i am permitted to live i shall be different i will do something  first of all get well he said and his words had the force of a command give me your hand  she complied and he took it in a firm clasp now i want you to promise me youll turn your mind from darkness to the light from the cañons to the peaksthat you will determine to live do you promise  i promise  very well i shall see that you keep that promise     chapter ii   it was rather curious to see that as she grew in strength clement lost in assertivenessin his feeling of command he began to comprehend that with returning health the girl was not altogether pitiable she had culture social position and wealth  the distinction of his readilyacquired millions grew to be a very poor possession in his own mindin fact he came at last to such selfconfessed utter poverty of mind and body that he wondered at her continued toleration he ceased to plead any special worthiness on his own part and began to throw himself on her mercy  as the time came on when she no longer needed his arm for support he found it hard to offer it as an act of gallantry in fact in that small act was typified the change which he came ultimately to assume at first she had seemed to him like an angelic child deaths shadows had made him boldbut now he could not deceive himself he was coming to love her in a very human and definite fashion he dared not refer to the past in any way and his visits grew more and more formal and carefully accounted for  she thought she understood all this and was serenely untroubled by it she brooded over the problem with dreamful lips and halfshut eyes she was drifting back to life on a current of mountain air companioned by splendid clouds and her content was like to the lotuseaters languorit held no thought of time or tide  that she idealized him was true but he grew richly in grace all the small amenities of conduct which he once possessed came back to him he studied to please her and succeeded in that as in his other ventures he did not exactly abandon his business but he came to superintend his superintendents  however he attached a telephone to his mine in order to be able to direct his business from the springs he still roomed at the hotel though ellice was living in a private house farther up the cañon his rooms were becoming filled with books and magazines and he was struggling hard to catch up with the latest literature  if ellice referred to any book even in the most casual way he made mental note of it and if he had read it he reread it and if he had not read it he secured it at once  i know something of chemistry and mineralogy and geology and milling processes but of art and literature very little he said to her once but give me time  the highest peaks were white with september snows before she felt able to mount a horse each day she had been able to go a little farther and climb a little higher her gain was slow very slow but it was almost perceptible from day to day  mr ross had been to chicago and was once more at the springs he had brought a couple of nieces very lively young creatures who annoyed clement exceedingly by their impertinenceat least that is what he called their excessive interest in his affairs without the cooperation of ellice he would have found little chance to see her alone but she had a quiet way of letting them know when she found them a burden which they respected  one day he said to her have you forgotten what i said to you about the spring up there  no i have not forgotten do you think i can go now am i really well enough to go  the time has come  what would the doctor say  the doctordo you still heed what he says  must i walk  yes to have the water heal you but i will lead old wisconse for you to ride down  after i am healed  one can be cured and yet be tired  they set off in such spirits as children have old wisconse leading soberly behind  clement was obliged to check the girl  now dont go too fast it is a long way up there i warn you it is almost at timberline  but she paid small heed to his warning she felt so light so active it seemed she could not tire  for a time they followed the wide road which climbed steadily but at last he stopped  now here we strike the trail he said you must go ahead for i am to lead the horse  not far ahead she exclaimed a little bit alarmed  only two steps he was a little amused at her just so i will not tread on your heels  you neednt laugh i know they hunt bears up here  they climbed for some time in comparative silence  oh how much greener it is up here she exclaimed at last looking around her eyes bright with excitement  he smiled indulgently you tourists think you know colorado when youve crossed it once on the railway this is the colorado which you seldom see  she was in rapture over the glory of color the waving grasses of smooth hillsides and the radiant dapple of light and shadow beneath the groves of vivid yellow aspens the cactus and spanish dagger and the everpresent sage bush of the lower levels had disappeared crowsfoot and bluejoint grasses swung in the wind the bright flame of the painted cup and the purple of the asters still lighted up the aisles of the pines in sheltered places  there are many more in august he explained the frost has swept them all away  is this our stream she asked  yes we cross it many times  how small it is  are you tired  not at all  he came close to her to listen to her breathing you must not do too much if you find yourself out of breath stop and ride  i want to be cured  he laughed by the way you lead up this trail i dont think you need medicine i never finish wondering whether you are the same girl i met first  she flashed a glance back at him im not im another person  that shows what three months of this climate will do  climate did not do it  what did  you did she kept marching steadily forward her head held very straight indeed  i wish you would wait a moment he pleaded  i am very thirstyi want to reach the spring  but dear girl you cant keep this up  cant i watch me and see  she seemed possessed of some miraculous staff for she mounted the steep trail as lightly as a fawn clement was in an agony of apprehension lest she should overdo and fall fainting in the path this ecstasy of activity was most dangerously persistent  it was past noon when they came out of the aspens and pines into the little smooth slope of meadow which lay between the low peaks which were already crusted with snow in the midst of the orange and purple and red of the grasses lay a deep dark pool of wateras beautiful as her eyes it seemed to him  here is the spring clement called to the girl  i knew it she said  wait he called again i must drink with you  he hastened up and dipped a cup into the water and handed it to her  now drink confusion to disease  confusion she drank oh isnt it sweet i never knew before how good water was but here drink you are dying of thirst too she handed him the cup  i want to drink to some purpose also he said and there was no need of further words but he went on his full heart giving eloquence to his lips i want to pledge my life to your servicemy life and all i am  she grew a little pale this intensity of emotion awed her as the majestic in nature affects great souls i dont think you ought i dont think i am quite worthy  let me be judge of that he spoke quickly and almost sharply shall i drink  she had walked on while clement was speaking and stood leaning against the browsing horse after a little hesitation she answered if you are thirsty  illustration  the words were light but he understood her he drank and then came straight toward her  she shrank from him in sudden timidity and said a little hurriedly help me into the saddle i shall need to ride back     westward vista           the halfsunk sun     burns through the dustycrimson sky     streamers of gold and green soar     in radiating splendor like the spokes     of gods unmeasurable chariotwheels     halfhid and vanishing     around me is coolness ripeness and repose     the smell of gathered grain and fruits     and the musky breath of melons fills the air     the very dust is fruity and the click     of locusts wings is like the close     of gates upon great stores of wheat     the gathered barley bleaches in shock     the corn breathes on me from the west     and the skyline widens on and on     until i see the waves of yellowgreen     break on the hills that face the snow and lilac peaks     of colorados mountains     chapter i   at first clements happiness had no further base of uneasiness than the lovers fear of loss it all seemed too good to be true and he had a hidden fear that something might happen to set him back where he was before she came it was quite like his feeling about his mineit took him a certain length of time before he ceased to dream of its sudden loss and now it seemed when absent from her that it would be easy for something to rob him of this love which was his life  this feeling was mixed too with a feeling of his unworthiness which deepened the more closely he studied her she was so free from all bruise and stain of lifes battle there were no questionable places in her life could he say as much  whenever he asked himself the question his dealings with the stockholders of the biddy came into his mind could he afford to tell his bride all the facts in the case this feeling of dissatisfaction with himself led him to do many extravagant things he presented her with beautiful and costly jewels for which she had little taste  why richard what made you think of that she said once after he had slipped away to the city to buy her something  is it so very pretty  it is beautiful but can we afford such things  we can afford anything that will make you happy  he made a similar answer when she drew back a little startled at the cost of the house he had contracted for  why it is a palace  the best is scarcely good enough for you after a moment he added you see i know you can never live east again and i want you to have all the comforts of a palace out here and so long as the witch holds out you shall have your hearts desire  mr ross had come to have a profound respect for his future soninlaw i cant say that he dont make as much of a fool of himself as any prospective bridegroom but he is a business man at the same time he dont lose his head by any means he was telling his son about clement he is devoted to your sister but i went over to his mine with him the other day and it is perfectly certain that he understands his business he is only reckless when buying things for ellice hell take care of her and the mine too  clement felt a certain incongruity every time he put on his miners dress and went through the mine im too rough for her too old he kept thinkingtrying to conceal the real cause of his growing fear  he was not honest with himself he fought round the real point of danger he gave a generous sum to the library aided a hospital and did other things which should ease a bad conscience and yet do not he hastened the house forward and passed to and fro between his mine the springs and the city in ceaseless activity  the marriage was set for july just a year from the time he first saw her and the winter passed quickly so busied was he in building and planning the home he grew less and less buoyant and more careworn as spring wore on and ellice could not understand the change he was moody and changeable even in her presence this troubled her and she often asked  what is the matter richard is your business going wrong  no oh no business is all right nothing is the matter and ended by convincing her that something was very much wrong indeed and she grieved in silence not daring to question him further  the selfrevealing touch came to him in a curious way only a few days before their wedding day he was in camp on a final inspection of his mine and was walking the streets at night silent selfabsorbed and gloomy he had grown morbid and unwholesome in his thought and the wreck of his happiness seemed already complete he spent a great deal of time in long and lonely walks  the street swarmed with rough noisy miners a band of evangelists with drums and tambourines occupied the central corner a low continuous hum of talk could be heard at the base of all other noises  being in no mood for companionship clement stood aside from it all thinking how far above all this life his beautiful bride was  there had been in the camp for some weeks a certain sensational evangelista man of some power but of unhappy disposition apparently at any rate he had been in much trouble with the city authorities he had been called a hypocrite and fake in the public press and had been prosecuted for disturbance of the peace but he seemed to thrive on such treatment  clement had paid very little attention to the man and his troubles but as he looked down the street at the crowd around the speakers on the corner it occurred to him to wonder if they were the fighting evangelists  he was about to move that way when he observed near him in the dark middle of the street a man and a woman  this will do as well as anywhere the man said putting down a small box he wore a broad cowboy hat and a long coat which hung unbuttoned down his powerful figure the woman was tall and slender and neatly dressed in gray clement understood that these were the persecuted ones  the man mounted the box and in a powerful but not very musical voice began to sing a hymn full of cowboy slang his singing had a quality not usual in street singers and a crowd quickly gathered about him his song was long and not without a rude poetry he began his address at last by issuing a defiance to his enemies this would mean little in an eastern village perhaps but in a mining camp even a degenerate mining camp it might mean a great deallife or death in fact  now gentlemen i want to say something as a preface in order to know just where we stand some citizens of the town have vilified me in private and in the public pressover an assumed name however it wouldnt be healthy for any man to do it openly the man is a liarbut i dont care about myself it is a little difference of opinion among men but some miscreant has reflected upon the good name of my wife now let me say that the man that says my wife is not a lady and a woman of the highest character insults the mother of my children and will answer to me for every word he utters  a little thrill of interest and awe ran through the crowd the mans voice meant battle and battle to the hilt of the bowie it was so easy to prove a mark for desperate men but there was no fear in the attitude of the speaker he had come up through a wild life and knew his audience his accuser and himself  his voice took a sudden changeit grew tender and reverent i am here to preach the gospel of christ and him crucified i may not do it in the best way always but i do it as well as i know how here his tone grew severely earnest and savage again as he added but i shall defend the honor of my wife with my life  his voice and pose were magnificentlionlike  his manner changed again with dramatic suddenness he took the whole street into his confidence  i love my wife gentlemen she has borne three children to me she is a good woman a mighty sight smarter and better than i am but she cant defend herself against sneaks and reptilious liars i can thats part of my business i tell you boys he added in a low voice very sincere and winning they aint no man good enough to marry a good woman its just her good pure kind heart gives him any show at all  a sudden lump rose in clements throat the mans deep humility and loyalty and apparent sincerity had gone straight to his own heart and touched him in a very sensitive place he turned away and sought the deeper shadow with his head bowed in black despair  he thought of the eyes of his bride with a shudder almost of fear could he ever face her again  oh god how pure and dainty and unspotted she is and ii am unclean  he saw as clearly as if a light had been turned in upon his secret thought that the ownership of the witch was in question he had not been candid with herhe had been dishonest he had not dared to let her know how he had secured control of that stock  all the way back to the springs he wrestled with himself about it he ended by reasserting the justice of his position and resolved to tell her at once the whole story and let her judge he had in his pocket the deed to the house and lot which he determined now to give her at once and to make explanations at the same time  this he did he called to see her the following afternoon and found her surrounded with women and gowns and flowers the women fled when he approached but the gowns and flowers remained and there was talk upon them till at last in sheer desperation clement said  ellice here is something that i want to give you now it is my wedding gift  he placed in her hand the deed she looked at it  oh theres so much fine print i cant read it now what is it  it is the deed to the new home  her eyes misted with quick emotion  how good you are to me richard  no its precaution he replied as lightly as he could we will have a home always if you dont lose it in some wild speculation  she put her arms about his neck an infrequent caress with her  how rich we are god is good to us and is it not good to think that our wealth does not come from anybodys misery it comes out of the earth like a springlike the spring that made me well  as he looked down into her face it seemed lit from within by some heavenly light and her voice made his head grow dizzy he could not tell her his story then  he sat down and listened to her talk she wanted to know what troubled him and he was forced to lie  oh nothing im a little worried about anew piece of machinery this gave him a thought i must be away this evening i cant take dinner with you  she was not one of those who worry with expostulations or complainings she had a mind of her own and she granted the same decision to others  very well she said and she flashed a sudden roguish look at him dont forget to breakfast with me  he had the grace to return her smile as he said  oh ill not forget ive charged my mind with it  his going was like a flight his inner cry was this  my god i am absolutely unworthy of her i am big coarse and dishonestunfit to touch her hand  his gloomy face and bent head was a subject of joke for the acquaintances he met on the street  saddle susanna he called sharply to his mexican hostler he had made up his mind to radical measures  as he sat in his room with his face buried in his hands shutting out the light of the splendid sunset he saw her as she sat among her soft silks and dainty flowers her lovely eyes and the exquisite texture of her skin grew more and more wonderful to him the touch of his lips to hers came to seem an act of pollution almost of envenoming as he brooded on his unworthiness  he wrote a note to her on the impulse of the moment the missive read       i am not fit to see you to touch you i am going away      across the divide to make restitution for a great wrong i      have done if i do not i can never face you again when i      see you again i will be an honest man or iif you think me      worthy of forgiveness i will see you and ask it tomorrow                                                   richard  he added as a postscript       i am well i am not crazy but i am not an honest man i      cant kiss you again till i am  upon reading this note he saw it would frighten her and keep her in agony of suspense therefore he tore it up and rushing out of the house leaped into the saddle  the spirited little broncho was fresh and mettlesome and went off in a series of sheeplike bounds which her rider seemed not to notice  he drew rein at the telegraph office and there sent three telegrams they were all alike       meet me at the office at midnight important  as he turned susannas head up the trail the mountains stood deep purple silhouettes against the cloudlessness of the sky the wind blew from the heights cool and fragrant and the little horse set nostril to it as if she anticipated and welcomed the hard ride  the way lay over forbidding mountain passes ten thousand feet above the sea and her rider was a heavy man but susanna was of broncho strain with a blooded sire which makes the hardiest and swiftest mountain horse in the world  clements mind cleared as he began the ascentcleared but did not rest over and over the problem came each time clearer and more difficult he must that night give away a hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollarsterrible ordeal ninety thousand dollars to go to an old irishman and his wifeboth ignorant careless  what would they do with it it might drive them crazy as they now lived they were comfortable he had made dan subsuperintendent of the mine and he had rebuilt the eatinghouse for biddy could they take care of the big fortune he was about to give them  ought he not to give them a few thousandssuch sum as they could comprehend and take care of would it not be better for them  then there was fortyfive thousand dollars to be given to a cheap little manthat was hardest of all for he had come to hate the sight of the sleek black head of arthur eldred yes but he had saved the day he had put in six hundred dollars when every dollar was a ducat true but the reward was too great a hundred thousand dollars for six hundred  oh this was familiar ground he had gone over it in a sort of subconscious way a hundred times each time apparently the final one it had been quite settled when this slender little woman first lifted her face to him and now nothing was settled  it was very still and cold there was no stream to sing up through the pines and no wind in the pines to answer should the stream call nothing seemed to be stirring save the pensive man and his faithful pony  reaching the upper levels he spurred on at a gallop finding some relief in the pounding action of the saddle and in the rush of air past his ears the moon was late but when it came it seemed to help him lightening his mood as it lightened the trail the big ledges and lowering lesser peaks lifted into the dark sky weirdly translucent and their upper edges seemed smooth and graceful as the rims of bubbles solid rock seemed melted and transfused with light and air it was all miraculously beautiful and the sorehearted man lifted his eyes to the heights seeing the face of a girl in every moonlit rock and in every wayside pool  as he entered the office he found them all waiting for himdan and biddy in their best dress and eldred with a supercilious halfgrin halfscowl on his face  clement nodded at him but said hello to dan and goodevening to biddy conly his trusted discreet cashier was at his desk and the office was dimly lit with a single electric bulb  dan and biddy greeted him cautiously for eldred had filled their simple souls with suspicion he wants to compromise hes afraid of our suit against him  as a matter of fact dan would never put a dollar into the plan for a suit and it had never gone beyond eldreds talkand yet he had made them suspicious dan was forced to confess that clement was becoming an aristocrat and biddy acknowledged that he sildom dairkened her dure these days they had always felt his superiority and refinement and they rose as he entered  he wasted no time in preliminaries sit down he said imperiously and his face when he turned to the light was knotted with trouble he sat for a moment with bent head while he strengthened his heart to a bitter and humiliating task he began abruptly  dan you remember the time i brought the amalgam home in a vial and it had turned green  i do yis  you remember that you gave it up right then  i did i said its witchs gould  sure such it looked like that day said biddy  all the same the thing which scared you put a happy thought into my head and i felt then i could solve it he lifted his head and looked around defiantly in short when i bought your stock in at ten cents on the dollar i knew it was worth par for i had solved the process  there was a silence very awesome following the defiant ring of the voice  eldred was the first to comprehend what it meant his eyes glittered like those of an awakened rat  do you mean that if thats true you robbed us you thief robbed us cold and clean he sprang up i knew youd do something  sit down interrupted clement harshly im not going to have any words with you if i had seen fit not to tell you of this how much would you have known of it sit down and keep your tongue between your teeth he turned to dan and his voice was softer dan when i was hungry you took me in and fed me for that ive given you a good position is that debt paid  sure clement me boy it was only a sup of ptaties an bacon annyway  biddy i turned over two thousand dollars to you and rebuilt your eatinghouse you thought that paid the debt i owed you  biddy was slower to answer for all the grub an the loikes o that indade yis mr clementbut sure we wor pardners  clement interrupted i know im coming to that now answer me if it hadnt been for me wouldnt you have thrown up the sponge long before you did  the silence of the little group answered him  would any of you ever have worked out the mystery of that ore werent you all anxious to sell for anything you could get  they were all silent as before  i made the mine worth money i discovered the secret it was my invention i paid you four times what you had put into it the mine was worthless until i invented a process for saving the gold i claimed it as an invention like any man claims a patent right i believed i had a right to itto all of it and so i bought in your stock after i had solved the problem of the reduction i say i believed i was righttonight i believe i was wrongit dont matter how i came to the conclusion but ive changed my mind i have come tonight to make restitution i am ready to pay you ninety cents more on every dollar of stock you sold me at that time  biddy gasped howly saints  dan leaped up with a wild hurrah listen to that now he cried with other incoherences he shook clements hand and kissed biddy he praised clement  yere the whitest man that iver stepped green turf  clement sat coldly impassive and unsmiling  then youre satisfied  satisfied shouted dan satisfied is it man indade i am  and you biddy  biddy was weeping and muttering wild irish prayers dan dear do ye understand its fortyfive thousand dollars apiece to the two of us oh the blessed old ireland ill go back sure oh its too good to be truewe must be dramin  clement looked at the distracted woman with a flush of selfrighteousness he had been right in his fears it seemed like to ruin the simple souls he turned to eldred who sat in silence  what have you to say  eldred sneered i say you cant fool me these shares are worth seventeen dollars and eighty cents each i want their market value not their par value i want onequarter the present value of the witch  clements brow darkened and his eyes burned with a fierce steady light  is that all you want if i served you right id kick you out of the door and let you do your worst i know if you sue that you cant recover one dollar from me but i have my reasons for putting up with your insolence i will pay you fortyfive thousand dollars and not one cent more the market value of the witch today i have made by my management i have gone on improving the mine day by day as it stands it is a new property you were a quarter owner in the biddy we capitalized the biddy at your own suggestion at two hundred thousand dollars because we wanted it big enough to cover all values when i render you your share of that i am doing you justice john make out three checks for fortyfive thousand dollars each  dan and biddy turned upon eldred and talked him into silence but he was unconvinced  clement refused to touch the checks and the clerk said here is yours biddy  biddy went up and took the slip in her hands is that little slip o white paper really worth so much  call at the bank and get your money when you want it said the imperturbable cashier  dan studied his check his face foolish with joy  eldred took his saying this puts into my hands the means to fight  clement merely nodded you know my address eldred went out without further word  when the door closed on him clements face lost its sternness and he became sad and tender  his struggle was not yet done his mind was clear about the man who came in at the eleventh hour but it was not clear with regard to these truehearted old friends who had been with him from the first he recalled the time when dans big arm had helped him to a chair and biddy had put the steaming soup before himfood worth all the gold in the world at that moment he recalled her broad kindly face hot and shining from the stove he remembered their struggles their sacrifices  wait a moment biddy he said as they called out goodnight and started to leave  sit down a moment and you too dan i want to talk over old times a while  they sat down in stupefaction  biddy do you remember the money you squandered on the lottery ticket  a slow smile broadened her face i do mister clementand i remember i won the prize sure  you did and saved all our lives dan do you remember the day we lost our last fivedollar gold piece in the grass  dan slapped his knee do i i wore me hands raw as beef combin the grass that day  ah those were great days we had days when fortyfive cents would have made us joyous and here you are with ninety thousand dollars and wishin for more  dan laughed again sure thats no lie  it is dan kelly said biddy i have enoughtoo much my heart misgives me now im afraid of it sure im scared to carry it away wid me  youre safe biddy nobody will steal that check a sudden impulse seized him dan you believed in me in those daysgive me that check dan slowly handed to him the check clement took it and turned biddy you fed me when i was starving and you pawned everything you had to grubstake megive me your check she handed it to him without hesitation he tore them into small pieces  dan you are mining boss and i make you both quarter owners in the witch with all i have and share and share alike as we did when we hadnt a dime now hurrah for the witch  nobody shouted but the cashier dan sat in a stupor and biddy was weeping with one arm flung around dans neck dan was turning his hat around on his fingers and staring at clements face for some solution to the situation it was beyond his imagination  clement did not speak again for some moments when he did his voice was husky and tremulous with emotion you notice i say quarter interestthats because there is a new member in the firm now she comes in tomorrow i want you to see how she looks he extended a picture of ellice to biddy she made a marvelous dramatic shift of features and a smile of admiration broke through the red of her broad countenance  oh the swate blessed angel sure shes beautiful as one of the saints in the church luk at her dan  im lukin shes none too good for him  dont say that dan clement protested in an earnest tone all you have tonight you owe to her all the best thoughts in me today i owe to her     chapter ii   there remained to him now all the joy of riding back to tell her of his purification of soul his heart was so joyous it kept time to every happy song in the world  the gloom and doubt of himself had passed away but the wonder and mystery of womans love for man remained he felt himself to be an honest man but a man big crude and coarse compared to her beauty and delicacy he marveled at her bravery and her magnanimity leaving susanna he leaped upon a fresh horse and set off riding fast toward the divide the wind had risen and was blowing from the dim domes of the highest mountainsa cold wind and he would have said a sad wind had his heart not been so light as it was he lifted his bared forehead to it exultantly  he put behind him so far as in his power lay all thought of the great wealth he had given away he was eager to pour out the whole story to her and hear her say well done richard  over and over again his thought ran now i am an honest man i am not worthy of her but at least my heart is clean  henceforth she was to be his altar of sacrifice all he did would be for her approval all there was of his money his inventive skill his command of men should be hers she should regulate every hour of his coming and going and share all the plans and purposes of his life  oh i must live right and deal justly he thought i must be a better man from this time forth  in the east the pale lances of the coming sun pierced the breasts of the soaring gray clouds and behold they grew to be the most splendid orange and red and purple the stars began to pale and as he came to the eastern slope where the plain stretched to dim splendor like a motionless sea of russet and purple the sun was rising  the plain seemed lonely and desolate of life so far below was it all action was lost in the mist of immensitymens stature that of the most minute insects and down there in the pathway of the morning was the little woman of all the world waiting for him  as he rode down the slope to the river level into the town the sun was swinging big and red high above the horizon his long ride had made him look wan and pale but he ordered coffee and a biscuit and was glad to find it helped him to look less wan and sorrowful he dressed with great care then sat down to wait at 730 oclock he sent a note to her       i have not forgotten when do you breakfast  she replied       goodmorning dearest breakfast is ready come as soon as      you can  he entered the room with the heart of a boy the presence of an athlete he was at his prime of robust manhood and his physical pride was unconscious  she was proud of him and met him more than half way in his greeting her face was still slender and delicate of color but in her eyes was a serene brightness and her lips were tremulous with happiness  she led him to the little table now you mustnt call this breakfast she explained this is a private cup of coffee to sustain us through the ordeal we all breakfast immediately after the ceremony  ive had one breakfast this morning  she looked dismayed  at least a roll and a cup of coffee he hastened to explain however i think i could eat all there is here and not be inconvenienced  they sat down and looked at each other in silence she spoke first  just think this is the last time you will ever sit down with miss ross  you seem to be sad about it  i amand yet i am very happy i dont suppose you men can understand but a woman wants to marry the man she lovesand yet she is sad at leaving girlhood behind now let me see you take two lumps dont you i must not forget that it makes the waiter stare when a wife cant remember how many lumps of sugar her husband takes  he felt his courage oozing away and so began abruptly  ellice i have a story to tell and a confession to make to you  she looked a little startled that sounds ominous richardlike the villain in the play only he makes his confession after marriage  he was very sober indeed now thats the reason i make mine now i want you to know just what i am before you marry me  she leaned her chin on her clasped hands and looked at him tell me all about it  he did he began at the beginning and while it would not be true to say he did not spare himself he told the story as it actually happened he concealed no essential  i rode there and back last night simply because i couldnt kiss you again until i had made myself an honest man  she reached out and clutched the hand which lay on the table near hera sudden convulsive embrace  last night  yes ive been to the camp since i left you last night i couldnt stand with youtherebefore all our friends till i could say i had no other mans money in my pockets  she took his hand in both of her own and bent her head and touched her cheek to his fingers she was very deeply moved  and hethough his voice chokedfaltered through  i gave it all back deari mean i gave over to biddy and dan their full sharethey are equal owners with you and me in the witch i tried to withhold some of it it was hard to give it all back but i did it because i believed you would approve of it and now if you will let me i can call you my wife with a clear conscience  for answer she rose and came to his side and put her arms about his neck and laid a kiss on his upturned face words were of no avail in his heart the man was still afraid of one so good and loving   the end
