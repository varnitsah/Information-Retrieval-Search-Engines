77745166	conger agreed to kill a stranger he had  never seen but he would make no mistakes  because he had the strangers skull under  his arm           the        skull   by philip k dick   what is this opportunity conger asked go on im interested  the room was silent all faces were fixed on congerstill in the drab prison uniform the speaker leaned forward slowly  before you went to prison your trading business was paying wellall illegalall very profitable now you have nothing except the prospect of another six years in a cell  conger scowled  there is a certain situation very important to this council that requires your peculiar abilities also it is a situation you might find interesting you were a hunter were you not youve done a great deal of trapping hiding in the bushes waiting at night for the game i imagine hunting must be a source of satisfaction to you the chase the stalking  conger sighed his lips twisted all right he said leave that out get to the point who do you want me to kill  the speaker smiled all in proper sequence he said softly                                       the car slid to a stop it was night there was no light anywhere along the street conger looked out where are we what is this place  the hand of the guard pressed into his arm come through that door  conger stepped down onto the damp sidewalk the guard came swiftly after him and then the speaker conger took a deep breath of the cold air he studied the dim outline of the building rising up before them  i know this place ive seen it before he squinted his eyes growing accustomed to the dark suddenly he became alert this is  yes the first church the speaker walked toward the steps were expected  expected here  yes the speaker mounted the stairs you know were not allowed in their churches especially with guns he stopped two armed soldiers loomed up ahead one on each side  all right the speaker looked up at them they nodded the door of the church was open conger could see other soldiers inside standing about young soldiers with large eyes gazing at the ikons and holy images  i see he said  it was necessary the speaker said as you know we have been singularly unfortunate in the past in our relations with the first church  this wont help  but its worth it you will see                                       they passed through the hall and into the main chamber where the altar piece was and the kneeling places the speaker scarcely glanced at the altar as they passed by he pushed open a small side door and beckoned conger through  in here we have to hurry the faithful will be flocking in soon  conger entered blinking they were in a small chamber lowceilinged with dark panels of old wood there was a smell of ashes and smoldering spices in the room he sniffed whats that the smell  cups on the wall i dont know the speaker crossed impatiently to the far side according to our information it is hidden here by this  conger looked around the room he saw books and papers holy signs and images a strange low shiver went through him  does my job involve anyone of the church if it does  the speaker turned astonished can it be that you believe in the founder is it possible a hunter a killer  no of course not all their business about resignation to death nonviolence  what is it then  conger shrugged ive been taught not to mix with such as these they have strange abilities and you cant reason with them  the speaker studied conger thoughtfully you have the wrong idea it is no one here that we have in mind weve found that killing them only tends to increase their numbers  then why come here lets leave  no we came for something important something you will need to identify your man without it you wont be able to find him a trace of a smile crossed the speakers face we dont want you to kill the wrong person its too important  i dont make mistakes congers chest rose listen speaker  this is an unusual situation the speaker said you see the person you are afterthe person that we are sending you to findis known only by certain objects here they are the only traces the only means of identification without them  what are they  he came toward the speaker the speaker moved to one side look he said he drew a sliding wall away showing a dark square hole in there  conger squatted down staring in he frowned a skull a skeleton  the man you are after has been dead for two centuries the speaker said this is all that remains of him and this is all you have with which to find him  for a long time conger said nothing he stared down at the bones dimly visible in the recess of the wall how could a man dead centuries be killed how could he be stalked brought down  conger was a hunter a man who had lived as he pleased where he pleased he had kept himself alive by trading bringing furs and pelts in from the provinces on his own ship riding at high speed slipping through the customs line around earth  he had hunted in the great mountains of the moon he had stalked through empty martian cities he had explored  the speaker said soldier take these objects and have them carried to the car dont lose any part of them  the soldier went into the cupboard reaching gingerly squatting on his heels  it is my hope the speaker continued softly to conger that you will demonstrate your loyalty to us now there are always ways for citizens to restore themselves to show their devotion to their society for you i think this would be a very good chance i seriously doubt that a better one will come and for your efforts there will be quite a restitution of course  the two men looked at each other conger thin unkempt the speaker immaculate in his uniform  i understand you conger said i mean i understand this part about the chance but how can a man who has been dead two centuries be  ill explain later the speaker said right now we have to hurry the soldier had gone out with the bones wrapped in a blanket held carefully in his arms the speaker walked to the door come theyve already discovered that weve broken in here and theyll be coming at any moment  they hurried down the damp steps to the waiting car a second later the driver lifted the car up into the air above the housetops                                       the speaker settled back in the seat  the first church has an interesting past he said i suppose you are familiar with it but id like to speak of a few points that are of relevancy to us  it was in the twentieth century that the movement beganduring one of the periodic wars the movement developed rapidly feeding on the general sense of futility the realization that each war was breeding greater war with no end in sight the movement posed a simple answer to the problem without military preparationsweaponsthere could be no war and without machinery and complex scientific technocracy there could be no weapons  the movement preached that you couldnt stop war by planning for it they preached that man was losing to his machinery and science that it was getting away from him pushing him into greater and greater wars down with society they shouted down with factories and science a few more wars and there wouldnt be much left of the world  the founder was an obscure person from a small town in the american middle west we dont even know his name all we know is that one day he appeared preaching a doctrine of nonviolence nonresistance no fighting no paying taxes for guns no research except for medicine live out your life quietly tending your garden staying out of public affairs mind your own business be obscure unknown poor give away most of your possessions leave the city at least that was what developed from what he told the people  the car dropped down and landed on a roof  the founder preached this doctrine or the germ of it theres no telling how much the faithful have added themselves the local authorities picked him up at once of course apparently they were convinced that he meant it he was never released he was put to death and his body buried secretly it seemed that the cult was finished  the speaker smiled unfortunately some of his disciples reported seeing him after the date of his death the rumor spread he had conquered death he was divine it took hold grew and here we are today with a first church obstructing all social progress destroying society sowing the seeds of anarchy  but the wars conger said about them  the wars well there were no more wars it must be acknowledged that the elimination of war was the direct result of nonviolence practiced on a general scale but we can take a more objective view of war today what was so terrible about it war had a profound selective value perfectly in accord with the teachings of darwin and mendel and others without war the mass of useless incompetent mankind without training or intelligence is permitted to grow and expand unchecked war acted to reduce their numbers like storms and earthquakes and droughts it was natures way of eliminating the unfit  without war the lower elements of mankind have increased all out of proportion they threaten the educated few those with scientific knowledge and training the ones equipped to direct society they have no regard for science or a scientific society based on reason and this movement seeks to aid and abet them only when scientists are in full control can the                                       he looked at his watch and then kicked the car door open ill tell you the rest as we walk  they crossed the dark roof doubtless you now know whom those bones belonged to who it is that we are after he has been dead just two centuries now this ignorant man from the middle west this founder the tragedy is that the authorities of the time acted too slowly they allowed him to speak to get his message across he was allowed to preach to start his cult and once such a thing is under way theres no stopping it  but what if he had died before he preached what if none of his doctrines had ever been spoken it took only a moment for him to utter them that we know they say he spoke just once just one time then the authorities came taking him away he offered no resistance the incident was small  the speaker turned to conger  small but were reaping the consequences of it today  they went inside the building inside the soldiers had already laid out the skeleton on a table the soldiers stood around it their young faces intense  conger went over to the table pushing past them he bent down staring at the bones so these are his remains he murmured the founder the church has hidden them for two centuries  quite so the speaker said but now we have them come along down the hall  they went across the room to a door the speaker pushed it open technicians looked up conger saw machinery whirring and turning benches and retorts in the center of the room was a gleaming crystal cage  the speaker handed a slemgun to conger the important thing to remember is that the skull must be saved and brought backfor comparison and proof aim lowat the chest  conger weighed the gun in his hands it feels good he said i know this gunthat is ive seen them before but i never used one  the speaker nodded you will be instructed on the use of the gun and the operation of the cage you will be given all data we have on the time and location the exact spot was a place called hudsons field about 1960 in a small community outside denver colorado and dont forgetthe only means of identification you will have will be the skull there are visible characteristics of the front teeth especially the left incisor  conger listened absently he was watching two men in white carefully wrapping the skull in a plastic bag they tied it and carried it into the crystal cage and if i should make a mistake  pick the wrong man then find the right one dont come back until you succeed in reaching this founder and you cant wait for him to start speaking thats what we must avoid you must act in advance take chances shoot as soon as you think youve found him hell be someone unusual probably a stranger in the area apparently he wasnt known  conger listened dimly  do you think you have it all now the speaker asked  yes i think so conger entered the crystal cage and sat down placing his hands on the wheel  good luck the speaker said  well be awaiting the outcome theres some philosophical doubt as to whether one can alter the past this should answer the question once and for all  conger fingered the controls of the cage  by the way the speaker said dont try to use this cage for purposes not anticipated in your job we have a constant trace on it if we want it back we can get it back good luck  conger said nothing the cage was sealed he raised his finger and touched the wheel control he turned the wheel carefully  he was still staring at the plastic bag when the room outside vanished  for a long time there was nothing at all nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage thoughts rushed through congers mind helterskelter how would he know the man how could he be certain in advance what had he looked like what was his name how had he acted before he spoke would he be an ordinary person or some strange outlandish crank  conger picked up the slemgun and held it against his cheek the metal of the gun was cool and smooth he practiced moving the sight it was a beautiful gun the kind of gun he could fall in love with if he had owned such a gun in the martian deserton the long nights when he had lain cramped and numbed with cold waiting for things that moved through the darkness  he put the gun down and adjusted the meter readings of the cage the spiraling mist was beginning to condense and settle all at once forms wavered and fluttered around him  colors sounds movements filtered through the crystal wire he clamped the controls off and stood up                                       he was on a ridge overlooking a small town it was high noon the air was crisp and bright a few automobiles moved along a road off in the distance were some level fields conger went to the door and stepped outside he sniffed the air then he went back into the cage  he stood before the mirror over the shelf examining his features he had trimmed his beardthey had not got him to cut it offand his hair was neat he was dressed in the clothing of the middletwentieth century the odd collar and coat the shoes of animal hide in his pocket was money of the times that was important nothing more was needed  nothing except his ability his special cunning but he had never used it in such a way before  he walked down the road toward the town  the first things he noticed were the newspapers on the stands april 5 1961 he was not too far off he looked around him there was a filling station a garage some taverns and a tencent store down the street was a grocery store and some public buildings  a few minutes later he mounted the stairs of the little public library and passed through the doors into the warm interior  the librarian looked up smiling  good afternoon she said  he smiled not speaking because his words would not be correct accented and strange probably he went over to a table and sat down by a heap of magazines for a moment he glanced through them then he was on his feet again he crossed the room to a wide rack against the wall his heart began to beat heavily  newspapersweeks on end he took a roll of them over to the table and began to scan them quickly the print was odd the letters strange some of the words were unfamiliar  he set the papers aside and searched farther at last he found what he wanted he carried the cherrywood gazette to the table and opened it to the first page he found what he wanted      prisoner hangs self      an unidentified man held by the county sheriffs office for     suspicion of criminal syndicalism was found dead this morning by  he finished the item it was vague uninforming he needed more he carried the gazette back to the racks and then after a moments hesitation approached the librarian  more he asked more papers old ones  she frowned how old which papers  months old andbefore  of the gazette this is all we have what did you want what are you looking for maybe i can help you  he was silent  you might find older issues at the gazette office the woman said taking off her glasses why dont you try there but if youd tell me maybe i could help you  he went out  the gazette office was down a side street the sidewalk was broken and cracked he went inside a heater glowed in the corner of the small office a heavyset man stood up and came slowly over to the counter  what did you want mister he said  old papers a month or more  to buy you want to buy them  yes he held out some of the money he had the man stared  sure he said sure wait a minute he went quickly out of the room when he came back he was staggering under the weight of his armload his face red here are some he grunted took what i could find covers the whole year and if you want more  conger carried the papers outside he sat down by the road and began to go through them                                       what he wanted was four months back in december it was a tiny item so small that he almost missed it his hands trembled as he scanned it using the small dictionary for some of the archaic terms      man arrested for unlicensed demonstration      an unidentified man who refused to give his name was picked up in     cooper creek by special agents of the sheriffs office according to     sheriff duff it was said the man was recently noticed in this area     and had been watched continually it was  cooper creek december 1960 his heart pounded that was all he needed to know he stood up shaking himself stamping his feet on the cold ground the sun had moved across the sky to the very edge of the hills he smiled already he had discovered the exact time and place now he needed only to go back perhaps to november to cooper creek  he walked back through the main section of town past the library past the grocery store it would not be hard the hard part was over he would go there rent a room prepare to wait until the man appeared  he turned the corner a woman was coming out of a doorway loaded down with packages conger stepped aside to let her pass the woman glanced at him suddenly her face turned white she stared her mouth open  conger hurried on he looked back what was wrong with her the woman was still staring she had dropped the packages to the ground he increased his speed he turned a second corner and went up a side street when he looked back again the woman had come to the entrance of the street and was starting after him a man joined her and the two of them began to run toward him  he lost them and left the town striding quickly easily up into the hills at the edge of town when he reached the cage he stopped what had happened was it something about his clothing his dress  he pondered then as the sun set he stepped into the cage  conger sat before the wheel for a moment he waited his hands resting lightly on the control then he turned the wheel just a little following the control readings carefully  the grayness settled down around him  but not for very long                                       the man looked him over critically you better come inside he said out of the cold  thanks conger went gratefully through the open door into the livingroom it was warm and close from the heat of the little kerosene heater in the corner a woman large and shapeless in her flowered dress came from the kitchen she and the man studied him critically  its a good room the woman said im mrs appleton its got heat you need that this time of year  yes he nodded looking around  you want to eat with us  what  you want to eat with us the mans brows knitted youre not a foreigner are you mister  no he smiled i was born in this country quite far west though  california  no he hesitated in oregon  whats it like up there mrs appleton asked i hear theres a lot of trees and green its so barren here i come from chicago myself  thats the middle west the man said to her you aint no foreigner  oregon isnt foreign either conger said its part of the united states  the man nodded absently he was staring at congers clothing  thats a funny suit you got on mister he said whered you get that  conger was lost he shifted uneasily its a good suit he said maybe i better go some other place if you dont want me here  they both raised their hands protestingly the woman smiled at him we just have to look out for those reds you know the government is always warning us about them  the reds he was puzzled  the government says theyre all around were supposed to report anything strange or unusual anybody doesnt act normal  like me  they looked embarrassed well you dont look like a red to me the man said but we have to be careful the tribune says  conger half listened it was going to be easier than he had thought clearly he would know as soon as the founder appeared these people so suspicious of anything different would be buzzing and gossiping and spreading the story all he had to do was lie low and listen down at the general store perhaps or even here in mrs appletons boarding house  can i see the room he said  certainly mrs appleton went to the stairs ill be glad to show it to you  they went upstairs it was colder upstairs but not nearly as cold as outside nor as cold as nights on the martian deserts for that he was grateful                                       he was walking slowly around the store looking at the cans of vegetables the frozen packages of fish and meats shining and clean in the open refrigerator counters  ed davies came toward him can i help you he said the man was a little oddly dressed and with a beard ed couldnt help smiling  nothing the man said in a funny voice just looking  sure ed said he walked back behind the counter mrs hacket was wheeling her cart up  whos he she whispered her sharp face turned her nose moving as if it were sniffing i never seen him before  i dont know  looks funny to me why does he wear a beard no one else wears a beard must be something the matter with him  maybe he likes to wear a beard i had an uncle who  wait mrs hacket stiffened didnt thatwhat was his name the redthat old one didnt he have a beard marx he had a beard  ed laughed this aint karl marx i saw a photograph of him once  mrs hacket was staring at him you did  sure he flushed a little whats the matter with that  id sure like to know more about him mrs hacket said i think we ought to know more for our own good                                       hey mister want a ride  conger turned quickly dropping his hand to his belt he relaxed two young kids in a car a girl and a boy he smiled at them a ride sure  conger got into the car and closed the door bill willet pushed the gas and the car roared down the highway  i appreciate a ride conger said carefully i was taking a walk between towns but it was farther than i thought  where are you from lora hunt asked she was pretty small and dark in her yellow sweater and blue skirt  from cooper creek  cooper creek bill said he frowned thats funny i dont remember seeing you before  why do you come from there  i was born there i know everybody there  i just moved in from oregon  from oregon i didnt know oregon people had accents  do i have an accent  you use words funny  how  i dont know doesnt he lora  you slur them lora said smiling talk some more im interested in dialects she glanced at him whiteteethed conger felt his heart constrict  i have a speech impediment  oh her eyes widened im sorry  they looked at him curiously as the car purred along conger for his part was struggling to find some way of asking them questions without seeming curious i guess people from out of town dont come here much he said strangers  no bill shook his head not very much  ill bet im the first outsider for a long time  i guess so  conger hesitated a friend of minesomeone i know might be coming through here where do you suppose i might he stopped would there be anyone certain to see him someone i could ask make sure i dont miss him if he comes  they were puzzled just keep your eyes open cooper creek isnt very big  no thats right  they drove in silence conger studied the outline of the girl probably she was the boys mistress perhaps she was his trial wife or had they developed trial marriage back so far he could not remember but surely such an attractive girl would be someones mistress by this time she would be sixteen or so by her looks he might ask her sometime if they ever met again                                       the next day conger went walking along the one main street of cooper creek he passed the general store the two filling stations and then the post office at the corner was the soda fountain  he stopped lora was sitting inside talking to the clerk she was laughing rocking back and forth  conger pushed the door open warm air rushed around him lora was drinking hot chocolate with whipped cream she looked up in surprise as he slid into the seat beside her  i beg your pardon he said am i intruding  no she shook her head her eyes were large and dark not at all  the clerk came over what do you want  conger looked at the chocolate same as she has  lora was watching conger her arms folded elbows on the counter she smiled at him by the way you dont know my name lora hunt  she was holding out her hand he took it awkwardly not knowing what to do with it conger is my name he murmured  conger is that your last or first name  last or first he hesitated last omar conger  omar she laughed thats like the poet omar khayyam  i dont know of him i know very little of poets we restored very few works of art usually only the church has been interested enough he broke off she was staring he flushed where i come from he finished  the church which church do you mean  the church he was confused the chocolate came and he began to sip it gratefully lora was still watching him  youre an unusual person she said bill didnt like you but he never likes anything different hes soso prosaic dont you think that when a person gets older he should becomebroadened in his outlook  conger nodded  he says foreign people ought to stay where they belong not come here but youre not so foreign he means orientals you know  conger nodded  the screen door opened behind them bill came into the room he stared at them well he said  conger turned hello  well bill sat down hello lora he was looking at conger i didnt expect to see you here  conger tensed he could feel the hostility of the boy something wrong with that  no nothing wrong with it  there was silence suddenly bill turned to lora come on lets go  go she was astonished why  just go he grabbed her hand come on the cars outside  why bill willet lora said youre jealous  who is this guy bill said do you know anything about him look at him his beard  she flared so what just because he doesnt drive a packard and go to cooper high  conger sized the boy up he was bigbig and strong probably he was part of some civil control organization  sorry conger said ill go  whats your business in town bill asked what are you doing here why are you hanging around lora  conger looked at the girl he shrugged no reason ill see you later  he turned away and froze bill had moved congers fingers went to his belt half pressure he whispered to himself no more half pressure  he squeezed the room leaped around him he himself was protected by the lining of his clothing the plastic sheathing inside  my god lora put her hands up conger cursed he hadnt meant any of it for her but it would wear off there was only a halfamp to it it would tingle  tingle and paralyze  he walked out the door without looking back he was almost to the corner when bill came slowly out holding onto the wall like a drunken man conger went on                                       as conger walked restless in the night a form loomed in front of him he stopped holding his breath  who is it a mans voice came conger waited tense  who is it the man said again he clicked something in his hand a light flashed conger moved  its me he said  who is me  conger is my name im staying at the appletons place who are you  the man came slowly up to him he was wearing a leather jacket there was a gun at his waist  im sheriff duff i think youre the person i want to talk to you were in blooms today about three oclock  blooms  the fountain where the kids hang out duff came up beside him shining his light into congers face conger blinked  turn that thing away he said  a pause all right the light flickered to the ground you were there some trouble broke out between you and the willet boy is that right you had a beef over his girl  we had a discussion conger said carefully  then what happened  why  im just curious they say you did something  did something did what  i dont know thats what im wondering they saw a flash and something seemed to happen they all blacked out couldnt move  how are they now  all right  there was silence  well duff said what was it a bomb  a bomb conger laughed no my cigarette lighter caught fire there was a leak and the fluid ignited  why did they all pass out  fumes  silence conger shifted waiting his fingers moved slowly toward his belt the sheriff glanced down he grunted  if you say so he said anyhow there wasnt any real harm done he stepped back from conger and that willet is a troublemaker  good night then conger said he started past the sheriff  one more thing mr conger before you go you dont mind if i look at your identification do you  no not at all conger reached into his pocket he held his wallet out the sheriff took it and shined his flashlight on it conger watched breathing shallowly they had worked hard on the wallet studying historic documents relics of the times all the papers they felt would be relevant  duff handed it back okay sorry to bother you the light winked off  when conger reached the house he found the appletons sitting around the television set they did not look up as he came in he lingered at the door  can i ask you something he said mrs appleton turned slowly can i ask youwhats the date  the date she studied him the first of december  december first why it was just november  they were all looking at him suddenly he remembered in the twentieth century they still used the old twelvemonth system november fed directly into december there was no quartember between  he gasped then it was tomorrow the second of december tomorrow  thanks he said thanks  he went up the stairs what a fool he was forgetting the founder had been taken into captivity on the second of december according to the newspaper records tomorrow only twelve hours hence the founder would appear to speak to the people and then be dragged away                                       the day was warm and bright congers shoes crunched the melting crust of snow on he went through the trees heavy with white he climbed a hill and strode down the other side sliding as he went  he stopped to look around everything was silent there was no one in sight he brought a thin rod from his waist and turned the handle of it for a moment nothing happened then there was a shimmering in the air  the crystal cage appeared and settled slowly down conger sighed it was good to see it again after all it was his only way back  he walked up on the ridge he looked around with some satisfaction his hands on his hips hudsons field was spread out all the way to the beginning of town it was bare and flat covered with a thin layer of snow  here the founder would come here he would speak to them and here the authorities would take him  only he would be dead before they came he would be dead before he even spoke  conger returned to the crystal globe he pushed through the door and stepped inside he took the slemgun from the shelf and screwed the bolt into place it was ready to go ready to fire for a moment he considered should he have it with him  no it might be hours before the founder came and suppose someone approached him in the meantime when he saw the founder coming toward the field then he could go and get the gun  conger looked toward the shelf there was the neat plastic package he took it down and unwrapped it  he held the skull in his hands turning it over in spite of himself a cold feeling rushed through him this was the mans skull the skull of the founder who was still alive who would come here this day who would stand on the field not fifty yards away  what if he could see this his own skull yellow and eroded two centuries old would he still speak would he speak if he could see it the grinning aged skull what would there be for him to say to tell the people what message could he bring  what action would not be futile when a man could look upon his own aged yellowed skull better they should enjoy their temporary lives while they still had them to enjoy  a man who could hold his own skull in his hands would believe in few causes few movements rather he would preach the opposite  a sound conger dropped the skull back on the shelf and took up the gun outside something was moving he went quickly to the door his heart beating was it he was it the founder wandering by himself in the cold looking for a place to speak was he meditating over his words choosing his sentences  what if he could see what conger had held  he pushed the door open the gun raised  lora  he stared at her she was dressed in a wool jacket and boots her hands in her pockets a cloud of steam came from her mouth and nostrils her breast was rising and falling  silently they looked at each other at last conger lowered the gun  what is it he said what are you doing here  she pointed she did not seem able to speak he frowned what was wrong with her  what is it he said what do you want he looked in the direction she had pointed i dont see anything  theyre coming  they who who are coming  they are the police during the night the sheriff had the state police send cars all around everywhere blocking the roads theres about sixty of them coming some from town some around behind she stopped gasping they saidthey said  what  they said you were some kind of a communist they said                                       conger went into the cage he put the gun down on the shelf and came back out he leaped down and went to the girl  thanks you came here to tell me you dont believe it  i dont know  did you come alone  no joe brought me in his truck from town  joe whos he  joe french the plumber hes a friend of dads  lets go they crossed the snow up the ridge and onto the field the little panel truck was parked half way across the field a heavy short man was sitting behind the wheel smoking his pipe he sat up as he saw the two of them coming toward him  are you the one he said to conger  yes thanks for warning me  the plumber shrugged i dont know anything about this lora says youre all right he turned around it might interest you to know some more of them are coming not to warn youjust curious  more of them conger looked toward the town black shapes were picking their way across the snow  people from the town you cant keep this sort of thing quiet not in a small town we all listen to the police radio they heard the same way lora did someone tuned in spread it around  the shapes were getting closer conger could make out a couple of them bill willet was there with some boys from the high school the appletons were along hanging back in the rear  even ed davies conger murmured  the storekeeper was toiling onto the field with three or four other men from the town  all curious as hell french said well i guess im going back to town i dont want my truck shot full of holes come on lora  she was looking up at conger wideeyed  come on french said again lets go you sure as hell cant stay here you know  why  there may be shooting thats what they all came to see you know that dont you conger  yes  you have a gun or dont you care french smiled a little theyve picked up a lot of people in their time you know you wont be lonely  he cared all right he had to stay here on the field he couldnt afford to let them take him away any minute the founder would appear would step onto the field would he be one of the townsmen standing silently at the foot of the field waiting watching  or maybe he was joe french or maybe one of the cops anyone of them might find himself moved to speak and the few words spoken this day were going to be important for a long time  and conger had to be there ready when the first word was uttered  i care he said you go on back to town take the girl with you  lora got stiffly in beside joe french the plumber started up the motor look at them standing there he said like vultures waiting to see someone get killed                                       the truck drove away lora sitting stiff and silent frightened now conger watched for a moment then he dashed back into the woods between the trees toward the ridge  he could get away of course anytime he wanted to he could get away all he had to do was to leap into the crystal cage and turn the handles but he had a job an important job he had to be here here at this place at this time  he reached the cage and opened the door he went inside and picked up the gun from the shelf the slemgun would take care of them he notched it up to full count the chain reaction from it would flatten them all the police the curious sadistic people  they wouldnt take him before they got him all of them would be dead he would get away he would escape by the end of the day they would all be dead if that was what they wanted and he  he saw the skull  suddenly he put the gun down he picked up the skull he turned the skull over he looked at the teeth then he went to the mirror  he held the skull up looking in the mirror he pressed the skull against his cheek beside his own face the grinning skull leered back at him beside his skull against his living flesh  he bared his teeth and he knew  it was his own skull that he held he was the one who would die he was the founder  after a time he put the skull down for a few minutes he stood at the controls playing with them idly he could hear the sound of motors outside the muffled noise of men should he go back to the present where the speaker waited he could escape of course  escape  he turned toward the skull there it was his skull yellow with age escape escape when he had held it in his own hands  what did it matter if he put it off a month a year ten years even fifty time was nothing he had sipped chocolate with a girl born a hundred and fifty years before his time escape for a little while perhaps  but he could not really escape no more so than anyone else had ever escaped or ever would  only he had held it in his hands his own bones his own deathshead  they had not  he went out the door and across the field empty handed there were a lot of them standing around gathered together waiting they expected a good fight they knew he had something they had heard about the incident at the fountain  and there were plenty of policepolice with guns and tear gas creeping across the hills and ridges between the trees closer and closer it was an old story in this century  one of the men tossed something at him it fell in the snow by his feet and he looked down it was a rock he smiled  come on one of them called dont you have any bombs  throw a bomb you with the beard throw a bomb  let em have it  toss a few a bombs                                       they began to laugh he smiled he put his hands to his hips they suddenly turned silent seeing that he was going to speak  im sorry he said simply i dont have any bombs youre mistaken  there was a flurry of murmuring  i have a gun he went on a very good one made by science even more advanced than your own but im not going to use that either  they were puzzled  why not someone called at the edge of the group an older woman was watching he felt a sudden shock he had seen her before where  he remembered the day at the library as he had turned the corner he had seen her she had noticed him and been astounded at the time he did not understand why  conger grinned so he would escape death the man who right now was voluntarily accepting it they were laughing laughing at a man who had a gun but didnt use it but by a strange twist of science he would appear again a few months later after his bones had been buried under the floor of a jail  and so in a fashion he would escape death he would die but then after a period of months he would live again briefly for an afternoon  an afternoon yet long enough for them to see him to understand that he was still alive to know that somehow he had returned to life  and then finally he would appear once more after two hundred years had passed two centuries later  he would be born again born as a matter of fact in a small trading village on mars he would grow up learning to hunt and trade  a police car came on the edge of the field and stopped the people retreated a little conger raised his hands  i have an odd paradox for you he said those who take lives will lose their own those who kill will die but he who gives his own life away will live again  they laughed faintly nervously the police were coming out walking toward him he smiled he had said everything he intended to say it was a good little paradox he had coined they would puzzle over it remember it  smiling conger awaited a death foreordained   the end
