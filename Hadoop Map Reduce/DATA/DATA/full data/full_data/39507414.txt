39507414	the black robe  by wilkie collins     before the story     first sceneboulognesurmerthe duel  i  the doctors could do no more for the dowager lady berrick  when the medical advisers of a lady who has reached seventy years of age recommend the mild climate of the south of france they mean in plain language that they have arrived at the end of their resources her ladyship gave the mild climate a fair trial and then decided as she herself expressed it to die at home traveling slowly she had reached paris at the date when i last heard of her it was then the beginning of november a week later i met with her nephew lewis romayne at the club  what brings you to london at this time of year i asked  the fatality that pursues me he answered grimly i am one of the unluckiest men living  he was thirty years old he was not married he was the enviable possessor of the fine old country seat called vange abbey he had no poor relations and he was one of the handsomest men in england when i add that i am myself a retired army officer with a wretched income a disagreeable wife four ugly children and a burden of fifty years on my back no one will be surprised to hear that i answered romayne with bitter sincerity in these words  i wish to heaven i could change places with you  i wish to heaven you could he burst out with equal sincerity on his side read that  he handed me a letter addressed to him by the traveling medical attendant of lady berrick after resting in paris the patient had continued her homeward journey as far as boulogne in her suffering condition she was liable to sudden fits of caprice an insurmountable horror of the channel passage had got possession of her she positively refused to be taken on board the steamboat in this difficulty the lady who held the post of her companion had ventured on a suggestion would lady berrick consent to make the channel passage if her nephew came to boulogne expressly to accompany her on the voyage the reply had been so immediately favorable that the doctor lost no time in communicating with mr lewis romayne this was the substance of the letter  it was needless to ask any more questionsromayne was plainly on his way to boulogne i gave him some useful information try the oysters i said at the restaurant on the pier  he never even thanked me he was thinking entirely of himself  just look at my position he said i detest boulogne i cordially share my aunts horror of the channel passage i had looked forward to some months of happy retirement in the country among my booksand what happens to me i am brought to london in this season of fogs to travel by the tidal train at seven tomorrow morningand all for a woman with whom i have no sympathies in common if i am not an unlucky manwho is  he spoke in a tone of vehement irritation which seemed to me under the circumstances to be simply absurd but my nervous system is not the irritable systemsorely tried by night study and strong teaof my friend romayne its only a matter of two days i remarked by way of reconciling him to his situation  how do i know that he retorted in two days the weather may be stormy in two days she may be too ill to be moved unfortunately i am her heir and i am told i must submit to any whim that seizes her im rich enough already i dont want her money besides i dislike all travelingand especially traveling alone you are an idle man if you were a good friend you would offer to go with me he added with the delicacy which was one of the redeeming points in his wayward character of course as my guest  i had known him long enough not to take offense at his reminding me in this considerate way that i was a poor man the proposed change of scene tempted me what did i care for the channel passage besides there was the irresistible attraction of getting away from home the end of it was that i accepted romaynes invitation  ii  shortly after noon on the next day we were established at boulognenear lady berrick but not at her hotel if we live in the same house romayne reminded me we shall be bored by the companion and the doctor meetings on the stairs you know and exchanging bows and small talk he hated those trivial conventionalities of society in which other people delight when somebody once asked him in what company he felt most at ease he made a shocking answerhe said in the company of dogs  i waited for him on the pier while he went to see her ladyship he joined me again with his bitterest smile what did i tell you she is not well enough to see me today the doctor looks grave and the companion puts her handkerchief to her eyes we may be kept in this place for weeks to come  the afternoon proved to be rainy our early dinner was a bad one this last circumstance tried his temper sorely he was no gourmand the question of cookery was with him purely a matter of digestion those late hours of study and that abuse of tea to which i have already alluded had sadly injured his stomach the doctors warned him of serious consequences to his nervous system unless he altered his habits he had little faith in medical science and he greatly overrated the restorative capacity of his constitution so far as i know he had always neglected the doctors advice  the weather cleared toward evening and we went out for a walk we passed a churcha roman catholic church of coursethe doors of which were still open some poor women were kneeling at their prayers in the dim light wait a minute said romayne i am in a vile temper let me try to put myself into a better frame of mind  i followed him into the church he knelt down in a dark corner by himself i confess i was surprised he had been baptized in the church of england but so far as outward practice was concerned he belonged to no religious community i had often heard him speak with sincere reverence and admiration of the spirit of christianitybut he never to my knowledge attended any place of public worship when we met again outside the church i asked if he had been converted to the roman catholic faith  no he said i hate the inveterate striving of that priesthood after social influence and political power as cordially as the fiercest protestant living but let us not forget that the church of rome has great merits to set against great faults its system is administered with an admirable knowledge of the higher needs of human nature take as one example what you have just seen the solemn tranquillity of that church the poor people praying near me the few words of prayer by which i silently united myself to my fellowcreatures have calmed me and done me good in our country i should have found the church closed out of service hours he took my arm and abruptly changed the subject how will you occupy yourself he asked if my aunt receives me tomorrow  i assured him that i should easily find ways and means of getting through the time the next morning a message came from lady berrick to say that she would see her nephew after breakfast left by myself i walked toward the pier and met with a man who asked me to hire his boat he had lines and bait at my service most unfortunately as the event proved i decided on occupying an hour or two by sea fishing  the wind shifted while we were out and before we could get back to the harbor the tide had turned against us it was six oclock when i arrived at the hotel a little open carriage was waiting at the door i found romayne impatiently expecting me and no signs of dinner on the table he informed me that he had accepted an invitation in which i was included and promised to explain everything in the carriage  our driver took the road that led toward the high town i subordinated my curiosity to my sense of politeness and asked for news of his aunts health  she is seriously ill poor soul he said i am sorry i spoke so petulantly and so unfairly when we met at the club the near prospect of death has developed qualities in her nature which i ought to have seen before this no matter how it may be delayed i will patiently wait her time for the crossing to england  so long as he believed himself to be in the right he was as to his actions and opinions one of the most obstinate men i ever met with but once let him be convinced that he was wrong and he rushed into the other extremebecame needlessly distrustful of himself and needlessly eager in seizing his opportunity of making atonement in this latter mood he was capable with the best intentions of committing acts of the most childish imprudence with some misgivings i asked how he had amused himself in my absence  i waited for you he said till i lost all patience and went out for a walk first i thought of going to the beach but the smell of the harbor drove me back into the town and there oddly enough i met with a man a certain captain peterkin who had been a friend of mine at college  a visitor to boulogne i inquired  not exactly  a resident  yes the fact is i lost sight of peterkin when i left oxfordand since that time he seems to have drifted into difficulties we had a long talk he is living here he tells me until his affairs are settled  i needed no further enlightenmentcaptain peterkin stood as plainly revealed to me as if i had known him for years isnt it a little imprudent i said to renew your acquaintance with a man of that sort couldnt you have passed him with a bow  romayne smiled uneasily i daresay youre right he answered but remember i had left my aunt feeling ashamed of the unjust way in which i had thought and spoken of her how did i know that i mightnt be wronging an old friend next if i kept peterkin at a distance his present position may be as much his misfortune poor fellow as his fault i was half inclined to pass him as you saybut i distrusted my own judgment he held out his hand and he was so glad to see me it cant be helped now i shall be anxious to hear your opinion of him  are we going to dine with captain peterkin  yes i happened to mention that wretched dinner yesterday at our hotel he said come to my boardinghouse out of paris there isnt such a table dhote in france i tried to get off itnot caring as you know to go among strangersi said i had a friend with me he invited you most cordially to accompany me more excuses on my part only led to a painful result i hurt peterkins feelings im down in the world he said and im not fit company for you and your friends i beg your pardon for taking the liberty of inviting you he turned away with the tears in his eyes what could i do  i thought to myself you could have lent him five pounds and got rid of his invitation without the slightest difficulty if i had returned in reasonable time to go out with romayne we might not have met the captainor if we had met him my presence would have prevented the confidential talk and the invitation that followed i felt i was to blameand yet how could i help it it was useless to remonstrate the mischief was done  we left the old town on our right hand and drove on past a little colony of suburban villas to a house standing by itself surrounded by a stone wall as we crossed the front garden on our way to the door i noticed against the side of the house two kennels inhabited by two large watchdogs was the proprietor afraid of thieves  iii  the moment we were introduced to the drawingroom my suspicions of the company we were likely to meet with were fully confirmed  cards billiards and bettingthere was the inscription legibly written on the manner and appearance of captain peterkin the brighteyed yellow old lady who kept the boardinghouse would have been worth five thousand pounds in jewelry alone if the ornaments which profusely covered her had been genuine precious stones the younger ladies present had their cheeks as highly rouged and their eyelids as elaborately penciled in black as if they were going on the stage instead of going to dinner we found these fair creatures drinking madeira as a whet to their appetites among the men there were two who struck me as the most finished and complete blackguards whom i had ever met with in all my experience at home and abroad one with a brown face and a broken nose was presented to us by the title of commander and was described as a person of great wealth and distinction in peru traveling for amusement the other wore a military uniform and decorations and was spoken of as the general a bold bullying manner a fat sodden face little leering eyes and greasylooking hands made this man so repellent to me that i privately longed to kick him romayne had evidently been announced before our arrival as a landed gentleman with a large income men and women vied in servile attentions to him when we went into the diningroom the fascinating creature who sat next to him held her fan before her face and so made a private interview of it between the rich englishman and herself with regard to the dinner i shall only report that it justified captain peterkins boast in some degree at least the wine was good and the conversation became gay to the verge of indelicacy usually the most temperate of men romayne was tempted by his neighbors into drinking freely i was unfortunately seated at the opposite extremity of the table and i had no opportunity of warning him  the dinner reached its conclusion and we all returned together on the foreign plan to coffee and cigars in the drawingroom the women smoked and drank liqueurs as well as coffee with the men one of them went to the piano and a little impromptu ball followed the ladies dancing with their cigarettes in their mouths keeping my eyes and ears on the alert i saw an innocentlooking table with a surface of rosewood suddenly develop a substance of green cloth at the same time a neat little roulettetable made its appearance from a hidingplace in a sofa passing near the venerable landlady i heard her ask the servant in a whisper if the dogs were loose after what i had observed i could only conclude that the dogs were used as a patrol to give the alarm in case of a descent of the police it was plainly high time to thank captain peterkin for his hospitality and to take our leave  we have had enough of this i whispered to romayne in english let us go  in these days it is a delusion to suppose that you can speak confidentially in the english language when french people are within hearing one of the ladies asked romayne tenderly if he was tired of her already another reminded him that it was raining heavily as we could all hear and suggested waiting until it cleared up the hideous general waved his greasy hand in the direction of the card table and said the game is waiting for us  romayne was excited but not stupefied by the wine he had drunk he answered discreetly enough i must beg you to excuse me i am a poor card player  the general suddenly looked grave you are speaking sir under a strange misapprehension he said our game is lansquenetessentially a game of chance with luck the poorest player is a match for the whole table  romayne persisted in his refusal as a matter of course i supported him with all needful care to avoid giving offense the general took offense nevertheless he crossed his arms on his breast and looked at us fiercely  does this mean gentlemen that you distrust the company he asked  the brokennosed commander hearing the question immediately joined us in the interests of peacebearing with him the elements of persuasion under the form of a lady on his arm  the lady stepped briskly forward and tapped the general on the shoulder with her fan i am one of the company she said and i am sure mr romayne doesnt distrust me she turned to romayne with her most irresistible smile a gentleman always plays cards she resumed when he has a lady for a partner let us join our interests at the tableand dear mr romayne dont risk too much she put her pretty little purse into his hand and looked as if she had been in love with him for half her lifetime  the fatal influence of the sex assisted by wine produced the inevitable result romayne allowed himself to be led to the card table for a moment the general delayed the beginning of the game after what had happened it was necessary that he should assert the strict sense of justice that was in him we are all honorable men he began  and brave men the commander added admiring the general  and brave men the general admitted admiring the commander gentlemen if i have been led into expressing myself with unnecessary warmth of feeling i apologize and regret it  nobly spoken the commander pronounced the general put his hand on his heart and bowed the game began  as the poorest man of the two i had escaped the attentions lavished by the ladies on romayne at the same time i was obliged to pay for my dinner by taking some part in the proceedings of the evening small stakes were allowed i found at roulette and besides the heavy chances in favor of the table made it hardly worth while to run the risk of cheating in this case i placed myself next to the least rascallylooking man in the company and played roulette  for a wonder i was successful at the first attempt my neighbor handed me my winnings i have lost every farthing i possess he whispered to me piteously and i have a wife and children at home i lent the poor wretch five francs he smiled faintly as he looked at the money it reminds me he said of my last transaction when i borrowed of that gentleman there who is betting on the generals luck at the card table beware of employing him as i did what do you think i got for my note of hand of four thousand francs a hundred bottles of champagne fifty bottles of ink fifty bottles of blacking three dozen handkerchiefs two pictures by unknown masters two shawls one hundred maps andfive francs  we went on playing my luck deserted me i lost and lost and lost again from time to time i looked round at the card table the deal had fallen early to the general and it seemed to be indefinitely prolonged a heap of notes and gold won mainly from romayne as i afterward discovered lay before him as for my neighbor the unhappy possessor of the bottles of blacking the pictures by unknown masters and the rest of it he won and then rashly presumed on his good fortune deprived of his last farthing he retired into a corner of the room and consoled himself with a cigar i had just arisen to follow his example when a furious uproar burst out at the card table  i saw romayne spring up and snatch the cards out of the generals hand you scoundrel he shouted you are cheating the general started to his feet in a fury you lie he cried i attempted to interfere but romayne had already seen the necessity of controlling himself a gentleman doesnt accept an insult from a swindler he said coolly accept this then the general answeredand spat on him in an instant romayne knocked him down  the blow was dealt straight between his eyes he was a gross bigboned man and he fell heavily for the time he was stunned the women ran screaming out of the room the peaceable commander trembled from head to foot two of the men present who to give them their due were no cowards locked the doors you dont go they said till we see whether he recovers or not cold water assisted by the landladys smelling salts brought the general to his senses after a while he whispered something to one of his friends who immediately turned to me the general challenges mr romayne he said as one of his seconds i demand an appointment for tomorrow morning i refused to make any appointment unless the doors were first unlocked and we were left free to depart our carriage is waiting outside i added if it returns to the hotel without us there will be an inquiry this latter consideration had its effect on their side the doors were opened on our side the appointment was made we left the house  iv  in consenting to receive the generals representative it is needless to say that i merely desired to avoid provoking another quarrel if those persons were really impudent enough to call at the hotel i had arranged to threaten them with the interference of the police and so to put an end to the matter romayne expressed no opinion on the subject one way or the other his conduct inspired me with a feeling of uneasiness the filthy insult of which he had been made the object seemed to be rankling in his mind he went away thoughtfully to his own room have you nothing to say to me i asked he only answered wait till tomorrow  the next day the seconds appeared  i had expected to see two of the men with whom we had dined to my astonishment the visitors proved to be officers of the generals regiment they brought proposals for a hostile meeting the next morning the choice of weapons being left to romayne as the challenged man  it was now quite plain to me that the generals peculiar method of cardplaying had thus far not been discovered and exposed he might keep doubtful company and might as i afterward heard be suspected in certain quarters but that he still had formallyspeaking a reputation to preserve was proved by the appearance of the two gentlemen present as his representatives they declared with evident sincerity that romayne had made a fatal mistake had provoked the insult offered to him and had resented it by a brutal and cowardly outrage as a man and a soldier the general was doubly bound to insist on a duel no apology would be accepted even if an apology were offered  in this emergency as i understood it there was but one course to follow i refused to receive the challenge  being asked for my reasons i found it necessary to speak within certain limits though we knew the general to be a cheat it was a delicate matter to dispute his right to claim satisfaction when he had found two officers to carry his message i produced the seized cards which romayne had brought away with him in his pocket and offered them as a formal proof that my friend had not been mistaken  the secondsevidently prepared for this circumstance by their principaldeclined to examine the cards in the first place they said not even the discovery of foul play supposing the discovery to have been really made could justify romaynes conduct in the second place the generals high character made it impossible under any circumstances that he could be responsible like ourselves he had rashly associated with bad company and he had been the innocent victim of an error or a fraud committed by some other person present at the table  driven to my last resource i could now only base my refusal to receive the challenge on the ground that we were englishmen and that the practice of dueling had been abolished in england both the seconds at once declined to accept this statement in justification of my conduct  you are now in france said the elder of the two where a duel is the established remedy for an insult among gentlemen you are bound to respect the social laws of the country in which you are for the time residing if you refuse to do so you lay yourselves open to a public imputation on your courage of a nature too degrading to be more particularly alluded to let us adjourn this interview for three hours on the ground of informality we ought to confer with two gentlemen acting on mr romaynes behalf be prepared with another second to meet us and reconsider your decision before we call again  the frenchmen had barely taken their departure by one door when romayne entered by another  i have heard it all he said quietly accept the challenge  i declare solemnly that i left no means untried of opposing my friends resolution no man could have felt more strongly convinced than i did that nothing could justify the course he was taking my remonstrances were completely thrown away he was deaf to sense and reason from the moment when he had heard an imputation on his courage suggested as a possible result of any affair in which he was concerned  with your views he said i wont ask you to accompany me to the ground i can easily find french seconds and mind this if you attempt to prevent the meeting the duel will take place elsewhereand our friendship is at an end from that moment  after this i suppose it is needless to add that i accompanied him to the ground the next morning as one of his seconds  v  we were punctual to the appointed houreight oclock  the second who acted with me was a french gentleman a relative of one of the officers who had brought the challenge at his suggestion we had chosen the pistol as our weapon romayne like most englishmen at the present time knew nothing of the use of the sword he was almost equally inexperienced with the pistol  our opponents were late they kept us waiting for more than ten minutes it was not pleasant weather to wait in the day had dawned damp and drizzling a thick white fog was slowly rolling in on us from the sea  when they did appear the general was not among them a tall welldressed young man saluted romayne with stern courtesy and said to a stranger who accompanied him explain the circumstances  the stranger proved to be a surgeon he entered at once on the necessary explanation the general was too ill to appear he had been attacked that morning by a fitthe consequence of the blow that he had received under these circumstances his eldest son maurice was now on the ground to fight the duel on his fathers behalf attended by the generals seconds and with the generals full approval  we instantly refused to allow the duel to take place romayne loudly declaring that he had no quarrel with the generals son upon this maurice broke away from his seconds drew off one of his gloves and stepping close up to romayne struck him on the face with the glove have you no quarrel with me now the young frenchman asked must i spit on you as my father did his seconds dragged him away and apologized to us for the outbreak but the mischief was done romaynes fiery temper flashed in his eyes load the pistols he said after the insult publicly offered to him and the outrage publicly threatened there was no other course to take  it had been left to us to produce the pistols we therefore requested the seconds of our opponent to examine and to load them while this was being done the advancing seafog so completely enveloped us that the duelists were unable to see each other we were obliged to wait for the chance of a partial clearing in the atmosphere romaynes temper had become calm again the generosity of his nature spoke in the words which he now addressed to his seconds after all he said the young man is a good sonhe is bent on redressing what he believes to be his fathers wrong does his flipping his glove in my face matter to me i think i shall fire in the air  i shall refuse to act as your second if you do answered the french gentleman who was assisting us the generals son is famous for his skill with the pistol if you didnt see it in his face just now i didhe means to kill you defend your life sir i spoke quite as strongly to the same purpose when my turn came romayne yieldedhe placed himself unreservedly in our hands  in a quarter of an hour the fog lifted a little we measured the distance having previously arranged at my suggestion that the two men should both fire at the same moment at a given signal romaynes composure as they faced each other was in a man of his irritable nervous temperament really wonderful i placed him sidewise in a position which in some degree lessened his danger by lessening the surface exposed to the bullet my french colleague put the pistol into his hand and gave him the last word of advice let your arm hang loosely down with the barrel of the pistol pointing straight to the ground when you hear the signal only lift your arm as far as the elbow keep the elbow pressed against your sideand fire we could do no more for him as we drew asidei own itmy tongue was like a cinder in my mouth and a horrid inner cold crept through me to the marrow of my bones  the signal was given and the two shots were fired at the same time  my first look was at romayne he took off his hat and handed it to me with a smile his adversarys bullet had cut a piece out of the brim of his hat on the right side he had literally escaped by a hairbreadth  while i was congratulating him the fog gathered again more thickly than ever looking anxiously toward the ground occupied by our adversaries we could only see vague shadowy forms hurriedly crossing and recrossing each other in the mist something had happened my french colleague took my arm and pressed it significantly leave me to inquire he said romayne tried to follow i held him backwe neither of us exchanged a word  the fog thickened and thickened until nothing was to be seen once we heard the surgeons voice calling impatiently for a light to help him no light appeared that we could see dreary as the fog itself the silence gathered round us again on a sudden it was broken horribly broken by another voice strange to both of us shrieking hysterically through the impenetrable mist where is he the voice cried in the french language assassin assassin where are you was it a woman or was it a boy we heard nothing more the effect upon romayne was terrible to see he who had calmly confronted the weapon lifted to kill him shuddered dumbly like a terrorstricken animal i put my arm round him and hurried him away from the place  we waited at the hotel until our french friend joined us after a brief interval he appeared announcing that the surgeon would follow him  the duel had ended fatally the chance course of the bullet urged by romaynes unpracticed hand had struck the generals son just above the right nostrilhad penetrated to the back of his neckand had communicated a fatal shock to the spinal marrow he was a dead man before they could take him back to his fathers house  so far our fears were confirmed but there was something else to tell for which our worst presentiments had not prepared us  a younger brother of the fallen man a boy of thirteen years old had secretly followed the dueling party on their way from his fathers househad hidden himselfand had seen the dreadful end the seconds only knew of it when he burst out of his place of concealment and fell on his knees by his dying brothers side his were the frightful cries which we had heard from invisible lips the slayer of his brother was the assassin whom he had vainly tried to discover through the fathomless obscurity of the mist  we both looked at romayne he silently looked back at us like a man turned to stone i tried to reason with him  your life was at your opponents mercy i said it was he who was skilled in the use of the pistol your risk was infinitely greater than his are you responsible for an accident rouse yourself romayne think of the time to come when all this will be forgotten  never he said to the end of my life  he made that reply in dull monotonous tones his eyes looked wearily and vacantly straight before him i spoke to him again he remained impenetrably silent he appeared not to hear or not to understand me the surgeon came in while i was still at a loss what to say or do next without waiting to be asked for his opinion he observed romayne attentively and then drew me away into the next room  your friend is suffering from a severe nervous shock he said can you tell me anything of his habits of life  i mentioned the prolonged night studies and the excessive use of tea the surgeon shook his head  if you want my advice he proceeded take him home at once dont subject him to further excitement when the result of the duel is known in the town if it ends in our appearing in a court of law it will be a mere formality in this case and you can surrender when the time comes leave me your address in london  i felt that the wisest thing i could do was to follow his advice the boat crossed to folkestone at an early hour that daywe had no time to lose romayne offered no objection to our return to england he seemed perfectly careless what became of him leave me quiet he said and do as you like i wrote a few lines to lady berricks medical attendant informing him of the circumstances a quarter of an hour afterward we were on board the steamboat  there were very few passengers after we had left the harbor my attention was attracted by a young english ladytraveling apparently with her mother as we passed her on the deck she looked at romayne with compassionate interest so vividly expressed in her beautiful face that i imagined they might be acquainted with some difficulty i prevailed sufficiently over the torpor that possessed him to induce him to look at our fellow passenger  do you know that charming person i asked  no he replied with the weariest indifference i never saw her before im tiredtiredtired dont speak to me leave me by myself  i left him his rare personal attractionsof which let me add he never appeared to be conscioushad evidently made their natural appeal to the interest and admiration of the young lady who had met him by chance the expression of resigned sadness and suffering now visible in his face added greatly no doubt to the influence that he had unconsciously exercised over the sympathies of a delicate and sensitive woman it was no uncommon circumstance in his past experience of the sexas i myself well knewto be the object not of admiration only but of true and ardent love he had never reciprocated the passionhad never even appeared to take it seriously marriage might as the phrase is be the salvation of him would he ever marry  leaning over the bulwark idly pursuing this train of thought i was recalled to present things by a low sweet voicethe voice of the lady of whom i had been thinking  excuse me for disturbing you she said i think your friend wants you  she spoke with the modesty and selfpossession of a highlybred woman a little heightening of her color made her to my eyes more beautiful than ever i thanked her and hastened back to romayne  he was standing by the barred skylight which guarded the machinery i instantly noticed a change in him his eyes wandering here and there in search of me had more than recovered their animationthere was a wild look of terror in them he seized me roughly by the arm and pointed down to the engineroom  what do you hear there he asked  i hear the thump of the engines  nothing else  nothing what do you hear  he suddenly turned away  ill tell you he said when we get on shore     second scenevange abbeythe forewarnings  vi  as we approached the harbor at folkestone romaynes agitation appeared to subside his head drooped his eyes half closedhe looked like a weary man quietly falling asleep  on leaving the steamboat i ventured to ask our charming fellowpassenger if i could be of any service in reserving places in the london train for her mother and herself she thanked me and said they were going to visit some friends at folkestone in making this reply she looked at romayne i am afraid he is very ill she said in gently lowered tones before i could answer her mother turned to her with an expression of surprise and directed her attention to the friends whom she had mentioned waiting to greet her her last look as they took her away rested tenderly and sorrowfully on romayne he never returned ithe was not even aware of it as i led him to the train he leaned more and more heavily on my arm seated in the carriage he sank at once into profound sleep  we drove to the hotel at which my friend was accustomed to reside when he was in london his long sleep on the journey seemed in some degree to have relieved him we dined together in his private room when the servants had withdrawn i found that the unhappy result of the duel was still preying on his mind  the horror of having killed that man he said is more than i can bear alone for gods sake dont leave me  i had received letters at boulogne which informed me that my wife and family had accepted an invitation to stay with some friends at the seaside under these circumstances i was entirely at his service having quieted his anxiety on this point i reminded him of what had passed between us on board the steamboat he tried to change the subject my curiosity was too strongly aroused to permit this i persisted in helping his memory  we were looking into the engineroom i said and you asked me what i heard there you promised to tell me what you heard as soon as we got on shore  he stopped me before i could say more  i begin to think it was a delusion he answered you ought not to interpret too literally what a person in my dreadful situation may say the stain of another mans blood is on me  i interrupted him in my turn i refuse to hear you speak of yourself in that way i said you are no more responsible for the frenchmans death than if you had been driving and had accidentally run over him in the street i am not the right companion for a man who talks as you do the proper person to be with you is a doctor i really felt irritated with himand i saw no reason for concealing it  another man in his place might have been offended with me there was a native sweetness in romaynes disposition which asserted itself even in his worst moments of nervous irritability he took my hand  dont be hard on me he pleaded i will try to think of it as you do make some little concession on your side i want to see how i get through the night we will return to what i said to you on board the steamboat tomorrow morning is it agreed  it was agreed of course there was a door of communication between our bedrooms at his suggestion it was left open if i find i cant sleep he explained i want to feel assured that you can hear me if i call to you  three times in the night i woke and seeing the light burning in his room looked in at him he always carried some of his books with him when he traveled on each occasion when i entered the room he was reading quietly i suppose i forestalled my nights sleep on the railway he said it doesnt matter i am content something that i was afraid of has not happened i am used to wakeful nights go back to bed and dont be uneasy about me  the next morning the deferred explanation was put off again  do you mind waiting a little longer he asked  not if you particularly wish it  will you do me another favor you know that i dont like london the noise in the streets is distracting besides i may tell you i have a sort of distrust of noise since he stopped with an appearance of confusion  since i found you looking into the engineroom i asked  yes i dont feel inclined to trust the chances of another night in london i want to try the effect of perfect quiet do you mind going back with me to vange dull as the place is you can amuse yourself there is good shooting as you know  in an hour more we had left london  vii  vange abbey is i suppose the most solitary country house in england if romayne wanted quiet it was exactly the place for him  on the rising ground of one of the wildest moors in the north riding of yorkshire the ruins of the old monastery are visible from all points of the compass there are traditions of thriving villages clustering about the abbey in the days of the monks and of hostleries devoted to the reception of pilgrims from every part of the christian world not a vestige of these buildings is left they were deserted by the pious inhabitants it is said at the time when henry the eighth suppressed the monasteries and gave the abbey and the broad lands of vange to his faithful friend and courtier sir miles romayne in the next generation the son and heir of sir miles built the dwellinghouse helping himself liberally from the solid stone walls of the monastery with some unimportant alterations and repairs the house stands defying time and weather to the present day  at the last station on the railway the horses were waiting for us it was a lovely moonlight night and we shortened the distance considerably by taking the bridle path over the moor between nine and ten oclock we reached the abbey  years had passed since i had last been romaynes guest nothing out of the house or in the house seemed to have undergone any change in the interval neither the good northcountry butler nor his buxom scotch wife skilled in cookery looked any older they received me as if i had left them a day or two since and had come back again to live in yorkshire my wellremembered bedroom was waiting for me and the matchless old madeira welcomed us when my host and i met in the innerhall which was the ordinary diningroom of the abbey  as we faced each other at the wellspread table i began to hope that the familiar influences of his country home were beginning already to breathe their blessed quiet over the disturbed mind of romayne in the presence of his faithful old servants he seemed to be capable of controlling the morbid remorse that oppressed him he spoke to them composedly and kindly he was affectionately glad to see his old friend once more in the old house  when we were near the end of our meal something happened that startled me i had just handed the wine to romayne and he had filled his glasswhen he suddenly turned pale and lifted his head like a man whose attention is unexpectedly roused no person but ourselves was in the room i was not speaking to him at the time he looked round suspiciously at the door behind him leading into the library and rang the oldfashioned handbell which stood by him on the table the servant was directed to close the door  are you cold i asked  no he reconsidered that brief answer and contradicted himself yesthe library fire has burned low i suppose  in my position at the table i had seen the fire the grate was heaped with blazing coals and wood i said nothing the pale change in his face and his contradictory reply roused doubts in me which i had hoped never to feel again  he pushed away his glass of wine and still kept his eyes fixed on the closed door his attitude and expression were plainly suggestive of the act of listening listening to what  after an interval he abruptly addressed me do you call it a quiet night he said  as quiet as quiet can be i replied the wind has droppedand even the fire doesnt crackle perfect stillness indoors and out  out he repeated for a moment he looked at me intently as if i had started some new idea in his mind i asked as lightly as i could if i had said anything to surprise him instead of answering me he sprang to his feet with a cry of terror and left the room  i hardly knew what to do it was impossible unless he returned immediately to let this extraordinary proceeding pass without notice after waiting for a few minutes i rang the bell  the old butler came in he looked in blank amazement at the empty chair wheres the master he asked  i could only answer that he had left the table suddenly without a word of explanation he may perhaps be ill i added as his old servant you can do no harm if you go and look for him say that i am waiting here if he wants me  the minutes passed slowly and more slowly i was left alone for so long a time that i began to feel seriously uneasy my hand was on the bell again when there was a knock at the door i had expected to see the butler it was the groom who entered the room  garthwaite cant come down to you sir said the man he asks if you will please go up to the master on the belvidere  the houseextending round three sides of a squarewas only two stories high the flat roof accessible through a species of hatchway and still surrounded by its sturdy stone parapet was called the belvidere in reference as usual to the fine view which it commanded fearing i knew not what i mounted the ladder which led to the roof romayne received me with a harsh outburst of laughterthat saddest false laughter which is true trouble in disguise  heres something to amuse you he cried i believe old garthwaite thinks i am drunkhe wont leave me up here by myself  letting this strange assertion remain unanswered the butler withdrew as he passed me on his way to the ladder he whispered be careful of the master i tell you sir he has a bee in his bonnet this night  although not of the north country myself i knew the meaning of the phrase garthwaite suspected that the master was nothing less than mad  romayne took my arm when we were alonewe walked slowly from end to end of the belvidere the moon was by this time low in the heavens but her mild mysterious light still streamed over the roof of the house and the high heathy ground round it i looked attentively at romayne he was deadly pale his hand shook as it rested on my armand that was all neither in look nor manner did he betray the faintest sign of mental derangement he had perhaps needlessly alarmed the faithful old servant by something that he had said or done i determined to clear up that doubt immediately  you left the table very suddenly i said did you feel ill  not ill he replied i was frightened look at meim frightened still  what do you mean  instead of answering he repeated the strange question which he had put to me downstairs  do you call it a quiet night  considering the time of year and the exposed situation of the house the night was almost preternaturally quiet throughout the vast open country all round us not even a breath of air could be heard the nightbirds were away or were silent at the time but one sound was audible when we stood still and listenedthe cool quiet bubble of a little stream lost to view in the valleyground to the south  i have told you already i said so still a night i never remember on this yorkshire moor  he laid one hand heavily on my shoulder what did the poor boy say of me whose brother i killed he asked what words did we hear through the dripping darkness of the mist  i wont encourage you to think of them i refuse to repeat the words  he pointed over the northward parapet  it doesnt matter whether you accept or refuse he said i hear the boy at this momentthere  he repeated the horrid wordsmarking the pauses in the utterance of them with his finger as if they were sounds that he heard  assassin assassin where are you  good god i cried you dont mean that you really hear the voice  do you hear what i say i hear the boy as plainly as you hear me the voice screams at me through the clear moonlight as it screamed at me through the seafog again and again its all round the house that way now where the light just touches on the tops of the heather tell the servants to have the horses ready the first thing in the morning we leave vange abbey tomorrow  these were wild words if he had spoken them wildly i might have shared the butlers conclusion that his mind was deranged there was no undue vehemence in his voice or his manner he spoke with a melancholy resignationhe seemed like a prisoner submitting to a sentence that he had deserved remembering the cases of men suffering from nervous disease who had been haunted by apparitions i asked if he saw any imaginary figure under the form of a boy  i see nothing he said i only hear look yourself it is in the last degree improbablebut let us make sure that nobody has followed me from boulogne and is playing me a trick  we made the circuit of the belvidere on its eastward side the house wall was built against one of the towers of the old abbey on the westward side the ground sloped steeply down to a deep pool or tarn northward and southward there was nothing to be seen but the open moor look where i might with the moonlight to make the view plain to me the solitude was as void of any living creature as if we had been surrounded by the awful dead world of the moon  was it the boys voice that you heard on the voyage across the channel i asked  yes i heard it for the first timedown in the engineroom rising and falling rising and falling like the sound of the engines themselves  and when did you hear it again  i feared to hear it in london it left me i should have told you when we stepped ashore out of the steamboat i was afraid that the noise of the traffic in the streets might bring it back to me as you know i passed a quiet night i had the hope that my imagination had deceived methat i was the victim of a delusion as people say it is no delusion in the perfect tranquillity of this place the voice has come back to me while we were at table i heard it againbehind me in the library i heard it still when the door was shut i ran up here to try if it would follow me into the open air it has followed me we may as well go down again into the hall i know now that there is no escaping from it my dear old home has become horrible to me do you mind returning to london tomorrow  what i felt and feared in this miserable state of things matters little the one chance i could see for romayne was to obtain the best medical advice i sincerely encouraged his idea of going back to london the next day  we had sat together by the hall fire for about ten minutes when he took out his handkerchief and wiped away the perspiration from his forehead drawing a deep breath of relief it has gone he said faintly  when you hear the boys voice i asked do you hear it continuously  no at intervals sometimes longer sometimes shorter  and thus far it comes to you suddenly and leaves you suddenly  yes  do my questions annoy you  i make no complaint he said sadly you can see for yourselfi patiently suffer the punishment that i have deserved  i contradicted him at once it is nothing of the sort its a nervous malady which medical science can control and cure wait till we get to london  this expression of opinion produced no effect on him  i have taken the life of a fellowcreature he said i have closed the career of a young man who but for me might have lived long and happily and honorably say what you may i am of the race of cain he had the mark set on his brow i have my ordeal delude yourself if you like with false hopes i can endureand hope for nothing goodnight  viii  early the next morning the good old butler came to me in great perturbation for a word of advice  do come sir and look at the master i cant find it in my heart to wake him  it was time to wake him if we were to go to london that day i went into the bedroom although i was no doctor the restorative importance of that profound and quiet sleep impressed itself on me so strongly that i took the responsibility of leaving him undisturbed the event proved that i had acted wisely he slept until noon there was no return of the torment of the voiceas he called it poor fellow we passed a quiet day excepting one little interruption which i am warned not to pass over without a word of record in this narrative  we had returned from a ride romayne had gone into the library to read and i was just leaving the stables after a look at some recent improvements when a ponychaise with a gentleman in it drove up to the door he asked politely if he might be allowed to see the house there were some fine pictures at vange as well as many interesting relics of antiquity and the rooms were shown in romaynes absence to the very few travelers who were adventurous enough to cross the heathy desert that surrounded the abbey on this occasion the stranger was informed that mr romayne was at home he at once apologizedwith an appearance of disappointment however which induced me to step forward and speak to him  mr romayne is not very well i said and i cannot venture to ask you into the house but you will be welcome i am sure to walk round the grounds and to look at the ruins of the abbey  he thanked me and accepted the invitation i find no great difficulty in describing him generally he was elderly fat and cheerful buttoned up in a long black frockcoat and presenting that closely shaven face and that inveterate expression of watchful humility about the eyes which we all associate with the reverend personality of a priest  to my surprise he seemed in some degree at least to know his way about the place he made straight for the dreary little lake which i have already mentioned and stood looking at it with an interest which was so incomprehensible to me that i own i watched him  he ascended the slope of the moorland and entered the gate which led to the grounds all that the gardeners had done to make the place attractive failed to claim his attention he walked past lawns shrubs and flowerbeds and only stopped at an old stone fountain which tradition declared to have been one of the ornaments of the garden in the time of the monks having carefully examined this relic of antiquity he took a sheet of paper from his pocket and consulted it attentively it might have been a plan of the house and grounds or it might noti can only report that he took the path which led him by the shortest way to the ruined abbey church  as he entered the roofless inclosure he reverently removed his hat it was impossible for me to follow him any further without exposing myself to the risk of discovery i sat down on one of the fallen stones waiting to see him again it must have been at least half an hour before he appeared he thanked me for my kindness as composedly as if he had quite expected to find me in the place that i occupied  i have been deeply interested in all that i have seen he said may i venture to ask what is perhaps an indiscreet question on the part of a stranger  i ventured on my side to inquire what the question might be  mr romayne is indeed fortunate he resumed in the possession of this beautiful place he is a young man i think  yes  is he married  no  excuse my curiosity the owner of vange abbey is an interesting person to all good antiquaries like myself many thanks again goodday  his ponychaise took him away his last look restednot on mebut on the old abbey  ix  my record of events approaches its conclusion  on the next day we returned to the hotel in london at romaynes suggestion i sent the same evening to my own house for any letters which might be waiting for me his mind still dwelt on the duel he was morbidly eager to know if any communication had been received from the french surgeon  when the messenger returned with my letters the boulogne postmark was on one of the envelopes at romaynes entreaty this was the letter that i opened first the surgeons signature was at the end  one motive for anxietyon my partwas set at rest in the first lines after an official inquiry into the circumstances the french authorities had decided that it was not expedient to put the survivor of the duelists on his trial before a court of law no jury hearing the evidence would find him guilty of the only charge that could be formally brought against himthe charge of homicide by premeditation homicide by misadventure occurring in a duel was not a punishable offense by the french law my correspondent cited many cases in proof of it strengthened by the publiclyexpressed opinion of the illustrious berryer himself in a word we had nothing to fear  the next page of the letter informed us that the police had surprised the card playing community with whom we had spent the evening at boulogne and that the muchbejeweled old landlady had been sent to prison for the offense of keeping a gamblinghouse it was suspected in the town that the general was more or less directly connected with certain disreputable circumstances discovered by the authorities in any case he had retired from active service  he and his wife and family had left boulogne and had gone away in debt no investigation had thus far succeeded in discovering the place of their retreat  reading this letter aloud to romayne i was interrupted by him at the last sentence  the inquiries must have been carelessly made he said i will see to it myself  what interest can you have in the inquiries i exclaimed  the strongest possible interest he answered it has been my one hope to make some little atonement to the poor people whom i have so cruelly wronged if the wife and children are in distressed circumstances which seems to be only too likely i may place them beyond the reach of anxietyanonymously of course give me the surgeons address i shall write instructions for tracing them at my expensemerely announcing that an unknown friend desires to be of service to the generals family  this appeared to me to be a most imprudent thing to do i said so plainlyand quite in vain with his customary impetuosity he wrote the letter at once and sent it to the post that night  x  on the question of submitting himself to medical advice which i now earnestly pressed upon him romayne was disposed to be equally unreasonable but in this case events declared themselves in my favor  lady berricks last reserves of strength had given way she had been brought to london in a dying state while we were at vange abbey romayne was summoned to his aunts bedside on the third day of our residence at the hotel and was present at her death the impression produced on his mind roused the better part of his nature he was more distrustful of himself more accessible to persuasion than usual in this gentler frame of mind he received a welcome visit from an old friend to whom he was sincerely attached the visitof no great importance in itselfled as i have since been informed to very serious events in romaynes later life for this reason i briefly relate what took place within my own healing  lord loringwell known in society as the head of an old english catholic family and the possessor of a magnificent gallery of pictureswas distressed by the change for the worse which he perceived in romayne when he called at the hotel i was present when they met and rose to leave the room feeling that the two friends might perhaps be embarrassed by the presence of a third person romayne called me back lord loring ought to know what has happened to me he said i have no heart to speak of it myself tell him everything and if he agrees with you i will submit to see the doctors with those words he left us together  it is almost needless to say that lord loring did agree with me he was himself disposed to think that the moral remedy in romaynes case might prove to be the best remedy  with submission to what the doctors may decide his lordship said the right thing to do in my opinion is to divert our friends mind from himself i see a plain necessity for making a complete change in the solitary life that he has been leading for years past why shouldnt he marry a womans influence by merely giving a new turn to his thoughts might charm away that horrible voice which haunts him perhaps you think this a merely sentimental view of the case look at it practically if you like and you come to the same conclusion with that fine estateand with the fortune which he has now inherited from his auntit is his duty to marry dont you agree with me  i agree most cordially but i see serious difficulties in your lordships way romayne dislikes society and as to marrying his coldness toward women seems so far as i can judge to be one of the incurable defects of his character  lord loring smiled my dear sir nothing of that sort is incurable if we can only find the right woman  the tone in which he spoke suggested to me that he had got the right womanand i took the liberty of saying so he at once acknowledged that i had guessed right  romayne is as you say a difficult subject to deal with he resumed if i commit the slightest imprudence i shall excite his suspicionand there will be an end of my hope of being of service to him i shall proceed carefully i can tell you luckily poor dear fellow he is fond of pictures its quite natural that i should ask him to see some recent additions to my galleryisnt it there is the trap that i set i have a sweet girl to tempt him staying at my house who is a little out of health and spirits herself at the right moment i shall send word upstairs she may well happen to look in at the gallery by the merest accident just at the time when romayne is looking at my new pictures the rest depends of course on the effect she produces if you knew her i believe you would agree with me that the experiment is worth trying  not knowing the lady i had little faith in the success of the experiment no one however could doubt lord lorings admirable devotion to his friendand with that i was fain to be content  when romayne returned to us it was decided to submit his case to a consultation of physicians at the earliest possible moment when lord loring took his departure i accompanied him to the door of the hotel perceiving that he wished to say a word more to me in private he had it seemed decided on waiting for the result of the medical consultation before he tried the effect of the young ladys attractions and he wished to caution me against speaking prematurely of visiting the picture gallery to our friend  not feeling particularly interested in these details of the worthy noblemans little plot i looked at his carriage and privately admired the two splendid horses that drew it the footman opened the door for his master and i became aware for the first time that a gentleman had accompanied lord loring to the hotel and had waited for him in the carriage the gentleman bent forward and looked up from a book that he was reading to my astonishment i recognized the elderly fat and cheerful priest who had shown such a knowledge of localities and such an extraordinary interest in vange abbey  it struck me as an odd coincidence that i should see the man again in london so soon after i had met with him in yorkshire this was all i thought about it at the time if i had known then what i know now i might have dreamed let us say of throwing that priest into the lake at vange and might have reckoned the circumstance among the wiselyimproved opportunities of my life  to return to the serious interests of the present narrative i may now announce that my evidence as an eyewitness of events has come to an end the day after lord lorings visit domestic troubles separated me to my most sincere regret from romayne i have only to add that the foregoing narrative of personal experience has been written with a due sense of responsibility and that it may be depended on throughout as an exact statement of the truth  john philip hynd late major 110th regiment     the story     book the first    chapter i  the confidences  in an upper room of one of the palatial houses which are situated on the north side of hyde park two ladies sat at breakfast and gossiped over their tea  the elder of the two was lady loringstill in the prime of life possessed of the golden hair and the clear blue eyes the delicatelyflorid complexion and the freely developed figure which are among the favorite attractions popularly associated with the beauty of englishwomen her younger companion was the unknown lady admired by major hynd on the sea passage from france to england with hair and eyes of the darkest brown with a pure pallor of complexion only changing to a faint rose tint in moments of agitation with a tall graceful figure incompletely developed in substance and strengthshe presented an almost complete contrast to lady loring two more opposite types of beauty it would have been hardly possible to place at the same table  the servant brought in the letters of the morning lady loring ran through her correspondence rapidly pushed away the letters in a heap and poured herself out a second cup of tea  nothing interesting this morning for me she said any news of your mother stella  the young lady handed an open letter to her hostess with a faint smile see for yourself adelaide she answered with the tender sweetness of tone which made her voice irresistibly charmingand tell me if there were ever two women so utterly unlike each other as my mother and myself  lady loring ran through the letter as she had run through her own correspondence never dearest stella have i enjoyed myself as i do in this delightful country housetwentyseven at dinner every day without including the neighborsa little carpet dance every eveningwe play billiards and go into the smoking roomthe hounds meet three times a weekall sorts of celebrities among the company famous beauties includedsuch dresses such conversationand serious duties my dear not neglectedhigh church and choral service in the town on sundaysrecitations in the evening from paradise lost by an amateur elocutionistoh you foolish headstrong child why did you make excuses and stay in london when you might have accompanied me to this earthly paradiseare you really illmy love to lady loringand of course if you are ill you must have medical advicethey ask after you so kindly herethe first dinner bell is ringing before i have half done my letterwhat am i to wearwhy is my daughter not here to advise me etc etc etc  there is time to change your mind and advise your mother lady loring remarked with grave irony as she returned the letter  dont even speak of it said stella i really know no life that i should not prefer to the life that my mother is enjoying at this moment what should i have done adelaide if you had not offered me a happy refuge in your house my earthly paradise is here where i am allowed to dream away my time over my drawings and my books and to resign myself to poor health and low spirits without being dragged into society and worse still threatened with that medical advice in which when she isnt threatened with it herself my poor dear mother believes so implicitly i wish you would hire me as your companion and let me stay here for the rest of my life  lady lorings bright face became grave while stella was speaking  my dear she said kindly i know well how you love retirement and how differently you think and feel from other young women of your age and i am far from forgetting what sad circumstances have encouraged the natural bent of your disposition but since you have been staying with me this time i see something in you which my intimate knowledge of your character fails to explain we have been friends since we were together at schooland in those old days we never had any secrets from each other you are feeling some anxiety or brooding over some sorrow of which i know nothing i dont ask for your confidence i only tell you what i have noticedand i say with all my heart stella i am sorry for you  she rose and with intuitive delicacy changed the subject i am going out earlier than usual this morning she resumed is there anything i can do for you she laid her hand tenderly on stellas shoulder waiting for the reply stella lifted the hand and kissed it with passionate fondness  dont think me ungrateful she said i am only ashamed her head sank on her bosom she burst into tears  lady loring waited by her in silence she well knew the girls selfcontained nature always shrinking except in moments of violent emotion from the outward betrayal of its trials and its sufferings to others the true depth of feeling which is marked by this inbred modesty is most frequently found in men the few women who possess it are without the communicative consolations of the feminine heart they are the noblestand but too often the unhappiest of their sex  will you wait a little before you go out stella asked softly  lady loring returned to the chair that she had lefthesitated for a momentand then drew it nearer to stella shall i sit by you she said  close by me you spoke of our school days just now adelaide there was some difference between us of all the girls i was the youngestand you were the eldest or nearly the eldest i think  quite the eldest my dear there is a difference of ten years between us but why do you go back to that  its only a recollection my father was alive then i was at first homesick and frightened in the strange place among the big girls you used to let me hide my face on your shoulder and tell me stories may i hide in the old way and tell my story  she was now the calmest of the two the elder woman turned a little pale and looked down in silent anxiety at the darkly beautiful head that rested on her shoulder  after such an experience as mine has been said stella would you think it possible that i could ever again feel my heart troubled by a manand that man a stranger  my dear i think it quite possible you are only now in your twentythird year you were innocent of all blame at that wretched bygone time which you ought never to speak of again love and be happy stellaif you can only find the man who is worthy of you but you frighten me when you speak of a stranger where did you meet with him  on our way back from paris  traveling in the same carriage with you  noit was in crossing the channel there were few travelers in the steamboat or i might never have noticed him  did he speak to you  i dont think he even looked at me  that doesnt say much for his taste stella  you dont understand i mean i have not explained myself properly he was leaning on the arm of a friend weak and worn and wasted as i supposed by some long and dreadful illness there was an angelic sweetness in his facesuch patience such resignation for heavens sake keep my secret one hears of men falling in love with women at first sight but a woman who looks at a man and feelsoh its shameful i could hardly take my eyes off him if he had looked at me in return i dont know what i should have donei burn when i think of it he was absorbed in his suffering and his sorrow my last look at his beautiful face was on the pier before they took me away the perfect image of him has been in my heart ever since in my dreams i see him as plainly as i see you now dont despise me adelaide  my dear you interest me indescribably do you suppose he was in our rank of life i mean of course did he look like a gentleman  there could be no doubt of it  do try to describe him stella was he tall and well dressed  neither tall nor shortrather thinquiet and graceful in all his movementsdressed plainly in perfect taste how can i describe him when his friend brought him on board he stood at the side of the vessel looking out thoughtfully toward the sea such eyes i never saw before adelaide in any human faceso divinely tender and sadand the color of them that dark violet blue so uncommon and so beautifultoo beautiful for a man i may say the same of his hair i saw it completely for a minute or two he removed his hathis head was fevered i thinkand he let the sea breeze blow over it the pure light brown of his hair was just warmed by a lovely reddish tinge his beard was of the same color short and curling like the beards of the roman heroes one sees in pictures i shall never see him againand it is best for me that i shall not what can i hope from a man who never once noticed me but i should like to hear that he had recovered his health and his tranquillity and that his life was a happy one it has been a comfort to me adelaide to open my heart to you i am getting bold enough to confess everything would you laugh at me i wonder if i  she stopped her pale complexion softly glowed into color her grand dark eyes brightenedshe looked her loveliest at that moment  i am far more inclined stella to cry over you than to laugh at you said lady loring there is something to my mind very sad about this adventure of yours i wish i could find out who the man is even the best description of a person falls so short of the reality  i thought of showing you something stella continued which might help you to see him as i saw him its only making one more acknowledgment of my own folly  you dont mean a portrait of him lady loring exclaimed  the best that i could do from recollection stella answered sadly  bring it here directly  stella left the room and returned with a little drawing in pencil the instant lady loring looked at it she recognized romayne and started excitedly to her feet  you know him cried stella  lady loring had placed herself in an awkward position her husband had described to her his interview with major hynd and had mentioned his project for bringing romayne and stella together after first exacting a promise of the strictest secrecy from his wife she felt herself bounddoubly bound after what she had now discoveredto respect the confidence placed in her and this at the time when she had betrayed herself to stella with a womans feline fineness of perception in all cases of subterfuge and concealment she picked a part of the truth out of the whole and answered harmlessly without a moments hesitation  i have certainly seen him she saidprobably at some party but i see so many people and i go to so many places that i must ask for time to consult my memory my husband might help me if you dont object to my asking him she added slyly  stella snatched the drawing away from her in terror you dont mean that you will tell lord loring she said  my dear child how can you be so foolish cant i show him the drawing without mentioning who it was done by his memory is a much better one than mine if i say to him where did we meet that manhe may tell me at oncehe may even remember the name of course if you like to be kept in suspense you have only to say so it rests with you to decide  poor stella gave way directly she returned the drawing and affectionately kissed her artful friend having now secured the means of consulting her husband without exciting suspicion lady loring left the room  at that time in the morning lord loring was generally to be found either in the library or the picture gallery his wife tried the library first on entering the room she found but one person in itnot the person of whom she was in search there buttoned up in his long frock coat and surrounded by books of all sorts and sizes sat the plump elderly priest who had been the especial object of major hynds aversion  i beg your pardon father benwell said lady loring i hope i dont interrupt your studies  father benwell rose and bowed with a pleasant paternal smile i am only trying to organize an improved arrangement of the library he said simply books are companionable creaturesmembers as it were of his family to a lonely old priest like myself can i be of any service to your ladyship  thank you father if you can kindly tell me where lord loring is  to be sure his lordship was here five minutes sincehe is now in the picture gallery pray permit me  with a remarkably light and easy step for a man of his age and size he advanced to the further end of the library and opened a door which led into the gallery  lord loring is among the pictures he announced and alone he laid a certain emphasis on the last word which might or might not in the case of a spiritual director of the household invite a word of explanation  lady loring merely said just what i wanted thank you once more father benwelland passed into the picture gallery  left by himself again in the library the priest walked slowly to and fro thinking his latent power and resolution began to show themselves darkly in his face a skilled observer would now have seen plainly revealed in him the habit of command and the capacity for insisting on his right to be obeyed from head to foot father benwell was one of those valuable soldiers of the church who acknowledge no defeat and who improve every victory  after a while he returned to the table at which he had been writing when lady loring entered the room an unfinished letter lay open on the desk he took up his pen and completed it in these words i have therefore decided on trusting this serious matter in the hands of arthur penrose i know he is youngbut we have to set against the drawback of his youth the countermerits of his incorruptible honesty and his true religious zeal no better man is just now within my reachand there is no time to lose romayne has recently inherited a large increase of fortune he will be the object of the basest conspiraciesconspiracies of men to win his money and worse still of women to marry him even these contemptible efforts may be obstacles in the way of our righteous purpose unless we are first in the field penrose left oxford last week i expect him here this morning by my invitation when i have given him the necessary instructions and have found the means of favorably introducing him to romayne i shall have the honor of forwarding a statement of our prospects so far  having signed these lines he addressed the letter to the reverend the secretary society of jesus rome as he closed and sealed the envelope a servant opened the door communicating with the hall and announced  mr arthur penrose    chapter ii  the jesuits  father benwell rose and welcomed the visitor with his paternal smile i am heartily glad to see you he saidand held out his hand with a becoming mixture of dignity and cordiality penrose lifted the offered hand respectfully to his lips as one of the provincials of the order father benwell occupied a high place among the english jesuits he was accustomed to acts of homage offered by his younger brethren to their spiritual chief i fear you are not well he proceeded gently your hand is feverish arthur  thank you fatheri am as well as usual  depression of spirits perhaps father benwell persisted  penrose admitted it with a passing smile my spirits are never very lively he said  father benwell shook his head in gentle disapproval of a depressed state of spirits in a young man this must be corrected he remarked cultivate cheerfulness arthur i am myself thank god a naturally cheerful man my mind reflects in some degree and reflects gratefully the brightness and beauty which are part of the great scheme of creation a similar disposition is to be cultivatedi know instances of it in my own experience add one more instance and you will really gratify me in its seasons of rejoicing our church is eminently cheerful shall i add another encouragement a great trust is about to be placed in you be socially agreeable or you will fail to justify the trust this is father benwells little sermon i think it has a merit arthurit is a sermon soon over  penrose looked up at his superior eager to hear more  he was a very young man his large thoughtful wellopened gray eyes and his habitual refinement and modesty of manner gave a certain attraction to his personal appearance of which it stood in some need in stature he was little and lean his hair had become prematurely thin over his broad forehead there were hollows already in his cheeks and marks on either side of his thin delicate lips he looked like a person who had passed many miserable hours in needlessly despairing of himself and his prospects with all this there was something in him so irresistibly truthful and sincereso suggestive even where he might be wrong of a purely conscientious belief in his own errorsthat he attached people to him without an effort and often without being aware of it himself what would his friends have said if they had been told that the religious enthusiasm of this gentle selfdistrustful melancholy man might in its very innocence of suspicion and selfseeking be perverted to dangerous uses in unscrupulous hands his friends would one and all have received the scandalous assertion with contempt and penrose himself if he had heard of it might have failed to control his temper for the first time in his life  may i ask a question without giving offense he said timidly  father benwell took his hand my dear arthur let us open our minds to each other without reserve what is your question  you have spoken father of a great trust that is about to be placed in me  yes you are anxious no doubt to hear what it is  i am anxious to know in the first place if it requires me to go back to oxford  father benwell dropped his young friends hand do you dislike oxford he asked observing penrose attentively  bear with me father if i speak too confidently i dislike the deception which has obliged me to conceal that i am a catholic and a priest  father benwell set this little difficulty right with the air of a man who could make benevolent allowance for unreasonable scruples i think arthur you forget two important considerations he said in the first place you have a dispensation from your superiors which absolves you of all responsibility in respect of the concealment that you have practiced in the second place we could only obtain information of the progress which our church is silently making at the university by employing you in the capacity oflet me say an independent observer however if it will contribute to your ease of mind i see no objection to informing you that you will not be instructed to return to oxford do i relieve you  there could be no question of it penrose breathed more freely in every sense of the word  at the same time father benwell continued let us not misunderstand each other in the new sphere of action which we design for you you will not only be at liberty to acknowledge that you are a catholic it will be absolutely necessary that you should do so but you will continue to wear the ordinary dress of an english gentleman and to preserve the strictest secrecy on the subject of your admission to the priesthood until you are further advised by myself now dear arthur read that paper it is the necessary preface to all that i have yet to say to you  the paper contained a few pages of manuscript relating the early history of vange abbey in the days of the monks and the circumstances under which the property was confiscated to lay uses in the time of henry the eighth penrose handed back the little narrative vehemently expressing his sympathy with the monks and his detestation of the king  compose yourself arthur said father benwell smiling pleasantly we dont mean to allow henry the eighth to have it all his own way forever  penrose looked at his superior in blank bewilderment his superior withheld any further information for the present  everything in its turn the discreet father resumed the turn of explanation has not come yet i have something else to show you first one of the most interesting relics in england look here  he unlocked a flat mahogany box and displayed to view some writings on vellum evidently of great age  you have had a little sermon already he said you shall have a little story now no doubt you have heard of newstead abbeyfamous among the readers of poetry as the residence of byron king henry treated newstead exactly as he treated vange abbey many years since the lake at newstead was dragged and the brass eagle which had served as the lectern in the old church was rescued from the waters in which it had lain for centuries a secret receptacle was discovered in the body of the eagle and the ancient titledeeds of the abbey were found in it the monks had taken that method of concealing the legal proof of their rights and privileges in the hopea vain hope i need hardly saythat a time might come when justice would restore to them the property of which they had been robbed only last summer one of our bishops administering a northern diocese spoke of these circumstances to a devout catholic friend and said he thought it possible that the precaution taken by the monks at newstead might also have been taken by the monks at vange the friend i should tell you was an enthusiast saying nothing to the bishop whose position and responsibilities he was bound to respect he took into his confidence persons whom he could trust one nightin the absence of the present proprietor or i should rather say the present usurper of the estatethe lake at vange was privately dragged with a result that proved the bishops conjecture to be right read those valuable documents knowing your strict sense of honor my son and your admirable tenderness of conscience i wish you to be satisfied of the title of the church to the lands of vange by evidence which is beyond dispute  with this little preface he waited while penrose read the titledeeds any doubt on your mind he asked when the reading had come to an end  not the shadow of a doubt  is the churchs right to the property clear  as clear father as words can make it  very good we will lock up the documents arbitrary confiscation arthur even on the part of a king cannot override the law what the church once lawfully possessed the church has a right to recover any doubt about that in your mind  only the doubt of how the church can recover is there anything in this particular case to be hoped from the law  nothing whatever  and yet father you speak as if you saw some prospect of the restitution of the property by what means can the restitution be made  by peaceful and worthy means father benwell answered by honorable restoration of the confiscated property to the church on the part of the person who is now in possession of it  penrose was surprised and interested is the person a catholic he asked eagerly  not yet father benwell laid a strong emphasis on those two little words his fat fingers drummed restlessly on the table his vigilant eyes rested expectantly on penrose surely you understand me arthur he added after an interval  the color rose slowly in the worn face of penrose i am afraid to understand you he said  why  i am not sure that it is my better sense which understands i am afraid father it may be my vanity and presumption  father benwell leaned back luxuriously in his chair i like that modesty he said with a relishing smack of his lips as if modesty was as good as a meal to him there is power of the right sort arthur hidden under the diffidence that does you honor i am more than ever satisfied that i have been right in reporting you as worthy of this most serious trust i believe the conversion of the owner of vange abbey isin your handsno more than a matter of time  may i ask what his name is  certainly his name is lewis romayne  when do you introduce me to him  impossible to say i have not yet been introduced myself  you dont know mr romayne  i have never even seen him  these discouraging replies were made with the perfect composure of a man who saw his way clearly before him sinking from one depth of perplexity to another penrose ventured on putting one last question how am i to approach mr romayne he asked  i can only answer that arthur by admitting you still further into my confidence it is disagreeable to me said the reverend gentleman with the most becoming humility to speak of myself but it must be done shall we have a little coffee to help us through the coming extract from father benwells autobiography dont look so serious my son when the occasion justifies it let us take life lightly he rang the bell and ordered the coffee as if he was the master of the house the servant treated him with the most scrupulous respect he hummed a little tune and talked at intervals of the weather while they were waiting plenty of sugar arthur he inquired when the coffee was brought in no even in trifles i should have been glad to feel that there was perfect sympathy between us i like plenty of sugar myself  having sweetened his coffee with the closest attention to the process he was at liberty to enlighten his young friend he did it so easily and so cheerfully that a far less patient man than penrose would have listened to him with interest    chapter iii  the introduction to romayne  excepting my employment here in the library father benwell began and some interesting conversation with lord loring to which i shall presently allude i am almost as great a stranger in this house arthur as yourself when the object which we now have in view was first taken seriously into consideration i had the honor of being personally acquainted with lord loring i was also aware that he was an intimate and trusted friend of romayne under these circumstances his lordship presented himself to our point of view as a means of approaching the owner of vange abbey without exciting distrust i was charged accordingly with the duty of establishing myself on terms of intimacy in this house by way of making room for me the spiritual director of lord and lady loring was removed to a cure of souls in ireland and here i am in his place bytheway dont treat me when we are in the presence of visitors with any special marks of respect i am not provincial of our order in lord lorings housei am one of the inferior clergy  penrose looked at him with admiration it is a great sacrifice to make father in your position and at your age  not at all arthur a position of authority involves certain temptations to pride i feel this change as a lesson in humility which is good for me for example lady loring as i can plainly see dislikes and distrusts me then again a young lady has recently arrived here on a visit she is a protestant with all the prejudices incident to that way of thinkingavoids me so carefully poor soul that i have never seen her yet these rebuffs are wholesome reminders of his fallible human nature to a man who has occupied a place of high trust and command besides there have been obstacles in my way which have had an excellent effect in rousing my energies how do you feel arthur when you encounter obstacles  i do my best to remove them father but i am sometimes conscious of a sense of discouragement  curious said father benwell i am only conscious myself of a sense of impatience what right has an obstacle to get in my waythat is how i look at it for example the first thing i heard when i came here was that romayne had left england my introduction to him was indefinitely delayed i had to look to lord loring for all the information i wanted relating to the man and his habits there was another obstacle not living in the house i was obliged to find an excuse for being constantly on the spot ready to take advantage of his lordships leisure moments for conversation i sat down in this room and i said to myself before i get up again i mean to brush these impertinent obstacles out of my way the state of the books suggested the idea of which i was in search before i left the house i was charged with the rearrangement of the library from that moment i came and went as often as i liked whenever lord loring was disposed for a little talk there i was to lead the talk in the right direction and what is the result on the first occasion when romayne presents himself i can place you in a position to become his daily companion all due arthur in the first instance to my impatience of obstacles amusing isnt it  penrose was perhaps deficient in the sense of humor instead of being amused he appeared to be anxious for more information  in what capacity am i to be mr romaynes companion he asked  father benwell poured himself out another cup of coffee  suppose i tell you first he suggested how circumstances present romayne to us as a promising subject for conversion he is young still a single man not compromised by any illicit connection romantic sensitive highly cultivated no near relations are alive to influence him and to my certain knowledge his estate is not entailed he has devoted himself for years past to books and is collecting materials for a work of immense research on the origin of religions some great sorrow or remorselord loring did not mention what it washas told seriously on his nervous system already injured by night study add to this that he is now within our reach he has lately returned to london and is living quite alone at a private hotel for some reason which i am not acquainted with he keeps away from vange abbeythe very place as i should have thought for a studious man  penrose began to be interested have you been to the abbey he said  i made a little excursion to that part of yorkshire arthur not long since a very pleasant tripapart from the painful associations connected with the ruin and profanation of a sacred place there is no doubt about the revenues i know the value of that productive part of the estate which stretches southward away from the barren region round the house let us return for a moment to romayne and to your position as his future companion he has had his books sent to him from vange and has persuaded himself that continued study is the one remedy for his troubles whatever they may be at lord lorings suggestion a consultation of physicians was held on his case the other day  is he so ill as that penrose exclaimed  so it appears father benwell replied lord loring is mysteriously silent about the illness one result of the consultation i extracted from him in which you are interested the doctors protested against his employing himself on his proposed work he was too obstinate to listen to them there was but one concession that they could gain from himhe consented to spare himself in some small degree by employing an amanuensis it was left to lord loring to find the man i was consulted by his lordship i was even invited to undertake the duty myself each one in his proper sphere my son the person who converts romayne must be young enough and pliable enough to be his friend and companion your part is there arthuryou are the future amanuensis how does the prospect strike you now  i beg your pardon father i fear i am unworthy of the confidence which is placed in me  in what way  penrose answered with unfeigned humility  i am afraid i may fail to justify your belief in me he said unless i can really feel that i am converting mr romayne for his own souls sake however righteous the cause may be i cannot find in the restitution of the church property a sufficient motive for persuading him to change his religious faith there is something so serious in the responsibility which you lay on me that i shall sink under the burden unless my whole heart is in the work if i feel attracted toward mr romayne when i first see him if he wins upon me little by little until i love him like a brotherthen indeed i can promise that his conversion shall be the dearest object of my life but if there is not this intimate sympathy between usforgive me if i say it plainlyi implore you to pass me over and to commit the task to the hands of another man  his voice trembled his eyes moistened father benwell handled his young friends rising emotion with the dexterity of a skilled angler humoring the struggles of a lively fish  good arthur he said i see muchtoo much dear boyof selfseeking people it is as refreshing to me to hear you as a draught of water to a thirsty man at the same time let me suggest that you are innocently raising difficulties where no difficulties exist i have already mentioned as one of the necessities of the case that you and romayne should be friends how can that be unless there is precisely that sympathy between you which you have so well described i am a sanguine man and i believe you will like each other wait till you see him  as the words passed his lips the door that led to the picture gallery was opened lord loring entered the library  he looked quickly round himapparently in search of some person who might perhaps be found in the room a shade of annoyance showed itself in his face and disappeared again as he bowed to the two jesuits  dont let me disturb you he said looking at penrose is this the gentleman who is to assist mr romayne  father benwell presented his young friend arthur penrose my lord i ventured to suggest that he should call here today in case you wished to put any questions to him  quite needless after your recommendation lord loring answered graciously mr penrose could not have come here at a more appropriate time as it happens mr romayne has paid us a visit todayhe is now in the picture gallery  the priests looked at each other lord loring left them as he spoke he walked to the opposite door of the libraryopened itglanced round the hall and at the stairsand returned again with the passing expression of annoyance visible once more come with me to the gallery gentlemen he said i shall be happy to introduce you to mr romayne  penrose accepted the proposal father benwell pointed with a smile to the books scattered about him with permission i will follow your lordship he said  who was my lord looking for that was the question in father benwells mind while he put some of the books away on the shelves and collected the scattered papers on the table relating to his correspondence with rome it had become a habit of his life to be suspicious of any circumstances occurring within his range of observation for which he was unable to account he might have felt some stronger emotion on this occasion if he had known that the conspiracy in the library to convert romayne was matched by the conspiracy in the picture gallery to marry him  lady lorings narrative of the conversation which had taken place between stella and herself had encouraged her husband to try his proposed experiment without delay i shall send a letter at once to romaynes hotel he said  inviting him to come here today her ladyship inquired  yes i shall say i particularly wish to consult him about a picture are we to prepare stella to see him or would it be better to let the meeting take her by surprise  certainly not said lady loring with her sensitive disposition i am afraid of taking stella by surprise let me only tell her that romayne is the original of her portrait and that he is likely to call on you to see the picture todayand leave the rest to me  lady lorings suggestion was immediately carried out in the first fervor of her agitation stella had declared that her courage was not equal to a meeting with romayne on that day becoming more composed she yielded to lady lorings persuasion so far as to promise that she would at least make the attempt to follow her friend to the gallery if i go down with you she said it will look as if we had arranged the thing between us i cant bear even to think of that let me look in by myself as if it was by accident consenting to this arrangement lady loring had proceeded alone to the gallery when romaynes visit was announced the minutes passed and stella did not appear it was quite possible that she might shrink from openly presenting herself at the main entrance to the gallery and might preferespecially if she was not aware of the priests presence in the roomto slip in quietly by the library door failing to find her on putting this idea to the test lord loring had discovered penrose and had so hastened the introduction of the younger of the two jesuits to romayne    having gathered his papers together father benwell crossed the library to the deep bowwindow which lighted the room and opened his dispatchbox standing on a small table in the recess placed in this position he was invisible to any person entering the room by the hall door he had secured his papers in the dispatchbox and had just closed and locked it when he heard the door cautiously opened  the instant afterward the rustling of a womans dress over the carpet caught his ear other men might have walked out of the recess and shown themselves father benwell stayed where he was and waited until the lady crossed his range of view  the priest observed with cold attention her darklybeautiful eyes and hair her quicklychanging color her modest grace of movement slowly and in evident agitation she advanced to the door of the picture galleryand paused as if she was afraid to open it father benwell heard her sigh to herself softly oh how shall i meet him she turned aside to the lookingglass over the fireplace the reflection of her charming face seemed to rouse her courage she retraced her steps and timidly opened the door lord loring must have been close by at the moment his voice immediately made itself heard in the library  come in stellacome in here is a new picture for you to see and a friend whom i want to present to you who must be your friend toomr lewis romayne  the door was closed again father benwell stood still as a statue in the recess with his head down deep in thought after a while he roused himself and rapidly returned to the writing table with a roughness strangely unlike his customary deliberation of movement he snatched a sheet of paper out of the case and frowning heavily wrote these lines on itsince my letter was sealed i have made a discovery which must be communicated without the loss of a post i greatly fear there may be a woman in our way trust me to combat this obstacle as i have combated other obstacles in the meantime the work goes on penrose has received his first instructions and has today been presented to romayne  he addressed this letter to rome as he had addressed the letter preceding it now for the woman he said to himselfand opened the door of the picture gallery    chapter iv  father benwell hits  art has its trials as well as its triumphs it is powerless to assert itself against the sordid interests of everyday life the greatest book ever written the finest picture ever painted appeals in vain to minds preoccupied by selfish and secret cares on entering lord lorings gallery father benwell found but one person who was not looking at the pictures under false pretenses  innocent of all suspicion of the conflicting interests whose struggle now centered in himself romayne was carefully studying the picture which had been made the pretext for inviting him to the house he had bowed to stella with a tranquil admiration of her beauty he had shaken hands with penrose and had said some kind words to his future secretaryand then he had turned to the picture as if stella and penrose had ceased from that moment to occupy his mind  in your place he said quietly to lord loring i should not buy this work  why not  it seems to me to have the serious defect of the modern english school of painting a total want of thought in the rendering of the subject disguised under dexterous technical tricks of the brush when you have seen one of that mans pictures you have seen all he manufactureshe doesnt paint  father benwell came in while romayne was speaking he went through the ceremonies of introduction to the master of vange abbey with perfect politeness but a little absently his mind was bent on putting his suspicion of stella to the test of confirmation not waiting to be presented he turned to her with the air of fatherly interest and chastened admiration which he well knew how to assume in his intercourse with women  may i ask if you agree with mr romaynes estimate of the picture he said in his gentlest tones  she had heard of him and of his position in the house it was quite needless for lady loring to whisper to her father benwell my dear her antipathy identified him as readily as her sympathy might have identified a man who had produced a favorable impression on her i have no pretension to be a critic she answered with frigid politeness i only know what i personally like or dislike  the reply exactly answered father benwells purpose it diverted romaynes attention from the picture to stella the priest had secured his opportunity of reading their faces while they were looking at each other  i think you have just stated the true motive for all criticism romayne said to stella whether we only express our opinions of pictures or books in the course of conversation or whether we assert them at full length with all the authority of print we are really speaking in either case of what personally pleases or repels us my poor opinion of that picture means that it says nothing to me does it say anything to you  he smiled gently as he put the question to her but there was no betrayal of emotion in his eyes or in his voice relieved of anxiety so far as romayne was concerned father benwell looked at stella  steadily as she controlled herself the confession of her hearts secret found its way into her face the coldly composed expression which had confronted the priest when she spoke to him melted away softly under the influence of romaynes voice and romaynes look without any positive change of color her delicate skin glowed faintly as if it felt some animating inner warmth her eyes and lips brightened with a new vitality her frail elegant figure seemed insensibly to strengthen and expand like the leaf of a flower under a favoring sunny air when she answered romayne agreeing with him it is needless to say there was a tender persuasiveness in her tones shyly inviting him still to speak to her and still to look at her which would in itself have told father benwell the truth even if he had not been in a position to see her face confirmed in his doubts of her he looked with concealed suspicion at lady loring next sympathy with stella was undisguisedly expressed to him in the honest blue eyes of stellas faithful friend  the discussion on the subject of the unfortunate picture was resumed by lord loring who thought the opinions of romayne and stella needlessly severe lady loring as usual agreed with her husband while the general attention was occupied in this way father benwell said a word to penrosethus far a silent listener to the discourse on art  have you seen the famous portrait of the first lady loring by gainsborough he asked without waiting for a reply he took penrose by the arm and led him away to the picturewhich had the additional merit under present circumstances of hanging at the other end of the gallery  how do you like romayne father benwell put the question in low peremptory tones evidently impatient for a reply  he interests me already said penrose he looks so ill and so sad and he spoke to me so kindly  in short father benwell interposed romayne has produced a favorable impression on you let us get on to the next thing you must produce a favorable impression on romayne  penrose sighed with the best will to make myself agreeable to people whom i like he said i dont always succeed they used to tell me at oxford that i was shyand i am afraid that is against me i wish i possessed some of your social advantages father  leave it to me son are they still talking about the picture  yes  i have something more to say to you have you noticed the young lady  i thought her beautifulbut she looks a little cold  father benwell smiled when you are as old as i am he said you will not believe in appearances where women are concerned do you know what i think of her beautiful if you likeand dangerous as well  dangerous in what way  this is for your private ear arthur she is in love with romayne wait a minute and lady loringunless i am entirely mistaken in what i observedknows it and favors it the beautiful stella may be the destruction of all our hopes unless we keep romayne out of her way  these words were whispered with an earnestness and agitation which surprised penrose his superiors equanimity was not easily overthrown are you sure father of what you say he asked  i am quite sureor i should not have spoken  do you think mr romayne returns the feeling  not yet luckily you must use your first friendly influence over himwhat is her name her surname i mean  eyrecourt miss stella eyrecourt  very well you must use your influence when you are quite sure that it is an influence to keep mr romayne away from miss eyrecourt  penrose looked embarrassed i am afraid i should hardly know how to do that he said but i should naturally as his assistant encourage him to keep to his studies  whatever arthurs superior might privately think of arthurs reply he received it with outward indulgence that will come to the same thing he said besides when i get the information i wantthis is strictly between ourselvesi may be of some use in placing obstacles in the ladys way  penrose started information he repeated what information  tell me something before i answer you said father benwell how old do you take miss eyrecourt to be  i am not a good judge in such matters between twenty and twentyfive perhaps  we will take her age at that estimate arthur in former years i have had opportunities of studying womens characters in the confessional can you guess what my experience tells me of miss eyrecourt  no indeed  a lady is not in love for the first time when she is between twenty and twentyfive years oldthat is my experience said father benwell if i can find a person capable of informing me i may make some valuable discoveries in the earlier history of miss eyrecourts life no more now we had better return to our friends    chapter v  father benwell misses  the group before the picture which had been the subject of dispute was broken up in one part of the gallery lady loring and stella were whispering together on a sofa in another part lord loring was speaking privately to romayne  do you think you will like mr penrose his lordship asked  yesso far as i can tell at present he seems to be modest and intelligent  you are looking ill my dear romayne have you again heard the voice that haunts you  romayne answered with evident reluctance i dont know why he saidbut the dread of hearing it again has oppressed me all this morning to tell you the truth i came here in the hope that the change might relieve me  has it done so  yesthus far  doesnt that suggest my friend that a greater change might be of use to you  dont ask me about it loring i can go through my ordealbut i hate speaking of it  let us speak of something else then said lord loring what do you think of miss eyrecourt  a very striking face full of expression and character leonardo would have painted a noble portrait of her but there is something in her manner he stopped unwilling or unable to finish the sentence  something you dont like lord loring suggested  no something i dont quite understand one doesnt expect to find any embarrassment in the manner of a wellbred woman and yet she seemed to be embarrassed when she spoke to me perhaps i produced an unfortunate impression on her  lord loring laughed in any man but you romayne i should call that affectation  why romayne asked sharply  lord loring looked unfeignedly surprised my dear fellow do you really think you are the sort of man who impresses a woman unfavorably at first sight for once in your life indulge in the amiable weakness of doing yourself justiceand find a better reason for miss eyrecourts embarrassment  for the first time since he and his friend had been talking together romayne turned toward stella he innocently caught her in the act of looking at him a younger woman or a woman of weaker character would have looked away again stellas noble head drooped her eyes sank slowly until they rested on her long white hands crossed upon her lap for a moment more romayne looked at her with steady attention  he roused himself and spoke to lord loring in lowered tones  have you known miss eyrecourt for a long time  she is my wifes oldest and dearest friend i think romayne you would feel interested in stella if you saw more of her  romayne bowed in silent submission to lord lorings prophetic remark let us look at the pictures he said quietly  as he moved down the gallery the two priests met him father benwell saw his opportunity of helping penrose to produce a favorable impression  forgive the curiosity of an old student mr romayne he said in his pleasant cheerful way lord loring tells me you have sent to the country for your books do you find a london hotel favorable to study  it is a very quiet hotel romayne answered and the people know my ways he turned to arthur i have my own set of rooms mr penrose he continuedwith a room at your disposal i used to enjoy the solitude of my house in the country my tastes have lately changedthere are times now when i want to see the life in the streets as a relief though we are in a hotel i can promise that you will not be troubled by interruptions when you kindly lend me the use of your pen  father benwell answered before penrose could speak you may perhaps find my young friends memory of some use to you mr romayne as well as his pen penrose has studied in the vatican library if your reading leads you that way he knows more than most men of the rare old manuscripts which treat of the early history of christianity  this delicately managed reference to the projected work on the origin of religions produced its effect  i should like very much mr penrose to speak to you about those manuscripts romayne said copies of some of them may perhaps be in the british museum is it asking too much to inquire if you are disengaged this morning  i am entirely at your service mr romayne  if you will kindly call at my hotel in an hours time i shall have looked over my notes and shall be ready for you with a list of titles and dates there is the address  with those words he advanced to take his leave of lady loring and stella  father benwell was a man possessed of extraordinary power of foresightbut he was not infallible seeing that romayne was on the point of leaving the house and feeling that he had paved the way successfully for romaynes amanuensis he too readily assumed that there was nothing further to be gained by remaining in the gallery moreover the interval before penrose called at the hotel might be usefully filled up by some wise words of advice relating to the religious uses to which he might turn his intercourse with his employer making one of his ready and plausible excuses he accordingly returned with penrose to the libraryand so committed as he himself discovered at a later time one of the few mistakes in the long record of his life  in the meanwhile romayne was not permitted to bring his visit to a conclusion without hospitable remonstrance on the part of lady loring she felt for stella with a womans enthusiastic devotion to the interests of true love and she had firmly resolved that a matter so trifling as the cultivation of romaynes mind should not be allowed to stand in the way of the far more important enterprise of opening his heart to the influence of the sex  stay and lunch with us she said when he held out his hand to bid her goodby  thank you lady loring i never take lunch  well then come and dine with usno party only ourselves tomorrow and next day we are disengaged which day shall it be  romayne still resisted you are very kind in my state of health i am unwilling to make engagements which i may not be able to keep  lady loring was just as resolute on her side she appealed to stella mr romayne persists my dear in putting me off with excuses try if you can persuade him  i am not likely to have any influence adelaide  the tone in which she replied struck romayne he looked at her her eyes gravely meeting his eyes held him with a strange fascination she was not herself conscious how openly all that was noble and true in her nature all that was most deeply and sensitively felt in her aspirations spoke at that moment in her look romaynes face changed he turned pale under the new emotion that she had roused in him lady loring observed him attentively  perhaps you underrate your influence stella she suggested  stella remained impenetrable to persuasion i have only been introduced to mr romayne half an hour since she said i am not vain enough to suppose that i can produce a favorable impression on any one in so short a time  she had expressed in other words romaynes own idea of himself in speaking of her to lord loring he was struck by the coincidence  perhaps we have begun miss eyrecourt by misinterpreting one another he said we may arrive at a better understanding when i have the honor of meeting you again  he hesitated and looked at lady loring she was not the woman to let a fair opportunity escape her we will say tomorrow evening she resumed at seven oclock  tomorrow said romayne he shook hands with stella and left the picture gallery  thus far the conspiracy to marry him promised even more hopefully than the conspiracy to convert him and father benwell carefully instructing penrose in the next room was not aware of it  but the hours in their progress mark the march of events as surely as they mark the march of time the day passed the evening cameand with its coming the prospects of the conversion brightened in their turn  let father benwell himself relate how it happenedin an extract from his report to rome written the same evening   i had arranged with penrose that he should call at my lodgings and tell me how he had prospered at the first performance of his duties as secretary to romayne  the moment he entered the room the signs of disturbance in his face told me that something serious had happened i asked directly if there had been any disagreement between romayne and himself  he repeated the word with every appearance of surprise disagreement he said no words can tell how sincerely i feel for mr romayne i cannot express to you father how eager i am to be of service to him  relieved so far i naturally asked what had happened penrose betrayed a marked embarrassment in answering my question  i have innocently surprised a secret he said on which i had no right to intrude all that i can honorably tell you shall be told add one more to your many kindnessesdont command me to speak when it is my duty toward a sorelytried man to be silent even to you  it is needless to say that i abstained from directly answering this strange appeal let me hear what you can tell i replied and then we shall see  upon this he spoke i need hardly recall to your memory how careful we were in first planning the attempt to recover the vange property to assure ourselves of the promise of success which the peculiar character of the present owner held out to us in reporting what penrose said i communicate a discovery which i venture to think will be as welcome to you as it was to me  he began by reminding me of what i had myself told him in speaking of romayne you mentioned having heard from lord loring of a great sorrow or remorse from which he was suffering penrose said i know what he suffers and why he suffers and with what noble resignation he submits to his affliction we were sitting together at the table looking over his notes and memoranda when he suddenly dropped the manuscript from which he was reading to me a ghastly paleness overspread his face he started up and put both his hands to his ears as if he heard something dreadful and was trying to deafen himself to it i ran to the door to call for help he stopped me he spoke in faint gasping tones forbidding me to call any one in to witness what he suffered it was not the first time he said it would soon be over if i had not courage to remain with him i could go and return when he was himself again i so pitied him that i found the courage to remain when it was over he took me by the hand and thanked me i had stayed by him like a friend he said and like a friend he would treat me sooner or later those were his exact words i must be taken into his confidenceand it should be now he told me his melancholy story i implore you father dont ask me to repeat it be content if i tell you the effect of it on myself the one hope the one consolation for him is in our holy religion with all my heart i devote myself to his conversionand in my inmost soul i feel the conviction that i shall succeed  to this effect and in this tone penrose spoke i abstained from pressing him to reveal romaynes confession the confession is of no consequence to us you know how the moral force of arthurs earnestness and enthusiasm fortifies his otherwise weak character i too believe he will succeed  to turn for a moment to another subject you are already informed that there is a woman in our way i have my own idea of the right method of dealing with this obstacle when it shows itself more plainly for the present i need only assure you that neither this woman nor any woman shall succeed in her designs on romayne if i can prevent it  having completed his report in these terms father benwell reverted to the consideration of his proposed inquiries into the past history of stellas life  reflection convinced him that it would be unwise to attempt no matter how guardedly to obtain the necessary information from lord loring or his wife if he assumed at his age to take a strong interest in a protestant young lady who had notoriously avoided him they would certainly feel surpriseand surprise might in due course of development turn to suspicion  there was but one other person under lord lorings roof to whom he could address himselfand that person was the housekeeper as an old servant possessing lady lorings confidence she might prove a source of information on the subject of lady lorings fair friend and as a good catholic she would feel flattered by the notice of the spiritual director of the household  it may not be amiss thought father benwell if i try the housekeeper    chapter vi  the order of the dishes  when miss notman assumed the post of housekeeper in lady lorings service she was accurately described as a competent and respectable person and was praised with perfect truth for her incorruptible devotion to the interests of her employers on its weaker side her character was represented by the wearing of a youthful wig and the erroneous conviction that she still possessed a fine figure the ruling idea in her narrow little mind was the idea of her own dignity any offense offered in this direction oppressed her memory for days together and found its way outward in speech to any human being whose attention she could secure  at five oclock on the day which followed his introduction to romayne father benwell sat drinking his coffee in the housekeepers roomto all appearance as much at his ease as if he had known miss notman from the remote days of her childhood a new contribution to the housekeepers little library of devotional works lay on the table and bore silent witness to the means by which he had made those first advances which had won him his present position miss notmans sense of dignity was doubly flattered she had a priest for her guest and a new book with the reverend gentlemans autograph inscribed on the titlepage  is your coffee to your liking father  a little more sugar if you please  miss notman was proud of her hand viewed as one of the meritorious details of her figure she took up the sugartongs with suavity and grace she dropped the sugar into the cup with a youthful pleasure in ministering to the minor desires of her illustrious guest it is so good of you father to honor me in this way she saidwith the appearance of sixteen superinduced upon the reality of sixty  father benwell was an adept at moral disguises of all kinds on this occasion he wore the disguise of pastoral simplicity i am an idle old man at this hour of the afternoon he said i hope i am not keeping you from any household duties  i generally enjoy my duties miss notman answered today they have not been so agreeable as usual it is a relief to me to have done with them even my humble position has its trials  persons acquainted with miss notmans character hearing these last words would have at once changed the subject when she spoke of her humble position she invariably referred to some offense offered to her dignity and she was invariably ready to state the grievance at full length ignorant of this peculiarity father benwell committed a fatal error he inquired with courteous interest what the housekeepers trials might be  oh sir they are beneath your notice said miss notman modestly at the same time i should feel it an honor to have the benefit of your opinioni should so like to know that you do not altogether disapprove of my conduct under some provocation you see father the whole responsibility of ordering the dinners falls on me and when there is company as there is this evening the responsibility is particularly trying to a timid person like myself  a large dinner party miss notman  oh dear no quite the reverse only one gentlemanmr romayne  father benwell set down his cup of coffee half way to his lips he at once drew the correct conclusion that the invitation to romayne must have been given and accepted after he had left the picture gallery that the object was to bring romayne and stella together under circumstances which would rapidly improve their acquaintance was as plain to him as if he had heard it confessed in so many words if he had only remained in the gallery he might have become acquainted with the form of persuasion used to induce a man so unsocial as romayne to accept an invitation i have myself to blame he thought bitterly for being left in the dark  anything wrong with the coffee miss notman asked anxiously  he rushed on his fate he said nothing whatever pray go on  miss notman went on  you see father lady loring was unusually particular about the dinner on this occasion she said lord loring reminds me that mr romayne is a very little eater and yet very difficult to please in what he does eat of course i consulted my experience and suggested exactly the sort of dinner that was wanted under the circumstances i wish to do her ladyship the utmost justice she made no objection to the dinner in itself on the contrary she complimented me on what she was pleased to call my ready invention but when we came next to the order in which the dishes were to be served miss notman paused in the middle of the sentence and shuddered over the private and poignant recollections which the order of the dishes called up  by this time father benwell had discovered his mistake he took a mean advantage of miss notmans susceptibilities to slip his own private inquiries into the interval of silence  pardon my ignorance he said my own poor dinner is a matter of ten minutes and one dish i dont understand a difference of opinion on a dinner for three people only lord and lady loring two mr romayne threeoh perhaps i am mistaken perhaps miss eyrecourt makes a fourth  certainly father  a very charming person miss notman i only speak as a stranger you no doubt are much better acquainted with miss eyrecourt  much better indeedif i may presume to say so miss notman replied she is my ladys intimate friend we have often talked of miss eyrecourt during the many years of my residence in this house on such subjects her ladyship treats me quite on the footing of a humble friend a complete contrast to the tone she took father when we came to the order of the dishes we agreed of course about the soup and the fish but we had a little a very little divergence of opinion as i may call it on the subject of the dishes to follow her ladyship said first the sweetbreads and then the cutlets i ventured to suggest that the sweetbreads as white meat had better not immediately follow the turbot as white fish the brown meat my lady i said as an agreeable variety presented to the eye and then the white meat recalling pleasant remembrances of the white fish you see the point father  i see miss notman that you are a consummate mistress of an art which is quite beyond poor me was miss eyrecourt present at the little discussion  oh no indeed i should have objected to her presence i should have said she was a young lady out of her proper place  yes i understand is miss eyrecourt an only child  she had two sisters father benwell one of them is in a convent  ah indeed  and the other is dead  sad for the father and mother miss notman  pardon me sad for the mother no doubt the father died long since  aye aye a sweet woman the mother at least i think i have heard so  miss notman shook her head i should wish to guard myself against speaking unjustly of any one she said but when you talk of a sweet woman you imply as it seems to me the domestic virtues mrs eyrecourt is essentially a frivolous person  a frivolous person is in the vast majority of cases a person easily persuaded to talk and not disposed to be reticent in keeping secrets father benwell began to see his way already to the necessary information is mrs eyrecourt living in london he inquired  oh dear no at this time of year she lives entirely in other peoples housesgoes from one country seat to another and only thinks of amusing herself no domestic qualities father she would know nothing of the order of the dishes lady loring i should have told you gave way in the matter of the sweetbread it was only at quite the latter part of my menoo as the french call it that she showed a spirit of oppositionwell well i wont dwell on that i will only ask you father at what part of a dinner an oysteromelet ought to be served  father benwell seized his opportunity of discovering mrs eyrecourts present address my dear lady he said i know no more when the omelet ought to be served than mrs eyrecourt herself it must be very pleasant to a lady of her way of thinking to enjoy the beauties of nature inexpensivelyas seen in other peoples houses from the point of view of a welcome guest i wonder whether she is staying at any country seat which i happen to have seen  she may be in england scotland or ireland for all i know miss notman answered with an unaffected ignorance which placed her good faith beyond doubt consult your own taste father after eating jelly cream and icepudding could you even look at an oysteromelet without shuddering would you believe it her ladyship proposed to serve the omelet with the cheese oysters after sweets i am not as yet a married woman  father benwell made a last desperate effort to pave the way for one more question before he submitted to defeat that must be your fault my dear lady he interposed with his persuasive smile  miss notman simpered you confuse me father she said softly  i speak from inward conviction miss notman to a lookeron like myself it is sad to see how many sweet women who might be angels in the households of worthy men prefer to lead a single life the church i know exalts the single life to the highest place but even the church allows exceptions to its rule under this roof for example i think i see two exceptions one of them my unfeigned respect he bowed to miss notman forbids me to indicate more particularly the other seems to my humble view to be the young lady of whom we have been speaking is it not strange that miss eyrecourt has never been married  the trap had been elaborately set father benwell had every reason to anticipate that miss notman would walk into it the disconcerting housekeeper walked up to itand then proved unable to advance a step further  i once made the same remark myself to lady loring she said  father benwells pulse began to quicken its beat yes he murmured in tones of the gentlest encouragement  and her ladyship miss notman proceeded did not encourage me to go on there are reasons for not pursuing that subject she said reasons into which i am sure you will not expect me to enter she spoke with a flattering confidence in my prudence which i felt gratefully such a contrast to her tone when the omelet presented itself in the order of the dishes as i said just now i am not a married woman but if i proposed to my husband to give him an oysteromelet after his puddings and his pies i should not be surprised if he said to me my dear have you taken leave of your senses i reminded lady loring most respectfully that a cheeseomelette might be in its proper place if it followed the sweets an oysteromelet i suggested surely comes after the birds i should be sorry to say that her ladyship lost her temperi will only mention that i kept mine let me repeat what she said and leave you father to draw your own conclusions she said which of us is mistress in this house miss notman i order the oysteromelet to come in with the cheese there was not only irritability there was contemptoh yes contempt in her tone out of respect for myself i made no reply as a christian i can forgive as a wounded gentlewoman i may not find it so easy to forget  miss notman laid herself back in her easy chairshe looked as if she had suffered martyrdom and only regretted having been obliged to mention it father benwell surprised the wounded gentlewoman by rising to his feet  you are not going away already father  time flies fast in your society dear miss notman i have an engagementand i am late for it already  the housekeeper smiled sadly at least let me hear that you dont disapprove of my conduct under trying circumstances she said  father benwell took her hand a true christian only feels offenses to pardon them he remarked in his priestly and paternal character you have shown me miss notman that you are a true christian my evening has indeed been well spent god bless you  he pressed her hand he shed on her the light of his fatherly smile he sighed and took his leave miss notmans eyes followed him out with devotional admiration  father benwell still preserved his serenity of temper when he was out of the housekeepers sight one important discovery he had made in spite of the difficulties placed in his way a compromising circumstance had unquestionably occurred in stellas past life and in all probability a man was in some way connected with it my evening has not been entirely thrown away he thought as he ascended the stairs which led from the housekeepers room to the hall    chapter vii  the influence of stella  entering the hall father benwell heard a knock at the house door the servants appeared to recognize the knockthe porter admitted lord loring  father benwell advanced and made his bow it was a perfect obeisance of its kindrespect for lord loring unobtrusively accompanied by respect for himself has your lordship been walking in the park he inquired  i have been out on business lord loring answered and i should like to tell you about it if you can spare me a few minutes come into the library some time since he resumed when the door was closed i think i mentioned that my friends had been speaking to me on a subject of some importancethe subject of opening my picture gallery occasionally to the public  i remember said father benwell has your lordship decided what to do  yes i have decided as the phrase is to go with the times and follow the example of other owners of picture galleries dont suppose i ever doubted that it is my duty to extend to the best of my ability the civilizing influences of art my only hesitation in the matter arose from a dread of some accident happening or some injury being done to the pictures even now i can only persuade myself to try the experiment under certain restrictions  a wise decision undoubtedly said father benwell in such a city as this you could hardly open your gallery to anybody who happens to pass the housedoor  i am glad you agree with me father the gallery will be open for the first time on monday any respectablydressed person presenting a visiting card at the offices of the librarians in bond street and regent street will receive a free ticket of admission the number of tickets it is needless to say being limited and the gallery being only open to the public two days in the week you will be here i suppose on monday  certainly my work in the library as your lordship can see has only begun  i am very anxious about the success of this experiment said lord loring do look in at the gallery once or twice in the course of the day and tell me what your own impression is  having expressed his readiness to assist the experiment in every possible way father benwell still lingered in the library he was secretly conscious of a hope that he might at the eleventh hour be invited to join romayne at the dinnertable lord loring only looked at the clock on the mantelpiece it was nearly time to dress for dinner the priest had no alternative but to take the hint and leave the house  five minutes after he had withdrawn a messenger delivered a letter for lord loring in which father benwells interests were directly involved the letter was from romayne it contained his excuses for breaking his engagement literally at an hours notice  only yesterday he wrote i had a return of what you my dear friend call the delusion of the voice the nearer the hour of your dinner approaches the more keenly i fear that the same thing may happen in your house pity me and forgive me  even goodnatured lord loring felt some difficulty in pitying and forgiving when he read these lines this sort of caprice might be excusable in a woman he thought a man ought really to be capable of exercising some selfcontrol poor stella and what will my wife say  he walked up and down the library with stellas disappointment and lady lorings indignation prophetically present in his mind there was however no help for ithe must accept his responsibility and be the bearer of the bad news  he was on the point of leaving the library when a visitor appeared the visitor was no less a person than romayne himself have i arrived before my letter he asked eagerly  lord loring showed him the letter  throw it into the fire he said and let me try to excuse myself for having written it you remember the happier days when you used to call me the creature of impulse an impulse produced that letter another impulse brings me here to disown it i can only explain my strange conduct by asking you to help me at the outset will you carry your memory back to the day of the medical consultation on my case i want you to correct me if i inadvertently misrepresent my advisers two of them were physicians the third and last was a surgeon a personal friend of yours and he as well as i recollect told you how the consultation ended  quite right romayneso far  the first of the two physicians romayne proceeded declared my case to be entirely attributable to nervous derangement and to be curable by purely medical means i speak ignorantly but in plain english that i believe was the substance of what he said  the substance of what he said lord loring replied and the substance of his prescriptionswhich i think you afterward tore up  if you have no faith in a prescription said romayne that is in my opinion the best use to which you can put it when it came to the turn of the second physician he differed with the first as absolutely as one man can differ with another the third medical authority your friend the surgeon took a middle course and brought the consultation to an end by combining the first physicians view and the second physicians view and mingling the two opposite forms of treatment in one harmonious result  lord loring remarked that this was not a very respectful way of describing the conclusion of the medical proceedings that it was the conclusion however he could not honestly deny  as long as i am right said romayne nothing else appears to be of much importance as i told you at the time the second physician appeared to me to be the only one of the three authorities who really understood my case do you mind giving me in few words your own impression of what he said  are you sure that i shall not distress you  on the contrary you may help me to hope  as i remember it said lord loring the doctor did not deny the influence of the body over the mind he was quite willing to admit that the state of your nervous system might be one among other predisposing causes which led youi really hardly like to go on  which led me romayne continued finishing the sentence for his friend to feel that i never shall forgive myselfaccident or no accidentfor having taken that mans life now go on  the delusion that you still hear the voice lord loring proceeded is in the doctors opinion the moral result of the morbid state of your mind at the time when you really heard the voice on the scene of the duel the influence acts physically of course by means of certain nerves but it is essentially a moral influence and its power over you is greatly maintained by the selfaccusing view of the circumstances which you persist in taking that in substance is my recollection of what the doctor said  and when he was asked what remedies he proposed to try romayne inquired do you remember his answer the mischief which moral influences have caused moral influences alone can remedy  i remember said lord loring and he mentioned as examples of what he meant the occurrence of some new and absorbing interest in your life or the working of some complete change in your habits of thoughtor perhaps some influence exercised over you by a person previously unknown appearing under unforeseen circumstances or in scenes quite new to you  romaynes eyes sparkled  now you are coming to it he cried now i feel sure that i recall correctly the last words the doctor said if my view is the right one i should not be surprised to hear that the recovery which we all wish to see had found its beginning in such apparently trifling circumstances as the tone of some other persons voice or the influence of some other persons look that plain expression of his opinion only occurred to my memory after i had written my foolish letter of excuse i spare you the course of other recollections that followed to come at once to the result for the first time i have the hope the faint hope that the voice which haunts me has been once already controlled by one of the influences of which the doctor spokethe influence of a look  if he had said this to lady loring instead of to her husband she would have understood him at once lord loring asked for a word more of explanation  i told you yesterday romayne answered that a dread of the return of the voice had been present to me all the morning and that i had come to see the picture with an idea of trying if change would relieve me while i was in the gallery i was free from the dread and free from the voice when i returned to the hotel it tortured meand mr penrose i grieve to say saw what i suffered you and i attributed the remission to the change of scene i now believe we were both wrong where was the change in seeing you and lady loring i saw the two oldest friends i have in visiting your gallery i only revived the familiar associations of hundreds of other visits to what influence was i really indebted for my respite dont try to dismiss the question by laughing at my morbid fancies morbid fancies are realities to a man like me remember the doctors words loring think of a new face seen in your house think of a look that searched my heart for the first time  lord loring glanced once more at the clock on the mantelpiece the hands pointed to the dinner hour  miss eyrecourt he whispered  yes miss eyrecourt  the library door was thrown open by a servant stella herself entered the room    chapter viii  the priest or the woman  lord loring hurried away to his dressing room i wont be more than ten minutes he saidand left romayne and stella together  she was attired with her customary love of simplicity white lace was the only ornament on her dress of delicate silvery gray her magnificent hair was left to plead its own merits without adornment of any sort even the brooch which fastened her lace pelerine was of plain gold only conscious that she was showing her beauty to the greatest advantage in the eyes of a man of taste she betrayed a little of the embarrassment which romayne had already noticed at the moment when she gave him her hand they were alone and it was the first time she had seen him in evening dress  it may be that women have no positive appreciation of what is beautiful in form and coloror it may be that they have no opinions of their own when the laws of fashion have spoken this at least is certain that not one of them in a thousand sees anything objectionable in the gloomy and hideous evening costume of a gentleman in the nineteenth century a handsome man is to their eyes more seductive than ever in the contemptible black coat and the stiff white cravat which he wears in common with the servant who waits on him at table after a stolen glance at romayne stella lost all confidence in herselfshe began turning over the photographs on the table  the momentary silence which followed their first greeting became intolerable to her rather than let it continue she impulsively confessed the uppermost idea in her mind when she entered the room  i thought i heard my name when i came in she said were you and lord loring speaking of me  romayne owned without hesitation that they had been speaking of her  she smiled and turned over another photograph but when did sunpictures ever act as a restraint on a womans curiosity the words passed her lips in spite of her i suppose i mustnt ask what you were saying  it was impossible to answer this plainly without entering into explanations from which romayne shrank he hesitated  she turned over another photograph i understand she said you were talking of my faults she paused and stole another look at him i will try to correct my faults if you will tell me what they are  romayne felt that he had no alternative but to tell the truthunder certain reserves indeed you are wrong he said we were talking of the influence of a tone or a look on a sensitive person  the influence on me she asked  no the influence which you might exercise on another person  she knew perfectly well that he was speaking of himself but she was determined to feel the pleasure of making him own it  if i have any such influence as you describe she began i hope it is for good  certainly for good  you speak positively mr romayne almost as positivelyonly that can hardly beas if you were speaking from experience  he might still have evaded a direct reply if she had been content with merely saying this but she looked at him while she spoke he answered the look  shall i own that you are right he said i was thinking of my own experience yesterday  she returned to the photographs it sounds impossible she rejoined softly there was a pause was it anything i said she asked  no it was only when you looked at me but for that look i dont think i should have been here today  she shut up the photographs on a sudden and drew her chair a little away from him  i hope she said you have not so poor an opinion of me as to think i like to be flattered  romayne answered with an earnestness that instantly satisfied her  i should think it an act of insolence to flatter you he said if you knew the true reason why i hesitated to accept lady lorings invitationif i could own to you the new hope for myself that has brought me hereyou would feel as i feel that i have been only speaking the truth i darent say yet that i owe you a debt of gratitude for such a little thing as a look i must wait till time puts certain strange fancies of mine to the proof  fancies about me mr romayne  before he could answer the dinner bell rang lord and lady loring entered the library together    the dinner having pursued its appointed course always excepting the case of the omelet the head servant who had waited at table was graciously invited to rest after his labors in the housekeepers room having additionally conciliated him by means of a glass of rare liqueur miss notman still feeling her grievance as acutely as ever ventured to inquire in the first place if the gentlefolks upstairs had enjoyed their dinner so far the report was on the whole favorable but the conversation was described as occasionally flagging the burden of the talk had been mainly borne by my lord and my lady mr romayne and miss eyrecourt contributing but little to the social enjoyment of the evening receiving this information without much appearance of interest the housekeeper put another question to which judging by her manner she attached a certain importance she wished to know if the oysteromelet accompanying the cheese had been received as a welcome dish and treated with a just recognition of its merits the answer to this was decidedly in the negative mr romayne and miss eyrecourt had declined to taste it my lord had tried it and had left it on his plate my lady alone had really eaten her share of the misplaced dish having stated this apparently trivial circumstance the head servant was surprised by the effect which it produced on the housekeeper she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes with an appearance of unutterable enjoyment that night there was one supremely happy woman in london and her name was miss notman  ascending from the housekeepers room to the drawingroom it is to be further reported that music was tried as a means of getting through the time in the absence of general conversation lady loring sat down at the piano and played as admirably as usual at the other end of the room romayne and stella were together listening to the music lord loring walking backward and forward with a restlessness which was far from being characteristic of him in his afterdinner hours was stopped when he reached the neighborhood of the piano by a private signal from his wife  what are you walking about for lady loring asked in a whisper without interrupting her musical performance  im not quite easy my dear  turn over the music indigestion  good heavens adelaide what a question  well what is it then  lord loring looked toward stella and her companion they dont seem to get on together as well as i had hoped he said  i should think notwhen you are walking about and disturbing them sit down there behind me  what am i to do  am i not playing listen to me  my dear i dont understand modern german music  then read the evening paper  the evening paper had its attractions lord loring took his wifes advice  left entirely by themselves at the other end of the room romayne and stella justified lady lorings belief in the result of reducing her husband to a state of repose stella ventured to speak first in a discreet undertone  do you pass most of your evenings alone mr romayne  not quite alone i have the company of my books  are your books the companions that you like best  i have been true to those companions miss eyrecourt for many years if the doctors are to be believed my books have not treated me very well in return they have broken down my health and have made me i am afraid a very unsocial man he seemed about to say more and suddenly checked the impulse why am i talking of myself he resumed with a smile i never do it at other times is this another result of your influence over me  he put the question with an assumed gayety stella made no effort on her side to answer him in the same tone  i almost wish i really had some influence over you she said gravely and sadly  why  i should try to induce you to shut up your books and choose some living companion who might restore you to your happier self  it is already done said romayne i have a new companion in mr penrose  penrose she repeated he is the friendis he notof the priest here whom they call father benwell  yes  i dont like father benwell  is that a reason for disliking mr penrose  yes she said boldly because he is father benwells friend  indeed you are mistaken miss eyrecourt mr penrose only entered yesterday on his duties as my secretary and i have already had reason to think highly of him many men after that experience of me he added speaking more to himself than to her might have asked me to find another secretary  stella heard those last words and looked at him in astonishment were you angry with mr penrose she asked innocently is it possible that you could speak harshly to any person in your employment  romayne smiled it was not what i said he answered i am subject to attacksto sudden attacks of illness i am sorry i alarmed mr penrose by letting him see me under those circumstances  she looked at him hesitated and looked away again would you be angry with me if i confessed something she said timidly  it is impossible i can be angry with you  mr romayne i think i have seen what your secretary saw i know how you suffer and how patiently you bear it  you he exclaimed  i saw you with your friend when you came on board the steamboat at boulogne oh no you never noticed me you never knew how i pitied you and afterward when you moved away by yourself and stood by the place in which the engines workyou are sure you wont think the worse of me if i tell it  no no  your face frightened mei cant describe iti went to your friend and took it on myself to say that you wanted him it was an impulsei meant well  i am sure you meant well as he spoke his face darkened a little betraying a momentary feeling of distrust had she put indiscreet questions to his traveling companion and had the major under the persuasive influence of her beauty been weak enough to answer them did you speak to my friend he asked  only when i told him that he had better go to you and i think i said afterward i was afraid you were very ill we were in the confusion of arriving at folkestoneand even if i had thought it right to say more there was no opportunity  romayne felt ashamed of the suspicion by which he had wronged her you have a generous nature he said earnestly among the few people whom i know how many would feel the interest in me that you felt  dont say that mr romayne you could have had no kinder friend than the gentleman who took care of you on your journey is he with you now in london  no  i am sorry to hear it you ought to have some devoted friend always near you  she spoke very earnestly romayne shrank with a strange shyness from letting her see how her sympathy affected him he answered lightly you go almost as far as my good friend there reading the newspaper he said lord loring doesnt scruple to tell me that i ought to marry i know he speaks with a sincere interest in my welfare he little thinks how he distresses me  why should he distress you  he reminds melive as long as i maythat i must live alone can i ask a woman to share such a dreary life as mine it would be selfish it would be cruel i should deservedly pay the penalty of allowing my wife to sacrifice herself the time would come when she would repent having married me  stella rose her eyes rested on him with a look of gentle remonstrance i think you hardly do women justice she said softly perhaps some day a woman may induce you to change your opinion she crossed the room to the piano you must be tired of playing adelaide she said putting her hand caressingly on lady lorings shoulder  will you sing stella  she sighed and turned away not tonight she answered  romayne took his leave rather hurriedly he seemed to be out of spirits and eager to get away lord loring accompanied his guest to the door you look sad and careworn he said do you regret having left your books to pass an evening with us  romayne looked up absently and answered i dont know yet  returning to report this extraordinary reply to his wife and stella lord loring found the drawingroom empty eager for a little private conversation the two ladies had gone upstairs    well said lady loring as they sat together over the fire what did he say  stella only repeated what he had said before she rose and left him what is there in mr romaynes life she asked which made him say that he would be selfish and cruel if he expected a woman to marry him it must be something more than mere illness if he had committed a crime he could not have spoken more strongly do you know what it is  lady loring looked uneasy i promised my husband to keep it a secret from everybody she said  it is nothing degrading adelaidei am sure of that  and you are right my dear i can understand that he has surprised and disappointed you but if you knew his motives she stopped and looked earnestly at stella they say she went on the love that lasts longest is the love of slowest growth this feeling of yours for romayne is of sudden growth are you very sure that your whole heart is given to a man of whom you know little  i know that i love him said stella simply  even though he doesnt seem as yet to love you lady loring asked  all the more because he doesnt i should be ashamed to make the confession to any one but you it is useless to say any more goodnight  lady loring allowed her to get as far as the door and then suddenly called her back stella returned unwillingly and wearily my head aches and my heart aches she said let me go away to my bed  i dont like you to go away wronging romayne perhaps in your thoughts said lady loring and more than that for the sake of your own happiness you ought to judge for yourself if this devoted love of yours may ever hope to win its reward it is time and more than time that you should decide whether it is good for you to see romayne again have you courage enough to do that  yesif i am convinced that it ought to be done  nothing would make me so happy lady loring resumed as to know that you were one day my dear to be his wife but i am not a prudent personi can never look as you can to consequences you wont betray me stella if i am doing wrong in telling a secret which has been trusted to me it is my fondness for you that misleads me sit down again you shall know what the misery of romaynes life really is  with those words she told the terrible story of the duel and of all that had followed it  it is for you to say she concluded whether romayne is right can any woman hope to release him from the torment that he suffers with nothing to help her but love determine for yourself  stella answered instantly  i determine to be his wife  with the same pure enthusiasm penrose had declared that he too devoted himself to the deliverance of romayne the loving woman was not more resolved to give her whole life to him than the fanatical man was resolved to convert him on the same common battleground the two were now to meet in unconscious antagonism would the priest or the woman win the day    chapter ix  the public and the pictures  on the memorable monday when the picture gallery was opened to the public for the first time lord loring and father benwell met in the library  judging by the number of carriages already at the door said father benwell your lordships kindness is largely appreciated by the lovers of art  all the tickets were disposed of in three hours lord loring answered everybody the librarians tell me is eager to see the pictures have you looked in yet  not yet i thought i would get on first with my work among the books  i have just come from the gallery lord loring continued and here i am driven out of it again by the remarks of some of the visitors you know my beautiful copies of raphaels cupid and psyche designs the general impression especially among the ladies is that they are disgusting and indecent that was enough for me if you happen to meet lady loring and stella kindly tell them that i have gone to the club  do the ladies propose paying a visit to the gallery  of courseto see the people i have recommended them to wait until they are ready to go out for their drive in their indoor costume they might become the objects of general observation as the ladies of the house i shall be anxious to hear father if you can discover the civilizing influences of art among my guests in the gallery goodmorning  father benwell rang the bell when lord loring had left him  do the ladies drive out today at their usual hour he inquired when the servant appeared the man answered in the affirmative the carriage was ordered at three oclock  at halfpast two father benwell slipped quietly into the gallery he posted himself midway between the library door and the grand entrance on the watch not for the civilizing influences of art but for the appearance of lady loring and stella he was still of opinion that stellas frivolous mother might be turned into a source of valuable information on the subject of her daughters earlier life the first step toward attaining this object was to discover mrs eyrecourts present address stella would certainly know itand father benwell felt a just confidence in his capacity to make the young lady serviceable in this respect to the pecuniary interests of the church  after an interval of a quarter of an hour lady loring and stella entered the gallery by the library door father benwell at once advanced to pay his respects  for some little time he discreetly refrained from making any attempt to lead the conversation to the topic that he had in view he was too well acquainted with the insatiable interest of women in looking at other women to force himself into notice the ladies made their remarks on the pretensions to beauty and to taste in dress among the throng of visitorsand father benwell waited by them and listened with the resignation of a modest young man patience being a virtue is sometimes its own reward two gentlemen evidently interested in the pictures approached the priest he drew back with his ready politeness to let them see the picture before which he happened to be standing  the movement disturbed stella she turned sharplynoticed one of the gentlemen the taller of the twobecame deadly paleand instantly quitted the gallery lady loring looking where stella had looked frowned angrily and followed miss eyrecourt into the library wise father benwell let them go and concentrated his attention on the person who had been the object of this startling recognition  unquestionably a gentlemanwith light hair and complexionwith a bright benevolent face and keen intelligent blue eyesapparently still in the prime of life such was father benwells first impression of the stranger he had evidently seen miss eyrecourt at the moment when she first noticed him and he too showed signs of serious agitation his face flushed deeply and his eyes expressed not merely surprise but distress he turned to his friend this place is hot he said let us get out of it  my dear winterfield the friend remonstrated we havent seen half the pictures yet  excuse me if i leave you the other replied i am used to the free air of the country let us meet again this evening come and dine with me the same address as usualderwents hotel  with those words he hurried out making his way without ceremony through the crowd in the picture gallery  father benwell returned to the library it was quite needless to trouble himself further about mrs eyrecourt or her address thanks to lord lorings picture gallery he thought i have found the man  he took up his pen and made a little memorandumwinterfield derwents hotel    chapter x  father benwells correspondence  i  to mr bitrake private and confidential  siri understand that your connection with the law does not exclude your occasional superintendence of confidential inquiries which are not of a nature to injure your professional position the inclosed letter of introduction will satisfy you that i am incapable of employing your experience in a manner unbecoming to you or to myself  the inquiry that i propose to you relates to a gentleman named winterfield he is now staying in london at derwents hotel and is expected to remain there for a week from the present date his place of residence is on the north devonshire coast and is well known in that locality by the name of beaupark house  the range of my proposed inquiry dates back over the last four or five yearscertainly not more my object is to ascertain as positively as may be whether within this limit of time events in mr winterfields life have connected him with a young lady named miss stella eyrecourt if this proves to be the case it is essential that i should be made acquainted with the whole of the circumstances  i have now informed you of all that i want to know whatever the information may be it is most important that it shall be information which i can implicitly trust please address to me when you write under cover to the friend whose letter i inclose  i beg your acceptanceas time is of importanceof a check for preliminary expenses and remain sir your faithful servant  ambrose benwell  ii  to the secretary society of jesus rome  i inclose a receipt for the remittance which your last letter confides to my care some of the money has been already used in prosecuting inquiries the result of which will as i hope and believe enable me to effectually protect romayne from the advances of the woman who is bent on marrying him  you tell me that our reverend fathers lately sitting in council on the vange abbey affair are anxious to hear if any positive steps have yet been taken toward the conversion of romayne i am happily able to gratify their wishes as you shall now see  yesterday i called at romaynes hotel to pay one of those occasional visits which help to keep up our acquaintance he was out and penrose for whom i asked next was with him most fortunately as the event proved i had not seen penrose or heard from him for some little time and i thought it desirable to judge for myself of the progress that he was making in the confidence of his employer i said i would wait the hotel servant knows me by sight i was shown into romaynes waitingroom  this room is so small as to be a mere cupboard it is lighted by a glass fanlight over the door which opens from the passage and is supplied with air in the absence of a fireplace by a ventilator in a second door which communicates with romaynes study looking about me so far i crossed to the other end of the study and discovered a diningroom and two bedrooms beyondthe set of apartments being secluded by means of a door at the end of the passage from the other parts of the hotel i trouble you with these details in order that you may understand the events that followed  i returned to the waitingroom not forgetting of course to close the door of communication  nearly an hour must have passed before i heard footsteps in the passage the study door was opened and the voices of persons entering the room reached me through the ventilator i recognized romayne penroseand lord loring  the first words exchanged among them informed me that romayne and his secretary had overtaken lord loring in the street as he was approaching the hotel door the three had entered the house togetherat a time probably when the servant who had admitted me was out of the way however it may have happened there i was forgotten in the waitingroom  could i intrude myself on a private conversation perhaps as an unannounced and unwelcome visitor and could i help it if the talk found its way to me through the ventilator along with the air that i breathed if our reverend fathers think i was to blame i bow to any reproof which their strict sense of propriety may inflict on me in the meantime i beg to repeat the interesting passages in the conversation as nearly word for word as i can remember them  his lordship as the principal personage in social rank shall be reported first he said more than a week has passed romayne and we have neither seen you nor heard from you why have you neglected us  here judging by certain sounds that followed penrose got up discreetly and left the room lord loring went on  he said to romayne now we are alone i may speak to you more freely you and stella seemed to get on together admirably that evening when you dined with us have you forgotten what you told me of her influence over you or have you altered your opinionand is that the reason why you keep away from us  romayne answered my opinion remains unchanged all that i said to you of miss eyrecourt i believe as firmly as ever  his lordship remonstrated naturally enough then why remain away from the good influence whyif it really can be controlledrisk another return of that dreadful nervous delusion  i have had another return  which as you yourself believe might have been prevented romayne you astonish me  there was a time of silence before romayne answered this he was a little mysterious when he did reply you know the old saying my good friendof two evils choose the least i bear my sufferings as one of two evils and the least of the two  lord loring appeared to feel the necessity of touching a delicate subject with a light hand he said in his pleasant way stella isnt the other evil i suppose  most assuredly not  then what is it  romayne answered almost passionately my own weakness and selfishness faults which i must resist or become a mean and heartless man for me the worst of the two evils is there i respect and admire miss eyrecourti believe her to be a woman in a thousanddont ask me to see her again where is penrose let us talk of something else  whether this wild way of speaking offended lord loring or only discouraged him i cannot say i heard him take his leave in these words you have disappointed me romayne we will talk of something else the next time we meet the study door was opened and closed romayne was left by himself  solitude was apparently not to his taste just then i heard him call to penrose i heard penrose ask do you want me  romayne answered god knows i want a friendand i have no friend near me but you major hynd is away and lord loring is offended with me  penrose asked why  romayne thereupon entered on the necessary explanation as a priest writing to priests i pass over details utterly uninteresting to us the substance of what he said amounted to this miss eyrecourt had produced an impression on him which was new to him in his experience of women if he saw more of her it might endi ask your pardon for repeating the ridiculous expressionin his falling in love with her in this condition of mind or body whichever it may be he would probably be incapable of the selfcontrol which he had hitherto practiced if she consented to devote her life to him he might accept the cruel sacrifice rather than do this he would keep away from her for her dear sakeno matter what he might suffer or whom he might offend  imagine any human being out of a lunatic asylum talking in this way shall i own to you my reverend colleague how this curious selfexposure struck me as i listened to romayne i felt grateful to the famous council which definitely forbade the priests of the catholic church to marry we might otherwise have been morally enervated by the weakness which degrades romayneand priests might have become instruments in the hands of women  but you will be anxious to hear what penrose did under the circumstances for the moment i can tell you this he startled me  instead of seizing the opportunity and directing romaynes mind to the consolations of religion penrose actually encouraged him to reconsider his decision all the weakness of my poor little arthurs character showed itself in his next words  he said to romayne it may be wrong in me to speak to you as freely as i wish to speak but you have so generously admitted me to your confidenceyou have been so considerate and so kind toward methat i feel an interest in your happiness which perhaps makes me over bold are you very sure that some such entire change in your life as your marriage might not end in delivering you from your burden if such a thing could be is it wrong to suppose that your wifes good influence over you might be the means of making your marriage a happy one i must not presume to offer an opinion on such a subject it is only my gratitude my true attachment to you that ventures to put the question are you conscious of having given this matterso serious a matter for yousufficient thought  make your mind easy reverend sir romaynes answer set everything right  he said i have thought of it till i could think no longer i still believe that sweet woman might control the torment of the voice but could she deliver me from the remorse perpetually gnawing at my heart i feel as murderers feel in taking another mans lifea man who had not even injured mei have committed the one unatonable and unpardonable sin can any human creatures influence make me forget that no more of itno more come let us take refuge in our books  those words touched penrose in the right place now as i understand his scruples he felt that he might honorably speak out his zeal more than balanced his weakness as you will presently see  he was loud he was positive when i heard him next no he burst out your refuge is not in books and not in the barren religious forms which call themselves protestant dear master the peace of mind which you believe you have lost forever you will find again in the divine wisdom and compassion of the holy catholic church there is the remedy for all that you suffer there is the new life that will yet make you a happy man  i repeat what he said so far merely to satisfy you that we can trust his enthusiasm when it is once roused nothing will discourage nothing will defeat him now he spoke with all the eloquence of convictionusing the necessary arguments with a force and feeling which i have rarely heard equaled romaynes silence vouched for the effect on him he is not the man to listen patiently to reasoning which he thinks he can overthrow  having heard enough to satisfy me that penrose had really begun the good work i quietly slipped out of the waitingroom and left the hotel  today being sunday i shall not lose a post if i keep my letter open until tomorrow i have already sent a note to penrose asking him to call on me at his earliest convenience there may be more news for you before post time  monday 10 am  there is more news penrose has just left me  his first proceeding of course was to tell me what i had already discovered for myself he is modest as usual about the prospect of success which awaits him but he has induced romayne to suspend his historical studies for a few days and to devote his attention to the books which we are accustomed to recommend for perusal in such cases as his this is unquestionably a great gain at starting  but my news is not at an end yet romayne is actually playing our gamehe has resolved definitely to withdraw himself from the influence of miss eyrecourt in another hour he and penrose will have left london their destination is kept a profound secret all letters addressed to romayne are to be sent to his bankers  the motive for this sudden resolution is directly traceable to lady loring  her ladyship called at the hotel yesterday evening and had a private interview with romayne her object no doubt was to shake his resolution and to make him submit himself again to miss eyrecourts fascinations what means of persuasion she used to effect this purpose is of course unknown to us penrose saw romayne after her ladyships departure and describes him as violently agitated i can quite understand it his resolution to take refuge in secret flight it is really nothing less speaks for itself as to the impression produced on him and the danger from which for the time at least we have escaped  yes i say for the time at least dont let our reverend fathers suppose that the money expended on my private inquiries has been money thrown away where these miserable love affairs are concerned women are daunted by no adverse circumstances and warned by no defeat romayne has left london in dread of his own weaknesswe must not forget that the day may yet come when nothing will interpose between us and failure but my knowledge of events in miss eyrecourts life  for the present there is no more to be said    chapter xi  stella asserts herself  two days after father benwell had posted his letter to rome lady loring entered her husbands study and asked eagerly if he had heard any news of romayne  lord loring shook his head as i told you yesterday he said the proprietor of the hotel can give me no information i went myself this morning to the bankers and saw the head partner he offered to forward letters but he could do no more until further notice he was positively enjoined not to disclose romaynes address to anybody how does stella bear it  in the worst possible way lady loring answered in silence  not a word even to you  not a word  at that reply the servant interrupted them by announcing the arrival of a visitor and presenting his card lord loring started and handed it to his wife the card bore the name of major hynd and this line was added in pencil on business connected with mr romayne  show him in directly cried lady loring  lord loring remonstrated my dear perhaps i had better see this gentleman alone  certainly notunless you wish to drive me into committing an act of the most revolting meanness if you send me away i shall listen at the door  major hynd was shown in and was duly presented to lady loring after making the customary apologies he said i returned to london last night expressly to see romayne on a matter of importance failing to discover his present address at the hotel i had the hope that your lordship might be able to direct me to our friend  i am sorry to say i know no more than you do lord loring replied romaynes present address is a secret confided to his bankers and to no one else i will give you their names if you wish to write to him  major hynd hesitated i am not quite sure that it would be discreet to write to him under the circumstances  lady loring could no longer keep silence is it possible major hynd to tell us what the circumstances are she asked i am almost as old a friend of romayne as my husbandand i am very anxious about him  the major looked embarrassed i can hardly answer your ladyship he said without reviving painful recollections  lady lorings impatience interrupted the majors apologies do you mean the duel she inquired  lord loring interposed i should tell you major hynd that lady loring is as well informed as i am of what happened at boulogne and of the deplorable result so far as romayne is concerned if you still wish to speak to me privately i will ask you to accompany me into the next room  major hynds embarrassment vanished after what you tell me he said i hope to be favored with lady lorings advice you both know that romayne fought the fatal duel with a son of the french general who had challenged him when we returned to england we heard that the general and his family had been driven away from boulogne by pecuniary difficulties romayne against my advice wrote to the surgeon who had been present at the duel desiring that the generals place of retreat might be discovered and expressing his wish to assist the family anonymously as their unknown friend the motive of course was in his own words to make some little atonement to the poor people whom he had wronged i thought it a rash proceeding at the time and i am confirmed in my opinion by a letter from the surgeon received yesterday will you kindly read it to lady loring  he handed the letter to lord loring translated from the french it ran as follows    siri am at last able to answer mr romaynes letter definitely with the courteous assistance of the french consul in london to whom i applied when other means of investigation had produced no result  a week since the general died circumstances connected with the burial expenses informed the consul that he had taken refuge from his creditors not in paris as we supposed but in london the address is number 10 camps hill islington i should also add that the general for obvious reasons lived in london under the assumed name of marillac it will be necessary therefore to inquire for his widow by the name of madame marillac  you will perhaps be surprised to find that i address these lines to you instead of to mr romayne the reason is soon told  i was acquainted with the late generalas you knowat a time when i was not aware of the company that he kept or of the deplorable errors into which his love of gambling had betrayed him of his widow and his children i know absolutely nothing whether they have resisted the contaminating influence of the head of the householdor whether poverty and bad example combined have hopelessly degraded themi cannot say there is at least a doubt whether they are worthy of mr romaynes benevolent intentions toward them as an honest man i cannot feel this doubt and reconcile it to my conscience to be the means however indirectly of introducing them to mr romayne to your discretion i leave it to act for the best after this warning    lord loring returned the letter to major hynd i agree with you he said it is more than doubtful whether you ought to communicate this information to romayne  lady loring was not quite of her husbands opinion while there is a doubt about these people she said it seems only just to find out what sort of character they bear in the neighborhood in your place major hynd i should apply to the person in whose house they live or to the tradespeople whom they have employed  i am obliged to leave london again today the major replied but on my return i will certainly follow your ladyships advice  and you will let us know the result  with the greatest pleasure  major hynd took his leave i think you will be responsible for wasting the majors time said lord loring when the visitor had retired  i think not said lady loring  she rose to leave the room are you going out her husband asked  no i am going upstairs to stella  lady loring found miss eyrecourt in her own room the little portrait of romayne which she had drawn from recollection lay on the table before her she was examining it with the closest attention  well stella and what does the portrait tell you  what i knew before adelaide there is nothing false and nothing cruel in that face  and does the discovery satisfy you for my part i despise romayne for hiding himself from us can you excuse him  stella locked up the portrait in her writingcase i can wait she said quietly  this assertion of patience seemed to irritate lady loring what is the matter with you this morning she asked you are more reserved than ever  no i am only out of spirits adelaide i cant help thinking of that meeting with winterfield i feel as if some misfortune was hanging over my head  dont speak of that hateful man her ladyship exclaimed i have something to tell you about romayne are you completely absorbed in your presentiments of evil or do you think you can listen to me  stellas face answered for her lady loring described the interview with major hynd in the minutest detailincluding by way of illustration the majors manners and personal appearance he and lord loring she added both think that romayne will never hear the last of it if he allows these foreigners to look to him for money until something more is known about them the letter is not to be forwarded  i wish i had the letter cried stella  would you forward it to romayne  instantly does it matter whether these poor french people are worthy of his generosity if it restores his tranquillity to help them who cares whether they deserve the help they are not even to know who it is that assists themromayne is to be their unknown friend it is he not they whom we have to think ofhis peace of mind is everything their merit is nothing i say its cruel to him to keep him in ignorance of what has happened why didnt you take the letter away from major hynd  gently stella the major is going to make inquiries about the widow and children when he returns to london  when he returns stella repeated indignantly who knows what the poor wretches may be suffering in the interval and what romayne may feel if he ever hears of it tell me the address againit was somewhere in islington you said  why do you want to know it lady loring asked you are not going to write to romayne yourself  i am going to think before i do anything if you cant trust my discretion adelaide you have only to say so  it was spoken sharply lady lorings reply betrayed a certain loss of temper on her side manage your own affairs stellai have done meddling with them her unlucky visit to romayne at the hotel had been a subject of dispute between the two friendsand this referred to it you shall have the address my lady added in her grandest manner she wrote it on a piece of paper and left the room  easily irritated lady loring had the merit of being easily appeased that meanest of all vices the vice of sulkiness had no existence in her nature in five minutes she regretted her little outburst of irritability for five minutes more she waited on the chance that stella might be the first to seek a reconciliation the interval passed and nothing happened have i really offended her lady loring asked herself the next moment she was on her way back to stella the room was empty she rang the bell for the maid  where is miss eyrecourt  gone out my lady  did she leave no message  no my lady she went away in a great hurry  lady loring at once drew the conclusion that stella had rashly taken the affair of the generals family into her own hands was it possible to say how this most imprudent proceeding might end after hesitating and reflecting and hesitating again lady lorings anxiety got beyond her control she not only decided on following stella but in the excess of her nervous apprehension she took one of the menservants with her in case of emergency    chapter xii  the generals family  not always remarkable for arriving at just conclusions lady loring had drawn the right inference this time stella had stopped the first cab that passed her and had directed the driver to camps hill islington  the aspect of the miserable little street closed at one end and swarming with dirty children quarreling over their play daunted her for the moment even the cabman drawing up at the entrance to the street expressed his opinion that it was a queer sort of place for a young lady to venture into alone stella thought of romayne her firm persuasion that she was helping him to perform an act of mercy which was to his mind an act of atonement as well roused her courage she boldly approached the open door of no 10 and knocked on it with her parasol  the tangled gray hair and grimy face of a hideous old woman showed themselves slowly at the end of the passage rising from the strongsmelling obscurity of the kitchen regions what do you want said the halfseen witch of the london slums does madame marillac live here stella asked do you mean the foreigner yes second door with those instructions the upper half of the witch sank and vanished stella gathered her skirts together and ascended a filthy flight of stairs for the first time in her life  coarse voices shameless language gross laughter behind the closed doors of the first floor hurried her on her way to the rooms on the higher flight here there was a change for the betterhere at least there was silence she knocked at the door on the landing of the second floor a gentle voice answered in french entrezthen quickly substituted the english equivalent come in stella opened the door  the wretchedly furnished room was scrupulously clean above the trucklebed a cheap little image of the virgin was fastened to the wall with some faded artificial flowers arranged above it in the form of a wreath two women in dresses of coarse black stuff sat at a small round table working at the same piece of embroidery the elder of the two rose when the visitor entered the room her worn and weary face still showed the remains of beauty in its finely proportioned partsher dim eyes rested on stella with an expression of piteous entreaty have you come for the work madam she asked in english spoken with a strong foreign accent pray forgive me i have not finished it yet  the second of the two workwomen suddenly looked up  she too was wan and frail but her eyes were bright her movements still preserved the elasticity of youth her likeness to the elder woman proclaimed their relationship even before she spoke ah its my fault she burst out passionately in french i was hungry and tired and i slept hours longer than i ought my mother was too kind to wake me and set me to work i am a selfish wretchand my mother is an angel she dashed away the tears gathering in her eyes and proudly fiercely resumed her work  stella hastened to reassure them the moment she could make herself heard indeed i have nothing to do with the work she said speaking in french so that they might the more readily understand her i came here madame marillacif you will not be offended with me for plainly owning itto offer you some little help  charity asked the daughter looking up again sternly from her needle  sympathy stella answered gently  the girl resumed her work i beg your pardon she said i shall learn to submit to my lot in time  the quiet longsuffering mother placed a chair for stella you have a kind beautiful face miss she said and i am sure you will make allowances for my poor girl i remember the time when i was as quick to feel as she is may i ask how you came to hear of us  i hope you will excuse me stella replied i am not at liberty to answer that question  the mother said nothing the daughter asked sharply why not  stella addressed her answer to the mother i come from a person who desires to be of service to you as an unknown friend she said  the wan face of the widow suddenly brightened oh she exclaimed has my brother heard of the generals death and has he forgiven me my marriage at last  no no stella interposed i must not mislead you the person whom i represent is no relation of yours  even in spite of this positive assertion the poor woman held desperately to the hope that had been roused in her the name by which you know me may mislead you she suggested anxiously my late husband assumed the name in his exile here perhaps if i told you  the daughter stopped her there my dear mother leave this to me the widow sighed resignedly and resumed her work madame marillac will do very well as a name the girl continued turning to stella until we know something more of each other i suppose you are well acquainted with the person whom you represent  certainly or i should not be here  you know the persons family connections in that case and you can say for certain whether they are french connections or not  i can say for certain stella answered that they are english connections i represent a friend who feels kindly toward madame marillac nothing more  you see mother you were mistaken bear it as bravely dear as you have borne other trials saying this very tenderly she addressed herself once more to stella without attempting to conceal the accompanying change in her manner to coldness and distrust one of us must speak plainly she said our few friends are nearly as poor as we are and they are all french i tell you positively that we have no english friends how has this anonymous benefactor been informed of our poverty you are a stranger to usyou cannot have given the information  stellas eyes were now open to the awkward position in which she had placed herself she met the difficulty boldly still upheld by the conviction that she was serving a purpose cherished by romayne you had good reasons no doubt mademoiselle when you advised your mother to conceal her true name she rejoined be just enough to believe that your anonymous benefactor has good reasons for concealment too  it was well said and it encouraged madame marillac to take stellas part my dear blanche you speak rather harshly to this good young lady she said to her daughter you have only to look at her and to see that she means well  blanche took up her needle again with dogged submission if we are to accept charity mother i should like to know the hand that gives it she answered i will say no more  when you are as old as i am my dear rejoined madame marillac you will not think quite so positively as you think now i have learned some hard lessons she proceeded turning to stella and i hope i am the better for them my life has not been a happy one  your life has been a martyrdom said the girl breaking out again in spite of herself oh my father my father she pushed aside the work and hid her face in her hands  the gentle mother spoke severely for the first time respect your fathers memory she said blanche trembled and kept silence i have no false pride madame marillac continued i own that we are miserably poor and i thank you my dear young lady for your kind intentions toward us without embarrassing you by any inquiries we manage to live while my eyes last our work helps to support us my good eldest daughter has some employment as a teacher of music and contributes her little share to assist our poor household i dont distrust youi only say let us try a little longer if we cannot help ourselves  she had barely pronounced the last words when a startling interruption led to consequences which the persons present had not foreseen a shrill wailing voice suddenly pierced through the flimsy partition which divided the front room and the back room bread cried the voice in french im hungry bread bread  the daughter started to her feet think of his betraying us at this moment she exclaimed indignantly the mother rose in silence and opened a cupboard its position was opposite to the place in which stella was sitting she saw two or three knives and forks some cups and saucers and plates and a folded tablecloth nothing else appeared on the shelves not even the stray crust of bread for which the poor woman had been looking go my dear and quiet your brother she saidand closed the cupboard door again as patiently as ever  stella opened her pocketbook when blanche had left the room for gods sake take something she cried i offer it with the sincerest respecti offer it as a loan  madame marillac gently signed to stella to close the pocketbook again that kind heart of yours must not be distressed about trifles she said the baker will trust us until we get the money for our workand my daughter knows it if you can tell me nothing else my dear will you tell me your christian name it is painful to me to speak to you quite as a stranger  stella at once complied with the request madame marillac smiled as she repeated the name  there is almost another tie between us she said we have your name in franceit speaks with a familiar sound to me in this strange place dear miss stella when my poor boy startled you by that cry for food he recalled to me the saddest of all my anxieties when i think of him i should be tempted if my better sense did not restrain meno no put back the pocketbook i am incapable of the shameless audacity of borrowing a sum of money which i could never repay let me tell you what my trouble is and you will understand that i am in earnest i had two sons miss stella the elderthe most lovable the most affectionate of my childrenwas killed in a duel  the sudden disclosure drew a cry of sympathy from stella which she was not mistress enough of herself to repress now for the first time she understood the remorse that tortured romayne as she had not understood it when lady loring had told her the terrible story of the duel attributing the effect produced on her to the sensitive nature of a young woman madame marillac innocently added to stellas distress by making excuses  i am sorry to have frightened you my dear she said in your happy country such a dreadful death as my sons is unknown i am obliged to mention it or you might not understand what i have still to say perhaps i had better not go on  stella roused herself yes yes she answered eagerly pray go on  my son in the next room the widow resumed is only fourteen years old it has pleased god sorely to afflict a harmless creature he has not been in his right mind sincesince the miserable day when he followed the duelists and saw his brothers death oh you are turning pale how thoughtless how cruel of me i ought to have remembered that such horrors as these have never overshadowed your happy life  struggling to recover her selfcontrol stella tried to reassure madame marillac by a gesture the voice which she had heard in the next room wasas she now knewthe voice that haunted romayne not the words that had pleaded hunger and called for breadbut those other words assassin assassin where are yourang in her ears she entreated madame marillac to break the unendurable interval of silence the widows calm voice had a soothing influence which she was eager to feel go on she repeated pray go on  i ought not to lay all the blame of my boys affliction on the duel said madame marillac in childhood his mind never grew with his bodily growth his brothers death may have only hurried the result which was sooner or later but too sure to come you need feel no fear of him he is never violentand he is the most beautiful of my children would you like to see him  no i would rather hear you speak of him is he not conscious of his own misfortune  for weeks together stellai am sure i may call you stellahe is quite calm you would see no difference outwardly between him and other boys unhappily it is just at those times that a spirit of impatience seems to possess him he watches his opportunity and however careful we may be he is cunning enough to escape our vigilance  do you mean that he leaves you and his sisters  yes that is what i mean for nearly two months past he has been away from us yesterday only his return relieved us from a state of suspense which i cannot attempt to describe we dont know where he has been or in the company of what persons he has passed the time of his absense no persuasion will induce him to speak to us on the subject this morning we listened while he was talking to himself  was it part of the boys madness to repeat the words which still tormented romayne stella asked if he ever spoke of the duel  never he seems to have lost all memory of it we only heard this morning one or two unconnected wordssomething about a woman and then more that appeared to allude to some persons death last night i was with him when he went to bed and i found that he had something to conceal from me he let me fold all his clothes as usual except his waistcoatand that he snatched away from me and put it under his pillow we have no hope of being able to examine the waistcoat without his knowledge his sleep is like the sleep of a dog if you only approach him he wakes instantly forgive me for troubling you with these trifling details only interesting to ourselves you will at least understand the constant anxiety that we suffer  in your unhappy position said stella i should try to resign myself to parting with himi mean to placing him under medical care  the mothers face saddened i have inquired about it she answered he must pass a night in the workhouse before he can be received as a pauper lunatic in a public asylum oh my dear i am afraid there is some pride still left in me he is my only son now his father was a general in the french army i was brought up among people of good blood and breedingi cant take my own boy to the workhouse  stella understood her i feel for you with all my heart she said place him privately dear madame marillac under skillful and kind controland let me do let me open the pocketbook again  the widow steadily refused even to look at the pocketbook perhaps stella persisted you dont know of a private asylum that would satisfy you  my dear i do know of such a place the good doctor who attended my husband in his last illness told me of it a friend of his receives a certain number of poor people into his house and charges no more than the cost of maintaining them an unattainable sum to me there is the temptation that i spoke of the help of a few pounds i might accept if i fell ill because i might afterward pay it back but a larger sumnever  she rose as if to end the interview stella tried every means of persuasion that she could think of and tried in vain the friendly dispute between them might have been prolonged if they had not both been silenced by another interruption from the next room  this time it was not only endurable it was even welcome the poor boy was playing the air of a french vaudeville on a pipe or flageolet now he is happy said the mother he is a born musician do come and see him an idea struck stella she overcame the inveterate reluctance in her to see the boy so fatally associated with the misery of romaynes life as madame marillac led the way to the door of communication between the rooms she quickly took from her pocketbook the banknotes with which she had provided herself and folded them so that they could be easily concealed in her hand  she followed the widow into the little room  the boy was sitting on his bed he laid down his flageolet and bowed to stella his long silky hair flowed to his shoulders but one betrayal of a deranged mind presented itself in his delicate facehis large soft eyes had the glassy vacant look which it is impossible to mistake do you like music mademoiselle he asked gently stella asked him to play his little vaudeville air again he proudly complied with the request his sister seemed to resent the presence of a stranger the work is at a standstill she saidand passed into the front room her mother followed her as far as the door to give her some necessary directions stella seized her opportunity she put the banknotes into the pocket of the boys jacket and whispered to him give them to your mother when i have gone away under those circumstances she felt sure that madame marillac would yield to the temptation she could resist muchbut she could not resist her son  the boy nodded to show that he understood her the moment after he laid down his flageolet with an expression of surprise  you are trembling he said are you frightened  she was frightened the mere sense of touching him had made her shudder did she feel a vague presentiment of some evil to come from that momentary association with him  madame marillac turning away again from her daughter noticed stellas agitation surely my poor boy doesnt alarm you she said before stella could answer some one outside knocked at the door lady lorings servant appeared charged with a carefullyworded message if you please miss a friend is waiting for you below any excuse for departure was welcome to stella at that moment she promised to call at the house again in a few days madame marillac kissed her on the forehead as she took leave her nerves were still shaken by that momentary contact with the boy descending the stairs she trembled so that she was obliged to hold by the servants arm she was not naturally timid what did it mean    lady lorings carriage was waiting at the entrance of the street with all the children in the neighborhood assembled to admire it she impulsively forestalled the servant in opening the carriage door come in she cried oh stella you dont know how you have frightened me good heavens you look frightened yourself from what wretches have i rescued you take my smelling bottle and tell me all about it  the fresh air and the reassuring presence of her old friend revived stella she was able to describe her interview with the generals family and to answer the inevitable inquiries which the narrative called forth lady lorings last question was the most important of the series what are you going to do about romayne  i am going to write to him the moment we get home  the answer seemed to alarm lady loring you wont betray me she said  what do you mean  you wont let romayne discover that i have told you about the duel  certainly not you shall see my letter before i send it to be forwarded  tranquilized so far lady loring bethought herself next of major hynd can we tell him what you have done her ladyship asked  of course we can tell him stella replied i shall conceal nothing from lord loring and i shall beg your good husband to write to the major he need only say that i have made the necessary inquiries after being informed of the circumstances by you and that i have communicated the favorable result to mr romayne  its easy enough to write the letter my dear but its not so easy to say what major hynd may think of you  does it matter to me what major hynd thinks  lady loring looked at stella with a malicious smile are you equally indifferent she said to what romaynes opinion of your conduct may be  stellas color rose try to be serious adelaide when you speak to me of romayne she answered gravely his good opinion of me is the breath of my life  an hour later the important letter to romayne was written stella scrupulously informed him of all that had happenedwith two necessary omissions in the first place nothing was said of the widows reference to her sons death and of the effect produced by it on his younger brother the boy was simply described as being of weak intellect and as requiring to be kept under competent control in the second place romayne was left to infer that ordinary motives of benevolence were the only motives on his part known to miss eyrecourt  the letter ended in these lines  if i have taken an undue liberty in venturing unasked to appear as your representative i can only plead that i meant well it seemed to me to be hard on these poor people and not just to you in your absence to interpose any needless delays in carrying out those kind intentions of yours which had no doubt been properly considered beforehand in forming your opinion of my conduct pray remember that i have been careful not to compromise you in any way you are only known to madame marillac as a compassionate person who offers to help her and who wishes to give that help anonymously if notwithstanding this you disapprove of what i have done i must not conceal that it will grieve and humiliate mei have been so eager to be of use to you when others appeared to hesitate i must find my consolation in remembering that i have become acquainted with one of the sweetest and noblest of women and that i have helped to preserve her afflicted son from dangers in the future which i cannot presume to estimate you will complete what i have only begun be forbearing and kind to me if i have innocently offended in this matterand i shall gratefully remember the day when i took it on myself to be mr romaynes almoner  lady loring read these concluding sentences twice over  i think the end of your letter will have its effect on him she said  if it brings me a kind letter in reply stella answered it will have all the effect i hope for  if it does anything lady loring rejoined it will do more than that  what more can it do  my dear it can bring romayne back to you  those hopeful words seemed rather to startle stella than to encourage her  bring him back to me she repeated oh adelaide i wish i could think as you do  send the letter to the post said lady loring and we shall see    chapter xiii  father benwells correspondence  i  arthur penrose to father benwell  reverend and dear fatherwhen i last had the honor of seeing you i received your instructions to report by letter the result of my conversations on religion with mr romayne  as events have turned out it is needless to occupy your time by dwelling at any length on this subject in writing mr romayne has been strongly impressed by the excellent books which i have introduced to his notice he raises certain objections which i have done my best to meet and he promises to consider my arguments with his closest attention in the time to come i am happier in the hope of restoring his mental tranquillityin other and worthier words of effecting his conversionthan i can tell you in any words of mine i respect and admire i may almost say i love mr romayne  the details which are wanting in this brief report of progress i shall have the privilege of personally relating to you mr romayne no longer desires to conceal himself from his friends he received a letter this morning which has changed all his plans and has decided him on immediately returning to london i am not acquainted with the contents of the letter or with the name of the writer but i am pleased for mr romaynes sake to see that the reading of it has made him happy  by tomorrow evening i hope to present my respects to you  ii  mr bitrake to father benwell  sirthe inquiries which i have instituted at your request have proved successful in one respect  i am in a position to tell you that events in mr winterfields life have unquestionably connected him with the young lady named miss stella eyrecourt  the attendant circumstances however are not so easy to discover judging by the careful report of the person whom i employ there must have been serious reasons in this case for keeping facts secret and witnesses out of the way i mention this not to discourage you but to prepare you for delays that may occur on our way to discovery  be pleased to preserve your confidence in me and to give me timeand i answer for the result     book the second    chapter i  the sandwich dance  a fine spring after a winter of unusual severity promised well for the prospects of the london season  among the social entertainments of the time general curiosity was excited in the little sphere which absurdly describes itself under the big name of society by the announcement of a party to be given by lady loring bearing the quaint title of a sandwich dance the invitations were issued at an unusually early hour and it was understood that nothing so solid and so commonplace as the customary supper was to be offered to the guests in a word lady lorings ball was designed as a bold protest against late hours and heavy midnight meals the younger people were all in favor of the proposed reform their elders declined to give an opinion beforehand  in the small inner circle of lady lorings most intimate friends it was whispered that an innovation in the matter of refreshments was contemplated which would put the tolerant principles of the guests to a severe test miss notman the housekeeper politely threatening retirement on a small annuity since the memorable affair of the oysteromelet decided on carrying out her design when she heard that there was to be no supper my attachment to the family can bear a great deal she said but when lady loring deliberately gives a ball without a supper i must hide my head somewhereand it had better be out of the house taking miss notman as representative of a class the reception of the coming experiment looked to say the least of it doubtful  on the appointed evening the guests made one agreeable discovery when they entered the reception rooms they were left perfectly free to amuse themselves as they liked  the drawingrooms were given up to dancing the picture gallery was devoted to chamber music chessplayers and cardplayers found remote and quiet rooms especially prepared for them people who cared for nothing but talking were accommodated to perfection in a sphere of their own and lovers in earnest or not in earnest discovered in a dimlylighted conservatory with many recesses that ideal of discreet retirement which combines solitude and society under one roof  but the ordering of the refreshments failed as had been foreseen to share in the approval conferred on the arrangement of the rooms the first impression was unfavorable lady loring however knew enough of human nature to leave results to two potent alliesexperience and time  excepting the conservatory the astonished guests could go nowhere without discovering tables prettily decorated with flowers and bearing hundreds of little pure white china plates loaded with nothing but sandwiches all varieties of opinion were consulted people of ordinary tastes who liked to know what they were eating could choose conventional beef or ham encased in thin slices of bread of a delicate flavor quite new to them other persons less easily pleased were tempted by sandwiches of pate de fois gras and by exquisite combinations of chicken and truffles reduced to a creamy pulp which clung to the bread like butter foreigners making experiments and not averse to garlic discovered the finest sausages of germany and italy transformed into english sandwiches anchovies and sardines appealed in the same unexpected way to men who desired to create an artificial thirstafter having first ascertained that the champagne was something to be fondly remembered and regretted at other parties to the end of the season the hospitable profusion of the refreshments was allpervading and inexhaustible wherever the guests might be or however they were amusing themselves there were the pretty little white plates perpetually tempting them people eat as they had never eat before and even the inveterate english prejudice against anything new was conquered at last universal opinion declared the sandwich dance to be an admirable idea perfectly carried out  many of the guests paid their hostess the compliment of arriving at the early hour mentioned in the invitations one of them was major hynd lady loring took her first opportunity of speaking to him apart  i hear you were a little angry she said when you were told that miss eyrecourt had taken your inquiries out of your hands  i thought it rather a bold proceeding lady loring the major replied but as the generals widow turned out to be a lady in the best sense of the word miss eyrecourts romantic adventure has justified itself i wouldnt recommend her to run the same risk a second time  i suppose you know what romayne thinks of it  not yet i have been too busy to call on him since i have been in town pardon me lady loring who is that beautiful creature in the pale yellow dress surely i have seen her somewhere before  that beautiful creature major is the bold young lady of whose conduct you dont approve  miss eyrecourt  yes  i retract everything i said cried the major quite shamelessly such a woman as that may do anything she is looking this way pray introduce me  the major was introduced and lady loring returned to her guests  i think we have met before major hynd said stella  her voice supplied the missing link in the majors memory of events remembering how she had looked at romayne on the deck of the steamboat he began dimly to understand miss eyrecourts otherwise incomprehensible anxiety to be of use to the generals family i remember perfectly he answered it was on the passage from boulogne to folkestoneand my friend was with me you and he have no doubt met since that time he put the question as a mere formality the unexpressed thought in him was another of them in love with romayne and nothing as usual likely to come of it  i hope you have forgiven me for going to camps hill in your place said stella  i ought to be grateful to you the major rejoined no time has been lost in relieving these poor peopleand your powers of persuasion have succeeded where mine might have failed has romayne been to see them himself since his return to london  no he desires to remain unknown and he is kindly content for the present to be represented by me  for the present major hynd repeated  a faint flush passed over her delicate complexion i have succeeded she resumed in inducing madame marillac to accept the help offered through me to her son the poor creature is safe under kind superintendence in a private asylum so far i can do no more  will the mother accept nothing  nothing either for herself or her daughter so long as they can work i cannot tell you how patiently and beautifully she speaks of her hard lot but her health may give wayand it is possible before long that i may leave london she paused the flush deepened on her face the failure of the mothers health may happen in my absence she continued and mr romayne will ask you to look after the family from time to time while i am away  i will do it with pleasure miss eyrecourt is romayne likely to be here tonight  she smiled brightly and looked away the majors curiosity was excitedhe looked in the same direction there was romayne entering the room to answer for himself  what was the attraction which drew the unsocial student to an evening party major hynds eyes were on the watch when romayne and stella shook hands the attraction stood selfrevealed to him in miss eyrecourt recalling the momentary confusion which she had betrayed when she spoke of possibly leaving london and of romaynes plans for supplying her place as his almoner the major with military impatience of delays jumped to a conclusion i was wrong he thought my impenetrable friend is touched in the right place at last when the splendid creature in yellow leaves london the name on her luggage will be mrs romayne  you are looking quite another man romayne he said mischievously since we met last  stella gently moved away leaving them to talk freely romayne took no advantage of the circumstance to admit his old friend to his confidence whatever relations might really exist between miss eyrecourt and himself were evidently kept secret thus far my health has been a little better lately was the only reply he made  the major dropped his voice to a whisper  have you not had any return he began  romayne stopped him there i dont want my infirmities made public he whispered back irritably look at the people all round us when i tell you i have been better lately you ought to know what it means  any discoverable reason for the improvement persisted the major still bent on getting evidence in support of his own private conclusions  none romayne answered sharply  but major hynd was not to be discouraged by sharp replies miss eyrecourt and i have been recalling our first meeting on board the steamboat he went on do you remember how indifferent you were to that beautiful person when i asked you if you knew her im glad to see that you show better taste tonight i wish i knew her well enough to shake hands as you did  hynd when a young man talks nonsense his youth is his excuse at your time of life you have passed the excusable ageeven in the estimation of your friends  with those words romayne turned away the incorrigible major instantly met the reproof inflicted on him with a smart answer remember he said that i was the first of your friends to wish you happiness he too turned awayin the direction of the champagne and the sandwiches  meanwhile stella had discovered penrose lost in the brilliant assemblage of guests standing alone in a corner it was enough for her that romaynes secretary was also romaynes friend passing by titled and celebrated personages all anxious to speak to her she joined the shy nervous sadlooking little man and did all she could to set him at his ease  i am afraid mr penrose this is not a very attractive scene to you having said those kind words she paused penrose was looking at her confusedly but with an expression of interest which was new to her experience of him has romayne told him she wondered inwardly  it is a very beautiful scene miss eyrecourt he said in his low quiet tones  did you come here with mr romayne she asked  yes it was by his advice that i accepted the invitation with which lady loring has honored me i am sadly out of place in such an assembly as thisbut i would make far greater sacrifices to please mr romayne  she smiled kindly attachment so artlessly devoted to the man she loved pleased and touched her in her anxiety to discover a subject which might interest him she overcame her antipathy to the spiritual director of the household is father benwell coming to us tonight she inquired  he will certainly be here miss eyrecourt if he can get back to london in time  has he been long away  nearly a week  not knowing what else to say she still paid penrose the compliment of feigning an interest in father benwell  has he a long journey to make in returning to london she asked  yesall the way from devonshire  from south devonshire  no north devonshireclovelly  the smile suddenly left her face she put another questionwithout quite concealing the effort that it cost her or the anxiety with which she waited for the reply  i know something of the neighborhood of clovelly she said i wonder whether father benwell is visiting any friends of mine there  i am not able to say miss eyrecourt the reverend fathers letters are forwarded to the hoteli know no more than that  with a gentle inclination of her head she turned toward other guestslooked backand with a last little courteous attention offered to him said if you like music mr penrose i advise you to go to the picture gallery they are going to play a quartet by mozart  penrose thanked her noticing that her voice and manner had become strangely subdued she made her way back to the room in which the hostess received her guests lady loring was for the moment alone resting on a sofa stella stooped over her and spoke in cautiously lowered tones  if father benwell comes here tonight she said try to find out what he has been doing at clovelly  clovelly lady loring repeated is that the village near winterfields house  yes    chapter ii  the question of marriage  as stella answered lady loring she was smartly tapped on the shoulder by an eager guest with a fan  the guest was a very little woman with twinkling eyes and a perpetual smile nature corrected by powder and paint was liberally displayed in her arms her bosom and the upper part of her back such clothes as she wore defective perhaps in quantity were in quality absolutely perfect more adorable color shape and workmanship never appeared even in a milliners picturebook her light hair was dressed with a fringe and ringlets on the pattern which the portraits of the time of charles the second have made familiar to us there was nothing exactly young or exactly old about her except her voice which betrayed a faint hoarseness attributable possibly to exhaustion produced by untold years of incessant talking it might be added that she was as active as a squirrel and as playful as a kitten but the lady must be treated with a certain forbearance of tone for this good reasonshe was stellas mother  stella turned quickly at the tap of the fan mamma she exclaimed how you startle me  my dear child said mrs eyrecourt you are constitutionally indolent and you want startling go into the next room directly mr romayne is looking for you  stella drew back a step and eyed her mother in blank surprise is it possible that you know him she asked  mr romayne doesnt go into society or we should have met long since mrs eyrecourt replied he is a striking personand i noticed him when he shook hands with you that was quite enough for me i have just introduced myself to him as your mother he was a little stately and stiff but most charming when he knew who i was i volunteered to find you he was quite astonished i think he took me for your elder sister not the least like each otherare we lady loring she takes after her poor dear father he was constitutionally indolent my sweet child rouse yourself you have drawn a prize in the great lottery at last if ever a man was in love mr romayne is that man i am a physiognomist lady loring and i see the passions in the face oh stella what a property vange abbey i once drove that way when i was visiting in the neighborhood superb and another fortune twelve thousand a year and a villa at highgate since the death of his aunt and my daughter may be mistress of this if she only plays her cards properly what a compensation after all that we suffered through that monster winterfield  mamma pray dont  stella i will not be interrupted when i am speaking to you for your own good i dont know a more provoking person lady loring than my daughteron certain occasions and yet i love her i would go through fire and water for my beautiful child only last week i was at a wedding and i thought of stella the church was crammed to the doors a hundred at the wedding breakfast the brides lacethere no language can describe it ten bridesmaids in blue and silver reminded me of the ten virgins only the proportion of foolish ones this time was certainly more than five however they looked well the archbishop proposed the health of the bride and bridegroom so sweetly pathetic some of us cried i thought of my daughter oh if i could live to see stella the central attraction so to speak of such a wedding as that only i would have twelve bridesmaids at least and beat the blue and silver with green and gold trying to the complexion you will say but there are artificial improvements at least i am told so what a house this would bea broad hint isnt it dear lady loringwhat a house for a wedding with the drawingroom to assemble in and the picture gallery for the breakfast i know the archbishop my darling he shall marry you why dont you go into the next room ah that constitutional indolence if you only had my energy as i used to say to your poor father will you go yes dear lady loring i should like a glass of champagne and another of those delicious chicken sandwiches if you dont go stella i shall forget every consideration of propriety and big as you are i shall push you out  stella yielded to necessity keep her quiet if you can she whispered to lady loring in the moment of silence that followed even mrs eyrecourt was not able to talk while she was drinking champagne  in the next room stella found romayne he looked careworn and irritable but brightened directly when she approached him  my mother has been speaking to you she said i am afraid  he stopped her there she is your mother he interposed kindly dont think that i am ungrateful enough to forget that  she took his arm and looked at him with all her heart in her eyes come into a quieter room she whispered  romayne led her away neither of them noticed penrose as they left the room  he had not moved since stella had spoken to him there he remained in his corner absorbed in thoughtand not in happy thought as his face would have plainly betrayed to any one who had cared to look at him his eyes sadly followed the retiring figures of stella and romayne the color rose on his haggard cheeks like most men who are accustomed to live alone he had the habit when he was strongly excited of speaking to himself no he said as the unacknowledged lovers disappeared through the door it is an insult to ask me to do it he turned the other way escaped lady lorings notice in the receptionroom and left the house  romayne and stella passed through the cardroom and the chessroom turned into a corridor and entered the conservatory  for the first time the place was a solitude the air of a newlyinvented dance faintly audible through the open windows of the ballroom above had proved an irresistible temptation those who knew the dance were eager to exhibit themselves those who had only heard of it were equally anxious to look on and learn even toward the latter end of the nineteenth century the youths and maidens of society can still be in earnestwhen the object in view is a new dance  what would major hynd have said if he had seen romayne turn into one of the recesses of the conservatory in which there was a seat which just held two but the major had forgotten his years and his family and he too was one of the spectators in the ballroom  i wonder said stella whether you know how i feel those kind words of yours when you spoke of my mother shall i tell you  she put her arm round his neck and kissed him he was a man new to love in the nobler sense of the word the exquisite softness in the touch of her lips the delicious fragrance of her breath intoxicated him again and again he returned the kiss she drew back she recovered her selfpossession with a suddenness and a certainty incomprehensible to a man from the depths of tenderness she passed to the shallows of frivolity in her own defense she was almost as superficial as her mother in less than a moment  what would mr penrose say if he saw you she whispered  why do you speak of penrose have you seen him tonight  yeslooking sadly out of his element poor man i did my best to set him at his easebecause i know you like him  dear stella  no not again i am speaking seriously now mr penrose looked at me with a strange kind of interesti cant describe it have you taken him into our confidence  he is so devotedhe has such a true interest in me said romaynei really felt ashamed to treat him like a stranger on our journey to london i did own that it was your charming letter which had decided me on returning i did say i must tell her myself how well she has understood me and how deeply i feel her kindness penrose took my hand in his gentle considerate way i understand you too he saidand that was all that passed between us  nothing more since that time  nothing  not a word of what we said to each other when we were alone last week in the picture gallery  not a word i am selftormentor enough to distrust myself even now god knows i have concealed nothing from you and yetam i not selfishly thinking of my own happiness stella when i ought to be thinking only of you you know my angel with what a life you must associate yourself if you marry me are you really sure that you have love enough and courage enough to be my wife  she rested her head caressingly on his shoulder and looked up at him with her charming smile  how many times must i say it she asked before you will believe me once morei have love enough and courage enough to be your wife and i knew it lewis the first time i saw you will that confession satisfy your scruples and will you promise never again to doubt yourself or me  romayne promised and sealed the promiseunresisted this timewith a kiss when are we to be married he whispered  she lifted her head from his shoulder with a sigh if i am to answer you honestly she replied i must speak of my mother before i speak of myself  romayne submitted to the duties of his new position as well as he understood them do you mean that you have told your mother of our engagement he said in that case is it my duty or yoursi am very ignorant in these mattersto consult her wishes my own idea is that i ought to ask her if she approves of me as her soninlaw and that you might then speak to her of the marriage  stella thought of romaynes tastes all in favor of modest retirement and of her mothers tastes all in favor of ostentation and display she frankly owned the result produced in her own mind i am afraid to consult my mother about our marriage she said  romayne looked astonished do you think mrs eyrecourt will disapprove of it he asked  stella was equally astonished on her side disapprove of it she repeated i know for certain that my mother will be delighted  then where is the difficulty  there was but one way of definitely answering that question stella boldly described her mothers idea of a weddingincluding the archbishop the twelve bridesmaids in green and gold and the hundred guests at breakfast in lord lorings picture gallery romaynes consternation literally deprived him for the moment of the power of speech to say that he looked at stella as a prisoner in the condemned cell might have looked at the sheriff announcing the morning of his execution would be to do injustice to the prisoner he receives his shock without flinching and in proof of his composure celebrates his wedding with the gallows by a breakfast which he will not live to digest  if you think as your mother does romayne began as soon as he had recovered his selfpossession no opinion of mine shall stand in the way he could get no further his vivid imagination saw the archbishop and the bridesmaids heard the hundred guests and their dreadful speeches his voice faltered in spite of himself  stella eagerly relieved him my darling i dont think as my mother does she interposed tenderly i am sorry to say we have very few sympathies in common marriages as i think ought to be celebrated as privately as possiblethe near and dear relations present and no one else if there must be rejoicings and banquets and hundreds of invitations let them come when the wedded pair are at home after the honeymoon beginning life in earnest these are odd ideas for a woman to havebut they are my ideas for all that  romaynes face brightened how few women possess your fine sense and your delicacy of feeling he exclaimed surely your mother must give way when she hears we are both of one mind about our marriage  stella knew her mother too well to share the opinion thus expressed mrs eyrecourts capacity for holding to her own little ideas and for persisting where her social interests were concerned in trying to insinuate those ideas into the minds of other persons was a capacity which no resistance short of absolute brutality could overcome she was perfectly capable of worrying romayne as well as her daughter to the utmost limits of human endurance in the firm conviction that she was bound to convert all heretics of their way of thinking to the orthodox faith in the matter of weddings putting this view of the case with all possible delicacy in speaking of her mother stella expressed herself plainly enough nevertheless to enlighten romayne  he made another suggestion can we marry privately he said and tell mrs eyrecourt of it afterward  this essentially masculine solution of the difficulty was at once rejected stella was too good a daughter to suffer her mother to be treated with even the appearance of disrespect oh she said think how mortified and distressed my mother would be she must be present at my marriage  an idea of a compromise occurred to romayne what do you say he proposed to arranging for the marriage privatelyand then telling mrs eyrecourt only a day or two beforehand when it would be too late to send out invitations if your mother would be disappointed  she would be angry stella interposed  very welllay all the blame on me besides there might be two other persons present whom i am sure mrs eyrecourt is always glad to meet you dont object to lord and lady loring  object they are my dearest friends as well as yours  any one else stella  any one lewis whom you like  then i sayno one else my own love when may it be my lawyers can get the settlements ready in a fortnight or less will you say in a fortnight  his arm was round her waist his lips were touching her lovely neck she was not a woman to take refuge in the commonplace coquetries of the sex yes she said softly if you wish it she rose and withdrew herself from him for my sake we must not be here together any longer lewis as she spoke the music in the ballroom ceased stella ran out of the conservatory  the first person she encountered on returning to the receptionroom was father benwell    chapter iii  the end of the ball  the priests long journey did not appear to have fatigued him he was as cheerful and as polite as everand so paternally attentive to stella that it was quite impossible for her to pass him with a formal bow  i have come all the way from devonshire he said the train has been behind time as usual and i am one of the late arrivals in consequence i miss some familiar faces at this delightful party mr romayne for instance perhaps he is not one of the guests  oh yes  has he gone away  not that i know of  the tone of her replies warned father benwell to let romayne be he tried another name  and arthur penrose he inquired next  i think mr penrose has left us  as she answered she looked toward lady loring the hostess was the center of a circle of ladies and gentlemen before she was at liberty father benwell might take his departure stella resolved to make the attempt for herself which she had asked lady loring to make for her it was better to try and to be defeated than not to try at all  i asked mr penrose what part of devonshire you were visiting she resumed assuming her more gracious manner i know something myself of the north coast especially the neighborhood of clovelly  not the faintest change passed over the priests face his fatherly smile had never been in a better state of preservation  isnt it a charming place he said with enthusiasm clovelly is the most remarkable and most beautiful village in england i have so enjoyed my little holidayexcursions by sea and excursions by landyou know i feel quite young again  he lifted his eyebrows playfully and rubbed his plump hands one over the other with such an intolerably innocent air of enjoyment that stella positively hated him she felt her capacity for selfrestraint failing her under the influence of strong emotion her thoughts lost their customary discipline in attempting to fathom father benwell she was conscious of having undertaken a task which required more pliable moral qualities than she possessed to her own unutterable annoyance she was at a loss what to say next  at that critical moment her mother appearedeager for news of the conquest of romayne  my dear child how pale you look said mrs eyrecourt come with me directlyyou must have a glass of wine  this dexterous device for entrapping stella into a private conversation failed not now mamma thank you she said  father benwell on the point of discreetly withdrawing stopped and looked at mrs eyrecourt with an appearance of respectful interest as things were it might not have been worth his while to take the trouble of discovering her but when she actually placed herself in his way the chance of turning mrs eyrecourt to useful account was not a chance to be neglected your mother he said to stella i should feel honored if you will introduce me  having not very willingly performed the ceremony of presentation stella drew back a little she had no desire to take any part in the conversation that might followbut she had her own reasons for waiting near enough to hear it  in the meanwhile mrs eyrecourt turned on her inexhaustible flow of smalltalk with her customary facility no distinction of persons troubled her no convictions of any sort stood in her way she was equally ready provided she met him in good society to make herself agreeable to a puritan or a papist  delighted to make your acquaintance father benwell surely i met you at that delightful evening at the dukes i mean when we welcomed the cardinal back from rome dear old manif one may speak so familiarly of a prince of the church how charmingly he bears his new honors such patriarchal simplicity as every one remarked have you seen him lately  the idea of the order to which he belonged feeling any special interest in a cardinal except when they made him of some use to them privately amused father benwell how wise the church was he thought in inventing a spiritual aristocracy even this fool of a woman is impressed by it his spoken reply was true to his assumed character as one of the inferior clergy poor priests like me madam see but little of princes of the church in the houses of dukes saying this with the most becoming humility he turned the talk in a more productive direction before mrs eyrecourt could proceed with her recollections of the evening at the dukes  your charming daughter and i have been talking about clovelly he continued i have just been spending a little holiday in that delightful place it was a surprise to me mrs eyrecourt to see so many really beautiful country seats in the neighborhood i was particularly struckyou know it of courseby beaupark house  mrs eyrecourts little twinging eyes suddenly became still and steady it was only for a moment but that trifling change boded ill for the purpose which the priest had in view even the wits of a fool can be quickened by contact with the world for many years mrs eyrecourt had held her place in society acting under an intensely selfish sense of her own interests fortified by those cunning instincts which grow best in a barren intellect perfectly unworthy of being trusted with secrets which only concerned other people this frivolous creature could be the unassailable guardian of secrets which concerned herself the instant the priest referred indirectly to winterfield by speaking of beaupark house her instincts warned her as if in wordsbe careful for stellas sake  oh yes said mrs eyrecourt i know beaupark house butmay i make a confession she added with her sweetest smile  father benwell caught her tone with his customary tact a confession at a ball is a novelty even in my experience he answered with his sweetest smile  how good of you to encourage me proceeded mrs eyrecourt no thank you i dont want to sit down my confession wont take longand i really must give that poor pale daughter of mine a glass of wine a student of human nature like youthey say all priests are students of human nature accustomed of course to be consulted in difficulties and to hear real confessionsmust know that we poor women are sadly subject to whims and caprices we cant resist them as men do and the dear good men generally make allowances for us well do you know that place of mr winterfields is one of my caprices oh dear i speak carelessly i ought to have said the place represents one of my caprices in short father benwell beaupark house is perfectly odious to me and i think clovelly the most overrated place in the world i havent the least reason to give but so it is excessively foolish of me its like hysterics i cant help it im sure you will forgive me there isnt a place on the habitable globe that i am not ready to feel interested in except detestable devonshire i am so sorry you went there the next time you have a holiday take my advice try the continent  i should like it of all things said father benwell only i dont speak french allow me to get miss eyrecourt a glass of wine  he spoke with the most perfect temper and tranquillity having paid his little attention to stella and having relieved her of the empty glass he took his leave with a parting request thoroughly characteristic of the man  are you staying in town mrs eyrecourt he asked  oh of course at the height of the season  may i have the honor of calling on youand talking a little more about the continent  if he had said it in so many words he could hardly have informed mrs eyrecourt more plainly that he thoroughly understood her and that he meant to try again strong in the worldly training of half a lifetime she at once informed him of her address with the complimentary phrases proper to the occasion five oclock tea on wednesdays father benwell dont forget  the moment he was gone she drew her daughter into a quiet corner dont be frightened stella that sly old person has some interest in trying to find out about winterfield do you know why  indeed i dont mamma i hate him  oh hush hush hate him as much as you like but always be civil to him tell mehave you been in the conservatory with romayne  yes  all going on well  yes  my sweet child dear dear me the wine has done you no good youre as pale as ever is it that priest oh pooh pooh leave father benwell to me    chapter iv  in the small hours  when stella left the conservatory the attraction of the ball for romayne was at an end he went back to his rooms at the hotel  penrose was waiting to speak to him romayne noticed signs of suppressed agitation in his secretarys face has anything happened he inquired  nothing of any importance penrose answered in sad subdued tones i only wanted to ask you for leave of absence  certainly is it for a long time  penrose hesitated you have a new life opening before you he said if your experience of that life isas i hope and pray it may bea happy one you will need me no longer we may not meet again his voice began to tremble he could say no more  not meet again romayne repeated my dear penrose if you forget how many happy days i owe to your companionship my memory is to be trusted do you really know what my new life is to be shall i tell you what i have said to stella tonight  penrose lifted his hand with a gesture of entreaty  not a word he said eagerly do me one more kindnessleave me to be prepared as i am prepared for the change that is to come without any confidence on your part to enlighten me further dont think me ungrateful i have reasons for saying what i have just saidi cannot mention what they arei can only tell you they are serious reasons you have spoken of my devotion to you if you wish to reward me a hundredfold more than i deserve bear in mind our conversations on religion and keep the books i asked you to read as gifts from a friend who loves you with his whole heart no new duties that you can undertake are incompatible with the higher interests of your soul think of me sometimes when i leave you i go back to a lonely life my poor heart is full of your brotherly kindness at this last moment when i may be saying goodby forever and what is my one consolation what helps me to bear my hard lot the faith that i hold remember that romayne if there comes a time of sorrow in the future remember that  romayne was more than surprised he was shocked why must you leave me he asked  it is best for you and for her said penrose that i should withdraw myself from your new life  he held out his hand romayne refused to let him go penrose he said i cant match your resignation give me something to look forward to i must and will see you again  penrose smiled sadly you know that my career in life depends wholly on my superiors he answered but if i am still in englandand if you have sorrows in the future that i can share and alleviateonly let me know it there is nothing within the compass of my power which i will not do for your sake god bless and prosper you goodby  in spite of his fortitude the tears rose in his eyes he hurried out of the room  romayne sat down at his writingtable and hid his face in his hands he had entered the room with the bright image of stella in his mind the image had faded from it nowthe grief that was in him not even the beloved woman could share his thoughts were wholly with the brave and patient christian who had left himthe true man whose spotless integrity no evil influence could corrupt by what inscrutable fatality do some men find their way into spheres that are unworthy of them oh penrose if the priests of your order were all like you how easily i should be converted these were romaynes thoughts in the stillness of the first hours of the morning the books of which his lost friend had spoken were close by him on the table he opened one of them and turned to a page marked by pencil lines his sensitive nature was troubled to its inmost depths the confession of that faith which had upheld penrose was before him in words the impulse was strong in him to read those words and think over them again    he trimmed his lamp and bent his mind on his book while he was still reading the ball at lord lorings house came to its end stella and lady loring were alone together talking of him before they retired to their rooms  forgive me for owning it plainly said lady loringi think you and your mother are a little too ready to suspect father benwell without any discoverable cause thousands of people go to clovelly and beaupark house is one of the showplaces in the neighborhood is there a little protestant prejudice in this new idea of yours  stella made no reply she seemed to be lost in her own thoughts  lady loring went on  i am open to conviction my dear if you will only tell me what interest father benwell can have in knowing about you and winterfield  stella suddenly looked up let us speak of another person she said i own i dont like father benwell as you know romayne has concealed nothing from me ought i to have any concealments from him ought i not to tell him about winterfield  lady loring started you astonish me she said what right has romayne to know it  what right have i to keep it a secret from him  my dear stella if you had been in any way to blame in that miserable matter i should be the last person in the world to advise you to keep it a secret but you are innocent of all blame no mannot even the man who is soon to be your husbandhas a right to know what you have so unjustly suffered think of the humiliation of even speaking of it to romayne  i darent think of it cried stella passionately but if it is my duty  it is your duty to consider the consequences lady loring interposed you dont know how such things sometimes rankle in a mans mind he may be perfectly willing to do you justiceand yet there may be moments when he would doubt if you had told him the whole truth i speak with the experience of a married woman dont place yourself in that position toward your husband if you wish for a happy married life  stella was not quite convinced yet suppose romayne finds it out she said  he cant possibly find it out i detest winterfield but let us do him justice he is no fool he has his position in the world to keep upand that is enough of itself to close his lips and as for others there are only three people now in england who could betray you i suppose you can trust your mother and lord loring and me  it was needless to answer such a question as that before stella could speak again lord lorings voice was audible outside the door what talking still he exclaimed not in bed yet  come in cried his wife let us hear what my husband thinks she said to stella  lord loring listened with the closest attention while the subject under discussion was communicated to him when the time came to give his opinion he sided unhesitatingly with his wife  if the fault was yours even in the slightest degree he said to stella romayne would have a right to be taken into your confidence but my dear child we who know the truth know you to be a pure and innocent woman you go to romayne in every way worthy of him and you know that he loves you if you did tell him that miserable story he could only pity you do you want to be pitied  those last unanswerable words brought the debate to an end from that moment the subject was dropped    there was still one other person among the guests at the ball who was waking in the small hours of the morning father benwell wrapped comfortably in his dressing gown was too hard at work on his correspondence to think of his bed with one exception all the letters that he had written thus far were closed directed and stamped for the post the letter that he kept open he was now engaged in reconsidering and correcting it was addressed as usual to the secretary of the order at rome and when it had undergone the final revision it contained these lines  my last letter informed you of romaynes return to london and to miss eyrecourt let me entreat our reverend brethren to preserve perfect tranquillity of mind in spite of this circumstance the owner of vange abbey is not married yet if patience and perseverance on my part win their fair reward miss eyrecourt shall never be his wife  but let me not conceal the truth in the uncertain future that lies before us i have no one to depend on but myself penrose is no longer to be trusted and the exertions of the agent to whom i committed my inquiries are exertions that have failed  i will dispose of the case of penrose first  the zeal with which this young man has undertaken the work of conversion intrusted to him has i regret to say not been fired by devotion to the interests of the church but by a doglike affection for romayne without waiting for my permission penrose has revealed himself in his true character as a priest and more than this he has not only refused to observe the proceedings of romayne and miss eyrecourthe has deliberately closed his ears to the confidence which romayne wished to repose in him on the ground that i might have ordered him to repeat that confidence to me  to what use can we put this poor fellows ungovernable sense of honor and gratitude under present circumstances he is clearly of little use to us i have therefore given him time to think that is to say i have not opposed his leaving london to assist in the spiritual care of a country district it will be a question for the future whether we may not turn his enthusiasm to good account in a foreign mission however as it is always possible that his influence may still be of use to us i venture to suggest keeping him within our reach until romaynes conversion has actually taken place dont suppose that the present separation between them is final i will answer for their meeting again    i may now proceed to the failure of my agent and to the course of action that i have adopted in consequence  the investigations appear to have definitely broken down at the seaside village of clovelly in the neighborhood of mr winterfields country seat knowing that i could depend upon the information which associated this gentleman with miss eyrecourt under compromising circumstances of some sort i decided on seeing mr winterfield and judging for myself  the agents report informed me that the person who had finally baffled his inquiries was an aged catholic priest long resident at clovelly his name is newbliss and he is much respected among the catholic gentry in that part of devonshire after due consideration i obtained a letter of introduction to my reverend colleague and traveled to clovellytelling my friends here that i was taking a little holiday in the interests of my health  i found father newbliss a venerable and reticent son of the churchwith one weak point however to work on which was entirely beyond the reach of the otherwise astute person charged with my inquiries my reverend friend is a scholar and is inordinately proud of his learning i am a scholar too in that capacity i first found my way to his sympathies and then gently encouraged his pride the result will appear in certain discoveries which i number as follows  1 the events which connect mr winterfield with miss eyrecourt happened about two years since and had their beginning at beaupark house  2 at this period miss eyrecourt and her mother were staying at beaupark house the general impression in the neighborhood was that mr winterfield and miss eyrecourt were engaged to be married  3 not long afterward miss eyrecourt and her mother surprised the neighborhood by suddenly leaving beaupark house their destination was supposed to be london  4 mr winterfield himself next left his country seat for the continent his exact destination was not mentioned to any one the steward soon afterward dismissed all the servants and the house was left empty for more than a year  5 at the end of that time mr winterfield returned alone to beaupark house and told nobody how or where he had passed the long interval of his absence  6 mr winterfield remains to the present day an unmarried man  having arrived at these preliminary discoveries it was time to try what i could make of mr winterfield next  among the other good things which this gentleman has inherited is a magnificent library collected by his father that one learned man should take another learned man to see the books was a perfectly natural proceeding my introduction to the master of the house followed my introduction to the library almost as a matter of course  i am about to surprise you as i was myself surprised in all my long experience mr winterfield is i think the most fascinating person i ever met with genial unassuming manners a prepossessing personal appearance a sweet temper a quaint humor delightfully accompanied by natural refinementsuch are the characteristic qualities of the man from whom i myself saw miss eyrecourt accidentally meeting him in public recoil with dismay and disgust it is absolutely impossible to look at him and to believe him to be capable of a cruel or dishonorable action i never was so puzzled in my life  you may be inclined to think that i am misled by a false impression derived from the gratifying welcome that i received as a friend of father newbliss i will not appeal to my knowledge of human naturei will refer to the unanswerable evidence of mr winterfields poorer neighbors wherever i went in the village or out of it if i mentioned his name i produced a universal outburst of admiration and gratitude there never was such a friend to poor people and there never can be such another to the end of the world such was a fishermans description of him and the one cry of all the men and women near us answered thats the truth  and yet there is something wrongfor this plain reason that there is something to be concealed in the past lives of mr winterfield and miss eyrecourt  under these perplexing circumstances what use have i made of my opportunities i am going to surprise you againi have mentioned romaynes name to mr winterfield and i have ascertained that they are so far perfect strangers to one anotherand that is all  the little incident of mentioning romayne arose out of my examination of the library i discovered certain old volumes which may one day be of use to him if he continues his contemplated work on the origin of religions hearing me express myself to this effect mr winterfield replied with the readiest kindness  i cant compare myself to my excellent father he said but i have at least inherited his respect for the writers of books my library is a treasure which i hold in trust for the interests of literature pray say so from me to your friend mr romayne  and what does this amount toyou will ask my reverend friend it offers me an opportunity in the future of bringing romayne and winterfield together do you see the complications which may ensue if i can put no other difficulty in miss eyrecourts way i think there is fruitful promise of a scandal of some kind arising out of the introduction to each other of those two men you will agree with me that a scandal may prove a valuable obstacle in the way of a marriage  mr winterfield has kindly invited me to call on him when he is next in london i may then have opportunities of putting questions which i could not venture to ask on a short acquaintance  in the meantime i have obtained another introduction since my return to town i have been presented to miss eyrecourts mother and i am invited to drink tea with her on wednesday my next letter may tell youwhat penrose ought to have discoveredwhether romayne has been already entrapped into a marriage engagement or not  farewell for the present remind the reverend fathers with my respects that i possess one of the valuable qualities of an englishmani never know when i am beaten     book the third    chapter i  the honeymoon  more than six weeks had passed the wedded lovers were still enjoying their honeymoon at vange abbey  some offense had been given not only to mrs eyrecourt but to friends of her way of thinking by the strictly private manner in which the marriage had been celebrated the event took everybody by surprise when the customary advertisement appeared in the newspapers foreseeing the unfavorable impression that might be produced in some quarters stella had pleaded for a timely retreat to the seclusion of romaynes country house the will of the bride being as usual the bridegrooms law to vange they retired accordingly  on one lovely moonlight night early in july mrs romayne left her husband on the belvidere described in major hynds narrative to give the housekeeper certain instructions relating to the affairs of the household half an hour later as she was about to ascend again to the top of the house one of the servants informed her that the master had just left the belvidere and had gone into his study  crossing the inner hall on her way to the study stella noticed an unopened letter addressed to romayne lying on a table in a corner he had probably laid it aside and forgotten it she entered his room with the letter in her hand  the only light was a reading lamp with the shade so lowered that the corners of the study were left in obscurity in one of these corners romayne was dimly visible sitting with his head sunk on his breast he never moved when stella opened the door at first she thought he might be asleep  do i disturb you lewis she asked softly  no my dear  there was a change in the tone of his voice which his wifes quick ear detected i am afraid you are not well she said anxiously  i am a little tired after our long ride today do you want to go back to the belvidere  not without you shall i leave you to rest here  he seemed not to hear the question there he sat with his head hanging down the shadowy counterfeit of an old man in her anxiety stella approached him and put her hand caressingly on his head it was burning hot o she cried you are ill and you are trying to hide it from me  he put his arm round her waist and made her sit on his knee nothing is the matter with me he said with an uneasy laugh what have you got in your hand a letter  yes addressed to you and not opened yet he took it out of her hand and threw it carelessly on a sofa near him never mind that now let us talk he paused and kissed her before he went on my darling i think you must be getting tired of vange  oh no i can be happy anywhere with youand especially at vange you dont how this noble old house interests me and how i admire the glorious country all round it  he was not convinced vange is very dull he said obstinately and your friends will be wanting to see you have you heard from your mother lately  no i am surprised she has not written  she has not forgiven us for getting married so quietly he went on we had better go back to london and make our peace with her dont you want to see the house my aunt left me at highgate  stella sighed the society of the man she loved was society enough for her was he getting tired of his wife already i will go with you wherever you like she said those words in tones of sad submission and gently got up from his knee  he rose also and took from the sofa the letter which he had thrown on it let us see what our friends say he resumed the address is in lorings handwriting  as he approached the table on which the lamp was burning she noticed that he moved with a languor that was new in her experience of him he sat down and opened the letter she watched him with an anxiety which had now become intensified to suspicion the shade of the lamp still prevented her from seeing his face plainly just what i told you he said the lorings want to know when they are to see us in london and your mother says she feels like that character in shakespeare who was cut by his own daughters read it  he handed her the letter in taking it she contrived to touch the lamp shade as if by accident and tilted it so that the full flow of the light fell on him he started backbut not before she had seen the ghastly pallor on his face she had not only heard it from lady loring she knew from his own unreserved confession to her what that startling change really meant in an instant she was on her knees at his feet oh my darling she cried it was cruel to keep that secret from your wife you have heard it again  she was too irresistibly beautiful at that moment to be reproved he gently raised her from the floorand owned the truth  yes he said i heard it after you left me on the belviderejust as i heard it on another moonlight night when major hynd was here with me our return to this house is perhaps the cause i dont complain i have had a long release  she threw her arms round his neck we will leave vange tomorrow she said  it was firmly spoken but her heart sank as the words passed her lips vange abbey had been the scene of the most unalloyed happiness in her life what destiny was waiting for her when she returned to london    chapter ii  events at ten acres  there was no obstacle to the speedy departure of romayne and his wife from vange abbey the villa at highgatecalled ten acres lodge in allusion to the measurement of the grounds surrounding the househad been kept in perfect order by the servants of the late lady berrick now in the employment of her nephew  on the morning after their arrival at the villa stella sent a note to her mother the same afternoon mrs eyrecourt arrived at ten acreson her way to a gardenparty finding the house to her great relief a modern building supplied with all the newest comforts and luxuries she at once began to plan a grand party in celebration of the return of the bride and bridegroom  i dont wish to praise myself mrs eyrecourt said but if ever there was a forgiving woman i am that person we will say no more stella about your truly contemptible weddingfive people altogether including ourselves and the lorings a grand ball will set you right with society and that is the one thing needful tea and coffee my dear romayne in your study cootes quadrille band the supper from gunters the grounds illuminated with colored lamps tyrolese singers among the trees relieved by military musicand if there are any african or other savages now in london there is room enough in these charming grounds for encampments dances squaws scalps and all the rest of it to end in a blaze of fireworks  a sudden fit of coughing seized her and stopped the further enumeration of attractions at the contemplated ball stella had observed that her mother looked unusually worn and haggard through the disguises of paint and powder this was not an uncommon result of mrs eyrecourts devotion to the demands of society but the cough was something new as a symptom of exhaustion  i am afraid mamma you have been overexerting yourself said stella you go to too many parties  nothing of the sort my dear i am as strong as a horse the other night i was waiting for the carriage in a draught one of the most perfect private concerts of the season ending with a delightfully naughty little french playand i caught a slight cold a glass of water is all i want thank you romayne you are looking shockingly serious and severe our ball will cheer you if you would only make a bonfire of all those horrid books you dont know how it would improve your spirits dearest stella i will come and lunch here tomorrowyou are within such a nice easy drive from townand ill bring my visitingbook and settle about the invitations and the day oh dear me how late it is i have nearly an hours drive before i get to my garden party goodby my turtle doves goodby  she was stopped on the way to her carriage by another fit of coughing but she still persisted in making light of it im as strong as a horse she repeated as soon as she could speakand skipped into the carriage like a young girl  your mother is killing herself said romayne  if i could persuade her to stay with us a little while stella suggested the rest and quiet might do wonders for her would you object to it lewis  my darling i object to nothingexcept giving a ball and burning my books if your mother will yield on these two points my house is entirely at her disposal  he spoke playfullyhe looked his best since he had separated himself from the painful associations that were now connected with vange abbey had the torment of the voice been left far away in yorkshire stella shrank from approaching the subject in her husbands presence knowing that it must remind him of the fatal duel to her surprise romayne himself referred to the generals family  i have written to hynd he began do you mind his dining with us today  of course not  i want to hear if he has anything to tell meabout those french ladies he undertook to see them in your absence and to ascertain he was unable to overcome his reluctance to pronounce the next words stella was quick to understand what he meant she finished the sentence for him  yes he said i wanted to hear how the boy is getting on and if there is any hope of curing him is it he trembled as he put the questionis it hereditary madness  feeling the serious importance of concealing the truth stella only replied that she had hesitated to ask if there was a taint of madness in the family i suppose she added you would not like to see the boy and judge of his chances of recovery for yourself  you suppose he burst out with sudden anger you might be sure the bare idea of seeing him turns me cold oh when shall i forget when shall i forget who spoke of him first he said with renewed irritability after a moment of silence you or i  it was my fault lovehe is so harmless and so gentle and he has such a sweet facei thought it might soothe you to see him forgive me we will never speak of him again have you any notes for me to copy you know lewis i am your secretary now  so she led romayne away to his study and his books when major hynd arrived she contrived to be the first to see him say as little as possible about the generals widow and her son she whispered  the major understood her dont be uneasy mrs romayne he answered i know your husband well enough to know what you mean besides the news i bring is good news  romayne came in before he could speak more particularly when the servants had left the room after dinner the major made his report  i am going to agreeably surprise you he began all responsibility toward the generals family is taken off our hands the ladies are on their way back to france  stella was instantly reminded of one of the melancholy incidents associated with her visit to camps hill madame marillac spoke of a brother of hers who disapproved of the marriage she said has he forgiven her  that is exactly what he has done mrs romayne naturally enough he felt the disgrace of his sisters marriage to such a man as the general only the other day he heard for the first time that she was a widowand he at once traveled to england i bade them goodby yesterdaymost happily reunitedon their journey home again ah i thought you would be glad mrs romayne to hear that the poor widows troubles are over her brother is rich enough to place them all in easy circumstanceshe is as good a fellow as ever lived  have you seen him stella asked eagerly  i have been with him to the asylum  does the boy go back to france  no we took the place by surprise and saw for ourselves how well conducted it was the boy has taken a strong liking to the proprietora bright cheerful old man who is teaching him some of our english games and has given him a pony to ride on he burst out crying poor creature at the idea of going awayand his mother burst out crying at the idea of leaving him it was a melancholy scene you know what a good mother isno sacrifice is too great for her the boy stays at the asylum on the chance that his healthier and happier life there may help to cure him bytheway romayne his uncle desires me to thank you  hynd you didnt tell the uncle my name  dont alarm yourself he is a gentleman and when i told him i was pledged to secrecy he made but one inquiryhe asked if you were a rich man i told him you had eighteen thousand a year  well  well he set that matter right between us with perfect taste he said i cannot presume to offer repayment to a person so wealthy we gratefully accept our obligation to our kind unknown friend for the future however my nephews expenses must be paid from my purse of course i could only agree to that from time to time the mother is to hear and i am to hear how the boy goes on or if you like romaynenow that the generals family has left englandi dont see why the proprietor might not make his report directly to yourself  no romayne rejoined positively let things remain as they are  very well i can send you any letters that i may receive from the asylum will you give us some music mrs romayne not tonight then let us go to the billiardroom and as i am the worst of bad players i will ask you to help me to beat your accomplished husband   on the afternoon of the next day mrs eyrecourts maid arrived at ten acres with a note from her mistress  dearest stellamatilda must bring you my excuses for today i dont in the least understand it but i seem to have turned lazy it is most ridiculousi really cannot get out of bed perhaps i did do just a little too much yesterday the opera after the garden party and a ball after the opera and this tiresome cough all night after the ball quite a series isnt it make my apologies to our dear dismal romayneand if you drive out this afternoon come and have a chat with me your affectionate mother emily eyrecourt p syou know what a fidget matilda is if she talks about me dont believe a word she says to you  stella turned to the maid with a sinking heart  is my mother very ill she asked  so ill maam that i begged and prayed her to let me send for a doctor you know what my mistress is if you would please to use your influence  i will order the carriage instantly and take you back with me  before she dressed to go out stella showed the letter to her husband he spoke with perfect kindness and sympathy but he did not conceal that he shared his wifes apprehensions go at once were his last words to her and if i can be of any use send for me  it was late in the evening before stella returned she brought sad news  the physician consulted told her plainly that the neglected cough and the constant fatigue had together made the case a serious one he declined to say that there was any absolute danger as yet or any necessity for her remaining with her mother at night the experience of the next twentyfour hours at most would enable him to speak positively in the meantime the patient insisted that stella should return to her husband even under the influence of opiates mrs eyrecourt was still drowsily equal to herself you are a fidget my dear and matilda is a fidgeti cant have two of you at my bedside goodnight stella stooped over her and kissed her she whispered three weeks notice remember for the party  by the next evening the malady had assumed so formidable an aspect that the doctor had his doubts of the patients chance of recovery with her husbands full approval stella remained night and day at her mothers bedside  thus in a little more than a month from the day of his marriage romayne was for the time a lonely man again  the illness of mrs eyrecourt was unexpectedly prolonged there were intervals during which her vigorous constitution rallied and resisted the progress of the disease on these occasions stella was able to return to her husband for a few hourssubject always to a message which recalled her to her mother when the chances of life or death appeared to be equally balanced romaynes one resource was in his books and his pen for the first time since his union with stella he opened the portfolios in which penrose had collected the first introductory chapters of his historical work almost at every page the familiar handwriting of his secretary and friend met his view it was a new trial to his resolution to be working alone never had he felt the absence of penrose as he felt it now he missed the familiar face the quiet pleasant voice and more than both the everwelcome sympathy with his work stella had done all that a wife could do to fill the vacant place and her husbands fondness had accepted the effort as adding another charm to the lovely creature who had opened a new life to him but where is the woman who can intimately associate herself with the hard brainwork of a man devoted to an absorbing intellectual pursuit she can love him admire him serve him believe in him beyond all other menbut in spite of exceptions which only prove the rule she is out of her place when she enters the study while the pen is in his hand more than once when he was at work romayne closed the page bitterly the sad thought came to him oh if i only had penrose here even other friends were not available as a resource in the solitary evening hours lord loring was absorbed in social and political engagements and major hyndtrue to the principle of getting away as often as possible from his disagreeable wife and his ugly childrenhad once more left london  one day while mrs eyrecourt still lay between life and death romayne found his historical labors suspended by the want of a certain volume which it was absolutely necessary to consult he had mislaid the references written for him by penrose and he was at a loss to remember whether the book was in the british museum in the bodleian library or in the bibliotheque at paris in this emergency a letter to his former secretary would furnish him with the information that he required but he was ignorant of penroses present address the lorings might possibly know itso to the lorings he resolved to apply    chapter iii  father benwell and the book  romaynes first errand in london was to see his wife and to make inquiries at mrs eyrecourts house the report was more favorable than usual stella whispered as she kissed him i shall soon come back to you i hope  leaving the horses to rest for a while he proceeded to lord lorings residence on foot as he crossed a street in the neighborhood he was nearly run over by a cab carrying a gentleman and his luggage the gentleman was mr winterfield on his way to derwents hotel  lady loring very kindly searched her cardbasket as the readiest means of assisting romayne penrose had left his card on his departure from london but no address was written on it lord loring unable himself to give the required information suggested the right person to consult  father benwell will be here later in the day he said if you will write to penrose at once he will add the address are you sure before the letter goes that the book you want is not in my library  i think not romayne answered but i will write down the title and leave it here with my letter  the same evening he received a polite note from father benwell informing him that the letter was forwarded and that the book he wanted was not in lord lorings library if there should be any delay or difficulty in obtaining this rare volume the priest added i only wait the expression of your wishes to borrow it from the library of a friend of mine residing in the country  by return of post the answer affectionately and gratefully written arrived from penrose he regretted that he was not able to assist romayne personally but it was out of his power in plain words he had been expressly forbidden by father benwell to leave the service on which he was then engaged in reference to the book that was wanted it was quite likely that a search in the catalogues of the british museum might discover it he had only met with it himself in the national library at paris  this information led romayne to london again immediately for the first time he called at father benwells lodgings the priest was at home expecting the visit his welcome was the perfection of unassuming politeness he asked for the last news of poor mrs eyrecourts health with the sympathy of a true friend  i had the honor of drinking tea with mrs eyrecourt some little time since he said her flow of conversation was never more delightfulit seemed impossible to associate the idea of illness with so bright a creature and how well she kept the secret of your contemplated marriage may i offer my humble congratulations and good wishes  romayne thought it needless to say that mrs eyrecourt had not been trusted with the secret until the wedding day was close at hand my wife and i agreed in wishing to be married as quietly as possible he answered after making the customary acknowledgments  and mrs romayne pursued father benwell this is a sad trial for her she is in attendance on her mother i suppose  in constant attendance i am quite alone now to change the subject may i ask you to look at the reply which i have received from penrose it is my excuse for troubling you with this visit  father benwell read the letter with the closest attention in spite of his habitual selfcontrol his vigilant eyes brightened as he handed it back  thus far the priests wellplanned scheme like mr bitrakes clever inquiries had failed he had not even entrapped mrs eyrecourt into revealing the marriage engagement her unconquerable smalltalk had foiled him at every point even when he had deliberately kept his seat after the other guests at the teatable had taken their departure she rose with the most imperturbable coolness and left him i have a dinner and two parties tonight and this is just the time when i take my little restorative nap forgive meand do come again when he sent the fatal announcement of the marriage to rome he had been obliged to confess that he was indebted for the discovery to the newspaper he had accepted the humiliation he had accepted the defeatbut he was not beaten yet i counted on romaynes weakness and miss eyrecourt counted on romaynes weakness and miss eyrecourt has won so let it be my turn will come in that manner he had reconciled himself to his position and nowhe knew it when he handed back the letter to romaynehis turn had come  you can hardly go to paris to consult the book he said in the present state of mrs eyrecourts health  certainly not  perhaps you will send somebody to search the catalogue at the british museum  i should have done that already father benwell but for the very kind allusion in your note to your friend in the country even if the book is in the museum library i shall be obliged to go to the reading room to get my information it would be far more convenient to me to have the volume at home to consult if you think your friend will trust me with it  i am certain he will trust you with it my friend is mr winterfield of beaupark house north devon perhaps you may have heard of him  no the name is quite new to me  then come and see the man himself he is now in londonand i am entirely at your service  in half an hour more romayne was presented to a wellbred amiable gentleman in the prime of life smoking and reading the newspaper the bowl of his long pipe rested on the floor on one side of him and a handsome red and white spaniel reposed on the other before his visitors had been two minutes in the room he understood the motive which had brought them to consult him and sent for a telegraphic form  my steward will find the book and forward it to your address by passenger train this afternoon he said i will tell him to put my printed catalogue of the library into the parcel in case i have any other books which may be of use to you  with those words he dispatched the telegram to the office romayne attempted to make his acknowledgments mr winterfield would hear no acknowledgments  my dear sir he said with a smile that brightened his whole face you are engaged in writing a great historical work and i am an obscure country gentleman who is lucky enough to associate himself with the production of a new book how do you know that i am not looking forward to a complimentary line in the preface i am the obliged person not you pray consider me as a handy little boy who runs on errands for the muse of history do you smoke  not even tobacco would soothe romaynes wasted and irritable nerves father benwellall things to all mencheerfully accepted a cigar from the box on the table  father benwell possesses all the social virtues mr winterfield ran on he shall have his coffee and the largest sugarbasin that the hotel can produce i can quite understand that your literary labors have tried your nerves he said to romayne when he had ordered the coffee the mere title of your work overwhelms an idle man like me the origin of religionswhat an immense subject how far must we look back to find out the first worshipers of the human familywhere are the hieroglyphics mr romayne that will give you the earliest information in the unknown center of africa or among the ruined cities of yucatan my own idea as an ignorant man is that the first of all forms of worship must have been the worship of the sun dont be shocked father benwelli confess i have a certain sympathy with sunworship in the east especially the rising of the sun is surely the grandest of all objectsthe visible symbol of a beneficent deity who gives life warmth and light to the world of his creation  very grand no doubt remarked father benwell sweetening his coffee but not to be compared with the noble sight at rome when the pope blesses the christian world from the balcony of st peters  so much for professional feeling said mr winterfield but surely something depends on what sort of man the pope is if we had lived in the time of alexander the sixth would you have called him a part of that noble sight  certainlyat a proper distance father benwell briskly replied ah you heretics only know the worst side of that most unhappy pontiff mr winterfield we have every reason to believe that he felt privately the truest remorse  i should require very good evidence to persuade me of it  this touched romayne on a sad side of his own personal experience perhaps he said you dont believe in remorse  pardon me mr winterfield rejoined i only distinguish between false remorse and true remorse we will say no more of alexander the sixth father benwell if we want an illustration i will supply it and give no offense true remorse depends to my mind on a mans accurate knowledge of his own motivesfar from a common knowledge in my experience say for instance that i have committed some serious offense  romayne could not resist interrupting him say you have killed one of your fellowcreatures he suggested  very well if i know that i really meant to kill him for some vile purpose of my own and if which by no means always follows i am really capable of feeling the enormity of my own crimethat is as i think true remorse murderer as i am i have in that case some moral worth still left in me but if i did not mean to kill the manif his death was my misfortune as well as hisand if as frequently happens i am nevertheless troubled by remorse the true cause lies in my own inability fairly to realize my own motivesbefore i look to results i am the ignorant victim of false remorse and if i will only ask myself boldly what has blinded me to the true state of the case i shall find the mischief due to that misdirected appreciation of my own importance which is nothing but egotism in disguise  i entirely agree with you said father benwell i have had occasion to say the same thing in the confessional  mr winterfield looked at his dog and changed the subject do you like dogs mr romayne he asked i see my spaniels eyes saying that he likes you and his tail begging you to take some notice of him  romayne caressed the dog rather absently  his new friend had unconsciously presented to him a new view of the darker aspect of his own life winterfields refined pleasant manners his generous readiness in placing the treasures of his library at a strangers disposal had already appealed irresistibly to romaynes sensitive nature the favorable impression was now greatly strengthened by the briefly bold treatment which he had just heard of a subject in which he was seriously interested i must see more of this man was his thought as he patted the companionable spaniel  father benwells trained observation followed the vivid changes of expression on romaynes face and marked the eager look in his eyes as he lifted his head from the dog to the dogs master the priest saw his opportunity and took it  do you remain long at ten acres lodge he said to romayne  i hardly know as yet we have no other plans at present  you inherit the place i think from your late aunt lady berrick  yes  the tone of the reply was not encouraging romayne felt no interest in talking of ten acres lodge father benwell persisted  i was told by mrs eyrecourt he went on that lady berrick had some fine pictures are they still at the lodge  certainly i couldnt live in a house without pictures  father benwell looked at winterfield another taste in common between you and mr romayne he said besides your liking for dogs  this at once produced the desired result romayne eagerly invited winterfield to see his pictures there are not many of them he said but they are really worth looking at when will you come  the sooner the better winterfield answered cordially will tomorrow doby the noonday light  whenever you please your time is mine  among his other accomplishments father benwell was a chessplayer if his thoughts at that moment had been expressed in language they would have said check to the queen    chapter iv  the end of the honeymoon  on the next morning winterfield arrived alone at romaynes house  having been included as a matter of course in the invitation to see the pictures father benwell had made an excuse and had asked leave to defer the proposed visit from his point of view he had nothing further to gain by being present at a second meeting between the two menin the absence of stella he had it on romaynes own authority that she was in constant attendance on her mother and that her husband was alone either mrs eyrecourt will get better or she will die father benwell reasoned i shall make constant inquiries after her health and in either case i shall know when mrs romayne returns to ten acres lodge after that domestic event the next time mr winterfield visits mr romayne i shall go and see the pictures  it is one of the defects of a supersubtle intellect to trust too implicitly to calculation and to leave nothing to chance once or twice already father benwell had been in the popular phrase a little too cleverand chance had thrown him out as events happened chance was destined to throw him out once more  of the most modest pretensions in regard to numbers and size the pictures collected by the late lady berrick were masterly works of modern art with few exceptions they had been produced by the matchless english landscape painters of half a century since there was no formal gallery here the pictures were so few that they could be hung in excellent lights in the different livingrooms of the villa turner constable collins danby callcott linnellthe master of beaupark house passed from one to the other with the enjoyment of a man who thoroughly appreciated the truest and finest landscape art that the world has yet seen  you had better not have asked me here he said to romayne in his quaintly goodhumored way i cant part with those pictures when i say goodby today you will find me calling here again and again till you are perfectly sick of me look at this sea piece who thinks of the brushes and palette of that painter there truth to nature and poetical feeling go hand in hand together it is absolutely lovelyi could kiss that picture  they were in romaynes study when this odd outburst of enthusiasm escaped winterfield he happened to look toward the writingtable next some pages of manuscript blotted and interlined with corrections at once attracted his attention  is that the forthcoming history he asked you are not one of the authors who perform the process of correction mentallyyou revise and improve with the pen in your hand  romayne looked at him in surprise i suspect mr winterfield you have used your pen for other purposes than writing letters  no indeed you pay me an undeserved compliment when you come to see me in devonshire i can show you some manuscripts and corrected proofs left by our great writers collected by my father my knowledge of the secrets of the craft has been gained by examining those literary treasures if the public only knew that every writer worthy of the name is the severest critic of his own book before it ever gets into the hands of the reviewers how surprised they would be the man who has worked in the full fervor of composition yesterday is the same man who sits in severe and merciless judgment today on what he has himself produced what a fascination there must be in the art which exacts and receives such double labor as this  romayne thoughtnot unkindlyof his wife stella had once asked him how long a time he was usually occupied in writing one page the reply had filled her with pity and wonder why do you take all that trouble she had gently remonstrated it would be just the same to the people darling if you did it in half the time  by way of changing the topic romayne led his visitor into another room i have a picture here he said which belongs to a newer school of painting you have been talking of hard work in one art there it is in another  yes said winterfield there it isthe misdirected hard work which has been guided by no critical faculty and which doesnt know where to stop i try to admire it and i end in pitying the poor artist look at that leafless felled tree in the middle distance every little twig on the smallest branch is conscientiously paintedand the result is like a colored photograph you dont look at a landscape as a series of separate parts you dont discover every twig on a tree you see the whole in nature and you want to see the whole in a picture that canvas presents a triumph of patience and pains produced exactly as a piece of embroidery is produced all in little separate bits worked with the same mechanically complete care i turn away from it to your shrubbery there with an ungrateful sense of relief  he walked to the window as he spoke it looked out on the grounds in front of the house at the same moment the noise of rolling wheels became audible on the drive an open carriage appeared at the turn in the road winterfield called romayne to the window a visitor he beganand suddenly drew back without saying a word more  romayne looked out and recognized his wife  excuse me for one moment he said it is mrs romayne  on that morning an improvement in the fluctuating state of mrs eyrecourts health had given stella another of those opportunities of passing an hour or two with her husband which she so highly prized romayne withdrew to meet her at the doortoo hurriedly to notice winterfield standing in the corner to which he had retreated like a man petrified  stella had got out of the carriage when her husband reached the porch she ascended the few steps that led to the hall as slowly and painfully as if she had been an infirm old woman the delicately tinted color in her face had faded to an ashy white she had seen winterfield at the window  for the moment romayne looked at her in speechless consternation he led her into the nearest room that opened out of the hall and took her in his arms my love this nursing of your mother has completely broken you down he said with the tenderest pity for her if you wont think of yourself you must think of me for my sake remain here and take the rest that you need i will be a tyrant stella for the first time i wont let you go back  she roused herself and tried to smileand hid the sad result from him in a kiss i do feel the anxiety and fatigue she said but my mother is really improving and if it only continues the blessed sense of relief will make me strong again she paused and roused all her courage in anticipation of the next wordsso trivial and so terriblethat must sooner or later be pronounced you have a visitor she said  did you see him at the window a really delightful mani know you will like him under any other circumstances i should have introduced him you are not well enough to see strangers today  she was too determined to prevent winterfield from ever entering the house again to shrink from the meeting i am not so ill as you think lewis she said bravely when you go to your new friend i will go with you i am a little tiredthats all  romayne looked at her anxiously let me get you a glass of wine he said  she consentedshe really felt the need of it as he turned away to ring the bell she put the question which had been in her mind from the moment when she had seen winterfield  how did you become acquainted with this gentleman  through father benwell  she was not surprised by the answerher suspicion of the priest had remained in her mind from the night of lady lorings ball the future of her married life depended on her capacity to check the growing intimacy between the two men in that conviction she found the courage to face winterfield  how should she meet him the impulse of the moment pointed to the shortest way out of the dreadful position in which she was placedit was to treat him like a stranger she drank her glass of wine and took romaynes arm we mustnt keep your friend waiting any longer she resumed come  as they crossed the hall she looked suspiciously toward the house door had he taken the opportunity of leaving the villa at any other time she would have remembered that the plainest laws of good breeding compelled him to wait for romaynes return his own knowledge of the world would tell him that an act of gross rudeness committed by a wellbred man would inevitably excite suspicion of some unworthy motiveand might perhaps connect that motive with her unexpected appearance at the house romayne opened the door and they entered the room together  mr winterfield let me introduce you to mrs romayne they bowed to each other they spoke the conventional words proper to the occasionbut the effort that it cost them showed itself romayne perceived an unusual formality in his wifes manner and a strange disappearance of winterfields easy grace of address was he one of the few men in these days who are shy in the presence of women and was the change in stella attributable perhaps to the state of her health the explanation might in either case be the right one he tried to set them at their ease  mr winterfield is so pleased with the pictures that he means to come and see them again he said to his wife and one of his favorites happens to be your favorite too  she tried to look at winterfield but her eyes sank she could turn toward him and that was all is it the seapiece in the study she said to him faintly  yes he answered with formal politeness it seems to me to be one of the painters finest works  romayne looked at him in unconcealed wonder to what flat commonplace winterfields lively enthusiasm had sunk in stellas presence she perceived that some unfavorable impression had been produced on her husband and interposed with a timely suggestion her motive was not only to divert romaynes attention from winterfield but to give him a reason for leaving the room  the little watercolor drawing in my bedroom is by the same artist she said mr winterfield might like to see it if you will ring the bell lewis i will send my maid for it  romayne had never allowed the servants to touch his works of art since the day when a zealous housemaid had tried to wash one of his plaster casts he made the reply which his wife had anticipated  no no he said i will fetch the drawing myself he turned gayly to winterfield prepare yourself for another work that you would like to kiss he smiled and left the room  the instant the door was closed stella approached winterfield her beautiful face became distorted by a mingled expression of rage and contempt she spoke to him in a fierce peremptory whisper  have you any consideration for me left his look at her as she put that question revealed the most complete contrast between his face and hers compassionate sorrow was in his eyes tender forbearance and respect spoke in his tones as he answered her  i have more than consideration for you stella  she angrily interrupted him how dare you call me by my christian name  he remonstrated with a gentleness that might have touched the heart of any woman do you still refuse to believe that i never deceived you has time not softened your heart to me yet  she was more contemptuous toward him than ever spare me your protestations she said i heard enough of them two years since will you do what i ask of you  you know that i will  put an end to your acquaintance with my husband put an end to it she repeated vehemently from this day at once and forever can i trust you to do it  do you think i would have entered this house if i had known he was your husband he made that reply with a sudden change in himwith a rising color and in firm tones of indignation in a moment more his voice softened again and his kind blue eyes rested on her sadly and devotedly you may trust me to do more than you ask he resumed you have made a mistake  what mistake  when mr romayne introduced us you met me like a strangerand you left me no choice but to do as you did  i wish you to be a stranger  her sharpest replies made no change in his manner he spoke as kindly and as patiently as ever  you forget that you and your mother were my guests at beaupark two years ago  stella understood what he meantand more in an instant she remembered that father benwell had been at beaupark house had he heard of the visit she clasped her hands in speechless terror  winterfield gently reassured her you must not be frightened he said it is in the last degree unlikely that mr romayne will ever find out that you were at my house if he doesand if you deny iti will do for you what i would do for no other human creature i will deny it too you are safe from discovery be happyand forget me  for the first time she showed signs of relentingshe turned her head away and sighed although her mind was full of the serious necessity of warning him against father benwell she had not even command enough over her own voice to ask how he had become acquainted with the priest his manly devotion the perfect and pathetic sincerity of his respect pleaded with her in spite of herself for a moment she paused to recover her composure in that moment romayne returned to them with the drawing in his hand  there he said its nothing this time but some children gathering flowers on the outskirts of a wood what do you think of it  what i thought of the larger work winterfield answered i could look at it by the hour together he consulted his watch but time is a hard master and tells me that my visit must come to an end thank you most sincerely  he bowed to stella romayne thought his guest might have taken the english freedom of shaking hands when will you come and look at the pictures again he asked will you dine with us and see how they bear the lamplight  i am sorry to say i must beg you to excuse me my plans are altered since we met yesterday i am obliged to leave london  romayne was unwilling to part with him on these terms you will let me know when you are next in town he said  certainly  with that short answer he hurried away  romayne waited a little in the hall before he went back to his wife stellas reception of winterfield though not positively ungracious was nevertheless the reverse of encouraging what extraordinary caprice had made her insensible to the social attractions of a man so unaffectedly agreeable it was not wonderful that winterfields cordiality should have been chilled by the cold welcome that he had received from the mistress of the house at the same time some allowance was to be made for the influence of stellas domestic anxieties and some sympathy was claimed by the state of her health although her husband shrank from distressing her by any immediate reference to her reception of his friend he could not disguise from himself that she had disappointed him when he went back to the room stella was lying on the sofa with her face turned toward the wall she was in tears and she was afraid to let him see it i wont disturb you he said and withdrew to his study the precious volume which winterfield had so kindly placed at his disposal was on the table waiting for him  father benwell had lost little by not being present at the introduction of winterfield to stella he had witnessed a plainer betrayal of emotion when they met unexpectedly in lord lorings picture gallery but if he had seen romayne reading in his study and stella crying secretly on the sofa he might have written to rome by that days post and might have announced that he had sown the first seeds of disunion between husband and wife    chapter v  father benwells correspondence  to the secretary s j rome  in my last few hasty lines i was only able to inform you of the unexpected arrival of mrs romayne while winterfield was visiting her husband if you remember i warned you not to attach any undue importance to my absence on that occasion my present report will satisfy my reverend brethren that the interests committed to me are as safe as ever in my hands  i have paid three visits at certain intervals the first to winterfield briefly mentioned in my last letter the second to romayne the third to the invalid lady mrs eyrecourt in every case i have been rewarded by important results  we will revert to winterfield first i found him at his hotel enveloped in clouds of tobacco smoke having led him with some difficulty into talking of his visit to ten acres lodge i asked how he liked romaynes pictures  i envy him his pictures that was the only answer  and how do you like mrs romayne i inquired next  he laid down his pipe and looked at me attentively my face i flatter myself defied discovery he inhaled another mouthful of tobacco and began to play with his dog if i must answer your question he burst out suddenly i didnt get a very gracious reception from mrs romayne there he abruptly stopped he is a thoroughly transparent man you see straight into his mind through his eyes i perceived that he was only telling me a part perhaps a very small part of the truth  can you account for such a reception as you describe i asked he answered shortly no  perhaps i can account for it i went on did mr romayne tell his wife that i was the means of introducing you to him  he fixed another searching look on me mr romayne might have said so when he left me to receive his wife at the door  in that case mr winterfield the explanation is as plain as the sun at noonday mrs romayne is a strong protestant and i am a catholic priest  he accepted this method of accounting for his reception with an alacrity that would not have imposed on a child you see i had relieved him from all further necessity of accounting for the conduct of mrs romayne  a ladys religious prejudices i proceeded in the friendliest way are never taken seriously by a sensible man you have placed mr romayne under obligations to your kindnesshe is eager to improve his acquaintance with you you will go again to ten acres lodge  he gave me another short answer i think not  i said i was sorry to hear it however i added you can always see him here when you are in london he puffed out a big volume of smoke and made no remark i declined to be put down by silence and smoke or perhaps i persisted you will honor me by meeting him at a simple little dinner at my lodgings being a gentleman he was of course obliged to answer this he said you are very kind i would rather not shall we talk of something else father benwell  we talked of something else he was just as amiable as everbut he was not in good spirits i think i shall run over to paris before the end of the month he said to make a long stay i asked oh no call in a week or ten daysand you will find me here again  when i got up to go he returned of his own accord to the forbidden subject he said i must beg you to do me two favors the first is not to let mr romayne know that i am still in london the second is not to ask me for any explanations  the result of our interview may be stated in very few words it has advanced me one step nearer to discovery winterfields voice look and manner satisfied me of thisthe true motive for his sudden change of feeling toward romayne is jealousy of the man who has married miss eyrecourt those compromising circumstances which baffled the inquiries of my agent are associated in plain english with a love affair remember all that i have told you of romaynes peculiar dispositionand imagine if you can what the consequences of such a disclosure will be when we are in a position to enlighten the master of vange abbey  as to the present relations between the husband and wife i have only to tell you next what passed when i visited romayne a day or two later i did well to keep penrose at our disposal we shall want him again    on arriving at ten acres lodge i found romayne in his study his manuscript lay before himbut he was not at work he looked worn and haggard to this day i dont know from what precise nervous malady he suffers i could only guess that it had been troubling him again since he and i last met  my first conventional civilities were dedicated of course to his wife she is still in attendance on her mother mrs eyrecourt is now considered to be out of danger but the good lady who is ready enough to recommend doctors to other people persists in thinking that she is too robust a person to require medical help herself the physician in attendance trusts entirely to her daughter to persuade her to persevere with the necessary course of medicine dont suppose that i trouble you by mentioning these trumpery circumstances without a reason we shall have occasion to return to mrs eyrecourt and her doctor  before i had been five minutes in his company romayne asked me if i had seen winterfield since his visit to ten acres lodge  i said i had seen him and waited anticipating the next question romayne fulfilled my expectations he inquired if winterfield had left london  there are certain cases as i am told by medical authorities in which the dangerous system of bleeding a patient still has its advantages there are other cases in which the dangerous system of telling the truth becomes equally judicious i said to romayne if i answer you honestly will you consider it as strictly confidential mr winterfield i regret to say has no intention of improving his acquaintance with you he asked me to conceal from you that he is still in london  romaynes face plainly betrayed that he was annoyed and irritated nothing that you say to me father benwell shall pass the walls of this room he replied did winterfield give any reason for not continuing his acquaintance with me  i told the truth once more with courteous expressions of regret mr winterfield spoke of an ungracious reception on the part of mrs romayne  he started to his feet and walked irritably up and down the room it is beyond endurance he said to himself  the truth had served its purpose by this time i affected not to have heard him did you speak to me i asked  he used a milder form of expression it is most unfortunate he said i must immediately send back the valuable book which mr winterfield has lent to me and that is not the worst of it there are other volumes in his library which i have the greatest interest in consultingand it is impossible for me to borrow them now at this time too when i have lost penrose i had hoped to find in winterfield another friend who sympathized with my pursuits there is something so cheering and attractive in his mannerand he has just the boldness and novelty of view in his opinions that appeal to a man like me it was a pleasant future to look forward to and it must be sacrificedand to what to a womans caprice  from our point of view this was a frame of mind to be encouraged i tried the experiment of modestly taking the blame on myself i suggested that i might be quite innocently answerable for romaynes disappointment  he looked at me thoroughly puzzled i repeated what i had said to winterfield did you mention to mrs romayne that i was the means of introducing you  he was too impatient to let me finish the sentence i did mention it to mrs romayne he said and what of it  pardon me for reminding you that mrs romayne has protestant prejudices i rejoined mr winterfield would i fear not be very welcome to her as the friend of a catholic priest  he was almost angry with me for suggesting the very explanation which had proved so acceptable to winterfield  nonsense he cried my wife is far too wellbred a woman to let her prejudices express themselves in that way winterfields personal appearance must have inspired her with some unreasonable antipathy or  he stopped and turned away thoughtfully to the window some vague suspicion had probably entered his mind which he had only become aware of at that moment and which he was not quite able to realize as yet i did my best to encourage the new train of thought  what other reason can there be i asked  he turned on me sharply i dont know do you  i ventured on a courteous remonstrance my dear sir if you cant find another reason how can i it must have been a sudden antipathy as you say such things do happen between strangers i suppose i am right in assuming that mrs romayne and mr winterfield are strangers  his eyes flashed with a sudden sinister brightnessthe new idea had caught light in his mind they met as strangers he said  there he stopped again and returned to the window i felt that i might lose the place i had gained in his confidence if i pressed the subject any further besides i had my reasons for saying a word about penrose next as it happened i had received a letter from him relating to his present employment and sending kindest regards to his dear friend and master in the postscript  i gave the message romayne looked round with an instant change in his face the mere sound of penroses name seemed to act as a relief to the gloom and suspicion that had oppressed him the moment before you dont know how i miss the dear gentle little fellow he said sadly  why not write to him i suggested he would be so glad to hear from you again  i dont know where to write  did i not send you his address when i forwarded your letter to him  no  then let me atone for my forgetfulness at once  i wrote down the address and took my leave  as i approached the door i noticed on a side table the catholic volumes which penrose left with romayne one of them was open with a pencil lying beside it i thought that a good signbut i said nothing  romayne pressed my hand at parting you have been very kind and friendly father benwell he said i shall be glad to see you again  dont mention it in quarters where it might do me harm do you know i really pitied him he has sacrificed everything to his marriageand his marriage has disappointed him he was even reduced to be friendly with me  of course when the right time comes i shall give penrose leave of absence do you foresee as i do the speedy return of the dear gentle little fellow to his old employment the resumed work of conversion advancing more rapidly than ever and the jealousy of the protestant wife aggravating the false position in which she is already placed by her equivocal reception of winterfield you may answer this by reminding me of the darker side of the prospect an heir may be born and the heirs mother backed by general opinion may insistif there is any hesitation in the matteron asserting the boys natural right to succeed his father  patience my reverend colleague there is no threatening of any such calamity yet and even if it happens dont forget that romayne has inherited a second fortune the vange estate has an estimated value if the act of restitution represented that value in ready money do you think the church would discourage a good convert by refusing his check you know better than thatand so do i    the next day i called to inquire how mrs eyrecourt was getting on the report was favorable three days later i called again the report was still more encouraging i was also informed that mrs romayne had returned to ten acres lodge  much of my success in life has been achieved by never being in a hurry i was not in a hurry now time sometimes brings opportunitiesand opportunities are worth waiting for  let me make this clear by an example  a man of headlong disposition in my place would have probably spoken of miss eyrecourts marriage to romayne at his first meeting with winterfield and would have excited their distrust and put them respectively on their guard without obtaining any useful result i can at any time make the disclosure to romayne which informs him that his wife had been winterfields guest in devonshire when she affected to meet her former host on the footing of a stranger in the meanwhile i give penrose ample opportunity for innocently widening the breach between husband and wife  you see i hope that if i maintain a passive position it is not from indolence or discouragement now we may get on  after an interval of a few days more i decided on making further inquiries at mrs eyrecourts house this time when i left my card i sent a message asking if the lady could receive me shall i own my weakness she possesses all the information that i want and she has twice baffled my inquiries under these humiliating circumstances it is part of the priestly pugnacity of my disposition to inquire again  i was invited to go upstairs  the front and back drawingrooms of the house were thrown into one mrs eyrecourt was being gently moved backward and forward in a chair on wheels propelled by her maid two gentlemen being present visitors like myself in spite of rouge and loosely folded lace and flowing draperies she presented a deplorable spectacle the bodily part of her looked like a dead woman painted and revivedwhile the moral part in the strongest contrast was just as lively as ever  so glad to see you again father benwell and so much obliged by your kind inquiries i am quite well though the doctor wont admit it isnt it funny to see me being wheeled about like a child in a perambulator returning to first principles i call it you see its a law of my nature that i must go about the doctor wont let me go about outside the house so i go about inside the house matilda is the nurse and i am the baby who will learn to walk some of these days are you tired matilda no then give me another turn theres a good creature movement perpetual movement is a law of nature oh dear no doctor i didnt make that discovery for myself some eminent scientific person mentioned it in a lecture the ugliest man i ever saw now back again matilda let me introduce you to my friends father benwell introducing is out of fashion i know but i am one of the few women who can resist the tyranny of fashion i like introducing people sir john dronefather benwell father benwelldoctor wybrow ah yes you know the doctor by reputation shall i give you his character personally charming professionally detestable pardon my impudence doctor it is one of the consequences of the overflowing state of my health another turn matildaand a little faster this time oh how i wish i was traveling by railway  there her breath failed her she reclined in her chair and fanned herself silentlyfor a while  i was now able to turn my attention to the two visitors sir john drone it was easy to see would be no obstacle to confidential conversation with mrs eyrecourt an excellent country gentleman with the bald head the ruddy complexion and the inexhaustible capacity for silence so familiar to us in english societythere you have the true description of sir john but the famous physician was quite another sort of man i had only to look at him and to feel myself condemned to small talk while he was in the room  you have always heard of it in my correspondence whenever i have been in the wrong i was in the wrong again nowi had forgotten the law of chances capricious fortune after a long interval was about to declare herself again in my favor by means of the very woman who had twice already got the better of me what a recompense for my kind inquiries after mrs eyrecourt she recovered breath enough to begin talking again  dear me how dull you are she said to us why dont you amuse a poor prisoner confined to the house rest a little matilda or you will be falling ill next doctor is this your last professional visit  promise to take care of yourself mrs eyrecourt and i will confess that the professional visits are over i come here today only as a friend  you best of men do me another favor enliven our dullness tell us some interesting story about a patient these great doctors sir john pass their lives in a perfect atmosphere of romance dr wybrows consultingroom is like your confessional father benwell the most fascinating sins and sorrows are poured into his ears what is the last romance in real life doctor that has asked you to treat it medically we dont want names and placeswe are good children we only want a story  dr wybrow looked at me with a smile  it is impossible to persuade ladies he said that we too are fatherconfessors in our way the first duty of a doctor mrs eyrecourt  is to cure people of course she interposed in her smartest manner  the doctor answered seriously no indeed that is only the second duty our first duty is invariably to respect the confidence of our patients however he resumed in his easier tone i happen to have seen a patient today under circumstances which the rules of professional honor do not forbid me to mention i dont know mrs eyrecourt whether you will quite like to be introduced to the scene of the story the scene is in a madhouse  mrs eyrecourt burst out with a coquettish little scream and shook her fan at the doctor no horrors she cried the bare idea of a madhouse distracts me with terror oh fie fie i wont listen to youi wont look at youi positively refuse to be frightened out of my wits matilda wheel me away to the furthest end of the room my vivid imagination father benwell is my rock ahead in life i declare i can smell the odious madhouse go straight to the window matilda i want to bury my nose among the flowers  sir john upon this spoke for the first time his language consisted entirely of beginnings of sentences mutely completed by a smile upon my word you know eh doctor wybrow a man of your experience horrors in madhouses a lady in delicate health no really upon my honor now i cannot something funny oh yes but such a subject oh no  he rose to leave us dr wybrow gently stopped him i had a motive sir john he said but i wont trouble you with needless explanations there is a person unknown to me whom i want to discover you are a great deal in society when you are in london may i ask if you have ever met with a gentleman named winterfield  i have always considered the power of selfcontrol as one of the strongest points in my character for the future i shall be more humble when i heard that name my surprise so completely mastered me that i sat selfbetrayed to dr wybrow as the man who could answer his question  in the meanwhile sir john took his time to consider and discovered that he had never heard of a person named winterfield having acknowledged his ignorance in his own eloquent language he drifted away to the windowbox in the next room and gravely contemplated mrs eyrecourt with her nose buried in flowers  the doctor turned to me am i wrong father benwell in supposing that i had better have addressed myself to you  i admitted that i knew a gentleman named winterfield  dr wybrow got up directly have you a few minutes to spare he asked it is needless to say that i was at the doctors disposal my house is close by and my carriage is at the door he resumed when you feel inclined to say goodby to our friend mrs eyrecourt i have something to say to you which i think you ought to know  we took our departure at once mrs eyrecourt leaving some of the color of her nose among the flowers patted me encouragingly with her fan and told the doctor that he was forgiven on the understanding that he would never do it again in five minutes more we were in dr wybrows study  my watch tells me that i cannot hope to finish this letter by post time accept what i have written thus farand be assured that the conclusion of my report shall follow a day later  ii  the doctor began cautiously winterfield is not a very common name he said but it may not be amiss father benwell to discover if we can whether your winterfield is the man of whom i am in search do you only know him by name or are you a friend of his  i answered of course that i was a friend  dr wybrow went on will you pardon me if i venture on an indiscreet question when you are acquainted with the circumstances i am sure you will understand and excuse me are you aware of anywhat shall i call itany romantic incident in mr winterfields past life  this timefeeling myself in all probability on the brink of discoveryi was careful to preserve my composure i said quietly some such incident as you describe has occurred in mr winterfields past life there i stopped discreetly and looked as if i knew all about it  the doctor showed no curiosity to hear more my object he went on was merely to be reasonably sure that i was speaking to the right person in speaking to you i may now tell you that i have no personal interest in trying to discover mr winterfield i only act as the representative of an old friend of mine he is the proprietor of a private asylum at sandswortha man whose integrity is beyond dispute or he would not be my friend you understand my motive in saying this  proprietors of private asylums are in these days the objects of very general distrust in england i understood the doctors motive perfectly  he proceeded yesterday evening my friend called upon me and said that he had a remarkable case in his house which he believed would interest me the person to whom he alluded was a french boy whose mental powers had been imperfectly developed from his childhood the mischief had been aggravated when he was about thirteen years old by a serious fright when he was placed in my asylum he was not idiotic and not dangerously madit was a case not to use technical language of deficient intelligence tending sometimes toward acts of unreasoning mischief and petty theft but never approaching to acts of downright violence my friend was especially interested in the ladwon his confidence and affection by acts of kindnessand so improved his bodily health as to justify some hope of also improving the state of his mind when a misfortune occurred which has altered the whole prospect the poor creature has fallen ill of a fever and the fever has developed to typhus so far there has been little to interest youi am coming to a remarkable event at last at the stage of the fever when delirium usually occurs in patients of sound mind this crazy french boy has become perfectly sane and reasonable  i looked at him when he made this amazing assertion with a momentary doubt of his being in earnest doctor wybrow understood me  just what i thought too when i first heard it he said my friend was neither offended nor surprised after inviting me to go to his house and judge for myself he referred me to a similar case publicly cited in the cornhill magazine for the month of april 1879 in an article entitled bodily illness as a mental stimulant the article is published anonymously but the character of the periodical in which it appears is a sufficient guarantee of the trustworthiness of the statement i was so far influenced by the testimony thus cited that i drove to sandsworth and examined the case myself  did the examination satisfy you  thoroughly when i saw him last night the poor boy was as sane as i am there is however a complication in this instance which is not mentioned in the case related in print the boy appears to have entirely forgotten every event in his past life reckoning from the time when the bodily illness brought with it the strange mental recovery which i have mentioned to you  this was a disappointment i had begun to hope for some coming result obtained by the lads confession  is it quite correct to call him sane when his memory is gone i ventured to ask  in this case there is no necessity to enter into the question the doctor answered the boys lapse of memory refers as i told you to his past lifethat is to say his life when his intellect was deranged during the extraordinary interval of sanity that has now declared itself he is putting his mental powers to their first free use and none of them fail him so far as i can see his new memory if i may call it so preserves the knowledge of what has happened since his illness you may imagine how this problem in brain disease interests me and you will not wonder that i am going back to sandsworth tomorrow afternoon when i have done with my professional visits but you may be reasonably surprised at my troubling you with details which are mainly interesting to a medical man  was he about to ask me to go with him to the asylum i replied very briefly merely saying that the details were interesting to every student of human nature if he could have felt my pulse at that moment i am afraid he might have thought i was in a fair way of catching the fever too  prepare yourself he resumed for another surprising circumstance mr winterfield is by some incomprehensible accident associated with one of the mischievous tricks played by the french boy before he was placed under my friends care there at any rate is the only explanation by which we can account for the discovery of an envelope with inclosures found sewn up in the lining of the lads waistcoat and directed to mr winterfieldwithout any place of address  i leave you to imagine the effect which those words produced on me  now said the doctor you will understand why i put such strange questions to you my friend and i are both hardworking men we go very little into society as the phrase is and neither he nor i had ever heard the name of winterfield as a certain proportion of my patients happen to be people with a large experience of society i undertook to make inquiries so that the packet might be delivered if possible to the right person you heard how mrs eyrecourt surely a likely lady to assist me received my unlucky reference to the madhouse and you saw how i puzzled sir john i consider myself most fortunate father benwell in having had the honor of meeting you will you accompany me to the asylum tomorrow and can you add to the favor by bringing mr winterfield with you  this last request it was out of my powerreally out of my powerto grant winterfield had left london that morning on his visit to paris his address there was thus far not known to me  well you must represent your friend the doctor said time is every way of importance in this case will you kindly call here at five tomorrow afternoon  i was punctual to my appointment we drove together to the asylum  there is no need for me to trouble you with a narrative of what i sawfavored by doctor wybrows introductionat the french boys bedside it was simply a repetition of what i had already heard there he lay at the height of the fever asking in the intervals of relief intelligent questions relating to the medicines administered to him and perfectly understanding the answers he was only irritable when we asked him to take his memory back to the time before his illness and then he answered in french i havent got a memory  but i have something else to tell you which is deserving of your best attention the envelope and its inclosures addressed to bernard winterfield esqre are in my possession the christian name sufficiently identifies the inscription with the winterfield whom i know  the circumstances under which the discovery was made were related to me by the proprietor of the asylum  when the boy was brought to the house two french ladies his mother and sister accompanied him and mentioned what had been their own domestic experience of the case they described the wandering propensities which took the lad away from home and the odd concealment of his waistcoat on the last occasion when he had returned from one of his vagrant outbreaks  on his first night at the asylum he became excited by finding himself in a strange place it was necessary to give him a composing draught on going to bed he was purposely not prevented from hiding his waistcoat under the pillow as usual  when the sedative had produced its effect the attendant easily possessed himself of the hidden garment it was the plain duty of the master of the house to make sure that nothing likely to be turned to evil uses was concealed by a patient the seal which had secured the envelope was found on examination to have been broken  i would not have broken the seal myself our host added but as things were i thought it my duty to look at the inclosures they refer to private affairs of mr winterfield in which he is deeply interested and they ought to have been long since placed in his possession i need hardly say that i consider myself bound to preserve the strictest silence as to what i have read an envelope containing some blank sheets of paper was put back in the boys waistcoat so that he might feel it in its place under the lining when he woke the original envelope and inclosures with a statement of circumstances signed by my assistant and myself have been secured under another cover sealed with my own seal i have done my best to discover mr bernard winterfield he appears not to live in london at least i failed to find his name in the directory i wrote next mentioning what had happened to the english gentleman to whom i send reports of the lads health he couldnt help me a second letter to the french ladies only produced the same result i own i should be glad to get rid of my responsibility on honorable terms  all this was said in the boys presence he lay listening to it as if it had been a story told of some one else i could not resist the useless desire to question him not speaking french myself although i can read the language i asked doctor wybrow and his friend to interpret for me  my questions led to nothing the french boy knew no more about the stolen envelope than i did  there was no discoverable motive mind for suspecting him of imposing on us when i said perhaps you stole it he answered quite composedly very likely they tell me i have been mad i dont remember it myself but mad people do strange things i tried him again or perhaps you took it away out of mischief yes and you broke the seal and looked at the papers i dare say and then you kept them hidden thinking they might be of some use to you or perhaps feeling ashamed of what you had done and meaning to restore them if you got the opportunity you know best sir the same result followed when we tried to find out where he had been and what people had taken care of him during his last vagrant escape from home it was a new revelation to him that he had been anywhere with evident interest he applied to us to tell him where he had wandered to and what people he had seen  so our last attempts at enlightenment ended we came to the final question of how to place the papers with the least possible loss of time in mr winterfields hands  his absence in paris having been mentioned i stated plainly my own position toward him at the present time  mr winterfield has made an appointment with me to call at his hotel on his return to london i said i shall probably be the first friend who sees him if you will trust me with your sealed packet in consideration of these circumstances i will give you a formal receipt for it in doctor wybrows presenceand i will add any written pledge that you may require on my part acting as mr winterfields representative and friend perhaps you would like a reference as well  he made a courteous reply a friend of dr wybrows he said requires no other reference  excuse me i persisted i had the honor of meeting doctor wybrow for the first time yesterday permit me to refer you to lord loring who has long known me as his spiritual director and friend  this account of myself settled the matter i drew out the necessary securitiesand i have all the papers lying before me on my desk at this moment  you remember how seals were broken and impressed again at the roman postoffice in the revolutionary days when we were both young men thanks to the knowledge then obtained the extraordinary events which once associated mr winterfield and miss eyrecourt are at last plainly revealed to me copies of the papers are in my possession and the originals are sealed again with the crest of the proprietor of the asylum as if nothing had happened i make no attempt to excuse myself you know our mottothe end justifies the means  i dont propose to make any premature use of the information which i have obtained the first and foremost necessity as i have already reminded you is to give penrose the undisturbed opportunity of completing the conversion of romayne during this interval my copies of the papers are at the disposal of my reverend brethren at headquarters    the stolen paperscopies  number onefrom emma winterfield to bernard winterfield  4 maidwell buildings belhaven  how shall i address you dear bernard or sir it doesnt matter i am going to do one of the few good actions of my life and familiarities or formalities matter nothing to a woman who lies on her deathbed  yesi have met with another accident shortly after the date of our separation you heard i think of the fall in the circus that fractured my skull on that occasion a surgical operation and a bit of silver plate in place of the bone put me right again this time it has been the kick of a horse in the stables some internal injury is the consequence i may die tomorrow or live till next week anywaythe doctor has confessed itmy time has come  mind one thing the drinkthat vile habit which lost me your love and banished me from your housethe drink is not to blame for this last misfortune only the day before it happened i had taken the pledge under persuasion of the good rector here the reverend mr fennick it is he who has brought me to make this confession and who takes it down in writing at my bedside do you remember how i once hated the very name of a parsonand when you proposed in joke to marry me before the registrar how i took it in downright earnest and kept you to your word we poor horseriders and acrobats only knew clergymen as the worst enemies we hadalways using their influence to keep the people out of our show and the bread out of our mouths if i had met with mr fennick in my younger days what a different woman i might have been  well regrets of that kind are useless now i am truly sorry bernard for the evil that i have done to you and i ask your pardon with a contrite heart  you will at least allow it in my favor that your drunken wife knew she was unworthy of you i refused to accept the allowance that you offered to me i respected your name for seven years from the time of our separation i returned to my profession under an assumed name and never troubled you the one thing i could not do was to forget you if you were infatuated by my unlucky beauty i loved devotedly on my side the wellborn gentleman who had sacrificed everything for my sake was something more than mortal in my estimation he wasno i wont shock the good man who writes this by saying what he was besides what do you care for my thoughts of you now  if you had only been content to remain as i left youor if i had not found out that you were in love with miss eyrecourt and were likely to marry her in the belief that death had released you from mei should have lived and died doing you no other injury than the first great injury of consenting to be your wife  but i made the discoveryit doesnt matter how our circus was in devonshire at the time my jealous rage maddened me and i had a wicked admirer in a man who was old enough to be my father i let him suppose that the way to my favor lay through helping my revenge on the woman who was about to take my place he found the money to have you watched at home and abroad he put the false announcement of my death in the daily newspapers to complete your delusion he baffled the inquiries made through your lawyers to obtain positive proof of my death and last and in those wicked days best service of all he took me to brussels and posted me at the door of the english church so that your lawful wife with her marriage certificate in her hand was the first person who met you and the mock mrs winterfield on your way from the altar to the wedding breakfast  i own it to my shame i triumphed in the mischief i had done  but i had deserved to suffer and i did suffer when i heard that miss eyrecourts mother and her two friends took her away from youwith her own entire approvalat the church door and restored her to society without a stain on her reputation how the brussels marriage was kept a secret i could not find out and when i threatened them with exposure i got a lawyers letter and was advised in my own interests to hold my tongue the rector has since told me that your marriage to miss eyrecourt could be lawfully declared null and void and that the circumstances would excuse you before any judge in england i can now well understand that people with rank and money to help them can avoid exposure to which the poor in their places must submit  one more duty the last still remains to be done  i declare solemnly on my deathbed that you acted in perfect good faith when you married miss eyrecourt you have not only been a man cruelly injured by me but vilely insulted and misjudged by the two eyrecourts and by the lord and lady who encouraged them to set you down as a villain guilty of heartless and shameless deceit  it is my conviction that these people might have done more than misinterpret your honorable submission to the circumstances in which you were placed they might have prosecuted you for bigamyif they could have got me to appear against you i am comforted when i remember that i did make some small amends i kept out of their way and yours from that day to this  i am told that i owe it to you to leave proof of my death behind me  when the doctor writes my certificate he will mention the mark by which i may be identified if this reaches you as i hope and believe it will between the time of my death and my burial the rector who will close and seal these lines as soon as the breath is out of my body will add what he can to identify me and the landlady of this house is ready to answer any questions that may be put to her this time you may be really assured that you are free when i am buried and they show you my nameless grave in the churchyard i know your kind hearti die bernard in the firm belief that you will forgive me  there was one thing more that i had to ask of you relating to a poor lost creature who is in the room with us at this moment but oh i am so weary mr fennick will tell you what it is say to yourself sometimesperhaps when you have married some lady who is worthy of youthere was good as well as bad in poor emma farewell  number twofrom the rev charles fennick to bernard winterfield  the rectory belhaven  sirit is my sad duty to inform you that mrs emma winterfield died this morning a little before five oclock i will add no comment of mine to the touching language in which she has addressed you god has i most sincerely believe accepted the poor sinners repentance her contrite spirit is at peace among the forgiven ones in the world beyond the grave  in consideration of her wish that you should see her in death the coffin will be kept open until the last moment the medical man in attendance has kindly given me a copy of his certificate which i inclose you will see that the remains are identified by the description of a small silver plate on the right parietal bone of the skull  i need hardly add that all the information i can give you is willingly at your service  she mentions poor soul something which she had to ask of you i prefer the request which in her exhausted state she was unable to address to you in her own words  while the performances of the circus were taking place in the next county to ours a wandering lad evidently of deficient intelligence was discovered trying to creep under the tent to see what was going on he could give no intelligible account of himself the late mrs winterfield who was born and brought up as i understand in france discovered that the boy was french and felt interested in the unfortunate creature from former happy association with kind friends of his nation she took care of him from that time to the day of her deathand he appeared to be gratefully attached to her  i say appeared because an inveterate reserve marks one of the peculiarities of the mental affliction from which he suffers even his benefactress never could persuade him to take her into his confidence in other respects her influence so far as i can learn had been successfully exerted in restraining certain mischievous propensities in him which occasionally showed themselves the effect of her death has been to intensify that reserve to which i have already alluded he is sullen and irritableand the good landlady at the lodgings does not disguise that she shrinks from taking care of him even for a few days until i hear from you he will remain under the charge of my housekeeper at the rectory  you have no doubt anticipated the request which the poor sufferer wished to address to you but a few hours before her death she hoped that you might be willing to place this friendless and helpless creature under competent protection failing your assistance i shall have no alternative however i may regret it but to send him to the workhouse of this town on his way probably to the public asylum  believe me sir your faithful servant  charles fennick  psi fear my letter and its inclosures may be delayed in reaching you  yesterday evening i had returned to my house before it occurred to me that mrs winterfield had not mentioned your address my only excuse for this forgetfulness is that i was very much distressed while i was writing by her bedside i at once went back to the lodgings but she had fallen asleep and i dared not disturb her this morning when i returned to the house she was dead there is an allusion to devonshire in her letter which suggests that your residence may be in that county and i think she once spoke of you as a person of rank and fortune having failed to find your name in a london directory i am now about to search our free library here for a county history of devon on the chance that it may assist me let me add for your own satisfaction that no eyes but mine will see these papers for securitys sake i shall seal them at once and write your name on the envelope  added by father benwell  how the boy contrived to possess himself of the sealed packet we shall probably never discover anyhow we know that he must have escaped from the rectory with the papers in his possession and that he did certainly get back to his mother and sister in london  with such complete information as i now have at my disposal the prospect is as clear again as we can desire the separation of romayne from his wife and the alteration of his will in favor of the church seem to be now merely questions of time     book the fourth    chapter i  the breach is widened  a fortnight after father benwells discovery stella followed her husband one morning into his study have you heard from mr penrose she inquired  yes he will be here tomorrow  to make a long visit  i hope so the longer the better  she looked at him with a mingled expression of surprise and reproach why do you say that she asked why do you want him so muchwhen you have got me  thus far he had been sitting at his desk resting his head on his hand with his downcast eyes fixed on an open book when she put her last question to him he suddenly looked up through the large window at his side the morning light fell on his face the haggard look of suffering which stella remembered on the day when they met on the deck of the steamboat was again visiblenot softened and chastened now by the touching resignation of the bygone time but intensified by the dogged and despairing endurance of a man weary of himself and his life her heart ached for him she said softly i dont mean to reproach you  are you jealous of penrose he asked with a bitter smile  she desperately told him the truth i am afraid of penrose she answered  he eyed her with a strange expression of suspicious surprise why are you afraid of penrose  it was no time to run the risk of irritating him the torment of the voice had returned in the past night the old gnawing remorse of the fatal day of the duel had betrayed itself in the wild words that had escaped him when he sank into a broken slumber as the morning dawned feeling the truest pity for him she was still resolute to assert herself against the coming interference of penrose she tried her ground by a dangerous meansthe means of an indirect reply  i think you might have told me she said that mr penrose was a catholic priest  he looked down again at his book how did you know penrose was a catholic priest  i had only to look at the direction on your letters to him  well and what is there to frighten you in his being a priest you told me at the lorings ball that you took an interest in penrose because i liked him  i didnt know then lewis that he had concealed his profession from us i cant help distrusting a man who does that  he laughednot very kindly you might as well say you distrust a man who conceals that he is an author by writing an anonymous book what penrose did he did under orders from his superiorand moreover he frankly owned to me that he was a priest if you blame anybody you had better blame me for respecting his confidence  she drew back from him hurt by the tone in which he spoke to her i remember the time lewis she said when you would have been more indulgent toward my errorseven if i am wrong  that simple appeal touched his better nature i dont mean to be hard on you stella he answered it is a little irritating to hear you say that you distrust the most devoted and most affectionate friend that man ever had why cant i love my wife and love my friend too you dont know when i am trying to get on with my book how i miss the help and sympathy of penrose the very sound of his voice used to encourage me come stella give me a kissand let us as the children say make it up  he rose from his writingtable she met him more than half way and pressed all her loveand perhaps a little of her fearon his lips he returned the kiss as warmly as it was given and then unhappily for both of them he went back to the subject  my own love he said try to like my friend for my sake and be tolerant of other forms of christianity besides the form which happens to be yours  her smiling lips closed she turned from him with the sensitive selfishness of a womans love she looked on penrose as a robber who had stolen the sympathies which should have been wholly hers as she moved away her quick observation noticed the open book on the desk with notes and lines in pencil on the margin of the page what had romayne been reading which interested him in that way if he had remained silent she would have addressed the inquiry to him openly but he was hurt on his side by the sudden manner of her withdrawal from him he spokeand his tone was colder than ever  i wont attempt to combat your prejudices he said but one thing i must seriously ask of you when my friend penrose comes here tomorrow dont treat him as you treated mr winterfield  there was a momentary paleness in her face which looked like fear but it passed away again she confronted him firmly with steady eyes  why do you refer again to that she asked is she hesitated and recovered herselfis mr winterfield another devoted friend of yours  he walked to the door as if he could hardly trust his temper if he answered herstoppedand thinking better of it turned toward her again  we wont quarrel stella he rejoined i will only say i am sorry you dont appreciate my forbearance your reception of mr winterfield has lost me the friendship of a man whom i sincerely liked and who might have assisted my literary labors you were ill at the time and anxious about mrs eyrecourt i respected your devotion to your mother i remembered your telling me when you first went away to nurse her that your conscience accused you of having sometimes thoughtlessly neglected your mother in her days of health and good spirits and i admired the motive of atonement which took you to her bedside for those reasons i shrank from saying a word that might wound you but because i was silent it is not the less true that you surprised and disappointed me dont do it again whatever you may privately think of catholic priests i once more seriously request you not to let penrose see it  he left the room  she stood looking after him as he closed the door like a woman thunderstruck never yet had he looked at her as he looked when he spoke his last warning words with a heavy sigh she roused herself the vague dread with which his tone rather than his words had inspired her strangely associated itself with the momentary curiosity which she had felt on noticing the annotated book that lay on his desk  she snatched up the volume and looked at the open page it contained the closing paragraphs of an eloquent attack on protestantism from the roman catholic point of view with trembling hands she turned back to the titlepage it presented this written inscription to lewis romayne from his attached friend and servant arthur penrose  god help me she said to herself the priest has got between us already    chapter ii  a christian jesuit  on the next day penrose arrived on his visit to romayne  the affectionate meeting between the two men tested stellas selfcontrol as it had never been tried yet she submitted to the ordeal with the courage of a woman whose happiness depended on her outward graciousness of manner toward her husbands friend her reception of penrose viewed as an act of refined courtesy was beyond reproach when she found her opportunity of leaving the room romayne gratefully opened the door for her thank you he whispered with a look which was intended to reward her  she only bowed to him and took refuge in her own room  even in trifles a womans nature is degraded by the falsities of language and manner which the artificial condition of modern society exacts from her when she yields herself to more serious deceptions intended to protect her dearest domestic interests the mischief is increased in proportion deceit which is the natural weapon of defense used by the weak creature against the strong then ceases to be confined within the limits assigned by the sense of selfrespect and by the restraints of education a woman in this position will descend selfblinded to acts of meanness which would be revolting to her if they were related of another person  stella had already begun the process of selfdegradation by writing secretly to winterfield it was only to warn him of the danger of trusting father benwellbut it was a letter claiming him as her accomplice in an act of deception that morning she had received penrose with the outward cordialities of welcome which are offered to an old and dear friend and now in the safe solitude of her room she had fallen to a lower depth still she was deliberately considering the safest means of acquainting herself with the confidential conversation which romayne and penrose would certainly hold when she left them together he will try to set my husband against me and i have a right to know what means he uses in my own defense with that thought she reconciled herself to an action which she would have despised if she had heard of it as the action of another woman  it was a beautiful autumn day brightened by clear sunshine enlivened by crisp air stella put on her hat and went out for a stroll in the grounds  while she was within view from the windows of the servants offices she walked away from the house turning the corner of a shrubbery she entered a winding path on the other side which led back to the lawn under romaynes study window garden chairs were placed here and there she took one of them and seated herselfafter a last moment of honorable hesitationwhere she could hear the mens voices through the open window above her  penrose was speaking at the time  yes father benwell has granted me a holiday he said but i dont come here to be an idle man you must allow me to employ my term of leave in the pleasantest of all ways i mean to be your secretary again  romayne sighed ah if you knew how i have missed you  stella waited in breathless expectation for what penrose would say to this would he speak of her no there was a natural tact and delicacy in him which waited for the husband to introduce the subject  penrose only said how is the great work getting on  the answer was sternly spoken in one wordbadly  i am surprised to hear that romayne  why were you as innocently hopeful as i was did you expect my experience of married life to help me in writing my book  penrose replied after a pause speaking a little sadly i expected your married life to encourage you in all your highest aspirations he said  stella turned pale with suppressed anger he had spoken with perfect sincerity the unhappy woman believed that he lied for the express purpose of rousing irritation against her in her husbands irritable mind she listened anxiously for romaynes answer  he made no answer penrose changed the subject you are not looking very well he gently resumed i am afraid your health has interfered with your work have you had any return  it was still one of the characteristics of romaynes nervous irritability that he disliked to hear the terrible delusion of the voice referred to in words yes he interposed bitterly i have heard it again and again my right hand is as red as ever penrose with the blood of a fellowcreature another destruction of my illusions when i married  romayne i dont like to hear you speak of your marriage in that way  oh very well let us go back to my book perhaps i shall get on better with it now you are here to help me my ambition to make a name in the world has never taken so strong a hold on me i dont know why unless other disappointments have had something to do with it as at this time when i find i cant give my mind to my work we will make a last effort together my friend if it fails we will put my manuscripts into the fire and i will try some other career politics are open to me through politics i might make my mark in diplomacy there is something in directing the destinies of nations wonderfully attractive to me in my present state of feeling i hate the idea of being indebted for my position in the world like the veriest fool living to the accidents of birth and fortune are you content with the obscure life that you lead did you not envy that priest he is no older than i am who was sent the other day as the popes ambassador to portugal  penrose spoke out at last without hesitation you are in a thoroughly unwholesome state of mind he said  romayne laughed recklessly when was i ever in a healthy state of mind he asked  penrose passed the interruption over without notice if i am to do you any good he resumed i must know what is really the matter with you the very last question that i ought to put and that i wish to put is the question which you force me to ask  what is it  when you speak of your married life said penrose your tone is the tone of a disappointed man have you any serious reason to complain of mrs romayne  stella rose to her feet in her eagerness to hear what her husbands answer would be  serious reason romayne repeated how can such an idea have entered your head i only complain of irritating trifles now and then even the best of women is not perfect its hard to expect it from any of them  the interpretation of this reply depended entirely on the tone in which it was spoken what was the animating spirit in this case irony or indulgence stella was ignorant of the indirect methods of irritation by means of which father benwell had encouraged romaynes doubts of his wifes motive for the reception of winterfield her husbands tone expressing this state of mind was new to her she sat down again divided between hope and fear waiting to hear more the next words spoken by penrose astounded her the priest the jesuit the wily spiritual intruder between man and wife actually took the wifes side  romayne he proceeded quietly i want you to be happy  how am i to be happy  i will try and tell you i believe your wife to be a good woman i believe she loves you there is something in her face that speaks for hereven to an inexperienced person like myself dont be impatient with her put away from you that besetting temptation to speak in ironyit is so easy to take that tone and sometimes so cruel i am only a lookeron i know domestic happiness can never be the happiness of my life but i have observed my fellowcreatures of all degreesand this i tell you is the result the largest number of happy men are the husbands and fathers yes i admit that they have terrible anxietiesbut they are fortified by unfailing compensations and encouragements only the other day i met with a man who had suffered the loss of fortune and worse still the loss of health he endured those afflictions so calmly that he surprised me what is the secret of your philosophy i asked he answered i can bear anything while i have my wife and my children think of that and judge for yourself how much happiness you may have left yet ungathered in your married life  those words touched stellas higher nature as the dew touches the thirsty ground surely they were nobly spoken how would her husband receive them  i must think with your mind penrose before i can do what you ask of me is there any method of transformation by which i can change natures with you that was all he saidand he said it despondingly  penrose understood and felt for him  if there is anything in my nature worthy to be set as an example to you he replied you know to what blessed influence i owe selfdiscipline and serenity of mind remember what i said when i left you in london to go back to my friendless life i told you that i found in the faith i held the one sufficient consolation which helped me to bear my lot andif there came a time of sorrow in the futurei entreated you to remember what i had said have you remembered it  look at the book here on my desklook at the other books within easy reach on that tableare you satisfied  more than satisfied tell medo you feel nearer to an understanding of the faith to which i have tried to convert you  there was a pause say that i do feel nearer romayne resumedsay that some of my objections are removedare you really as eager as ever to make a catholic of me now that i am a married man  i am even more eager penrose answered i have always believed that your one sure way to happiness lay through your conversion now when i know from what i have seen and heard in this room that you are not reconciled as you should be to your new life i am doubly confined in my belief as god is my witness i speak sincerely hesitate no longer be converted and be happy  have you not forgotten something penrose  what have i forgotten  a serious consideration perhaps i have a protestant wife  i have borne that in mind romayne throughout our conversation  and you still saywhat you have just said  with my whole heart i say it be converted and be happy be happy and you will be a good husband i speak in your wife s interest as well as in yours people who are happy in each others society will yield a little on either side even on questions of religious belief and perhaps there may follow a more profitable result still so far as i have observed a good husbands example is gladly followed by his wife dont think that i am trying to persuade you against your will i am only telling you in my own justification from what motives of love for yourself and of true interest in your welfare i speak you implied just now that you had still some objections left if i can remove themwell and good if i failif you cannot act on purely conscientious convictioni not only advise i entreat you to remain as you are i shall be the first to acknowledge that you have done right  this moderation of tone would appeal irresistibly as stella well knew to her husbands ready appreciation of those good qualities in others which he did not himself possess once more her suspicion wronged penrose had he his own interested motives for pleading her cause at the bare thought of it she left her chair and standing under the window boldly interrupted the conversation by calling to romayne  lewis she cried why do you stay indoors on this beautiful day i am sure mr penrose would like a walk in the grounds  penrose appeared alone at the window you are quite right mrs romayne he said we will join you directly  in a few minutes he turned the corner of the house and met stella on the lawn romayne was not with him is my husband not coming with us she asked he will follow us penrose answered i believe he has some letters to write  stella looked at him suspecting some underhand exercise of influence on her husband  if she had been able to estimate the noble qualities in the nature of penrose she might have done him the justice to arrive at a truer conclusion it was he who had asked leave when stella had interrupted them to take the opportunity of speaking alone with mrs romayne he had said to his friend if i am wrong in my anticipation of the effect of your change of religion on your wife let me find it out from herself my one object is to act justly toward you and toward her i should never forgive myself if i made mischief between you no matter how innocent of any evil intention i might be romayne had understood him it was stellas misfortune ignorantly to misinterpret everything that penrose said or did for the allsufficient reason that he was a catholic priest she had drawn the conclusion that her husband had deliberately left her alone with penrose to be persuaded or deluded into giving her sanction to aid the influence of the priest they shall find they are mistaken she thought to herself  have i interrupted an interesting conversation she inquired abruptly when i asked you to come out were you talking to my husband about his historical work  no mrs romayne we were not speaking at that time of the book  may i ask an odd question mr penrose  certainly  are you a very zealous catholic  pardon me i am a priest surely my profession speaks for me  i hope you are not trying to convert my husband  penrose stopped and looked at her attentively  are you strongly opposed to your husbands conversion he asked  as strongly she answered as a woman can be  by religious conviction mrs romayne  no by experience  penrose started is it indiscreet he said gently to inquire what your experience may have been  i will tell you what my experience has been stella replied i am ignorant of theological subtleties and questions of doctrine are quite beyond me but this i do know a wellmeaning and zealous catholic shortened my fathers life and separated me from an only sister whom i dearly loved i see i shock youand i daresay you think i am exaggerating  i hear what you say mrs romayne with very great paini dont presume to form any opinion thus far  my sad story can be told in a few words stella proceeded when my elder sister was still a young girl an aunt of ours my mothers sister came to stay with us she had married abroad and she was as i have said a zealous catholic unknown to the rest of us she held conversations on religion with my sisterworked on the enthusiasm which was part of the girls natureand accomplished her conversion other influences of which i know nothing were afterward brought to bear on my sister she declared her intention of entering a convent as she was under age my father had only to interpose his authority to prevent this she was his favorite child he had no heart to restrain her by forcehe could only try all that the kindest and best of fathers could do to persuade her to remain at home even after the years that have passed i cannot trust myself to speak of it composedly she persisted she was as hard as stone my aunt when she was entreated to interfere called her heartless obstinacy a vocation my poor fathers loving resistance was worn out he slowly drew nearer and nearer to death from the day when she left us let me do her justice if i can she has not only never regretted entering the conventshe is so happily absorbed in her religious duties that she has not the slightest wish to see her mother or me my mothers patience was soon worn out the last time i went to the convent i went by myself i shall never go there again she could not conceal her sense of relief when i took my leave of her i need say no more arguments are thrown away on me mr penrose after what i have seen and felt i have no right to expect that the consideration of my happiness will influence youbut i may perhaps ask you as a gentleman to tell me the truth do you come here with the purpose of converting my husband  penrose owned the truth without an instants hesitation  i cannot take your view of your sisters pious devotion of herself to a religious life he said but i can and will answer you truly from the time when i first knew him my dearest object has been to convert your husband to the catholic faith  stella drew back from him as if he had stung her and clasped her hands in silent despair  but i am bound as a christian he went on to do to others as i would they should do to me  she turned on him suddenly her beautiful face radiant with hope her hand trembling as it caught him by the arm  speak plainly she cried  he obeyed her to the letter  the happiness of my friends wife mrs romayne is sacred to me for his sake be the good angel of your husbands life i abandon the purpose of converting him  he lifted her hand from his arm and raised it respectfully to his lips then when he had bound himself by a promise that was sacred to him the terrible influence of the priesthood shook even that brave and lofty soul he said to himself as he left her god forgive me if i have done wrong    chapter iii  winterfield returns  twice father benwell called at derwents hotel and twice he was informed that no news had been received there of mr winterfield at the third attempt his constancy was rewarded mr winterfield had written and was expected to arrive at the hotel by five oclock  it was then halfpast four father benwell decided to await the return of his friend  he was as anxious to deliver the papers which the proprietor of the asylum had confided to him as if he had never broken a seal or used a counterfeit to hide the betrayal of a trust the resealed packet was safe in the pocket of his long black frockcoat his own future proceedings depended in some degree on the course which winterfield might take when he had read the confession of the unhappy woman who had once been his wife  would he show the letter to stella at a private interview as an unanswerable proof that she had cruelly wronged him and would it in this case be desirableif the thing could be doneso to handle circumstances as that romayne might be present unseen and might discover the truth for himself in the other eventthat is to say if winterfield abstained from communicating the confession to stellathe responsibility of making the necessary disclosure must remain with the priest  father benwell walked softly up and down the room looking about him with quietlyobservant eye a side table in a corner was covered with letters waiting winterfields return always ready for information of any sort he even looked at the addresses on the letters  the handwritings presented the customary variety of character all but three of the envelopes showed the london district postmarks two of the other letters addressed to winterfield at his club bore foreign postmarks and one as the altered direction showed had been forward from beaupark house to the hotel  this last letter especially attracted the priests attention  the address was apparently in a womans handwriting and it was worthy of remark that she appeared to be the only person among winterfields correspondents who was not acquainted with the address of his hotel or of his club who could the person be the subtly inquiring intellect of father benwell amused itself by speculating even on such a trifling problem as this he little thought that he had a personal interest in the letter the envelope contained stellas warning to winterfield to distrust no less a person than father benwell himself  it was nearly halfpast five before quick footsteps were audible outside winterfield entered the room  this is friendly indeed he said i expected to return to the worst of all solitudessolitude in a hotel you will stay and dine with me thats right you must have thought i was going to settle in paris do you know what has kept me so long the most delightful theater in the worldthe opera comique i am so fond of the bygone school of music father benwellthe flowing graceful delicious melodies of the composers who followed mozart one can only enjoy that music in paris would you believe that i waited a week to hear nicolos delightful joconde for the second time i was almost the only young man in the stalls all round me were the old men who remembered the first performances of the opera beating time with their wrinkled hands to the tunes which were associated with the happiest days of their lives whats that i hear my dog i was obliged to leave him here and he knows i have come back  he flew to the door and called down the stairs to have the dog set free the spaniel rushed into the room and leaped into his masters outstretched arms winterfield returned his caresses and kisses him as tenderly as a woman might have kissed her pet  dear old fellow its a shame to have left youi wont do it again father benwell have you many friends who would be as glad to see you as this friend i havent one and there are fools who talk of a dog as an inferior being to ourselves this creatures faithful love is mine do what i may i might be disgraced in the estimation of every human creature i know and he would be as true to me as ever and look at his physical qualities what an ugly thing for instancei wont say your eari will say my ear is crumpled and wrinkled and naked look at the beautiful silky covering of his ear what are our senses of smelling and hearing compared to his we are proud of our reason could we find our way back if they shut us up in a basket and took us to a strange place away from home if we both want to run downstairs in a hurry which of us is securest against breaking his necki on my poor two legs or he on his four who is the happy mortal who goes to bed without unbuttoning and gets up again without buttoning here he is on my lap knowing i am talking about him and too fond of me to say to himself what a fool my master is  father benwell listened to this rhapsodyso characteristic of the childish simplicity of the manwith an inward sense of impatience which never once showed itself on the smiling surface of his face  he had decided not to mention the papers in his pocket until some circumstance occurred which might appear to remind him naturally that he had such things about him if he showed any anxiety to produce the envelope he might expose himself to the suspicion of having some knowledge of the contents when would winterfield notice the side table and open his letters  the ticktick of the clock on the mantelpiece steadily registered the progress of time and winterfields fantastic attentions were still lavished on his dog  even father benwells patience was sorely tried when the good country gentleman proceeded to mention not only the spaniels name but the occasion which had suggested it we call him traveler and i will tell you why when he was only a puppy he strayed into the garden at beaupark so weary and footsore that we concluded he had come to us from a great distance we advertised him but he was never claimedand here he is if you dont object we will give traveler a treat today he shall have dinner with us  perfectly understanding those last words the dog jumped off his masters lap and actually forwarded the views of father benwell in less than a minute more scampering round and round the room as an appropriate expression of happiness he came into collision with the side table and directed winterfields attention to the letters by scattering them on the floor  father benwell rose politely to assist in picking up the prostrate correspondence but traveler was beforehand with him warning the priest with a low growl not to interfere with another persons business the dog picked up the letters in his mouth and carried them by installments to his masters feet even then the exasperating winterfield went no further than patting traveler father benwells endurance reached its limits pray dont stand on ceremony with me he said i will look at the newspaper while you read your letters  winterfield carelessly gathered the letters together tossed them on the dining table at his side and took the uppermost one of the little heap  fate was certainly against the priest on that evening the first letter that winterfield opened led him off to another subject of conversation before he had read it to the end father benwells hand already in his coat pocket appeared againempty  heres a proposal to me to go into parliament said the squire what do you think of representative institutions father benwell to my mind representative institutions are on their last legs honorable members vote away more of our money every year they have no alternative between suspending liberty of speech or sitting helpless while half a dozen impudent idiots stop the progress of legislation from motives of the meanest kind and they are not even sensitive enough to the national honor to pass a social law among themselves which makes it as disgraceful in a gentleman to buy a seat by bribery as to cheat at cards i declare i think the cardsharper the least degraded person of the two he doesnt encourage his inferiors to be false to a public trust in short my dear sir everything wears out in this worldand why should the house of commons be an exception to the rule  he picked up the next letter from the heap as he looked at the address his face changed the smile left his lips the gayety died out of his eyes traveler entreating for more notice with impatient forepaws applied to his masters knees saw the alteration and dropped into a respectfully recumbent position father benwell glanced sidelong off the columns of the newspaper and waited for events with all the discretion and none of the good faith of the dog  forwarded from beaupark winterfield said to himself he opened the letterread it carefully to the endthought over itand read it again  father benwell he said suddenly  the priest put down the newspaper for a few moments more nothing was audible but the steady ticktick of the clock  we have not been very long acquainted winterfield resumed but our association has been a pleasant one and i think i owe to you the duty of a friend i dont belong to your church but i hope you will believe me when i say that ignorant prejudice against the catholic priesthood is not one of my prejudices  father benwell bowed in silence  you are mentioned winterfield proceeded in the letter which i have just read  are you at liberty to tell me the name of your correspondent father benwell asked  i am not at liberty to do that but i think it due to you and to myself to tell you what the substance of the letter is the writer warns me to be careful in my intercourse with you your object i am told is to make yourself acquainted with events in my past life and you have some motive which my correspondent has thus far failed to discover i speak plainly but i beg you to understand that i also speak impartially i condemn no man unheardleast of all a man whom i have had the honor of receiving under my own roof  he spoke with a certain simple dignity with equal dignity father benwell answered it is needless to say that he now knew winterfields correspondent to be romaynes wife  let me sincerely thank you mr winterfield for a candor which does honor to us both he said you will hardly expect meif i may use such an expressionto condescend to justify myself against an accusation which is an anonymous accusation so far as i am concerned i prefer to meet that letter by a plain proof and i leave you to judge whether i am still worthy of the friendship to which you have so kindly alluded  with this preface he briefly related the circumstances under which he had become possessed of the packet and then handed it to winterfieldwith the seal uppermost  decide for yourself he concluded whether a man bent on prying into your private affairs with that letter entirely at his mercy would have been true to the trust reposed in him  he rose and took his hat ready to leave the room if his honor was profaned by the slightest expression of distrust winterfields genial and unsuspicious nature instantly accepted the offered proof as conclusive before i break the seal he said let me do you justice sit down again father benwell and forgive me if my sense of duty has hurried me into hurting your feelings no man ought to know better than i do how often people misjudge and wrong each other  they shook hands cordially no moral relief is more eagerly sought than relief from the pressure of a serious explanation by common consent they now spoke as lightly as if nothing had happened father benwell set the example  you actually believe in a priest he said gayly we shall make a good catholic of you yet  dont be too sure of that winterfield replied with a touch of his quaint humor i respect the men who have given to humanity the inestimable blessing of quinineto say nothing of preserving learning and civilizationbut i respect still more my own liberty as a free christian  perhaps a free thinker mr winterfield  anything you like to call it father benwell so long as it is free  they both laughed father benwell went back to his newspaper winterfield broke the seal of the envelope and took out the inclosures  the confession was the first of the papers at which he happened to look at the opening lines he turned pale he read more and his eyes filled with tears in low broken tones he said to the priest you have innocently brought me most distressing news i entreat your pardon if i ask to be left alone  father benwell said a few wellchosen words of sympathy and immediately withdrew the dog licked his masters hand hanging listlessly over the arm of the chair  later in the evening a note from winterfield was left by messenger at the priests lodgings the writer announced with renewed expressions of regret that he would be again absent from london on the next day but that he hoped to return to the hotel and receive his guest on the evening of the day after  father benwell rightly conjectured that winterfields destination was the town in which his wife had died  his object in taking the journey was not as the priest supposed to address inquiries to the rector and the landlady who had been present at the fatal illness and the deathbut to justify his wifes last expression of belief in the mercy and compassion of the man whom she had injured on that nameless grave so sadly and so humbly referred to in the confession he had resolved to place a simple stone cross giving to her memory the name which she had shrunk from profaning in her lifetime when he had written the brief inscription which recorded the death of emma wife of bernard winterfield and when he had knelt for a while by the low turf mound his errand had come to its end he thanked the good rector he left gifts with the landlady and her children by which he was gratefully remembered for many a year afterward and then with a heart relieved he went back to london  other men might have made their sad little pilgrimage alone winterfield took his dog with him i must have something to love he said to the rector at such a time as this    chapter iv  father benwells correspondence  to the secretary s j rome  when i wrote last i hardly thought i should trouble you again so soon the necessity has however arisen i must ask for instructions from our most reverend general on the subject of arthur penrose  i believe that i informed you that i decided to defer my next visit to ten acres lodge for two or three days in order that winterfield if he intended to do so might have time to communicate with mrs romayne after his return from the country naturally enough perhaps considering the delicacy of the subject he has not taken me into his confidence i can only guess that he has maintained the same reserve with mrs romayne  my visit to the lodge was duly paid this afternoon  i asked first of course for the lady of the house and hearing she was in the grounds joined her there she looked ill and anxious and she received me with rigid politeness fortunately mrs eyrecourt now convalescent was staying at ten acres and was then taking the air in her chair on wheels the good ladys nimble and discursive tongue offered me an opportunity of referring in the most innocent manner possible to winterfields favorable opinion of romaynes pictures i need hardly say that i looked at romaynes wife when i mentioned the name she turned paleprobably fearing that i had some knowledge of her letter warning winterfield not to trust me if she had already been informed that he was not to be blamed but to be pitied in the matter of the marriage at brussels she would have turned red such at least is my experience drawn from recollections of other days   the ladies having served my purpose i ventured into the house to pay my respects to romayne  he was in the study and his excellent friend and secretary was with him after the first greetings penrose left us his manner told me plainly that there was something wrong i asked no questionswaiting on the chance that romayne might enlighten me  i hope you are in better spirits now that you have your old companion with you i said  i am very glad to have penrose with me he answered and then he frowned and looked out of the window at the two ladies in the grounds  it occurred to me that mrs eyrecourt might be occupying the customary false position of a motherinlaw i was mistaken he was not thinking of his wifes motherhe was thinking of his wife  i suppose you know that penrose had an idea of converting me he said suddenly  i was perfectly candid with himi said i knew it and approved of it may i hope that arthur has succeeded in convincing you i ventured to add  he might have succeeded father benwell if he had chosen to go on  this reply as you may easily imagine took me by surprise  are you really so obdurate that arthur despairs of your conversion i asked  nothing of the sort i have thought and thought of itand i can tell you i was more than ready to meet him half way  then where is the obstacle i exclaimed  he pointed through the window to his wife there is the obstacle he said in a tone of ironical resignation  knowing arthurs character as i knew it i at last understood what had happened for a moment i felt really angry under these circumstances the wise course was to say nothing until i could be sure of speaking with exemplary moderation it doesnt do for a man in my position to show anger  romayne went on  we talked of my wife father benwell the last time you were here you only knew then that her reception of mr winterfield had determined him never to enter my house again by way of adding to your information on the subject of petticoat government i may now tell you that mrs romayne has forbidden penrose to proceed with the attempt to convert me by common consent the subject is never mentioned between us the bitter irony of his tone thus far suddenly disappeared he spoke eagerly and anxiously i hope you are not angry with arthur he said  by this time my little fit of illtemper was at an end i answeredand it was really in a certain sense truei know arthur too well to be angry with him  romayne seemed to be relieved i only troubled you with this last domestic incident he resumed to bespeak your indulgence for penrose i am getting learned in the hierarchy of the church father benwell you are the superior of my dear little friend and you exercise authority over him oh he is the kindest and best of men it is not his fault he submits to mrs romayneagainst his own better convictionin the honest belief that he consults the interests of our married life  i dont think i misinterpret the state of romaynes mind and mislead you when i express my belief that this second indiscreet interference of his wife between his friend and himself will produce the very result which she dreads mark my words written after the closest observation of himthis new irritation of romaynes sensitive selfrespect will hasten his conversion  you will understand that the one alternative before me after what has happened is to fill the place from which penrose has withdrawn i abstained from breathing a word of this to romayne it is he if i can manage it who must invite me to complete the work of conversionand besides nothing can be done until the visit of penrose has come to an end romaynes secret sense of irritation may be safely left to develop itself with time to help it  i changed the conversation to the subject of his literary labors  the present state of his mind is not favorable to work of that exacting kind even with the help of penrose to encourage him he does not get on to his satisfactionand yet as i could plainly perceive the ambition to make a name in the world exercises a stronger influence over him than ever all in our favor my reverend friendall in our favor  i took the liberty of asking to see penrose alone for a moment and this request granted romayne and i parted cordially i can make most people like me when i choose to try the master of vange abbey is no exception to the rule did i tell you bytheby that the property has a little declined of late in value it is now not worth more than six thousand a year we will improve it when it returns to the church  my interview with penrose was over in two minutes dispensing with formality i took his arm and led him into the front garden  i have heard all about it i said and i must not deny that you have disappointed me but i know your disposition and i make allowances you have qualities dear arthur which perhaps put you a little out of place among us i shall be obliged to report what you have donebut you may trust me to put it favorably shake hands my son and while we are still together let us be as good friends as ever  you may think that i spoke in this way with a view to my indulgent language being repeated to romayne and so improving the position which i have already gained in his estimation do you know i really believe i meant it at the time the poor fellow gratefully kissed my hand when i offered it to himhe was not able to speak i wonder whether i am weak about arthur say a kind word for him when his conduct comes under noticebut pray dont mention this little frailty of mine and dont suppose i have any sympathy with his weakminded submission to mrs romaynes prejudices if i ever felt the smallest consideration for her and i cannot call to mind any amiable emotion of that sort her letter to winterfield would have effectually extinguished it there is something quite revolting to me in a deceitful woman  in closing this letter i may quiet the minds of our reverend brethren if i assure them that my former objection to associating myself directly with the conversion of romayne no longer exists  yes even at my age and with my habits i am now resigned to hearing and confuting the trivial arguments of a man who is young enough to be my son i shall write a carefullyguarded letter to romayne on the departure of penrose and i shall send him a book to read from the influence of which i expect gratifying results it is not a controversial work arthur has been beforehand with me thereit is wisemans recollections of the popes i look to that essentially readable book to excite romaynes imagination by vivid descriptions of the splendors of the church and the vast influence and power of the higher priesthood does this sudden enthusiasm of mine surprise you and are you altogether at a loss to know what it means  it means my friend that i see our position toward romayne in a new light forgive me if i say no more for the present i prefer to be silent until my audacity is justified by events        father benwells experience had in this case not misled      him if stella had remained unmarried winterfield might have      justified himself but he was honorably unwilling to disturb her      relations with her husband by satisfying her that he had never      been unworthy of the affection which had once united them      chapter v  bernard winterfields correspondence  i  from mrs romayne to mr winterfield  has my letter failed to reach you i directed it as i direct this to beaupark not knowing your london address  yesterday father benwell called at ten acres lodge he first saw my mother and myself and he contrived to mention your name it was done with his usual adroitness and i might perhaps have passed it over if he had not looked at me i hope and pray it may be only my fancybut i thought i saw in his eyes that he was conscious of having me in his power and that he might betray me to my husband at any moment  i have no sort of claim on you and heaven knows i have little reason to trust you but i thought you meant fairly by me when we spoke together at this house in that belief i entreat you to tell me if father benwell has intruded himself into your confidenceor even if you have hinted anything to him which gives him a hold over me  ii  from mr winterfield to mrs romayne  both your letters have reached me  i have good reason for believing that you are entirely mistaken in your estimate of father benwells character but i know by sad experience how you hold to your opinions when they are once formed and i am eager to relieve you of all anxiety so far as i am concerned i have not said one wordi have not even let slip the slightest hintwhich could inform father benwell of that past event in our lives to which your letter alludes your secret is a sacred secret to me and it has been and shall be sacredly kept  there is a sentence in your letter which has given me great pain you reiterate the cruel language of the bygone time you say heaven knows i have little reason to trust you  i have reasons on my side for not justifying myselfexcept under certain conditions i mean under conditions which might place me in a position to serve and advise you as a friend or brother in that case i undertake to prove even to you that it was a cruel injustice ever to have doubted me and that there is no man living whom you can more implicitly trust than myself  my address when i am in london is at the head of this page  iii  from dr wybrow to mr winterfield  dear siri have received your letter mentioning that you wish to accompany me at my next visit to the asylum to see the french boy so strangely associated with the papers delivered to you by father benwell  your proposal reaches me too late the poor creatures troubled life has come to an end he never rallied from the exhausting effect of the fever to the last he was attended by his mother  i write with true sympathy for that excellent ladybut i cannot conceal from you or from myself that this death is not to be regretted in a case of the same extraordinary kind recorded in print the patient recovered from the fever and his insanity returned with his returning health  faithfully yours joseph wybrow    chapter vi  the saddest of all words  on the tenth morning dating from the dispatch of father benwells last letter to rome penrose was writing in the study at ten acres lodge while romayne sat at the other end of the room looking listlessly at a blank sheet of paper with the pen lying idle beside it on a sudden he rose and snatching up paper and pen threw them irritably into the fire  dont trouble yourself to write any longer he said to penrose my dream is over throw my manuscripts into the waste paper basket and never speak to me of literary work again  every man devoted to literature has these fits of despondency penrose answered dont think of your work send for your horse and trust to fresh air and exercise to relieve your mind  romayne barely listened he turned round at the fireplace and studied the reflection of his face in the glass  i look worse and worse he said thoughtfully to himself  it was true his flesh had fallen away his face had withered and whitened he stooped like an old man the change for the worse had been steadily proceeding from the time when he left vange abbey  its useless to conceal it from me he burst out turning toward penrose i believe i am in some way answerablethough you all deny itfor the french boys death why not his voice is still in my ears and the stain of his brothers blood is on me i am under a spell do you believe in the witchesthe merciless old women who made wax images of the people who injured them and stuck pins in their mock likenesses to register the slow wasting away of their victims day after day people disbelieve it in these times but it has never been disproved he stopped looked at penrose and suddenly changed his tone arthur what is the matter with you have you had a bad night has anything happened  for the first time in romaynes experience of him penrose answered evasively  is there nothing to make me anxious he said when i hear you talk as you are talking now the poor french boy died of a fever must i remind you again that he owed the happiest days of his life to you and your good wife  romayne still looked at him without attending to what he said  surely you dont think i am deceiving you penrose remonstrated  no i was thinking of something else i was wondering whether i really know you as well as i thought i did am i mistaken in supposing that you are not an ambitious man  my only ambition is to lead a worthy life and to be as useful to my fellowcreatures as i can does that satisfy you  romayne hesitated it seems strange he began  what seems strange  i dont say it seems strange that you should be a priest romayne explained i am only surprised that a man of your simple way of thinking should have attached himself to the order of the jesuits  i can quite understand that said penrose but you should remember that circumstances often influence a man in his choice of a vocation it has been so with me i am a member of a roman catholic family a jesuit college was near our place of abode and a near relative of minesince deadwas one of the resident priests he paused and added in a lower tone when i was little more than a lad i suffered a disappointment which altered my character for life i took refuge in the college and i have found patience and peace of mind since that time oh my friend you might have been a more contented man he stopped again his interest in the husband had all but deceived him into forgetting his promise to the wife  romayne held out his hand i hope i have not thoughtlessly hurt you he said  penrose took the offered hand and pressed it fervently he tried to speakand suddenly shuddered like a man in pain i am not very well this morning he stammered a turn in the garden will do me good  romaynes doubts were confirmed by the manner in which penrose left him something had unquestionably happened which his friend shrank from communicating to him he sat down again at his desk and tried to read the time passedand he was still left alone when the door was at last opened it was only stella who entered the room  have you seen penrose he asked  the estrangement between them had been steadily widening of late romayne had expressed his resentment at his wifes interference between penrose and himself by that air of contemptuous endurance which is the hardest penalty that a man can inflict on the woman who loves him stella had submitted with a proud and silent resignationthe most unfortunate form of protest that she could have adopted toward a man of romaynes temper when she now appeared however in her husbands study there was a change in her expression which he instantly noticed she looked at him with eyes softened by sorrow before she could answer his first question he hurriedly added another is penrose really ill  no lewis he is distressed  about what  about you and about himself  is he going to leave us  yes  but he will come back again  stella took a chair by her husbands side i am truly sorry for you lewis she said it is even a sad parting for me if you will let me say it i have a sincere regard for dear mr penrose  under other circumstances this confession of feeling for the man who had sacrificed his dearest aspiration to the one consideration of her happiness might have provoked a sharp reply but by this time romayne had really become alarmed you speak as if arthur was going to leave england he said  he leaves england this afternoon she answered for rome  why does he tell this to you and not to me romayne asked  he cannot trust himself to speak of it to you he begged me to prepare you  her courage failed her she paused romayne beat his hand impatiently on the desk before him speak out he cried if rome is not the end of the journeywhat is  stella hesitated no longer  he goes to rome she said to receive his instructions and to become personally acquainted with the missionaries who are associated with him they will leave leghorn in the next vessel which sets sail for a port in central america and the dangerous duty intrusted to them is to reestablish one of the jesuit missions destroyed by the savages years since they will find their church a ruin and not a vestige left of the house once inhabited by the murdered priests it is not concealed from them that they may be martyred too they are soldiers of the cross and they gowillingly goto save the souls of the indians at the peril of their lives  romayne rose and advanced to the door there he turned and spoke to stella where is arthur he said  stella gently detained him  there was one word more he entreated me to saypray wait and hear it she pleaded his one grief is at leaving you apart from that he devotes himself gladly to the dreadful service which claims him he has long looked forward to it and has long prepared himself for it those lewis are his own words  there was a knock at the door the servant appeared to announce that the carriage was waiting  penrose entered the room as the man left it  have you spoken for me he said to stella she could only answer him by a gesture he turned to romayne with a faint smile  the saddest of all words must be spoken he said farewell  pale and trembling romayne took his hand is this father benwells doing he asked  no penrose answered firmly in father benwells position it might have been his doing but for his goodness to me for the first time since i have known him he has shrunk from a responsibility for my sake he has left it to rome and rome has spoken oh my more than friendmy brother in love  his voice failed him with a resolution which was nothing less than heroic in a man of his affectionate nature he recovered his composure  let us make it as little miserable as it can be he said at every opportunity we will write to each other and who knowsi may yet come back to you god has preserved his servants in dangers as great as any that i shall encounter may that merciful god bless and protect you oh romayne what happy days we have had together his last powers of resistance were worn out tears of noble sorrow dimmed the friendly eyes which had never once looked unkindly on the brother of his love he kissed romayne help me out he said turning blindly toward the hall in which the servant was waiting that last act of mercy was not left to a servant with sisterly tenderness stella took his hand and led him away i shall remember you gratefully as long as i live she said to him when the carriage door was closed he waved his hand at the window and she saw him no more  she returned to the study  the relief of tears had not come to romayne he had dropped into a chair when penrose left him in stony silence he sat there his head down his eyes dry and staring the miserable days of their estrangement were forgotten by his wife in the moment when she looked at him she knelt by his side and lifted his head a little and laid it on her bosom her heart was fullshe let the caress plead for her silently he felt it his cold fingers pressed her hand thankfully but he said nothing after a long interval the first outward expression of sorrow that fell from his lips showed that he was still thinking of penrose  every blessing falls away from me he said i have lost my best friend  years afterward stella remembered those words and the tone in which he had spoken them    chapter vii  the impulsive sex  after a lapse of a few days father benwell was again a visitor at ten acres lodgeby romaynes invitation the priest occupied the very chair by the study fireside in which penrose had been accustomed to sit  it is really kind of you to come to me said romayne so soon after receiving my acknowledgment of your letter i cant tell you how i was touched by the manner in which you wrote of penrose to my shame i confess it i had no idea that you were so warmly attached to him  i hardly knew it myself mr romayne until our dear arthur was taken away from us  if you used your influence father benwell is there no hope that you might yet persuade him  to withdraw from the mission oh mr romayne dont you know arthurs character better than that even his gentle temper has its resolute side the zeal of the first martyrs to christianity is the zeal that burns in that noble nature the mission has been the dream of his lifeit is endeared to him by the very dangers which we dread persuade arthur to desert the dear and devoted colleagues who have opened their arms to him i might as soon persuade that statue in the garden to desert its pedestal and join us in this room shall we change the sad subject have you received the book which i sent you with my letter  romayne took up the book from his desk before he could speak of it some one called out briskly on the other side of the door may i come inand came in without waiting to be asked mrs eyrecourt painted and robed for the morningwafting perfumes as she movedappeared in the study she looked at the priest and lifted her manyringed hands with a gesture of coquettish terror  oh dear me i had no idea you were here father benwell i ask ten thousand pardons dear and admirable romayne you dont look as if you were pleased to see me good gracious i am not interrupting a confession am i  father benwell with his paternal smile in perfect order resigned his chair to mrs eyrecourt the traces of her illness still showed themselves in an intermittent trembling of her head and her hands she had entered the room strongly suspecting that the process of conversion might be proceeding in the absence of penrose and determined to interrupt it guided by his subtle intelligence father benwell penetrated her motive as soon as she opened the door mrs eyrecourt bowed graciously and took the offered chair father benwell sweetened his paternal smile and offered to get a footstool  how glad i am he said to see you in your customary good spirits but wasnt it just a little malicious to talk of interrupting a confession as if mr romayne was one of us queen elizabeth herself could hardly have said a sharper thing to a poor catholic priest  you clever creature said mrs eyrecourt how easily you see through a simple woman like me therei give you my hand to kiss and i will never try to deceive you again do you know father benwell a most extraordinary wish has suddenly come to me please dont be offended i wish you were a jew  may i ask why father benwell inquired with an apostolic suavity worthy of the best days of rome  mrs eyrecourt explained herself with the modest selfdistrust of a maiden of fifteen i am really so ignorant i hardly know how to put it but learned persons have told me that it is the peculiarity of the jewsmay i say the amiable peculiaritynever to make converts it would be so nice if you would take a leaf out of their book when we have the happiness of receiving you here my lively imagination pictures you in a double character father benwell everywhere else andsay the patriarch abraham at ten acres lodge  father benwell lifted his persuasive hands in courteous protest my dear lady pray make your mind easy not one word on the subject of religion has passed between mr romayne and myself  i beg your pardon mrs eyrecourt interposed i am afraid i fail to follow you my silent soninlaw looks as if he longed to smother me and my attention is naturally distracted you were about to say  i was about to say dear mrs eyrecourt that you are alarming yourself without any reason not one word on any controversial subject has passed  mrs eyrecourt cocked her head with the artless vivacity of a bird ah but it might though she suggested slyly  father benwell once more remonstrated in dumb show and romayne lost his temper  mrs eyrecourt he cried sternly  mrs eyrecourt screamed and lifted her hands to her ears i am not deaf dear romayne and i am not to be put down by any illtimed exhibition of what i may call domestic ferocity father benwell sets you an example of christian moderation do please follow it  romayne refused to follow it  talk on any other topic that you like mrs eyrecourt i request youdont oblige me to use a harder wordi request you to spare father benwell and myself any further expression of your opinion on controversial subjects  a soninlaw may make a request and a motherinlaw may decline to comply mrs eyrecourt declined to comply  no romayne it wont do i may lament your unhappy temper for my daughters sakebut i know what i am about and you cant provoke me our reverend friend and i understand each other he will make allowances for a sensitive woman who has had sad experience of conversions in her own household my eldest daughter father benwella poor foolish creaturewas converted into a nunnery the last time i saw her she used to be sweetly pretty my dear husband quite adored herthe last time i saw her she had a red nose and what is even more revolting at her age a double chin she received me with her lips pursed up and her eyes on the ground and she was insolent enough to say that she would pray for me i am not a furious old man with a long white beard and i dont curse my daughter and rush out into a thunderstorm afterwardbut i know what king lear felt and i have struggled with hysterics just as he did with your wonderful insight into human nature i am sure you will sympathize with and forgive me mr penrose as my daughter tells me behaved in the most gentlemanlike manner i make the same appeal to your kind forbearance the bare prospect of our dear friend here becoming a catholic  romaynes temper gave way once more  if anything can make me a catholic he said your interference will do it  out of sheer perversity dear romayne  not at all mrs eyrecourt if i became a catholic i might escape from the society of ladies in the refuge of a monastery  mrs eyrecourt hit him back again with the readiest dexterity  remain a protestant my dear and go to your club there is a refuge for you from the ladiesa monastery with nice little dinners and all the newspapers and periodicals having launched this shaft she got up and recovered her easy courtesy of look and manner i am so much obliged to you father benwell i have not offended you i hope and trust  you have done me a service dear mrs eyrecourt but for your salutory caution i might have drifted into controversial subjects i shall be on my guard now  how very good of you we shall meet again i hope under more agreeable circumstances after that polite allusion to a monastery i understand that my visit to my soninlaw may as well come to an end please dont forget five oclock tea at my house  as she approached the door it was opened from the outer side her daughter met her halfway why are you here mamma stella asked  why indeed my love you had better leave the room with me our amiable romaynes present idea is to relieve himself of our society by retiring to a monastery dont you see father benwell  stella coldly returned the priests bowand looked at romayne she felt a vague forewarning of what had happened mrs eyrecourt proceeded to enlighten her as an appropriate expression of gratitude we are indeed indebted to father benwell my dear he has been most considerate and kind  romayne interrupted her without ceremony favor me he said addressing his wife by inducing mrs eyrecourt to continue her narrative in some other room  stella was hardly conscious of what her mother or her husband had said she felt that the priests eyes were on her under any other circumstances father benwells good breeding and knowledge of the world would have impelled him to take his departure as things were he knew perfectly well that the more seriously romayne was annoyed in his presence the better his own private interests would be served accordingly he stood apart silently observant of stella in spite of winterfields reassuring reply to her letter stella instinctively suspected and dreaded the jesuit under the spell of those watchful eyes she trembled inwardly her customary tact deserted her she made an indirect apology to the man whom she hated and feared  whatever my mother may have said to you father benwell has been without my knowledge  romayne attempted to speak but father benwell was too quick for him  dear mrs romayne nothing has been said which needs any disclaimer on your part  i should think not mrs eyrecourt added really stella i dont understand you why may i not say to father benwell what you said to mr penrose you trusted mr penrose as your friend i can tell you thisi am quite sure you may trust father benwell  once more romayne attempted to speak and once more father benwell was beforehand with him  may i hope said the priest with a finely ironical smile that mrs romayne agrees with her excellent mother  with all her fear of him the exasperating influence of his tone and his look was more than stella could endure before she could restrain them the rash words flew out of her lips  i am not sufficiently well acquainted with you father benwell to express an opinion  with that answer she took her mothers arm and left the room  the moment they were alone romayne turned to the priest trembling with anger father benwell smiling indulgently at the ladys little outbreak took him by the hand with peacemaking intentions now dontpray dont excite yourself  romayne was not to be pacified in that way his anger was trebly intensified by the longcontinued strain on his nerves of the effort to control himself  i must and will speak out at last he said father benwell the ladies of my household have inexcusably presumed on the consideration which is due to women no words can say how ashamed i am of what has happened i can only appeal to your admirable moderation and patience to accept my apologies and the most sincere expression of my regret  no more mr romayne as a favor to me i beg and entreat you will say no more sit down and compose yourself  but romayne was impenetrable to the influence of friendly and forgiving demonstrations i can never expect you to enter my house again he exclaimed  my dear sir i will come and see you again with the greatest pleasure on any day that you may appointthe earlier day the better come come let us laugh i dont say it disrespectfully but poor dear mrs eyrecourt has been more amusing than ever i expect to see our excellent archbishop tomorrow and i must really tell him how the good lady felt insulted when her catholic daughter offered to pray for her there is hardly anything more humorous even in moliere and the double chin and the red noseall the fault of those dreadful papists oh dear me you still take it seriously how i wish you had my sense of humor when shall i come again and tell you how the archbishop likes the story of the nuns mother  he held out his hand with irresistible cordiality romayne took it gratefullystill bent however on making atonement  let me first do myself the honor of calling on you he said i am in no state to open my mindas i might have wished to open it to youafter what has happened in a day or two more  say the day after tomorrow father benwell hospitably suggested do me a great favor come and eat your bit of mutton at my lodgings six oclock if you likeand some remarkably good claret a present from one of the faithful you will thats hearty and do promise me to think no more of our little domestic comedy relieve your mind look at wisemans recollections of the popes goodbygod bless you  the servant who opened the house door for father benwell was agreeably surprised by the papists cheerfulness he isnt half a bad fellow the man announced among his colleagues give me halfacrown and went out humming a tune    chapter viii  father benwells correspondence  to the secretary s j rome  i  i beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter you mention that our reverend fathers are discouraged at not having heard from me for more than six weeks since i reported the little dinner given to romayne at my lodgings  i am sorry for this and more than sorry to hear that my venerated brethren are beginning to despair of romaynes conversion grant me a delay of another weekand if the prospects of the conversion have not sensibly improved in that time i will confess myself defeated meanwhile i bow to superior wisdom without venturing to add a word in my own defense  ii  the weeks grace granted to me has elapsed i write with humility at the same time i have something to say for myself  yesterday mr lewis romayne of vange abbey was received into the community of the holy catholic church i inclose an accurate newspaper report of the ceremonies which attended the conversion  be pleased to inform me by telegraph whether our reverend fathers wish me to go on or not     book the fifth    chapter i  mrs eyreco urts discovery  the leaves had fallen in the grounds at ten acres lodge and stormy winds told drearily that winter had come  an unchanging dullness pervaded the house romayne was constantly absent in london attending to his new religious duties under the guidance of father benwell the litter of books and manuscripts in the study was seen no more hideously rigid order reigned in the unused room some of romaynes papers had been burned others were imprisoned in drawers and cupboardsthe history of the origin of religions had taken its melancholy place among the suspended literary enterprises of the time mrs eyrecourt after a superficially cordial reconciliation with her soninlaw visited her daughter every now and then as an act of maternal sacrifice she yawned perpetually she read innumerable novels she corresponded with her friends in the long dull evenings the oncelively lady sometimes openly regretted that she had not been born a manwith the three masculine resources of smoking drinking and swearing placed at her disposal it was a dreary existence and happier influences seemed but little likely to change it grateful as she was to her mother no persuasion would induce stella to leave ten acres and amuse herself in london mrs eyrecourt said with melancholy and metaphorical truth there is no elasticity left in my child  on a dim gray morning mother and daughter sat by the fireside with another long day before them  where is that contemptible husband of yours mrs eyrecourt asked looking up from her book  lewis is staying in town stella answered listlessly  in company with judas iscariot  stella was too dull to immediately understand the allusion do you mean father benwell she inquired  dont mention his name my dear i have rechristened him on purpose to avoid it even his name humiliates me how completely the fawning old wretch took me inwith all my knowledge of the world too he was so nice and sympatheticsuch a comforting contrast on that occasion to you and your husbandi declare i forgot every reason i had for not trusting him ah we women are poor creatureswe may own it among ourselves if a man only has nice manners and a pleasant voice how many of us can resist him even romayne imposed upon meassisted by his property which in some degree excuses my folly there is nothing to be done now stella but to humor him do as that detestable priest does and trust to your beauty there isnt as much of it left as i could wish to turn the scale in your favor have you any idea when the new convert will come back i heard him ordering a fish dinner for himself yesterdaybecause it was friday did you join him at desserttime profanely supported by meat what did he say  what he has said more than once already mama his peace of mind is returning thanks to father benwell he was perfectly gentle and indulgentbut he looked as if he lived in a different world from mine he told me he proposed to pass a week in what he called retreat i didnt ask him what it meant whatever it is i suppose he is there now  my dear dont you remember your sister began in the same way she retreated we shall have romayne with a red nose and a double chin offering to pray for us next do you recollect that french maid of minethe woman i sent away because she would spit when she was out of temper like a cat i begin to think i treated the poor creature harshly when i hear of romayne and his retreat i almost feel inclined to spit myself there let us go on with your reading take the first volumei have done with it  what is it mama  a very remarkable work stella in the present state of light literature in englanda novel that actually tells a story its quite incredible i know try the book it has another extraordinary meritit isnt written by a woman  stella obediently received the first volume turned over the leaves and wearily dropped the wonderful novel on her lap i cant attend to it she said my mind is too full of my own thoughts  about romayne said her mother  no when i think of my husband now i almost wish i had his confidence in priests and retreats the conviction grows on me mama that my worst troubles are still to come when i was younger i dont remember being tormented by presentiments of any kind did i ever talk of presentiments to you in the bygone days  if you had done anything of the sort my love excuse me if i speak plainly i should have said stella your liver is out of order and i should have opened the family medicinechest i will only say now send for the carriage let us go to a morning concert dine at a restaurant and finish the evening at the play  this characteristic proposal was entirely thrown away on stella she was absorbed in pursuing her own train of thought i almost wish i had told lewis she said to herself absently  told him of what my dear  of what happened to me with winterfield  mrs eyrecourts faded eyes opened wide in astonishment  do you really mean it she asked  i do indeed  are you actually simple enough stella to think that a man of romaynes temper would have made you his wife if you had told him of the brussels marriage  why not  why not would romaynewould any manbelieve that you really did part from winterfield at the church door considering that you are a married woman your innocence my sweet child is a perfect phenomenon its well there were wiser people than you to keep your secret  dont speak too positively mama lewis may find it out yet  is that one of your presentiments  yes  how is he to find it out if you please  i am afraid through father benwell yes yes i know you only think him a fawning old hypocriteyou dont fear him as i do nothing will persuade me that zeal for his religion is the motive under which that man acts in devoting himself to romayne he has some abominable object in view and his eyes tell me that i am concerned in it  mrs eyrecourt burst out laughing  what is there to laugh at stella asked  i declare my dear there is something absolutely provoking in your utter want of knowledge of the world when you are puzzled to account for anything remarkable in a clergymans conduct i dont care my poor child to what denomination he belongs you cant be wrong in attributing his motive tomoney if romayne had turned baptist or methodist the reverend gentleman in charge of his spiritual welfare would not have forgottenas you have forgotten you little goosethat his convert was a rich man his mind would have dwelt on the chapel or the mission or the infant school in want of funds andwith no more abominable object in view than i have at this moment in poking the firehe would have ended in producing his modest subscription list and would have betrayed himself just as our odious benwell will betray himself by the two amiable little words please contribute is there any other presentiment my dear on which you would like to have your mothers candid opinion  stella resignedly took up the book again  i daresay you are right she said let us read our novel  before she had reached the end of the first page her mind was far away again from the unfortunate story she was thinking of that other presentiment which had formed the subject of her mothers last satirical inquiry the vague fear that had shaken her when she had accidentally touched the french boy on her visit to camps hill still from time to time troubled her memory even the event of his death had failed to dissipate the delusion which associated him with some undefined evil influence that might yet assert itself a superstitious forewarning of this sort was a weakness new to her in her experience of herself she was heartily ashamed of itand yet it kept its hold once more the book dropped on her lap she laid it aside and walked wearily to the window to look at the weather  almost at the same moment mrs eyrecourts maid disturbed her mistress over the second volume of the novel by entering the room with a letter  for me stella asked looking round from the window  no maamfor mrs eyrecourt  the letter had been brought to the house by one of lady lorings servants in delivering it he had apparently given private instructions to the maid she laid her finger significantly on her lips when she gave the letter to her mistress  in these terms lady loring wrote  if stella happens to be with you when you receive my note dont say anything which will let her know that i am your correspondent she has always poor dear had an inveterate distrust of father benwell and between ourselves i am not sure that she is quite so foolish as i once thought the father has unexpectedly left uswith a wellframed excuse which satisfied lord loring it fails to satisfy me not from any wonderful exercise of penetration on my part but in consequence of something i have just heard in course of conversation with a catholic friend father benwell my dear turns out to be a jesuit and what is more a person of such high authority in the order that his concealment of his rank while he was with us must have been a matter of necessity he must have had some very serious motive for occupying a position so entirely beneath him as his position in our house i have not the shadow of a reason for associating this startling discovery with dear stellas painful misgivingsand yet there is something in my mind which makes me want to hear what stellas mother thinks come and have a talk about it as soon as you possibly can  mrs eyrecourt put the letter in her pocket smiling quietly to herself  applying to lady lorings letter the infallible system of solution which she had revealed to her daughter mrs eyrecourt solved the mystery of the priests conduct without a moments hesitation lord lorings check in father benwells pocket representing such a liberal subscription that my lord was reluctant to mention it to my ladythere was the reading of the riddle as plain as the sun at noonday would it be desirable to enlighten lady loring as she had already enlightened stella mrs eyrecourt decided in the negative as roman catholics and as old friends of romayne the lorings naturally rejoiced in his conversion but as old friends also of romaynes wife they were bound not to express their sentiments too openly feeling that any discussion of the priests motives would probably lead to the delicate subject of the conversion mrs eyrecourt prudently determined to let the matter drop as a consequence of this decision stella was left without the slightest warning of the catastrophe which was now close at hand  mrs eyrecourt joined her daughter at the window  well my dear is it clearing up shall we take a drive before luncheon  if you like mama  she turned to her mother as she answered  the light of the clearing sky at once soft and penetrating fell full on her mrs eyrecourt looking at her as usual suddenly became serious she studied her daughters face with an eager and attentive scrutiny  do you see any extraordinary change in me stella asked with a faint smile  instead of answering mrs eyrecourt put her arm round stella with a loving gentleness entirely at variance with any ordinary expression of her character the worldly mothers eyes rested with a lingering tenderness on the daughters face stella she said softlyand stopped at a loss for words for the first time in her life  after a while she began again yes i see a change in you she whisperedan interesting change which tells me something can you guess what it is  stellas color rose brightly and faded again  she laid her head in silence on her mothers bosom worldly frivolous selfinterested mrs eyrecourts nature was the nature of a womanand the one great trial and triumph of a womans life appealing to her as a trial and a triumph soon to come to her own child touched fibers under the hardened surface of her heart which were still unprofaned my poor darling she said have you told the good news to your husband  no  why not  he doesnt care now for anything that i can tell him  nonsense stella you may win him back to you by a wordand do you hesitate to say the word i shall tell him  stella suddenly drew herself away from her mothers caressing arm if you do she cried no words can say how inconsiderate and how cruel i shall think you promiseon your word of honorpromise you will leave it to me  will you tell him yourselfif i leave it to you  yesat my own time promise  hush hush dont excite yourself my love i promise give me a kiss i declare i am agitated myself she exclaimed falling back into her customary manner such a shock to my vanity stellathe prospect of becoming a grandmother i really must ring for matilda and take a few drops of red lavender be advised by me my poor dear and we will turn the priest out of the house yet when romayne comes back from his ridiculous retreatafter his fasting and flagellation and heaven knows what besidesthen bring him to his senses then is the time to tell him will you think of it  yes i will think of it  and one word more before matilda comes in remember the vast importance of having a male heir to vange abbey on these occasions you may practice with perfect impunity on the ignorance of the men tell him youre sure its going to be a boy    chapter ii  the seed is sown  situated in a distant quarter of the vast western suburb of london the house called the retreat stood in the midst of a wellkept garden protected on all sides by a high brick wall excepting the grand gilt cross on the roof of the chapel nothing revealed externally the devotional purpose to which the roman catholic priesthood assisted by the liberality of the faithful had dedicated the building  but the convert privileged to pass the gates left protestant england outside and found himself as it were in a new country inside the retreat the paternal care of the church took possession of him surrounded him with monastic simplicity in his neat little bedroom and dazzled him with devotional splendor when his religious duties called him into the chapel the perfect tasteso seldom found in the modern arrangement and decoration of convents and churches in southern countriesshowed itself here pressed into the service of religion in every part of the house the severest discipline had no sordid and hideous side to it in the retreat the inmates fasted on spotless tablecloths and handled knives and forks the humble servants of halffilled stomachs without a speck on their decent brightness penitents who kissed the steps of the altar to use the expressive oriental phrase eat no dirt friends liberal friends permitted to visit the inmates on stated days saw copies of famous holy families in the receptionroom which were really works of art and trod on a carpet of studiously modest pretensions exhibiting pious emblems beyond reproach in color and design the retreat had its own artesian well not a person in the house drank impurity in his water a faint perfume of incense was perceptible in the corridors the soothing and mysterious silence of the place was intensified rather than disturbed by soft footsteps and gentle opening and closing of doors animal life was not even represented by a cat in the kitchen and yet pervaded by some inscrutable influence the house was not dull heretics with lively imaginations might have not inappropriately likened it to an enchanted castle in one word the catholic system here showed to perfection its masterly knowledge of the weakness of human nature and its inexhaustible dexterity in adapting the means to the end  on the morning when mrs eyrecourt and her daughter held their memorable interview by the fireside at ten acres father benwell entered one of the private rooms at the retreat devoted to the use of the priesthood the demure attendant waiting humbly for instructions was sent to request the presence of one of the inmates of the house named mortleman  father benwells customary serenity was a little ruffled on this occasion by an appearance of anxiety more than once he looked impatiently toward the door and he never even noticed the last new devotional publications laid invitingly on the table  mr mortleman made his appearancea young man and a promising convert the wild brightness of his eyes revealed that incipient form of brain disease which begins in fanaticism and ends not infrequently in religious madness his manner of greeting the priest was absolutely servile he cringed before the illustrious jesuit  father benwell took no notice of these demonstrations of humility be seated my son he said mr mortleman looked as if he would have preferred going down on his knees but he yielded and took a chair  i think you have been mr romaynes companion for a few days in the hours of recreation the priest began  yes father  does he appear to be at all weary of his residence in this house  oh far from it he feels the benign influence of the retreat we have had some delightful hours together  have you anything to report  mr mortleman crossed his hands on his breast and bowed profoundly i have to report of myself father that i have committed the sin of presumption i presumed that mr romayne was like myself not married  have i spoken to you on that subject  no father  then you have committed no sin you have only made an excusable mistake how were you led into error  in this way father mr romayne had been speaking to me of a book which you had been so good as to send to him he had been especially interested by the memoir therein contained of the illustrious englishman cardinal acton the degrees by which his eminence rose to the rank of a prince of the church seemed as i thought to have aroused in my friend a new sense of vocation he asked me if i myself aspired to belong to the holy priesthood i answered that this was indeed my aspiration if i might hope to be found worthy he appeared to be deeply affected i ventured to ask if he too had the same prospect before him he grieved me indescribably he sighed and said i have no such hope i am married tell me father i entreat you have i done wrong  father benwell considered for a moment did mr romayne say anything more he asked  no father  did you attempt to return to the subject  i thought it best to be silent  father benwell held out his hand my young friend you have not only done no wrongyou have shown the most commendable discretion i will detain you no longer from your duties go to mr romayne and say that i wish to speak with him  mr mortleman dropped on one knee and begged for a blessing father benwell lifted the traditional two fingers and gave the blessing the conditions of human happiness are easily fulfilled if we rightly understand them mr mortleman retired perfectly happy  left by himself again father benwell paced the room rapidly from end to end the disturbing influence visible in his face had now changed from anxiety to excitement ill try it today he said to himselfand stopped and looked round him doubtfully no not here he decided it may get talked about too soon it will be safer in every way at my lodgings he recovered his composure and returned to his chair  romayne opened the door  the double influence of the conversion and of the life in the retreat had already changed him his customary keenness and excitability of look had subsided and had left nothing in their place but an expression of suave and meditative repose all his troubles were now in the hands of his priest there was a passive regularity in his bodily movements and a beatific serenity in his smile  my dear friend said father benwell cordially shaking hands you were good enough to be guided by my advice in entering this house be guided by me again when i say that you have been here long enough you can return after an interval if you wish it but i have something to say to you firstand i beg to offer the hospitality of my lodgings  the time had been when romayne would have asked for some explanation of this abrupt notice of removal now he passively accepted the advice of his spiritual director father benwell made the necessary communication to the authorities and romayne took leave of his friends in the retreat the great jesuit and the great landowner left the place with becoming humility in a cab  i hope i have not disappointed you said father benwell  i am only anxious romayne answered to hear what you have to say    chapter iii  the harvest is reaped  on their way through the streets father benwell talked as persistently of the news of the day as if he had nothing else in his thoughts to keep his companions mind in a state of suspense was in certain emergencies to exert a useful preparatory influence over a man of romaynes character even when they reached his lodgings the priest still hesitated to approach the object that he had in view he made considerate inquiries in the character of a hospitable man  they breakfast early at the retreat he said what may i offer you  i want nothing thank you romayne answered with an effort to control his habitual impatience of needless delay  pardon mewe have a long interview before us i fear our bodily necessities romayne excuse me if i take the friendly liberty of suppressing the formal mrour bodily necessities are not to be trifled with a bottle of my famous claret and a few biscuits will not hurt either of us he rang the bell and gave the necessary directions another damp day he went on cheerfully i hope you dont pay the rheumatic penalties of a winter residence in england ah this glorious country would be too perfect if it possessed the delicious climate of rome  the wine and biscuits were brought in father benwell filled the glasses and bowed cordially to his guest  nothing of this sort at the retreat he said gayly excellent water i am toldwhich is a luxury in its way especially in london well my dear romayne i must begin by making my apologies you no doubt thought me a little abrupt in running away with you from your retirement at a moments notice  i believed that you had good reasons fatherand that was enough for me  thank youyou do me justiceit was in your best interests that i acted there are men of phlegmatic temperament over whom the wise monotony of discipline at the retreat exercises a wholesome influencei mean an influence which may be prolonged with advantage you are not one of those persons protracted seclusion and monotony of life are morally and mentally unprofitable to a man of your ardent disposition i abstained from mentioning these reasons at the time out of a feeling of regard for our excellent resident director who believes unreservedly in the institution over which he presides very good the retreat has done all that it could usefully do in your case we must think next of how to employ that mental activity which rightly developed is one of the most valuable qualities that you possess let me ask first if you have in some degree recovered your tranquillity  i feel like a different man father benwell  thats right and your nervous sufferingsi dont ask what they are i only want to know if you experience a sense of relief  a most welcome sense of relief romayne answered with a revival of the enthusiasm of other days the complete change in all my thoughts and convictions which i owe to you  and to dear penrose father benwell interposed with the prompt sense of justice which no man could more becomingly assume we must not forget arthur  forget him romayne repeated not a day passes without my thinking of him it is one of the happy results of the change in me that my mind does not dwell bitterly on the loss of him now i think of penrose with admiration as of one whose glorious life with all its dangers i should like to share  he spoke with a rising color and brightening eyes already the absorbent capacity of the roman church had drawn to itself that sympathetic side of his character which was also one of its strongest sides already his love for penrosehitherto inspired by the virtues of the manhad narrowed its range to sympathy with the trials and privileges of the priest truly and deeply indeed had the physician consulted in bygone days reasoned on romaynes case that occurrence of some new and absorbing influence in his life of which the doctor had spokenthat working of some complete change in his habits of thoughthad found its way to him at last after the wifes simple devotion had failed through the subtler ministrations of the priest  some men having father benwells object in view would have taken instant advantage of the opening offered to them by romaynes unguarded enthusiasm the illustrious jesuit held fast by the wise maxim which forbade him to do anything in a hurry  no he said your life must not be the life of our dear friend the service on which the church employs penrose is not the fit service for you you have other claims on us  romayne looked at his spiritual adviser with a momentary change of expressiona relapse into the ironical bitterness of the past time  have you forgotten that i am and can be only a layman he asked what claims can i have except the common claim of all faithful members of the church on the good offices of the priesthood he paused for a moment and continued with the abruptness of a man struck by a new idea yes i have perhaps one small aim of my ownthe claim of being allowed to do my duty  in what respect dear romayne  surely you can guess i am a rich man i have money lying idle which it is my duty and my privilege to devote to the charities and necessities of the church and while i am speaking of this i must own that i am a little surprised at your having said nothing to me on the subject you have never yet pointed out to me the manner in which i might devote my money to the best and noblest uses was it forgetfulness on your part  father benwell shook his head no he replied i cant honestly say that  then you had a reason for your silence  yes  may i not know it  father benwell got up and walked to the fireplace now there are various methods of getting up and walking to a fireplace and they find their way to outward expression through the customary means of look and manner we may feel cold and may only want to warm ourselves or we may feel restless and may need an excuse for changing our position or we may feel modestly confused and may be anxious to hide it father benwell from head to foot expressed modest confusion and polite anxiety to hide it  my good friend he said i am afraid of hurting your feelings  romayne was a sincere convert but there were instincts still left in him which resented this expression of regard even when it proceeded from a man whom he respected and admired you will hurt my feelings he answered a little sharply if you are not plain with me  then i will be plain with you father benwell rejoined the churchspeaking through me as her unworthy interpreterfeels a certain delicacy in approaching you on the subject of money  why  father benwell left the fireplace without immediately answering he opened a drawer and took out of it a flat mahogany box his gracious familiarity became transformed by some mysterious process of congelation into a dignified formality of manner the priest took the place of the man  the church mr romayne hesitates to receive as benevolent contributions money derived from property of its own arbitrarily taken from it and placed in a laymans hands no he cried interrupting romayne who instantly understood the allusion to vange abbeyno i must beg you to hear me out i state the case plainly at your own request at the same time i am bound to admit that the lapse of centuries has in the eye of the law sanctioned the deliberate act of robbery perpetrated by henry the eighth you have lawfully inherited vange abbey from your ancestors the church is not unreasonable enough to assert a merely moral right against the law of the country it may feel the act of spoliationbut it submits he unlocked the flat mahogany box and gently dropped his dignity the man took the place of the priest as the master of vange he said you may be interested in looking at a little historical curiosity which we have preserved the titledeeds dear romayne by which the monks held your present property in their time take another glass of wine  romayne looked at the titledeeds and laid them aside unread  father benwell had roused his pride his sense of justice his wild and lavish instincts of generosity he who had always despised moneyexcept when it assumed its only estimable character as a means for the attainment of merciful and noble endshe was in possession of property to which he had no moral right without even the poor excuse of associations which attached him to the place  i hope i have not offended you said father benwell  you have made me ashamed of myself romayne answered warmly on the day when i became a catholic i ought to have remembered vange better late than never i refuse to take shelter under the lawi respect the moral right of the church i will at once restore the property which i have usurped  father benwell took both romaynes hands in his and pressed them fervently  i am proud of you he said we shall all be proud of you when i write word to rome of what has passed between us butno romaynethis must not be i admire you feel with you and i refuse on behalf of the church i say iti refuse the gift  wait a little father benwell you dont know the state of my affairs i dont deserve the admiration which you feel for me the loss of the vange property will be no pecuniary loss in my case i have inherited a fortune from my aunt my income from that source is far larger than my income from the yorkshire property  romayne it must not be  pardon me it must be i have more money than i can spendwithout vange and i have painful associations with the house which disincline me ever to enter it again  even this confession failed to move father benwell he obstinately crossed his arms obstinately tapped his foot on the floor no he said plead as generously as you may my answer is no  romayne only became more resolute on his side the property is absolutely my own he persisted i am without a near relation in the world i have no children my wife is already provided for at my death out of the fortune left me by my aunt it is downright obstinacyforgive me for saying soto persist in your refusal  it is downright duty romayne if i gave way to you i should be the means of exposing the priesthood to the vilest misinterpretation i should be deservedly reprimanded and your proposal of restitutionif you expressed it in writingwould without a moments hesitation be torn up if you have any regard for me drop the subject  romayne refused to yield even to this unanswerable appeal  very well he said there is one document you cant tear up you cant interfere with my making another will i shall leave the vange property to the church and i shall appoint you one of the trustees you cant object to that  father benwell smiled sadly  the law spares me the ungracious necessity of objecting in this case he answered my friend you forget the statutes of mortmain they positively forbid you to carry out the intention which you have just expressed  romayne dismissed this appeal to the law irritably by waving his hand the statutes of mortmain he rejoined cant prevent my bequeathing my property to an individual i shall leave vange abbey to you now father benwell have i got the better of you at last  with christian humility the jesuit accepted the defeat for which he had paved the way from the outset of the interview at the same time he shuffled all personal responsibility off his own shoulders he had gained the victory for the churchwithout to do him justice thinking of himself  your generosity has conquered me he said but i must be allowed to clear myself of even the suspicion of an interested motive on the day when your will is executed i shall write to the general of our order at rome leaving my inheritance to him this proceeding will be followed by a deed in due form conveying the property to the church you have no objection to my taking that course no my dear romayne words are useless at such a time as this my acts shall speak for me i am too agitated to say more let us talk of something elselet us have some wine  he filled the glasses he offered more biscuitshe was really and even perceptibly agitated by the victory that he had won but one last necessity now confronted himthe necessity of placing a serious obstacle in the way of any future change of purpose on the part of romayne as to the choice of that obstacle father benwells mind had been made up for some time past  what was it i had to say to you he resumed surely i was speaking on the subject of your future life  you are very kind father benwell the subject has little interest for me my future life is shaped outdomestic retirement ennobled by religious duties  still pacing the room father benwell stopped at that reply and put his hand kindly on romaynes shoulder  we dont allow a good catholic to drift into domestic retirement who is worthy of better things he said the church romayne wishes to make use of you i never flattered any one in my life but i may say before your face what i have said behind your back a man of your strict sense of honorof your intellectof your high aspirationsof your personal charm and influenceis not a man whom we can allow to run to waste open your mind my friend fairly to me and i will open my mind fairly to you let me set the example i say it with authority an enviable future is before you  romaynes pale cheeks flushed with excitement what future he asked eagerly am i free to choose must i remind you that a man with a wife cannot think only of himself  suppose you were not a man with a wife  what do you mean  romayne i am trying to break my way through that inveterate reserve which is one of the failings in your character unless you can prevail on yourself to tell me those secret thoughts those unexpressed regrets which you can confide to no other man this conversation must come to an end is there no yearning in your inmost soul for anything beyond the position which you now occupy  there was a pause the flush on romaynes face faded away he was silent  you are not in the confessional father benwell reminded him with melancholy submission to circumstances you are under no obligation to answer me  romayne roused himself he spoke in low reluctant tones i am afraid to answer you he said  that apparently discouraging reply armed father benwell with the absolute confidence of success which he had thus far failed to feel he wound his way deeper and deeper into romaynes mind with the delicate ingenuity of penetration of which the practice of years had made him master  perhaps i have failed to make myself clearly understood he said i will try to put it more plainly you are no halfhearted man romayne what you believe you believe fervently impressions are not dimly and slowly produced on your mind as the necessary result your conversion being once accomplished your whole soul is given to the faith that is in you do i read your character rightly  so far as i know ityes  father benwell went on  bear in mind what i have just said he resumed and you will understand why i feel it my duty to press the question which you have not answered yet you have found in the catholic faith the peace of mind which you have failed to obtain by other means if i had been dealing with an ordinary man i should have expected from the change no happier result than this but i ask you has that blessed influence taken no deeper and nobler hold on your heart can you truly say to me i am content with what i have gained i wish for no more  i cannot truly say it romayne answered  the time had now come for speaking plainly father benwell no longer advanced to his end under cover of a cloud of words  a little while since he said you spoke of penrose as of a man whose lot in life you longed to share the career which has associated him with an indian mission is as i told you only adapted to a man of his special character and special gifts but the career which has carried him into the sacred ranks of the priesthood is open to every man who feels the sense of divine vocation which has made penrose one of us  no father benwell not open to every man  i say yes  it is not open to me  i say it is open to you and morei enjoin i command you to dismiss from your mind all merely human obstacles and discouragements they are beneath the notice of a man who feels himself called to the priesthood give me your hand romayne does your conscience tell you that you are that man  romayne started to his feet shaken to the soul by the solemnity of the appeal  i cant dismiss the obstacles that surround me he cried passionately to a man in my position your advice is absolutely useless the ties that bind me are beyond the limit of a priests sympathies  nothing is beyond the limit of a priests sympathies  father benwell i am married  father benwell folded his arms over his breastlooked with immovable resolution straight in romaynes faceand struck the blow which he had been meditating for months past  rouse your courage he said sternly you are no more married than i am    chapter iv  on the road to rome  there was not a sound in the room romayne stood looking at the priest  did you hear what i said father benwell asked  yes  do you understand that i really mean what i said  he made no replyhe waited like a man expecting to hear more  father benwell was alive to the vast importance at such a moment of not shrinking from the responsibility which he had assumed i see how i distress you he said but for your sake i am bound to speak out romayne the woman whom you have married is the wife of another man dont ask me how i know iti do know it you shall have positive proof as soon as you have recovered come rest a little in the easychair  he took romaynes arm and led him to the chair and made him drink some wine they waited a while romayne lifted his head with a heavy sigh  the woman whom i have married is the wife of another man he slowly repeated the words to himselfand then looked at father benwell  who is the man he asked  i introduced you to him when i was as ignorant of the circumstances as you are the priest answered the man is mr bernard winterfield  romayne half raised himself from the chair a momentary anger glittered in his eyes and faded out again extinguished by the nobler emotions of grief and shame he remembered winterfields introduction to stella  her husband he said speaking again to himself and she let me introduce him to her and she received him like a stranger he paused and thought of it the proofs if you please sir he resumed with sudden humility i dont want to hear any particulars it will be enough for me if i know beyond all doubt that i have been deceived and disgraced  father benwell unlocked his desk and placed two papers before romayne he did his duty with a grave indifference to all minor considerations the time had not yet come for expressions of sympathy and regret  the first paper he said is a certified copy of the register of the marriage of miss eyrecourt to mr winterfield celebrated as you will see by the english chaplain at brussels and witnessed by three persons look at the names  the brides mother was the first witness the two names that followed were the names of lord and lady loring they too in the conspiracy to deceive me romayne said as he laid the paper back on the table  i obtained that piece of written evidence father benwell proceeded by the help of a reverend colleague of mine residing at brussels i will give you his name and address if you wish to make further inquiries  quite needless what is this other paper  this other paper is an extract from the shorthand writers notes suppressed in the reports of the public journals of proceedings in an english court of law obtained at my request by my lawyer in london  what have i to do with it  he put the question in a tone of passive enduranceresigned to the severest moral martyrdom that could be inflicted on him  i will answer you in two words said father benwell in justice to miss eyrecourt i am bound to produce her excuse for marrying you  romayne looked at him in stern amazement  excuse he repeated  yesexcuse the proceedings to which i have alluded declare miss eyrecourts marriage to mr winterfield to be null and voidby the english lawin consequence of his having been married at the time to another woman try to follow me i will put it as briefly as possible in justice to yourself and to your future career you must understand this revolting case thoroughly from beginning to end  with those prefatory words he told the story of winterfields first marriage altering nothing concealing nothing doing the fullest justice to winterfields innocence of all evil motive from first to last when the plain truth served his purpose as it most assuredly did in this case the man has never yet been found who could match father benwell at stripping himself of every vestige of reserve and exhibiting his naked heart to the moral admiration of mankind  you were mortified and i was surprised he went on when mr winterfield dropped his acquaintance with you we now know that he acted like an honorable man  he waited to see what effect he had produced romayne was in no state of mind to do justice to winterfield or to any one his pride was mortally wounded his high sense of honor and delicacy writhed under the outrage inflicted on it  and mind this father benwell persisted poor human nature has its right to all that can be justly conceded in the way of excuse and allowance miss eyrecourt would naturally be advised by her friends would naturally be eager on her own part to keep hidden from you what happened at brussels a sensitive woman placed in a position so horribly false and degrading must not be too severely judged even when she does wrong i am bound to say thisand more speaking from my own knowledge of all the parties i have no doubt that miss eyrecourt and mr winterfield did really part at the church door  romayne answered by a lookso disdainfully expressive of the most immovable unbelief that it absolutely justified the fatal advice by which stellas worldlywise friends had encouraged her to conceal the truth father benwell prudently closed his lips he had put the case with perfect fairnesshis bitterest enemy could not have denied that  romayne took up the second paper looked at it and threw it back again on the table with an expression of disgust  you told me just now he said that i was married to the wife of another man and there is the judges decision releasing miss eyrecourt from her marriage to mr winterfield may i ask you to explain yourself  certainly let me first remind you that you owe religious allegiance to the principles which the church has asserted for centuries past with all the authority of its divine institution you admit that  i admit it  now listen in our church romayne marriage is even more than a religious institutionit is a sacrament we acknowledge no human laws which profane that sacrament take two examples of what i say when the great napoleon was at the height of his power pius the seventh refused to acknowledge the validity of the emperors second marriage to maria louisawhile josephine was living divorced by the french senate again in the face of the royal marriage act the church sanctioned the marriage of mrs fitzherbert to george the fourth and still declares in justice to her memory that she was the kings lawful wife in one word marriage to be marriage at all must be the object of a purely religious celebrationand this condition complied with marriage is only to be dissolved by death you remember what i told you of mr winterfield  yes his first marriage took place before the registrar  in plain english romayne mr winterfield and the womanrider in the circus pronounced a formula of words before a layman in an office that is not only no marriage it is a blasphemous profanation of a holy rite acts of parliament which sanction such proceedings are acts of infidelity the church declares it in defense of religion  i understand you said romayne mr winterfields marriage at brussels  which the english law father benwell interposed declares to be annulled by the marriage before the registrar stands good nevertheless by the higher law of the church mr winterfield is miss eyrecourts husband as long as they both live an ordained priest performed the ceremony in a consecrated buildingand protestant marriages so celebrated are marriages acknowledged by the catholic church under those circumstances the ceremony which afterward united you to miss eyrecourtthough neither you nor the clergyman were to blamewas a mere mockery need i to say any more shall i leave you for a while by yourself  no i dont know what i may think i dont know what i may do if you leave me by myself  father benwell took a chair by romaynes side it has been my hard duty to grieve and humiliate you he said do you bear me no ill will he held out his hand  romayne took itas an act of justice if not as an act of gratitude  can i be of any use in advising you father benwell asked  who can advise a man in my position romayne bitterly rejoined  i can at least suggest that you should take time to think over your position  time take time you talk as if my situation was endurable  everything is endurable romayne  it may be so to you father benwell did you part with your humanity when you put on the black robe of the priest  i parted my son with those weaknesses of our humanity on which women practice you talk of your position i will put it before you at its worst  for what purpose  to show you exactly what you have now to decide judged by the law of england mrs romayne is your wife judged by the principles held sacred among the religious community to which you belong she is not mrs romayneshe is mrs winterfield living with you in adultery if you regret your conversion  i dont regret it father benwell  if you renounce the holy aspirations which you have yourself acknowledged to me return to your domestic life but dont ask us while you are living with that lady to respect you as a member of our communion  romayne was silent the more violent emotions aroused in him had with time subsided into calm tenderness mercy past affection found their opportunity and pleaded with him the priests bold language had missed the object at which it aimed it had revived in romaynes memory the image of stella in the days when he had first seen her how gently her influence had wrought on him for good how tenderly how truly she had loved him give me some more wine he cried i feel faint and giddy dont despise me father benwelli was once so fond of her  the priest poured out the wine i feel for you he said indeed indeed i feel for you  it was not all a liethere were grains of truth in that outburst of sympathy father benwell was not wholly merciless his farseeing intellect his daring duplicity carried him straight on to his end in view but that end once gainedand let it be remembered not gained in this case wholly for himselfthere were compassionate impulses left in him which sometimes forced their way to the surface a man of high intelligencehowever he may misuse it however unworthy he may be of ithas a gift from heaven when you want to see unredeemed wickedness look for it in a fool  let me mention one circumstance father benwell proceeded which may help to relieve you for the moment in your present state of mind you cannot return to the retreat  impossible  i have had a room prepared for you in this house here free from any disturbing influence you can shape the future course of your life if you wish to communicate with your residence at highgate  dont speak of it  father benwell sighed ah i understand he said sadly the house associated with mr winterfields visit  romayne again interrupted himthis time by gesture only the hand that had made the sign clinched itself when it rested afterward on the table his eyes looked downward under frowning brows at the name of winterfield remembrances that poisoned every better influence in him rose venomously in his mind once more he loathed the deceit that had been practiced on him once more the detestable doubt of that asserted parting at the church door renewed its stealthy torment and reasoned with him as if in words she has deceived you in one thing why not in another  can i see my lawyer here he asked suddenly  my dear romayne you can see any one whom you like to invite  i shall not trouble you by staying very long father benwell  do nothing in a hurry my son pray do nothing in a hurry  romayne paid no attention to this entreaty shrinking from the momentous decision that awaited him his mind instinctively took refuge in the prospect of change of scene i shall leave england he said impatiently  not alone father benwell remonstrated  who will be my companion  i will the priest answered  romaynes weary eyes brightened faintly in his desolate position father benwell was the one friend on whom he could rely penrose was far away the lorings had helped to keep him deceived major hynd had openly pitied and despised him as a victim to priestcraft  can you go with me at any time he asked have you no duties that keep you in england  my duties romayne are already confided to other hands  then you have foreseen this  i have thought it possible your journey may be long or it may be shortyou shall not go away alone  i can think of nothing yet my mind is a blank romayne confessed sadly i dont know where i shall go  i know where you ought to goand where you will go said father benwell emphatically  where  to rome  romayne understood the true meaning of that brief reply a vague sense of dismay began to rise in his mind while he was still tortured by doubt it seemed as if father benwell had by some inscrutable process of prevision planned out his future beforehand had the priest foreseen events  nohe had only foreseen possibilities on the day when it first occurred to him that romaynes marriage was assailable before the court of romaynes conscience from the roman catholic point of view by this means the misfortune of romaynes marriage having preceded his conversion might be averted and the one certain obstacle in the way of any change of purpose on his partthe obstacle of the priesthoodmight still be set up by the voluntary separation of the husband from the wife thus far the jesuit had modestly described himself to his reverend colleagues as regarding his position toward romayne in a new light his next letter might boldly explain to them what he had really meant the triumph was won not a word more passed between his guest and himself that morning    before posttime on the same day father benwell wrote his last report to the secretary of the society of jesus in these lines  romayne is free from the domestic ties that bound him he leaves it to me to restore vange abbey to the church and he acknowledges a vocation for the priesthood expect us at rome in a fortnights time  after the story  extracts from bernard winterfields diary  i  winterfield defends himself  beaupark house june 17th 18  you and i cousin beeminster seldom meet but i occasionally hear of you from friends acquainted with both of us  i have heard of you last at sir philips rentday dinner a week since my name happened to be mentioned by one of the gentlemen present a guest like yourself you took up the subject of your own free will and spoke of me in these terms  i am sorry to say it of the existing head of the familybut bernard is really unfit for the position which he holds he has to say the least of it compromised himself and his relatives on more than one occasion he began as a young man by marrying a circusrider he got into some other scrape after that which he has contrived to keep a secret from us we only know how disgraceful it must have been by the resultshe was a voluntary exile from england for more than a year and now to complete the list he has mixed himself up in that miserable and revolting business of lewis romayne and his wife  if any other person had spoken of me in this manner i should have set him down as a mischievous idiotto be kicked perhaps but not to be noticed in any other way  with you the case is different if i die without male offspring the beaupark estate goes to you as next heir  i dont choose to let a man in this position slander me and those dear to me without promptly contradicting him the name i bear is precious to me in memory of my father your unanswered allusion to my relations with lewis romayne and his wife coming from a member of the family will be received as truth rather than let this be i reveal to you without reserve some of the saddest passages of my life i have nothing to be ashamed ofand if i have hitherto kept certain events in the dark it has been for the sake of others not for my own sake i know better now a womans reputationif she is a good womanis not easily compromised by telling the truth the person of whom i am thinking when i write this knows what i am going to doand approves of it  you will receive with these lines the most perfectly candid statement that i can furnish being extracts cut out of my own private diary they are accompanied where plain necessity seems to call for it by the written evidence of other persons  there has never been much sympathy between us but you have been brought up like a gentlemanand when you have read my narrative i expect that you will do justice to me and to otherseven though you think we acted indiscreetly under trying and critical circumstances  b w  ii  winterfield makes extracts  first extract  april 11th 1869mrs eyrecourt and her daughter have left beaupark today for london have i really made any impression on the heart of the beautiful stella in my miserable positionignorant whether i am free or noti have shrunk from formally acknowledging that i love her  12thi am becoming superstitious in the obituary of todays times the death is recorded of that unhappy woman whom i was mad enough to marry after hearing nothing of her for seven yearsi am free surely this is a good omen shall i follow the eyrecourts to london and declare myself i have not confidence enough in my own power of attraction to run the risk better to write first in strictest confidence to mrs eyrecourt  14than enchanting answer from my angels mother written in great haste they are on the point of leaving for paris stella is restless and dissatisfied she wants change of scene and mrs eyrecourt adds in so many wordsit is you who have upset her why did you not speak while we were at beaupark i am to hear again from paris good old father newbliss said all along that she was fond of me and wondered like mrs eyrecourt why i failed to declare myself how could i tell them of the hideous fetters which bound me in those days  18th parisshe has accepted me words are useless to express my happiness  19tha letter from my lawyer full of professional subtleties and delays i have no patience to enumerate them we move to belgium tomorrow not on our way back to englandstella is so little desirous of leaving the continent that we are likely to be married abroad but she is weary of the perpetual gayety and glitter of paris and wants to see the old belgian cities her mother leaves paris with regret the liveliest woman of her age that i ever met with  brussels may 7my blessing on the old belgian cities mrs eyrecourt is so eager to get away from them that she backs me in hurrying the marriage and even consents sorely against the grain to let the wedding be celebrated at brussels in a private and unpretending way she has only stipulated that lord and lady loring old friends shall be present they are to arrive tomorrow and two days afterward we are to be married    an inclosure is inserted in this place it consists of the deathbed confession of mr winterfields wife and of the explanatory letter written by the rector of belhaven the circumstances related in these documents already known to the reader are left to speak for themselves and the extracts from the diary are then continued    bingen on the rhine may 19letters from devonshire at last which relieve my wretchedness in some small degree the frightful misfortune at brussels will at least be kept secret so far as i am concerned beaupark house is shut up and the servants are dismissed in consequence of my residence abroad to father newbliss i have privately written not daring to tell him the truth i leave him to infer that my marriage engagement has been broken off he writes back a kind and comforting letter time will i suppose help me to bear my sad lot perhaps a day may come when stella and her friends will know how cruelly they have wronged me  london november 18 1860the old wound has been opened again i met her accidentally in a picture gallery she turned deadly pale and left the place oh stella stella  london august 12 1861another meeting with her and another shock to endure which i might not have suffered if i had been a reader of the marriage announcements in the newspapers like other men i am in the habit of leaving the marriage announcements to the women  i went to visit an agreeable new acquaintance mr romayne his wife drove up to the house while i was looking out of window i recognized stella after two years she has made use of the freedom which the law has given to her i must not complain of that or of her treating me like a stranger when her husband innocently introduced us but when are were afterward left together for a few minutesno i cannot write down the merciless words she said to me why am i fool enough to be as fond of her as ever  beaupark november 16stellas married life is not likely to be a happy one todays newspaper announces the conversion of her husband to the roman catholic faith i can honestly say i am sorry for her knowing how she has suffered among her own relatives by these conversions but i so hate him that this proof of his weakness is a downright consolation to me  beaupark january 27 1862a letter from stella so startling and deplorable that i cannot remain away from her after reading it her husband has deliberately deserted her he has gone to rome to serve his term of probation for the priesthood i travel to london by todays train  london january 27short as it is i looked at stellas letter again and again on the journey the tone of the closing sentences is still studiously cold after informing me that she is staying with her mother in london she concludes her letter in these terms  be under no fear that the burden of my troubles will be laid on your shoulders since the fatal day when we met at ten acres you have shown forbearance and compassion toward me i dont stop to inquire if you are sincereit rests with you to prove that but i have some questions to ask which no person but you can answer for the rest my friendless position will perhaps plead with you not to misunderstand me may i write again  inveterate distrust in every sentence if any other woman had treated me in this way i should have put her letter into the fire and should not have stirred from my comfortable house  january 29a day missed out of my diary the events of yesterday unnerved me for the time  arriving at derwents hotel on the evening of the 27th i sent a line to stella by messenger to ask when she could receive me  it is strange how the merest trifles seem to touch women her note in reply contains the first expression of friendly feeling toward me which has escaped her since we parted at brussels and this expression proceeds from her ungovernable surprise and gratitude at my taking the trouble to travel from devonshire to london on her account  for the rest she proposed to call on me at the hotel the next morning she and her mother it appeared differed in opinion on the subject of mr romaynes behavior to her and she wished to see me in the first instance unrestrained by mrs eyrecourts interference  there was little sleep for me that night i passed most of the time in smoking and walking up and down the room my one relief was afforded by travelerhe begged so hard to go to london with me i could not resist him the dog always sleeps in my room his surprise at my extraordinary restlessness ending in downright anxiety and alarm was expressed in his eyes and in his little whinings and cries quite as intelligibly as if he had put his meaning into words who first called a dog a dumb creature it must have been a man i thinkand a thoroughly unlovable man too from a dogs point of view  soon after ten on the morning of the 28th she entered my sittingroom  in her personal appearance i saw a change for the worse produced i suppose by the troubles that have tried her sorely poor thing there was a sad loss of delicacy in her features and of purity in her complexion even her dressi should certainly not have noticed it in any other womanseemed to be loose and slovenly in the agitation of the moment i forgot the long estrangement between us i half lifted my hand to take hers and checked myself was i mistaken in supposing that she yielded to the same impulse and resisted it as i did she concealed her embarrassment if she felt any by patting the dog  i am ashamed that you should have taken the journey to london in this wintry weather she began  it was impossible in her situation to let her assume this commonplace tone with me i sincerely feel for you i said and sincerely wish to help you if i can  she looked at me for the first time did she believe me or did she still doubt before i could decide she took a letter from her pocket opened it and handed it to me  women often exaggerate their troubles she said it is perhaps an unfair trial of your patiencebut i should like you to satisfy yourself that i have not made the worst of my situation that letter will place it before you in mr romaynes own words read it except where the page is turned down  it was her husbands letter of farewell  the language was scrupulously delicate and considerate but to my mind it entirely failed to disguise the fanatical cruelty of the mans resolution addressed to his wife in substance it came to this  he had discovered the marriage at brussels which she had deliberately concealed from him when he took her for his wife she had afterward persisted in that concealment under circumstances which made it impossible that he could ever trust her again this no doubt referred to her illadvised reception of me as a total stranger at ten acres lodge in the miserable breakup of his domestic life the church to which he now belonged offered him not only her divine consolation but the honor above all earthly distinctions of serving the cause of religion in the sacred ranks of the priesthood before his departure for rome he bade her a last farewell in this world and forgave her the injuries that she had inflicted on him for her sake he asked leave to say some few words more in the first place he desired to do her every justice in a worldly sense ten acres lodge was offered to her as a free gift for her lifetime with a sufficient income for all her wants in the second place he was anxious that she should not misinterpret his motives whatever his opinion of her conduct might be he did not rely on it as affording his only justification for leaving her setting personal feeling aside he felt religious scruples connected with his marriage which left him no other alternative than the separation on which he had resolved he would briefly explain those scruples and mention his authority for entertaining them before he closed his letter  there the page was turned down and the explanation was concealed from me  a faint color stole over her face as i handed the letter back to her  it is needless for you to read the end she said you know under his own hand that he has left me and if such a thing pleads with you in his favor you also know that he is liberal in providing for his deserted wife  i attempted to speak she saw in my face how i despised him and stopped me  whatever you may think of his conduct she continued i beg that you will not speak of it to me may i ask your opinion now you have read his letter on another matter in which my own conduct is concerned in former days  she paused poor soul in evident confusion and distress  why speak of those days i ventured to say  i must speak of them in former days i think you were told that my fathers will provided for my mother and for me you know that we have enough to live on  i had heard of it at the time of our betrothalwhen the marriage settlement was in preparation the mother and daughter had each a little income of a few hundreds a year the exact amount had escaped my memory  after answering her to this effect i waited to hear more  she suddenly became silent the most painful embarrassment showed itself in her face and manner never mind the rest she said mastering her confusion after an interval i have had some hard trials to bear i forget things she made an effort to finish the sentence and gave it up and called to the dog to come to her the tears were in her eyes and that was the way she took to hide them from me  in general i am not quick at reading the minds of othersbut i thought i understood stella now that we were face to face the impulse to trust me had for the moment got the better of her caution and her pride she was half ashamed of it half inclined to follow it i hesitated no longer the time for which i had waitedthe time to prove without any indelicacy on my side that i had never been unworthy of herhad surely come at last  do you remember my reply to your letter about father benwell i asked  yesevery word of it  i promised if you ever had need of me to prove that i had never been unworthy of your confidence in your present situation i can honorably keep my promise shall i wait till you are calmer or shall i go on at once  at once  when your mother and your friends took you from me i resumed if you had shown any hesitation  she shuddered the image of my unhappy wife vindictively confronting us on the church steps seemed to be recalled to her memory dont go back to it she cried spare me i entreat you  i opened the writingcase in which i keep the papers sent to me by the rector of belhaven and placed them on the table by which she was sitting the more plainly and briefly i spoke now the better i thought it might be for both of us  since we parted at brussels i said my wife has died here is a copy of the medical certificate of her death  stella refused to look at it i dont understand such things she answered faintly what is this  she took up my wifes deathbed confession  read it i said  she looked frightened what will it tell me she asked  it will tell you stella that false appearances once led you into wronging an innocent man  having said this i walked away to a window behind her at the further end of the room so that she might not see me while she read  after a timehow much longer it seemed to be than it really wasi heard her move as i turned from the window she ran to me and fell on her knees at my feet i tried to raise her i entreated her to believe that she was forgiven she seized my hands and held them over her facethey were wet with her tears i am ashamed to look at you she said oh bernard what a wretch i have been  i never was so distressed in my life i dont know what i should have said what i should have done if my dear old dog had not helped me out of it he too ran up to me with the loving jealousy of his race and tried to lick my hands still fast in stellas hold his paws were on her shoulder he attempted to push himself between us i think i successfully assumed a tranquillity which i was far from really feeling come come i said you mustnt make traveler jealous she let me raise her ah if she could have kissed mebut that was not to be done she kissed the dogs head and then she spoke to me i shall not set down what she said in these pages while i live there is no fear of my forgetting those words  i led her back to her chair the letter addressed to me by the rector of belhaven still lay on the table unread it was of some importance to stellas complete enlightenment as containing evidence that the confession was genuine but i hesitated for her sake to speak of it just yet  now you know that you have a friend to help and advise you i began  no she interposed more than a friend say a brother  i said it you had something to ask of me i resumed and you never put the question  she understood me  i meant to tell you she said that i had written a letter of refusal to mr romaynes lawyers i have left ten acres never to return and i refuse to accept a farthing of mr romaynes money my motherthough she knows that we have enough to live ontells me i have acted with inexcusable pride and folly i wanted to ask if you blame me bernard as she does  i daresay i was inexcusably proud and foolish too it was the second time she had called me by my christian name since the happy bygone time never to come again under whatever influence i acted i respected and admired her for that refusal and i owned it in so many words this little encouragement seemed to relieve her she was so much calmer that i ventured to speak of the rectors letter  she wouldnt hear of it oh bernard have i not learned to trust you yet put away those papers there is only one thing i want to know who gave them to you the rector  no  how did they reach you then  through father benwell  she started at that name like a woman electrified  i knew it she cried it is the priest who has wrecked my married lifeand he got his information from those letters before he put them into your hands she waited a while and recovered herself that was the first of the questions i wanted to put to you she said i am answered i ask no more  she was surely wrong about father benwell i tried to show her why  i told her that my reverend friend had put the letters into my hand with the seal which protected them unbroken she laughed disdainfully did i know him so little as to doubt for a moment that he could break a seal and replace it again this view was entirely new to me i was startled but not convinced i never desert my friendseven when they are friends of no very long standingand i still tried to defend father benwell the only result was to make her alter her intention of asking me no more questions i innocently roused in her a new curiosity she was eager to know how i had first become acquainted with the priest and how he had contrived to possess himself of papers which were intended for my reading only  there was but one way of answering her  it was far from easy to a man like myself unaccustomed to state circumstances in their proper orderbut i had no other choice than to reply by telling the long story of the theft and discovery of the rectors papers so far as father benwell was concerned the narrative only confirmed her suspicions for the rest the circumstances which most interested her were the circumstances associated with the french boy  anything connected with that poor creature she said has a dreadful interest for me now  did you know him i asked with some surprise  i knew him and his motheryou shall hear how at another time i suppose i felt a presentiment that the boy would have some evil influence over me at any rate when i accidentally touched him i trembled as if i had touched a serpent you will think me superstitiousbut after what you have said it is certainly true that he has been the indirect cause of the misfortune that has fallen on me how came he to steal the papers did you ask the rector when you went to belhaven  i asked the rector nothing but he thought it his duty to tell me all that he knew of the theft  she drew her chair nearer to me let me hear every word of it she pleaded eagerly  i felt some reluctance to comply with the request  is it not fit for me to hear she asked  this forced me to be plain with her if i repeat what the rector told me i said i must speak of my wife  she took my hand you have pitied and forgiven her she answered speak of her bernardand dont for gods sake think that my heart is harder than yours  i kissed the hand that she had given to meeven her brother might do that  it began i said in the grateful attachment which the boy felt for my wife he refused to leave her bedside on the day when she dictated her confession to the rector as he was entirely ignorant of the english language there seemed to be no objection to letting him have his own way he became inquisitive as the writing went on his questions annoyed the rectorand as the easiest way of satisfying his curiosity my wife told him that she was making her will he knew just enough from what he had heard at various times to associate making a will with gifts of moneyand the pretended explanation silenced and satisfied him  did the rector understand it stella asked  yes like many other englishmen in his position although he was not ready at speaking french he could read the language and could fairly well understand it when it was spoken after my wifes death he kindly placed the boy for a few days under the care of his housekeeper her early life had been passed in the island of martinique and she was able to communicate with the friendless foreigner in his own language when he disappeared she was the only person who could throw any light on his motive for stealing the papers on the day when he entered the house she caught him peeping through the keyhole of the study door he must have seen where the confession was placed and the color of the oldfashioned blue paper on which it was written would help him to identify it the next morning during the rectors absence he brought the manuscript to the housekeeper and asked her to translate it into french so that he might know how much money was left to him in the will she severely reproved him made him replace the paper in the desk from which he had taken it and threatened to tell the rector if his misconduct was repeated he promised amendment and the goodnatured woman believed him on that evening the papers were sealed and locked up in the morning the lock was found broken and the papers and the boy were both missing together  do you think he showed the confession to any other person stella asked i happen to know that he concealed it from his mother  after the housekeepers reproof i replied he would be cunning enough in my opinion not to run the risk of showing it to strangers it is far more likely that he thought he might learn english enough to read it himself  there the subject dropped we were silent for a while she was thinking and i was looking at her on a sudden she raised her head her eyes rested on me gravely  it is very strange she said  what is strange  i have been thinking of the lorings they encouraged me to doubt you they advised me to be silent about what happened at brussels and they too are concerned in my husbands desertion of me he first met father benwell at their house her head drooped again her next words were murmured to herself i am still a young woman she said oh god what is my future to be  this morbid way of thinking distressed me i reminded her that she had dear and devoted friends  not one she answered but you  have you not seen lady loring i asked  she and her husband have written most kindly inviting me to make their house my home i have no right to blame themthey meant well but after what has happened i cant go back to them  i am sorry to hear it i said  are you thinking of the lorings she asked  i dont even know the lorings i can think of nobody but you  i was still looking at herand i am afraid my eyes said more than my words if she had doubted it before she must have now known that i was as fond of her as ever she looked distressed rather than confused i made an awkward attempt to set myself right  surely your brother may speak plainly i pleaded  she agreed to this but nevertheless she rose to gowith a friendly word intended as i hoped to show me that i had got my pardon for that time will you come and see us tomorrow she said can you forgive my mother as generously as you have forgiven me i will take care bernard that she does you justice at last  she held out her hand to take leave how could i reply if i had been a resolute man i might have remembered that it would be best for me not to see too much of her but i am a poor weak creaturei accepted her invitation for the next day  january 30i have just returned from my visit  my thoughts are in a state of indescribable conflict and confusionand her mother is the cause of it i wish i had not gone to the house am i a bad man i wonder and have i only found it out now  mrs eyrecourt was alone in the drawingroom when i went in judging by the easy manner in which she got up to receive me the misfortune that has befallen her daughter seemed to have produced no sobering change in this frivolous woman  my dear winterfield she began i have behaved infamously i wont say that appearances were against you at brusselsi will only say i ought not to have trusted to appearances you are the injured person please forgive me shall we go on with the subject or shall we shake hands and say no more about it  i shook hands of course mrs eyrecourt perceived that i was looking for stella  sit down she said and be good enough to put up with no more attractive society than mine unless i set things straight my good friend you and my daughteroh with the best intentionswill drift into a false position you wont see stella today quite impossibleand i will tell you why i am the worldly old mother i dont mind what i say my innocent daughter would die before she would confess what i am going to tell you can i offer you anything have you had lunch  i begged her to continue she perplexedi am not sure that she did not even alarm me  very well she proceeded you may be surprised to hear itbut i dont mean to allow things to go on in this way my contemptible soninlaw shall return to his wife  this startled me and i suppose i showed it  wait a little said mrs eyrecourt there is nothing to be alarmed about romayne is a weak fool and father benwells greedy hands are of course in both his pockets but he has unless i am entirely mistaken some small sense of shame and some little human feeling still left after the manner in which he has behaved these are the merest possibilities you will say very likely i have boldly appealed to those possibilities nevertheless he has already gone away to rome and i need hardly addfather benwell would take good care of thathe has left us no address it doesnt in the least matter one of the advantages of being so much in society as i am is that i have nice acquaintances everywhere always ready to oblige me provided i dont borrow money of them i have written to romayne under cover to one of my friends living in rome wherever he may be there my letter will find him  so far i listened quietly enough naturally supposing that mrs eyrecourt trusted to her own arguments and persuasions i confess it even to myself with shame it was a relief to me to feel that the chances with such a fanatic as romayne were a hundred to one against her  this unworthy way of thinking was instantly checked by mrs eyrecourts next words  dont suppose that i am foolish enough to attempt to reason with him she went on my letter begins and ends on the first page his wife has a claim on him which no newlymarried man can resist let me do him justice he knew nothing of it before he went away my lettermy daughter has no suspicion that i have written ittells him plainly what the claim is  she paused her eyes softened her voice sank lowshe became quite unlike the mrs eyrecourt whom i knew  in a few months more winterfield she said my poor stella will be a mother my letter calls romayne back to his wifeand his child  mrs eyrecourt paused evidently expecting me to offer an opinion of some sort for the moment i was really unable to speak stellas mother never had a very high opinion of my abilities she now appeared to consider me the stupidest person in the circle of her acquaintance  are you a little deaf winterfield she asked  not that i know of  do you understand me  oh yes  then why cant you say something i want a mans opinion of our prospects good gracious how you fidget put yourself in romaynes place and tell me this if you had left stella  i should never have left her mrs eyrecourt  be quiet you dont know what you would have done i insist on your supposing yourself to be a weak superstitious conceited fanatical fool you understand now tell me then could you keep away from your wife when you were called back to her in the name of your firstborn child could you resist that  most assuredly not  i contrived to reply with an appearance of tranquillity it was not very easy to speak with composure envious selfish contemptibleno language is too strong to describe the turn my thoughts now took i never hated any human being as i hated romayne at that moment damn him he will come back there was my inmost feeling expressed in words  in the meantime mrs eyrecourt was satisfied she dashed at the next subject as fluent and as confident as ever  now winterfield it is surely plain to your mind that you must not see stella againexcept when i am present to tie the tongue of scandal my daughters conduct must not allow her husbandif you only knew how i detest that manmust not i say allow her husband the slightest excuse for keeping away from her if we give that odious old jesuit the chance he will make a priest of romayne before we know where we are the audacity of these papists is really beyond belief you remember how they made bishops and archbishops here in flat defiance of our laws father benwell follows that example and sets our other laws at defiancei mean our marriage laws i am so indignant i cant express myself as clearly as usual did stella tell you that he actually shook romaynes belief in his own marriage ah i understandshe kept that to herself poor dear and with good reason too  i thought of the turneddown page in the letter mrs eyrecourt readily revealed what her daughters delicacy had forbidden me to readincluding the monstrous assumption which connected my marriage before the registrar with her soninlaws scruples  yes she proceeded these catholics are all alike my daughteri dont mean my sweet stella i mean the unnatural creature in the nunnerysets herself above her own mother did i ever tell you she was impudent enough to say she would pray for me father benwell and the papal aggression over again now tell me winterfield dont you think taking the circumstances into considerationthat you will act like a thoroughly sensible man if you go back to devonshire while we are in our present situation what with footwarmers in the carriage and newspapers and magazines to amuse you it isnt such a very long journey and then beauparkdear beauparkis such a remarkably comfortable house in the winter and you you enviable creature are such a popular man in the neighborhood oh go back go back  i got up and took my hat she patted me on the shoulder i could have throttled her at that moment and yet she was right  you will make my excuses to stella i said  you dear good fellow i will do more than make your excuses i will sing your praisesas the poet says in her ungovernable exultation at having got rid of me she burst into extravagant language i feel like a mother to you she went on as we shook hands at parting i declare i could almost let you kiss me  there was not a single kissable place about mrs eyrecourt unpainted undyed or unpowdered i resisted temptation and opened the door there was still one last request that i could not help making  will you let me know i said when you hear from rome  with the greatest pleasure mrs eyrecourt answered briskly goodby you best of friendsgoodby  i write these lines while the servant is packing my portmanteau traveler knows what that means my dog is glad at any rate to get away from london i think i shall hire a yacht and try what a voyage round the world will do for me i wish to god i had never seen stella  second extract  beaupark february 10news at last from mrs eyrecourt  romayne has not even read the letter that she addressed to himit has actually been returned to her by father benwell mrs eyrecourt writes naturally enough in a state of fury her one consolation under this insulting treatment is that her daughter knows nothing of the circumstances she warns me quite needlessly to keep the secretand sends me a copy of father benwells letter  dear madammr romayne can read nothing that diverts his attention from his preparation for the priesthood or that recalls past associations with errors which he has renounced forever when a letter reaches him it is his wise custom to look at the signature first he has handed your letter to me unreadwith a request that i will return it to you in his presence i instantly sealed it up neither he nor i know or wish to know on what subject you have addressed him we respectfully advise you not to write again  this is really too bad but it has one advantage so far as i am concerned it sets my own unworthy doubts and jealousies before me in a baser light than ever how honestly i defended father benwell and how completely he has deceived me i wonder whether i shall live long enough to see the jesuit caught in one of his own traps  11thi was disappointed at not hearing from stella yesterday this morning has made amends it has brought me a letter from her  she is not well and her mothers conduct sadly perplexes her at one time mrs eyrecourts sense of injury urges her to indulge in violent measuresshe is eager to place her deserted daughter under the protection of the law to insist on a restitution of conjugal rights or on a judicial separation at another time she sinks into a state of abject depression declares that it is impossible for her in stellas deplorable situation to face society and recommends immediate retirement to some place on the continent in which they can live cheaply this latter suggestion stella is not only ready but eager to adopt she proves it by asking for my advice in a postscript no doubt remembering the happy days when i courted her in paris and the many foreign friends of mine who called at our hotel  the postscript gave me the excuse that i wanted i knew perfectly well that it would be better for me not to see herand i went to london for the sole purpose of seeing her by the first train  london february 12i found mother and daughter together in the drawingroom it was one of mrs eyrecourts days of depression her little twinkling eyes tried to cast on me a look of tragic reproach she shook her dyed head and said oh winterfield i didnt think you would have done thisstella fetch me my smelling bottle  but stella refused to take the hint she almost brought the tears into my eyes she received me so kindly if her mother had not been in the roombut her mother was in the room i had no other choice than to enter on my business as if i had been the family lawyer  mrs eyrecourt began by reproving stella for asking my advice and then assured me that she had no intention of leaving london how am i to get rid of my house she asked irritably enough i knew that her house as she called it was the furnished upper part of a house belonging to another person and that she could leave it at a short notice but i said nothing i addressed myself to stella  i have been thinking of two or three places which you might like i went on the nearest place belongs to an old french gentleman and his wife they have no children and they dont let lodgings but i believe they would be glad to receive friends of mine if their spare rooms are not already occupied they live at st germainclose to paris  i looked at mrs eyrecourt as i said those last wordsi was as sly as father benwell himself paris justified my confidence the temptation was too much for her she not only gave way but actually mentioned the amount of rent which she could afford to pay stella whispered her thanks to me as i went out my name is not mentioned but my misfortune is alluded to in the newspapers she said wellmeaning friends are calling and condoling with me already i shall die if you dont help me to get away among strangers  i start for paris by the mail train tonight  paris february 13it is evening i have just returned from st germain everything is settledwith more slyness on my part i begin to think i am a born jesuit there must have been some detestable sympathy between father benwell and me  my good friends monsieur and madame villeray will be only too glad to receive english ladies known to me for many years the spacious and handsome first floor of their house inherited from once wealthy ancestors by madame villeray can be got ready to receive mrs eyrecourt and her daughter in a weeks time our one difficulty related to the question of money monsieur villeray living on a government pension was modestly unwilling to ask terms and i was too absolutely ignorant of the subject to be of the slightest assistance to him it ended in our appealing to a houseagent at st germain his estimate appeared to me to be quite reasonable but it exceeded the pecuniary limit mentioned by mrs eyrecourt i had known the villerays long enough to be in no danger of offending them by proposing a secret arrangement which permitted me to pay the difference so that difficulty was got over in due course of time  we went into the large garden at the back of the house and there i committed another act of duplicity  in a nice sheltered corner i discovered one of those essentially french buildings called a pavilion a delightful little toy house of three rooms another private arrangement made me the tenant of this place madame villeray smiled i bet you she said to me in her very best english one of these ladies is in her fascinating first youth the good lady little knows what a hopeless love affair mine is i must see stella sometimesi ask and hope for no more never have i felt how lonely my life is as i feel it now  third extract  london march 1stella and her mother have set forth on their journey to st germain this morning without allowing me as i had hoped and planned to be their escort  mrs eyrecourt set up the old objection of the claims of propriety if that were the only obstacle in my way i should have set it aside by following them to france where is the impropriety of my seeing stella as her friend and brotherespecially when i dont live in the same house with her and when she has her mother on one side and madame villeray on the other to take care of her  no the influence that keeps me away from st germain is the influence of stella herself  i will write to you often she said but i beg you for my sake not to accompany us to france her look and tone reduced me to obedience stupid as i am i think after what passed between me and her mother i can guess what she meant  am i never to see you again i asked  do you think i am hard and ungrateful she answered do you doubt that i shall be glad more than glad to see you when  she turned away from me and said no more  it was time to take leave we were under her mothers superintendence we shook hands and that was all  matilda mrs eyrecourts maid followed me downstairs to open the door i suppose i looked as i felt wretchedly enough the good creature tried to cheer me dont be anxious about them she said i am used to traveling sirand ill take care of them she is a woman to be thoroughly depended on a faithful and attached servant i made her a little present at parting and i asked her if she would write to me from time to time  some people might consider this to be rather an undignified proceeding on my part i can only say it came naturally to me i am not a dignified man and when a person means kindly toward me i dont ask myself whether that person is higher or lower richer or poorer than i am we are to my mind on the same level when the same sympathy unites us matilda was sufficiently acquainted with all that had passed to foresee as i did that there would be certain reservations in stellas letters to me you shall have the whole truth from me sir dont doubt it she whispered i believed her when my heart is sore give me a woman for my friend whether she is lady or ladysmaid she is equally precious to me  cowes march 2i am in treaty with an agent for the hire of a yacht  i must do something and go somewhere returning to beaupark is out of the question people with tranquil minds can find pleasure in the society of their country neighbors i am a miserable creature with a mind in a state of incessant disturbance excellent fathers of families talking politics to me exemplary mothers of families offering me matrimonial opportunities with their daughtersthat is what society means if i go back to devonshire no i will go for a cruise in the mediterranean and i will take one friend with me whose company i never weary ofmy dog  the vessel is discovereda fine schooner of three hundred tons just returned from a cruise to madeira the sailingmaster and crew only ask for a few days on shore in that time the surveyor will have examined the vessel and the stores will be on board  march 3i have written to stella with a list of addresses at which letters will reach me and i have sent another list to my faithful ally the maid when we leave gibraltar our course will be to naplesthence to civita vecchia leghorn genoa marseilles from any of those places i am within easy traveling distance of st germain  march 7 at seait is halfpast six in the evening we have just passed the eddystone lighthouse with the wind abeam the log registers ten knots an hour  fourth extract  naples may 10the fair promise at the beginning of my voyage has not been fulfilled owing to contrary winds storms and delays at cadiz in repairing damages we have only arrived at naples this evening under trying circumstances of all sorts the yacht has behaved admirably a stouter and finer seaboat never was built  we are too late to find the postoffice open i shall send ashore for letters the first thing tomorrow morning my next movements will depend entirely on the news i get from st germain if i remain for any length of time in these regions i shall give my crew the holiday they have well earned at civita vecchia i am never weary of romebut i always did and always shall dislike naples  may 11 my plans are completely changed i am annoyed and angry the further i get away from france the better i shall be pleased  i have heard from stella and heard from the maid both letters inform me that the child is born and that it is a boy do they expect me to feel any interest in the boy he is my worst enemy before he is out of his longclothes  stella writes kindly enough not a line in her letter however invites me or holds out the prospect of inviting me to st germain she refers to her mother very briefly merely informing me that mrs eyrecourt is well and is already enjoying the gayeties of paris threefourths of the letter are occupied with the baby when i wrote to her i signed myself yours affectionately stella signs yours sincerely it is a trifle i daresaybut i feel it for all that  matilda is faithful to her engagement matildas letter tells me the truth  since the birth of the baby she writes mrs romayne has never once mentioned your name she can talk of nothing and think of nothing but her child i make every allowance i hope for a lady in her melancholy situation but i do think it is not very grateful to have quite forgotten mr winterfield who has done so much for her and who only asks to pass a few hours of his day innocently in her society perhaps being a single woman i write ignorantly about mothers and babies but i have my feelings and though i never liked mr romayne i feel for you sirif you will forgive the familiarity in my opinion this new craze about the baby will wear out he is already a cause of difference of opinion my good mistress who possesses knowledge of the world and a kind heart as well advises that mr romayne should be informed of the birth of a son and heir mrs eyrecourt says most truly that the hateful old priest will get possession of mr romaynes property to the prejudice of the child unless steps are taken to shame him into doing justice to his own son but mrs romayne is as proud as lucifer she will not hear of making the first advances as she calls it the man who has deserted me she says has no heart to be touched either by wife or child my mistress does not agree with her there have been hard words already and the nice old french gentleman and his wife try to make peace you will smile when i tell you that they offer sugarplums as a sort of composing gift my mistress accepts the gift and has been to the theater at paris with monsieur and madame villeray more than once already to conclude sir if i might venture to advise you i should recommend trying the effect on mrs r of absence and silence  a most sensibly written letter i shall certainly take matildas advice my name is never mentioned by stellaand not a day has passed without my thinking of her  well i suppose a man can harden his heart if he likes let me harden my heart and forget her  the crew shall have three days ashore at naples and then we sail for alexandria in that port the yacht will wait my return i have not yet visited the cataracts of the nile i have not yet seen the magnificent mousecolored women of nubia a tent in the desert and a dusky daughter of nature to keep house for methere is a new life for a man who is weary of the vapid civilization of europe i shall begin by letting my beard grow  fifth extract  civita vecchia february 28 1863back again on the coast of italyafter an absence at sea and ashore of nine months  what have my travels done for me they have made me browner and thinner they have given me a more patient mind and a taste for mild tobacco have they helped me to forget stella not the least in the worldi am more eager than ever to see her again when i look back at my diary i am really ashamed of my own fretfulness and impatience what miserable vanity on my part to expect her to think of me when she was absorbed in the first cares and joys of maternity especially sacred to her poor soul as the one consolation of her melancholy life i withdraw all that i wrote about herand from the bottom of my heart i forgive the baby  rome march 1i have found my letters waiting for me at the office of my banker  the latest news from st germain is all that i could wish in acknowledging the receipt of my last letter from cairo i broke my rash vow of silence when we got into port after leaving naples stella sends me the long desired invitation pray take care to return to us dear bernard before the first anniversary of my boys birthday on the twentyseventh of march after those words she need feel no apprehension of my being late at my appointment travelerthe dog has well merited his name by this timewill have to bid goodby to the yacht which he loves and journey homeward by the railway which he hates no more risk of storms and delays for me goodby to the sea for one while  i have sent the news of my safe return from the east by telegraph but i must not be in too great a hurry to leave rome or i shall commit a serious errori shall disappoint stellas mother  mrs eyrecourt writes to me earnestly requesting if i return by way of italy that i will get her some information about romayne she is eager to know whether they have made him a priest yet i am also to discover if i can what are his prospectswhether he is as miserable as he deserves to bewhether he has been disappointed in his expectations and is likely to be brought back to his senses in that wayand above all whether father benwell is still at rome with him my idea is that mrs eyrecourt has not given up her design of making romayne acquainted with the birth of his son  the right person to apply to for information is evidently my banker he has been a resident in rome for twenty yearsbut he is too busy a man to be approached by an idler like myself in business hours i have asked him to dine with me tomorrow  march 2my guest has just left me i am afraid mrs eyrecourt will be sadly disappointed when she hears what i have to tell her  the moment i mentioned romaynes name the banker looked at me with an expression of surprise the man most talked about in rome he said i wonder you have not heard of him already  is he a priest  certainly and what is more the ordinary preparations for the priesthood were expressly shortened by high authority on his account the pope takes the greatest interest in him and as for the people the italians have already nicknamed him the young cardinal dont suppose as some of our countrymen do that he is indebted to his wealth for the high position which he has already attained his wealth is only one of the minor influences in his favor the truth is he unites in himself two opposite qualities both of the greatest value to the church which are very rarely found combined in the same man he has already made a popular reputation here as a most eloquent and convincing preacher  a preacher i exclaimed and a popular reputation how do the italians understand him  the banker looked puzzled  why shouldnt they understand a man who addresses them in their own language he said romayne could speak italian when he came hereand since that time he has learned by constant practice to think in italian while our roman season lasts he preaches alternately in italian and in english but i was speaking of the two opposite accomplishments which this remarkable man possesses out of the pulpit he is capable of applying his mind successfully to the political necessities of the church as i am told his intellect has had severe practical training by means of historical studies in the past years of his life anyhow in one of the diplomatic difficulties here between the church and the state he wrote a memorial on the subject which the cardinalsecretary declared to be a model of ability in applying the experience of the past to the need of the present time if he doesnt wear himself out his italian nickname may prove prophetically true we may live to see the new convert cardinal romayne  are you acquainted with him yourself i asked  no englishman is acquainted with him the banker answered there is a report of some romantic event in his life which has led to his leaving england and which makes him recoil from intercourse with his own nation whether this is true or false it is certain that the english in rome find him unapproachable i have even heard that he refuses to receive letters from england if you wish to see him you must do what i have doneyou must go to church and look at him in the pulpit he preaches in englishi think for the last time this seasonon thursday evening next shall i call here and take you to the church  if i had followed my inclinations i should have refused i feel no sort of interest in romaynei might even say i feel a downright antipathy toward him but i have no wish to appear insensible to the bankers kindness and my reception at st germain depends greatly on the attention i show to mrs eyrecourts request so it was arranged that i should hear the great preacherwith a mental reservation on my part which contemplated my departure from the church before the end of his sermon  but before i see him i feel assured of one thingespecially after what the banker has told me stellas view of his character is the right one the man who has deserted her has no heart to be touched by wife or child they are separated forever  march 3i have just seen the landlord of the hotel he can help me to answer one of mrs eyrecourts questions a nephew of his holds some employment at the jesuit headquarters here adjoining their famous church il gesu i have requested the young man to ascertain if father benwell is still in romewithout mentioning me it would be no small trial to my selfcontrol if we met in the street  march 4good news this time for mrs eyrecourt as far as it goes father benwell has long since left rome and has returned to his regular duties in england if he exercises any further influence over romayne it must be done by letter  march 5i have returned from romaynes sermon this double renegadehas he not deserted his religion and his wifehas failed to convince my reason but he has so completely upset my nerves that i ordered a bottle of champagne to the great amusement of my friend the banker the moment we got back to the hotel  we drove through the scantily lighted streets of rome to a small church in the neighborhood of the piazza navona to a more imaginative man than myself the scene when we entered the building would have been too impressive to be described in wordsthough it might perhaps have been painted the one light in the place glimmered mysteriously from a great wax candle burning in front of a drapery of black cloth and illuminating dimly a sculptured representation in white marble of the crucified christ wrought to the size of life in front of this ghastly emblem a platform projected also covered with black cloth we could penetrate no further than to the space just inside the door of the church everywhere else the building was filled with standing sitting and kneeling figures shadowy and mysterious fading away in far corners into impenetrable gloom the only sounds were the low wailing notes of the organ accompanied at intervals by the muffled thump of fanatic worshipers penitentially beating their breasts on a sudden the organ ceased the selfinflicted blows of the penitents were heard no more in the breathless silence that followed a man robed in black mounted the black platform and faced the congregation his hair had become prematurely gray his face was of the ghastly paleness of the great crucifix at his side the light of the candle falling on him as he slowly turned his head cast shadows into the hollows of his cheeks and glittered in his gleaming eyes in tones low and trembling at first he stated the subject of his address a week since two noteworthy persons had died in rome on the same day one of them was a woman of exemplary piety whose funeral obsequies had been celebrated in that church the other was a criminal charged with homicide under provocation who had died in prison refusing the services of the priestimpenitent to the last the sermon followed the spirit of the absolved woman to its eternal reward in heaven and described the meeting with dear ones who had gone before in terms so devout and so touching that the women near us and even some of the men burst into tears far different was the effect produced when the preacher filled with the same overpowering sincerity of belief which had inspired his description of the joys of heaven traced the downward progress of the lost man from his impenitent deathbed to his doom in hell the dreadful superstition of everlasting torment became doubly dreadful in the priests fervent words he described the retributive voices of the mother and the brother of the murdered man ringing incessantly in the ears of the homicide i who speak to you hear the voices he cried assassin assassin where are you i see himi see the assassin hurled into his place in the sleepless ranks of the damnedi see him dripping with the flames that burn forever writhing under the torments that are without respite and without end the climax of this terrible effort of imagination was reached when he fell on his knees and prayed with sobs and cries of entreatyprayed pointing to the crucifix at his sidethat he and all who heard him might die the death of penitent sinners absolved in the divinely atoning name of christ the hysterical shrieks of women rang through the church i could endure it no longer i hurried into the street and breathed again freely when i looked up at the cloudless beauty of the night sky bright with the peaceful radiance of the stars  and this man was romayne i had last met with him among his delightful works of art an enthusiast in literature the hospitable master of a house filled with comforts and luxuries to its remotest corner and now i had seen what rome had made of him  yes said my companion the ancient church not only finds out the men who can best serve it but develops qualities in those men of which they have been themselves unconscious the advance which roman catholic christianity has been and is still making has its intelligible reason thanks to the great reformation the papal scandals of past centuries have been atoned for by the exemplary lives of servants of the church in high places and low places alike if a new luther arose among us where would he now find abuses sufficiently wicked and widely spread to shock the sense of decency in christendom he would find them nowhereand he would probably return to the respectable shelter of the roman sheepfold  i listened without making any remark to tell the truth i was thinking of stella  march 6i have been to civita vecchia to give a little farewell entertainment to the officers and crew before they take the yacht back to england  in a few words i said at parting i mentioned that it was my purpose to make an offer for the purchase of the vessel and that my guests should hear from me again on the subject this announcement was received with enthusiasm i really like my crewand i dont think it is vain in me to believe that they return the feeling from the sailingmaster to the cabinboy my future life after all that has passed is likely to be a roving life unlessno i may think sometimes of that happier prospect but i had better not put my thoughts into words i have a fine vessel i have plenty of money and i like the sea there are three good reasons for buying the yacht  returning to rome in the evening i found waiting for me a letter from stella  she writes immediately on the receipt of my telegram to make a similar request to the request addressed to me by her mother now that i am at rome she too wants to hear news of a jesuit priest he is absent on a foreign mission and his name is penrose you shall hear what obligations i owe to his kindness she writes when we meet in the meantime i will only say that he is the exact opposite of father benwell and that i should be the most ungrateful of women if i did not feel the truest interest in his welfare  this is strange and to my mind not satisfactory who is penrose and what has he done to deserve such strong expressions of gratitude if anybody had told me that stella could make a friend of a jesuit i am afraid i should have returned a rude answer well i must wait for further enlightenment and apply to the landlords nephew once more  march 7there is small prospect i fear of my being able to appreciate the merits of mr penrose by personal experience he is thousands of miles away from europe and he is in a situation of peril which makes the chance of his safe return doubtful in the last degree  the mission to which he is attached was originally destined to find its field of work in central america rumors of more fighting to come in that revolutionary part of the world reached rome before the missionaries had sailed from the port of leghorn under these discouraging circumstances the priestly authorities changed the destination of the mission to the territory of arizona bordering on new mexico and recently purchased by the united states here in the valley of santa cruz the jesuits had first attempted the conversion of the indian tribes two hundred years since and had failed their missionhouse and chapel are now a heap of ruins and the ferocious apache indians keep the fertile valley a solitude by the mere terror of their name to this illomened place penrose and his companions have made their daring pilgrimage and they are now risking their lives in the attempt to open the hearts of these bloodthirsty savages to the influence of christianity nothing has been yet heard of them at the best no trustworthy news is expected for months to come  what will stella say to this anyhow i begin to understand her interest in penrose now he is one of a company of heroes i am already anxious to hear more of him  tomorrow will be a memorable day in my calendar tomorrow i leave rome for st germain  if any further information is to be gained for mrs eyrecourt and her daughter i have made the necessary arrangements for receiving it the banker has promised to write to me if there is a change in romaynes life and prospects and my landlord will take care that i hear of it in the event of news reaching rome from the mission at arizona  sixth extract  st germain march 14i arrived yesterday between the fatigue of the journey and the pleasurable agitation caused by seeing stella again i was unfit to make the customary entry in my diary when i retired for the night  she is more irresistibly beautiful than ever her figure a little too slender as i remember it has filled out her lovely face has lost its haggard careworn look her complexion has recovered its delicacy i see again in her eyes the pure serenity of expression which first fascinated me years since it may be due to the consoling influence of the childassisted perhaps by the lapse of time and the peaceful life which she now leadsbut this at least is certain such a change for the better i never could have imagined as the change i find in stella after a years absence  as for the baby he is a bright goodhumored little fellow and he has one great merit in my estimationhe bears no resemblance to his father i saw his mothers features when i first took him on my knee and looked at his face lifted to mine in grave surprise the baby and i are certain to get on well together  even mrs eyrecourt seems to have improved in the french air and under the french diet she has a better surface to lay the paint on her nimble tongue runs faster than ever and she has so completely recovered her good spirits that monsieur and madame villeray declare she must have french blood in her veins they were all so unaffectedly glad to see me matilda included that it was really like returning to ones home as for traveler i must interfere in the interests of his figure and his health to prevent everybody in the house from feeding him with every eatable thing from plain bread to pate de foie gras  my experience of today will as stella tells me be my general experience of the family life at st germain  we begin the morning with the customary cup of coffee at eleven oclock i am summoned from my pavilion of three rooms to one of those delicious and artfully varied breakfasts which are only to be found in france and in scotland an interval of about three hours follows during which the child takes his airing and his siesta and his elders occupy themselves as they please at three oclock we all go outwith a pony chaise which carries the weaker members of the householdfor a ramble in the forest at six oclock we assemble at the dinnertable at coffee time some of the neighbors drop in for a game at cards at ten we all wish each other goodnight  such is the domestic programme varied by excursions in the country and by occasional visits to paris i am naturally a man of quiet stayathome habits it is only when my mind is disturbed that i get restless and feel longings for change surely the quiet routine at st germain ought to be welcome to me now i have been looking forward to this life through a long year of travel what more can i wish for  nothing more of course  and yetand yetstella has innocently made it harder than ever to play the part of her brother the recovery of her beauty is a subject for congratulation to her mother and her friends how does it affect me  i had better not think of my hard fate can i help thinking of it can i dismiss from memory the unmerited misfortunes which have taken from me in the prime of her charms the woman whom i love at least i can try  the good old moral must be my moral be content with such things as ye have  march 15it is eight in the morningand i hardly know how to employ myself having finished my coffee i have just looked again at my diary  it strikes me that i am falling into a bad habit of writing too much about myself the custom of keeping a journal certainly has this drawbackit encourages egotism well the remedy is easy from this date i lock up my bookonly to open it again when some event has happened which has a claim to be recorded for its own sake as for myself and my feelings they have made their last appearance in these pages  seventh extract  june 7the occasion for opening my diary once more has presented itself this morning  news has reached me of romayne which is too important to be passed over without notice he has been appointed one of the popes chamberlains it is also reported on good authority that he will be attached to a papal embassy when a vacancy occurs these honors present and to come seem to remove him further than ever from the possibility of a return to his wife and child  june 8in regard to romayne mrs eyrecourt seems to be of my opinion  being in paris today at a morning concert she there met with her old friend doctor wybrow the famous physician is suffering from overwork and is on his way to italy for a few months of rest and recreation they took a drive together after the performance in the bois de boulogne and mrs eyrecourt opened her mind to the doctor as freely as usual on the subject of stella and the child he entirely agreed speaking in the future interests of the boy that precious time has been lost in informing romayne of the birth of an heir and he has promised no matter what obstacles may be placed in his way to make the announcement himself when he reaches rome  june 9madame villeray has been speaking to me confidentially on a very delicate subject  i am pledged to discontinue writing about myself but in these private pages i may note the substance of what my good friend said to me if i only look back often enough at this little record i may gather the resolution to profit by her advice in brief these were her words  stella has spoken to me in confidence since she met you accidentally in the garden yesterday she cannot be guilty of the poor affectation of concealing what you must have already discovered for yourself but she prefers to say the words that must be said to you through me her husbands conduct to her is an outrage that she can never forget she now looks back with sentiments of repulsion which she dare not describe to that love at first sight as you call it in england conceived on the day when they first metand she remembers regretfully that other love of years since which was love of steadier and slower growth to her shame she confesses that she failed to set you the example of duty and selfrestraint when you two happened to be alone yesterday she leaves it to my discretion to tell you that you must see her for the future always in the presence of some other person make no reference to this when you next meet and understand that she has only spoken to me instead of to her mother because she fears that mrs eyrecourt might use harsh words and distress you again as she once distressed you in england if you will take my advice you will ask permission to go away again on your travels  it matters nothing what i said in reply let me only relate that we were interrupted by the appearance of the nursemaid at the pavilion door  she led the child by the hand among his first efforts at speaking under his mothers instruction had been the effort to call me uncle bernard he had now got as far as the first syllable of my christian name and he had come to me to repeat his lesson resting his little hands on my knees he looked up at me with his mothers eyes and said uncle ber a trifling incident but at that moment it cut me to the heart i could only take the boy in my arms and look at madame villeray the good woman felt for me i saw tears in her eyes  no no more writing about myself i close the book again  eighth extract  july 3a letter has reached mrs eyrecourt this morning from doctor wybrow it is dated castel gandolpho near rome here the doctor is established during the hot monthsand here he has seen romayne in attendance on the holy father in the famous summer palace of the popes how he obtained the interview mrs eyrecourt is not informed to a man of his celebrity doors are no doubt opened which remain closed to persons less widely known  i have performed my promise he writes and i may say for myself that i spoke with every needful precaution the result a little startled me romayne was not merely unprepared to hear of the birth of his childhe was physically and morally incapable of sustaining the shock of the disclosure for the moment i thought he had been seized with a fit of catalepsy he moved however when i tried to take his hand to feel the pulseshrinking back in his chair and feebly signing to me to leave him i committed him to the care of his servant the next day i received a letter from one of his priestly colleagues informing me that he was slowly recovering after the shock that i had inflicted and requesting me to hold no further communication with him either personally or by letter i wish i could have sent you a more favorable report of my interference in this painful matter perhaps you or your daughter may hear from him  july 49no letter has been received mrs eyrecourt is uneasy stella on the contrary seems to be relieved  july 10a letter has arrived from london addressed to stella by romaynes english lawyers the income which mrs romayne has refused for herself is to be legally settled on her child technical particulars follow which it is needless to repeat here  by return of post stella has answered the lawyers declaring that so long as she lives and has any influence over her son he shall not touch the offered income mrs eyrecourt monsieur and madame villerayand even matildaentreated her not to send the letter to my thinking stella acted with becoming spirit though there is no entail still vange abbey is morally the boys birthrightit is a cruel wrong to offer him anything else  july 11for the second time i have proposed to leave st germain the presence of the third person whenever i am in her company is becoming unendurable to me she still uses her influence to defer my departure nobody sympathizes with me she said but you  i am failing to keep my promise to myself not to write about myself but there is some little excuse this time for the relief of my own conscience i may surely place it on record that i have tried to do what is right it is not my fault if i remain at st germain insensible to madame villerays warning  ninth extract  september 13terrible news from rome of the jesuit mission to arizona  the indians have made a night attack on the new missionhouse the building is burned to the ground and the missionaries have been massacredwith the exception of two priests carried away captive the names of the priests are not known news of the atrocity has been delayed four months on its way to europe owing partly to the civil war in the united states and partly to disturbances in central america  looking at the times which we receive regularly at st germain i found this statement confirmed in a short paragraphbut here also the names of the two prisoners failed to appear  our one present hope of getting any further information seems to me to depend on our english newspaper the times stands alone as the one public journal which has the whole english nation for volunteer contributors in their troubles at home they appeal to the editor in their travels abroad over civilized and savage regions alike if they meet with an adventure worth mentioning they tell it to the editor if any one of our countrymen knows anything of this dreadful massacre i foresee with certainty where we shall find the information in print  soon after my arrival here stella had told me of her memorable conversation with penrose in the garden at ten acres lodge i was well acquainted with the nature of her obligation to the young priest but i was not prepared for the outbreak of grief which escaped her when she had read the telegram from rome she actually went the length of saying i shall never enjoy another happy moment till i know whether penrose is one of the two living priests  the inevitable third person with us this morning was monsieur villeray sitting at the window with a book in his handsometimes reading sometimes looking at the garden with the eye of a fond horticulturisthe discovered a strange cat among his flower beds forgetful of every other consideration the old gentleman hobbled out to drive away the intruder and left us together  i spoke to stella in words which i would now give everything i possess to recall a detestable jealousy took possession of me i meanly hinted that penrose could claim no great merit in the matter of romaynes conversion for yielding to the entreaties of a beautiful woman who had fascinated him though he might be afraid to own it she protested against my unworthy insinuationbut she failed to make me ashamed of myself is a woman ever ignorant of the influence which her beauty exercises over a man i went on like the miserable creature that i was from bad to worse  excuse me i said if i have unintentionally made you angry i ought to have known that i was treading on delicate ground your interest in penrose may be due to a warmer motive than a sense of obligation  she turned away from mesadly not angrilyintending as it appeared to leave the room in silence arrived at the door she altered her mind and came back  even if you insult me bernard i am not able to resent it she said very gently i once wronged youi have no right to complain of your now wronging me i will try to forget it  she held out her hand she raised her eyesand looked at me  it was not her fault i alone am to blame in another moment she was in my arms i held her to my breasti felt the quick beating of her heart on mei poured out the wild confession of my sorrow my shame my lovei tasted again and again and again the sweetness of her lips she put her arms round my neck and drew her head back with a long sigh be merciful to my weakness she whispered we must meet no more  she pushed me back from her with a trembling hand and left the room  i have broken my resolution not to write about myselfbut there is no egotism there is a sincere sense of humiliation in me when i record this confession of misconduct i can make but one atonementi must at once leave st germain now when it is too late i feel how hard for me this life of constant repression has been  thus far i had written when the nursemaid brought me a little note addressed in pencil no answer was required  the few lines were in stellas handwriting you must not leave us too suddenly or you may excite my mothers suspicions wait until you receive letters from england and make them the pretext for your departures  i never thought of her mother she is right even if she were wrong i must obey her  september 14the letters from england have arrived one of them presents me with the necessary excuse for my departure ready made my proposal for the purchase of the yacht is accepted the sailingmaster and crew have refused all offers of engagement and are waiting at cowes for my orders here is an absolute necessity for my return to england  the newspaper arrived with the letters my anticipations have been realized yesterdays paragraph has produced another volunteer contributor an englishman just returned from central america after traveling in arizona writes to the times he publishes his name and addressand he declares that he has himself seen the two captive priests  the name of this correspondent carries its own guarantee with it he is no less a person than mr murthwaitethe wellknown traveler in india who discovered the lost diamond called the moonstone set in the forehead of a hindoo idol he writes to the editor as follows  siri can tell you something of the two jesuit priests who were the sole survivors of the massacre in the santa cruz valley four months since  i was traveling at the time in arizona under the protection of an apache chief bribed to show me his country and his nation instead of cutting my throat and tearing off my scalp by a present tribute of whisky and gunpowder and by the promise of more when our association came to an end  about twelve miles northward of the little silvermining town of tubac we came upon an apache encampment i at once discovered two white men among the indians these were the captive priests  one of them was a frenchman named lherbier the other was an englishman named penrose they owed their lives to the influence of two powerful considerations among the indians unhappy lherbier lost his senses under the horror of the night massacre insanity as you may have heard is a sacred thing in the estimation of the american savages they regard this poor madman as a mysteriously inspired person the other priest penrose had been in charge of the mission medicinechest and had successfully treated cases of illness among the apaches as a great medicineman he too is a privileged personunder the strong protection of their interest in their own health the lives of the prisoners are in no danger provided they can endure the hardship of their wandering existence among the indians penrose spoke to me with the resignation of a true hero i am in the hands of god he said and if i die i die in gods service  i was entirely unprovided with the means of ransoming the missionariesand nothing that i could say or that i could promise had the smallest effect on the savages but for severe and tedious illness i should long since have been on my way back to arizona with the necessary ransom as it is i am barely strong enough to write this letter but i can head a subscription to pay expenses and i can give instructions to any person who is willing to attempt the deliverance of the priests  so the letter ended  before i had read it i was at a loss to know where to go or what to do when i leave st germain i am now at no loss i have found an object in life and a means of making atonement to stella for my own ungracious and unworthy words already i have communicated by telegraph with mr murthwaite and with my sailingmaster the first is informed that i hope to be with him in london tomorrow morning the second is instructed to have the yacht fitted out immediately for a long voyage if i can save these menespecially penrosei shall not have lived in vain  london september 15no i have resolution enough to go to arizona but i have no courage to record the parting scene when it was time to say goodby  i had intended to keep the coming enterprise a secret and only to make the disclosure in writing when the vessel was ready to sail but after reading the letter to the times stella saw something in my face as i suppose that betrayed me well its over now i do my best to keep myself from thinking of itand for this reason i abstain from dwelling on the subject here  mr murthwaite has not only given me valuable instructionshe has provided me with letters of introduction to persons in office and to the padres or priests in mexico which will be of incalculable use in such an expedition as mine in the present disturbed condition of the united states he recommends me to sail for a port on the eastern coast of mexico and then to travel northward overland and make my first inquiries in arizona at the town of tubac time is of such importance in his opinion that he suggests making inquiries in london and liverpool for a merchant vessel under immediate sailing orders for vera cruz or tampico the fitting out of the yacht cannot be accomplished i find in less than a fortnight or three weeks i have therefore taken mr murthwaites advice  september 16no favorable answer so far as the port of london is concerned very little commerce with mexico and bad harbors in that country when you do trade such is the report  september 17a mexican brig has been discovered at liverpool under orders for vera cruz but the vessel is in debt and the date of departure depends on expected remittances in this state of things i may wait with my conscience at ease to sail in comfort on board my own schooner  september 1830i have settled my affairs i have taken leave of my friends good mr murthwaite included i have written cheerfully to stella and i sail from portsmouth tomorrow well provided with the jars of whisky and the kegs of gunpowder which will effect the release of the captives  it is strange considering the serious matters i have to think of but it is also true that i feel out of spirits at the prospect of leaving england without my traveling companion the dog i am afraid to take the dear old fellow with me on such a perilous expedition as mine may be stella takes care of himand if i dont live to return she will never part with him for his masters sake it implies a childish sort of mind i supposebut it is a comfort to me to remember that i have never said a hard word to traveler and never lifted my hand on him in anger  all this about a dog and not a word about stella not a word those thoughts are not to be written  i have reached the last page of my diary i shall lock it and leave it in charge of my bankers on my way to the portsmouth train shall i ever want a new diary superstitious people might associate this coming to the end of the book with coming to an end of another kind i have no imagination and i take my leap in the dark hopefullywith byrons glorious lines in my mind       heres a sigh to those who love me      and a smile to those that hate      and whatever skys above met      heres heart for every fate    an inclosure is inserted here marking a lapse of seven months before the entries in the diary are resumed it consists of two telegrams dispatched respectively on the 1st and 2d of may 1864  1 from bernard winterfield portsmouth england to mrs romayne care of m villeray st germain near parispenrose is safe on board my yacht his unfortunate companion has died of exhaustion and he is himself in a feeble state of health i at once take him with me to london for medical advice we are eager for news of you telegraph to derwents hotel  2 from mrs eyrecourt st germain to bernard winterfield derwents hotel londonyour telegram received with joy and sent on to stella in paris all well but strange events have happened if you cannot come here at once go to lord loring he will tell you everything  tenth extract  london 2d may 1864mrs eyrecourts telegram reached me just after doctor wybrow had paid his first professional visit to penrose at the hotel i had hardly time to feel relieved by the opinion of the case which he expressed before my mind was upset by mrs eyrecourt leaving penrose under the charge of our excellent landlady i hurried away to lord loring  it was still early in the day his lordship was at home he maddened me with impatience by apologizing at full length for the inexcusable manner in which he had misinterpreted my conduct on the deplorable occasion of the marriage ceremony at brussels i stopped his flow of words very earnestly spoken it is only right to add and entreated him to tell me in the first place what stella was doing in paris  stella is with her husband lord loring replied  my head turned giddy my heart beat furiously lord loring looked at meran to the luncheon table in the next roomand returned with a glass of wine i really dont know whether i drank the wine or not i know i stammered out another inquiry in one word  reconciled i said  yes mr winterfieldreconciled before he dies  we were both silent for a while  what was he thinking of i dont know what was i thinking of i darent write it down  lord loring resumed by expressing some anxiety on the subject of my health i made the best excuse for myself that i could and told him of the rescue of penrose he had heard of my object in leaving england and heartily congratulated me this will be welcome news indeed he said to father benwell  even the name of father benwell now excites my distrust is he in paris too i inquired  he left paris last night lord loring answered and he is now in london on important business as i understand connected with romaynes affairs  i instantly thought of the boy  is romayne in possession of his faculties i asked  in complete possession  while justice is in his power has he done justice to his son  lord loring looked a little confused i have not heard was all he said in reply  i was far from satisfied you are one of romaynes oldest friends i persisted have you not seen him yourself  i have seen him more than once but he has never referred to his affairs having said this he hastily changed the subject is there any other information that i can give you he suggested  i had still to learn under what circumstances romayne had left italy for france and how the event of his illness in paris had been communicated to his wife lord loring had only to draw on his own recollections to enlighten me  lady loring and i passed the last winter in rome he said and there we saw romayne you look surprised perhaps you are aware that we had offended him by advice which we thought it our duty to offer to stella before her marriage  i was certainly thinking of what stella had said of the lorings on the memorable day when she visited me at the hotel  romayne would probably have refused to receive us lord loring resumed but for the gratifying circumstance of my having been admitted to an interview with the pope the holy father spoke of him with the most condescending kindness and hearing that i had not yet seen him gave instructions commanding romayne to present himself under these circumstances it was impossible for him to refuse to receive lady loring and myself on a later occasion i cannot tell you how distressed we were at the sad change for the worse in his personal appearance the italian physician whom he occasionally consulted told me that there was a weakness in the action of his heart produced in the first instance by excessive study and the excitement of preaching and aggravated by the further drain on his strength due to insufficient nourishment he would eat and drink just enough to keep him alive and no more and he persistently refused to try the good influence of rest and change of scene my wife at a later interview with him when they were alone induced him to throw aside the reserve which he had maintained with me and discovered another cause for the deterioration in his health i dont refer to the return of a nervous misery from which he has suffered at intervals for years past i speak of the effect produced on his mind by the announcementmade no doubt with best intentions by doctor wybrowof the birth of his child this disclosure he was entirely ignorant of his wifes situation when he left her appears to have affected him far more seriously than the english doctor supposed lady loring was so shocked at what he said to her on the subject that she has only repeated it to me with a certain reserve if i could believe i did wrong he said in dedicating myself to the service of the church after the overthrow of my domestic happiness i should also believe that the birth of this child was the retributive punishment of my sin and the warning of my approaching death i dare not take this view and yet i have it not in me after the solemn vows by which i am bound to place any more consoling interpretation on an event which as a priest it disturbs and humiliates me even to think of that one revelation of his tone of thought will tell you what is the mental state of this unhappy man he gave us little encouragement to continue our friendly intercourse with him it was only when we were thinking of our return to england that we heard of his appointment to the vacant place of first attache to the embassy at paris the popes paternal anxiety on the subject of romaynes health had chosen this wise and generous method of obliging him to try a salutary change of air as well as a relaxation from his incessant employments in rome on the occasion of his departure we met again he looked like a wornout old man we could now only remember his double claim on usas a priest of our religion and as a once dear friendand we arranged to travel with him the weather at the time was mild our progress was made by easy stages we left him at paris apparently the better for his journey  i asked if they had seen stella on that occasion  no said lord loring we had reason to doubt whether stella would be pleased to see us and we felt reluctant to meddle unasked with a matter of extreme delicacy i arranged with the nuncio whom i have the honor to know that we should receive written information of romaynes state of health and on that understanding we returned to england a week since our news from the embassy was so alarming that lady loring at once returned to paris her first letter informed me that she had felt it her duty to tell stella of the critical condition of romaynes health she expressed her sense of my wifes kindness most gratefully and feelingly and at once removed to paris to be on the spot if her husband expressed a wish to see her the two ladies are now staying at the same hotel i have thus far been detained in london by family affairs but unless i hear of a change for the better before evening i follow lady loring to paris by the mail train  it was needless to trespass further on lord lorings time i thanked him and returned to penrose he was sleeping when i got to the hotel  on the table in the sittingroom i found a telegram waiting for me it had been sent by stella and it contained these lines  i have just returned from his bedside after telling him of the rescue of penrose he desires to see you there is no positive sufferinghe is sinking under a complete prostration of the forces of life that is what the doctors tell me they said when i spoke of writing to you send a telegram there is no time to lose  toward evening penrose awoke i showed him the telegram throughout our voyage the prospect of seeing romayne again had been the uppermost subject in his thoughts in the extremity of his distress he declared that he would accompany me to paris by the night train remembering how severely he had felt the fatigue of the short railway journey from portsmouth i entreated him to let me go alone his devotion to romayne was not to be reasoned with while we were still vainly trying to convince each other doctor wybrow came in  to my amazement he sided with penrose  oh get up by all means he said we will help you to dress we took him out of bed and put on his dressinggown he thanked us and saying he would complete his toilet by himself sat down in an easy chair in another moment he was asleep again so soundly asleep that we put him back in his bed without waking him doctor wybrow had foreseen this result he looked at the poor fellows pale peaceful face with a kindly smile  there is the treatment he said that will set our patient on his legs again sleeping eating and drinkinglet that be his life for some weeks to come and he will be as good a man as ever if your homeward journey had been by land penrose would have died on the way i will take care of him while you are in paris  at the station i met lord loring he understood that i too had received bad news and gave me a place in the coupe carriage which had been reserved for him we had hardly taken our seats when we saw father benwell among the travelers on the platform accompanied by a grayhaired gentleman who was a stranger to both of us lord loring dislikes strangers otherwise i might have found myself traveling to paris with that detestable jesuit for a companion  paris may 3on our arrival at the hotel i was informed that no message had yet been received from the embassy  we found lady loring alone at the breakfasttable when we had rested after our night journey  romayne still lives she said but his voice has sunk to a whisper and he is unable to breathe if he tries to rest in bed stella has gone to the embassy she hopes to see him today for the second time  only for the second time i exclaimed  you forget mr winterfield that romayne is a priest he was only consecrated on the customary condition of an absolute separation from his wife on her sidenever let her know that i told you thisstella signed a formal document sent from rome asserting that she consented of her own free will to the separation she was relieved from the performance of another formality which i need not mention more particularly by a special dispensation under these circumstancescommunicated to me while stella and i have been together in this housethe wifes presence at the bedside of her dying husband is regarded by the other priests at the embassy as a scandal and a profanation the kindhearted nuncio is blamed for having exceeded his powers in yielding even under protest to the last wishes of a dying man he is now in communication with rome waiting for the final instructions which are to guide him  has romayne seen his child i asked  stella has taken the child with her today it is doubtful in the last degree whether the poor little boy will be allowed to enter his fathers room that complication is even more serious than the other the dying romayne persists in his resolution to see the child so completely has his way of thinking been altered by the approach of death and by the closing of the brilliant prospect which was before him that he even threatens to recant with his last breath if his wishes are not complied with how it will end i cannot even venture to guess  unless the merciful course taken by the nuncio is confirmed said lord loring it may end in a revival of the protest of the catholic priests in germany against the prohibition of marriage to the clergy the movement began in silesia in 1826 and was followed by unions or leagues as we should call them now in baden wurtemburg bavaria and rhenish prussia later still the agitation spread to france and austria it was only checked by a papal bull issued in 1847 reiterating the final decision of the famous council of trent in favor of the celibacy of the priesthood few people are aware that this rule has been an institution of slow growth among the clergy of the church of rome even as late as the twelfth century there were still priests who set the prohibition of marriage at defiance  i listened as one of the many ignorant persons alluded to by lord loring it was with difficulty that i fixed my attention on what he was saying my thoughts wandered to stella and to the dying man i looked at the clock  lady loring evidently shared the feeling of suspense that had got possession of me she rose and walked to the window  here is the message she said recognizing her traveling servant as he entered the hotel door  the man appeared with a line written on a card i was requested to present the card at the embassy without delay  may 4i am only now able to continue my record of the events of yesterday  a silent servant received me at the embassy looked at the card and led the way to an upper floor of the house arrived at the end of a long passage he opened a door and retired  as i crossed the threshold stella met me she took both my hands in hers and looked at me in silence all that was true and good and noble expressed itself in that look  the interval passed and she spokevery sadly very quietly  one more work of mercy bernard help him to die with a heart at rest  she drew backand i approached him  he reclined propped up with pillows in a large easychair it was the one position in which he could still breathe with freedom the ashy shades of death were on his wasted face in the eyes alone as they slowly turned on me there still glimmered the waning light of life one of his arms hung down over the chair the other was clasped round his child sitting on his knee the boy looked at me wonderingly as i stood by his father romayne signed to me to stoop so that i might hear him  penrose he asked faintly whispering dear arthur not dying like me  i quieted that anxiety for a moment there was even the shadow of a smile on his face as i told him of the effort that penrose had vainly made to be the companion of my journey he asked me by another gesture to bend my ear to him once more  my last grateful blessing to penrose and to you may i not say it you have saved arthurhis eyes turned toward stellayou have been her best friend he paused to recover his feeble breath looking round the large room without a creature in it but ourselves once more the melancholy shadow of a smile passed over his faceand vanished i listened nearer to him still  christ took a child on his knee the priests call themselves ministers of christ they have left me because of this child here on my knee wrong wrong wrong winterfield death is a great teacher i know how i have erredwhat i have lost wife and child how poor and barren all the rest of it looks now  he was silent for a while was he thinking no he seemed to be listeningand yet there was no sound in the room stella anxiously watching him saw the listening expression as i did her face showed anxiety but no surprise  does it torture you still she asked  no he said i have never heard it plainly since i left rome it has grown fainter and fainter from that time it is not a voice now it is hardly a whisper my repentance is accepted my release is comingwhere is winterfield  she pointed to me  i spoke of rome just now what did rome remind me of he slowly recovered the lost recollection tell winterfield he whispered to stella what the nuncio said when he knew that i was going to die the great man reckoned up the dignities that might have been mine if i had lived from my place here in the embassy  let me say it she gently interposed and spare your strength for better things from your place in the embassy you would have mounted a step higher to the office of vicelegate those duties wisely performed another rise to the auditorship of the apostolic chamber that office filled a last step upward to the highest rank left the rank of a prince of the church  all vanity said the dying romayne he looked at his wife and his child the true happiness was waiting for me here and i only know it now too late too late  he laid his head back on the pillow and closed his weary eyes we thought he was composing himself to sleep stella tried to relieve him of the boy no he whispered i am only resting my eyes to look at him again we waited the child stared at me in infantine curiosity his mother knelt at his side and whispered in his ear a bright smile irradiated his face his clear brown eyes sparkled he repeated the forgotten lesson of the bygone time and called me once more uncle ber  romayne heard it his heavy eyelids opened again no he said not uncle something better and dearer stella give me your hand  still kneeling she obeyed him he slowly raised himself on the chair take her hand he said to me i too knelt her hand lay cold in mine after a long interval he spoke to me bernard winterfield he said love them and help them when i am gone he laid his weak hand on our hands clasped together may god protect you may god bless you he murmured kiss me stella  i remember no more as a man i ought to have set a better example i ought to have preserved my selfcontrol it was not to be done i turned away from themand burst out crying  the minutes passed many minutes or few minutes i dont know which  a soft knock at the door aroused me i dashed away the useless tears stella had retired to the further end of the room she was sitting by the fireside with the child in her arms i withdrew to the same part of the room keeping far enough away not to disturb them  two strangers came in and placed themselves on either side of romaynes chair he seemed to recognize them unwillingly from the manner in which they examined him i inferred that they were medical men after a consultation in low tones one of them went out  he returned again almost immediately followed by the grayheaded gentleman whom i had noticed on the journey to parisand by father benwell  the jesuits vigilant eyes discovered us instantly in our place near the fireside i thought i saw suspicion as well as surprise in his face but he recovered himself so rapidly that i could not feel sure he bowed to stella she made no return she looked as if she had not even seen him  one of the doctors was an englishman he said to father benwell whatever your business may be with mr romayne we advise you to enter on it without delay shall we leave the room  certainly not father benwell answered the more witnesses are present the more relieved i shall feel he turned to his traveling companion let mr romaynes lawyer he resumed state what our business is  the grayheaded gentleman stepped forward  are you able to attend to me sir he asked  romayne reclining in his chair apparently lost to all interest in what was going on heard and answered the weak tones of his voice failed to reach my ear at the other end of the room the lawyer seeming to be satisfied so far put a formal question to the doctors next he inquired if mr romayne was in full possession of his faculties  both the physicians answered without hesitation in the affirmative father benwell added his attestation throughout mr romaynes illness he said firmly his mind has been as clear as mine is  while this was going on the child had slipped off his mothers lap with the natural restlessness of his age he walked to the fireplace and stoppedfascinated by the bright red glow of the embers of burning wood in one corner of the low fender lay a loose little bundle of sticks left there in case the fire might need relighting the boy noticing the bundle took out one of the sticks and threw it experimentally into the grate the flash of flame as the stick caught fire delighted him he went on burning stick after stick the new game kept him quiet his mother was content to be on the watch to see that no harm was done  in the meantime the lawyer briefly stated his case  you remember mr romayne that your will was placed for safe keeping in our office he began father benwell called upon us and presented an order signed by yourself authorizing him to convey the will from london to paris the object was to obtain your signature to a codicil which had been considered a necessary addition to secure the validity of the willare you favoring me with your attention sir  romayne answered by a slight bending of his head his eyes were fixed on the boystill absorbed in throwing his sticks one by one into the fire  at the time when your will was executed the lawyer went on father benwell obtained your permission to take a copy of it hearing of your illness he submitted the copy to a high legal authority the written opinion of this competent person declares the clause bequeathing the vange estate to father benwell to be so imperfectly expressed that the will might be made a subject of litigation after the testators death he has accordingly appended a form of codicil amending the defect and we have added it to the will i thought it my duty as one of your legal advisers to accompany father benwell on his return to paris in charge of the willin case you might feel disposed to make any alteration he looked toward stella and the child as he completed that sentence the jesuits keen eyes took the same direction shall i read the will sir the lawyer resumed or would you prefer to look at it yourself  romayne held out his hand for the will in silence he was still watching his son there were but few more sticks now left to be thrown in the fire  father benwell interfered for the first time  one word mr romayne before you examine that document he said the church receives back from you through me the property which was once its own beyond that it authorizes and even desires you to make any changes which you or your trusted legal adviser may think right i refer to the clauses of the will which relate to the property you have inherited from the late lady berrickand i beg the persons present to bear in memory the few plain words that i have now spoken  he bowed with dignity and drew back even the lawyer was favorably impressed the doctors looked at each other with silent approval for the first time the sad repose of stellas face was disturbedi could see that it cost her an effort to repress her indignation the one unmoved person was romayne the sheet of paper on which the will was written lay unregarded upon his lap his eyes were still riveted on the little figure at the fireplace  the child had thrown his last stick into the glowing red embers he looked about him for a fresh supply and found nothing his fresh young voice rose high through the silence of the room  more he cried more  his mother held up a warning finger hush she whispered he shrank away from her as she tried to take him on her knee and looked across the room at his father more he burst out louder than ever romayne beckoned to me and pointed to the boy  i led him across the room he was quite willing to go with mehe reiterated his petition standing at his fathers knees  lift him to me said romayne  i could barely hear the words even his strength to whisper seemed to be fast leaving him he kissed his sonwith a panting fatigue under that trifling exertion pitiable to see as i placed the boy on his feet again he looked up at his dying father with the one idea still in his mind  more papa more  romayne put the will into his hand  the childs eyes sparkled burn he asked eagerly  yes  father benwell sprang forward with outstretched hands i stopped him he struggled with me i forgot the privilege of the black robe i took him by the throat  the boy threw the will into the fire oh he shouted in high delight and clapped his chubby hands as the bright little blaze flew up the chimney i released the priest  in a frenzy of rage and despair he looked round at the persons in the room i take you all to witness he cried this is an act of madness  you yourself declared just now said the lawyer that mr romayne was in perfect possession of his faculties  the baffled jesuit turned furiously on the dying man they looked at each other  for one awful moment romaynes eyes brightened romaynes voice rallied its power as if life was returning to him frowning darkly the priest put his question  what did you do it for  quietly and firmly the answer came  wife and child  the last longdrawn sigh rose and fell with those sacred words on his lips romayne died  london 6th mayat stellas request i have returned to penrosewith but one fellowtraveler my dear old companion the dog is coiled up fast asleep at my feet while i write these lines penrose has gained strength enough to keep me company in the sittingroom in a few days more he will see stella again  what instructions reached the embassy from romewhether romayne received the last sacrament at the earlier period of his illnesswe never heard no objection was made when lord loring proposed to remove the body to england to be buried in the family vault at vange abbey  i had undertaken to give the necessary directions for the funeral on my arrival in london returning to the hotel i met father benwell in the street i tried to pass on he deliberately stopped me  how is mrs romayne he asked with that infernal suavity which he seems always to have at command fairly well i hope and the boy ah he little thought how he was changing his prospects for the better when he made that blaze in the fire pardon me mr winterfield you dont seem to be quite so cordial as usual perhaps you are thinking of your inconsiderate assault on my throat let us forgive and forget or perhaps you object to my having converted poor romayne and to my being ready to accept from him the restoration of the property of the church in both cases i only did my duty as a priest you are a liberalminded man surely i deserve a favorable construction of my conduct  i really could not endure this i have my own opinion of what you deserve i answered dont provoke me to mention it  he eyed me with a sinister smile  i am not so old as i look he said i may live another twenty years  well i asked  well he answered much may happen in twenty years  with that he left me if he means any further mischief i can tell him thishe will find me in his way  to turn to a more pleasant subject reflecting on all that had passed at my memorable interview with romayne i felt some surprise that one of the persons present had made no effort to prevent the burning of the will it was not to be expected of stellaor of the doctors who had no interest in the matterbut i was unable to understand the passive position maintained by the lawyer he enlightened my ignorance in two words  the vange property and the berrick property were both absolutely at the disposal of mr romayne he said if he died without leaving a will he knew enough of the law to foresee that houses lands and money would go to his nearest of kin in plainer words his widow and his son  when penrose can travel he accompanies me to beaupark stella and her little son and mrs eyrecourt will be the only other guests in my house time must pass and the boy will be older before i may remind stella of romaynes last wishes on that sad morning when we two knelt on either side of him in the meanwhile it is almost happiness enough for me to look forward to the day   notethe next leaf of the diary is missing by some accident a manuscript page has got into its place bearing a later date and containing elaborate instructions for executing a design for a wedding dress the handwriting has since been acknowledged as her own by no less a person thanmrs eyrecourt
