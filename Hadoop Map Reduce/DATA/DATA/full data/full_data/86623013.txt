first section of the second volume of the forsyte saga      the first and last       so the last shall be first and the first lastholy writ   it was a dark room at that hour of six in the evening when just the single oil readinglamp under its green shade let fall a dapple of light over the turkey carpet over the covers of books taken out of the bookshelves and the open pages of the one selected over the deep blue and gold of the coffee service on the little old stool with its oriental embroidery very dark in the winter with drawn curtains many rows of leatherbound volumes oakpanelled walls and ceiling so large too that the lighted spot before the fire where he sat was just an oasis but that was what keith darrant liked after his days workthe hard early morning study of his cases the fret and strain of the day in court it was his rest these two hours before dinner with books coffee a pipe and sometimes a nap in red turkish slippers and his old brown velvet coat he was well suited to that framing of glow and darkness a painter would have seized avidly on his clearcut yellowish face with its black eyebrows twisting up over eyesgrey or brown one could hardly tell and its dark grizzling hair still plentiful in spite of those daily hours of wig he seldom thought of his work while he sat there throwing off with practised ease the strain of that long attention to the multiple threads of argument and evidence to be disentangledwork profoundly interesting as a rule to his clear intellect trained to almost instinctive rejection of all but the essential to selection of what was legally vital out of the mass of confused tactical and human detail presented to his scrutiny yet sometimes tedious and wearing as for instance today when he had suspected his client of perjury and was almost convinced that he must throw up his brief he had disliked the weaklooking whitefaced fellow from the first and his nervous shifty answers his prominent startled eyesa type too common in these days of canting tolerations and weak humanitarianism no good no good  of the three books he had taken down a volume of voltairecurious fascination that frenchman had for all his destructive ironya volume of burtons travels and stevensons new arabian nights he had pitched upon the last he felt that evening the want of something sedative a desire to rest from thought of any kind the court had been crowded stuffy the air as he walked home soft souwesterly charged with coming moisture no quality of vigour in it he felt relaxed tired even nervy and for once the loneliness of his house seemed strange and comfortless  lowering the lamp he turned his face towards the fire perhaps he would get a sleep before that boring dinner at the tellassons he wished it were vacation and maisie back from school a widower for many years he had lost the habit of a woman about him yet tonight he had a positive yearning for the society of his young daughter with her quick ways and bright dark eyes curious what perpetual need of a woman some men had his brother laurencewastedall through womenatrophy of willpower a man on the edge of things living from hand to mouth his gifts all down at heel one would have thought the scottish strain might have saved him and yet when a scotsman did begin to go downhill who could go faster curious that their mothers blood should have worked so differently in her two sons he himself had always felt he owed all his success to it  his thoughts went off at a tangent to a certain issue troubling his legal conscience he had not wavered in the usual assumption of omniscience but he was by no means sure that he had given right advice well without that power to decide and hold to decision in spite of misgiving one would never have been fit for ones position at the bar never have been fit for anything the longer he lived the more certain he became of the prime necessity of virile and decisive action in all the affairs of life a word and a blowand the blow first doubts hesitations sentiment the muling and puking of this twilight age and there welled up on his handsome face a smile that was almost devilishthe tricks of firelight are so many it faded again in sheer drowsiness he slept  he woke with a start having a feeling of something out beyond the light and without turning his head said whats that there came a sound as if somebody had caught his breath he turned up the lamp  whos there  a voice over by the door answered  only ilarry  something in the tone or perhaps just being startled out of sleep like this made him shiver he said  i was asleep come in  it was noticeable that he did not get up or even turn his head now that he knew who it was but waited his halfclosed eyes fixed on the fire for his brother to come forward a visit from laurence was not an unmixed blessing he could hear him breathing and became conscious of a scent of whisky why could not the fellow at least abstain when he was coming here it was so childish so lacking in any sense of proportion or of decency and he said sharply  well larry what is it  it was always something he often wondered at the strength of that sense of trusteeship which kept him still tolerant of the troubles amenable to the petitions of this brother of his or was it just blood feeling a highland sense of loyalty to kith and kin an oldtime quality which judgment and half his instincts told him was weakness but which in spite of all bound him to the distressful fellow was he drunk now that he kept lurking out there by the door and he said less sharply  why dont you come and sit down  he was coming now avoiding the light skirting along the walls just beyond the radiance of the lamp his feet and legs to the waist brightly lighted but his face disintegrated in shadow like the face of a dark ghost  are you ill man  still no answer save a shake of that head and the passing up of a hand out of the light to the ghostly forehead under the dishevelled hair the scent of whisky was stronger now and keith thought  he really is drunk nice thing for the new butler to see if he cant behave  the figure against the wall heaved a sighso truly from an overburdened heart that keith was conscious with a certain dismay of not having yet fathomed the cause of this uncanny silence he got up and back to the fire said with a brutality born of nerves rather than design  what is it man have you committed a murder that you stand there dumb as a fish  for a second no answer at all not even of breathing then just the whisper  yes  the sense of unreality which so helps one at moments of disaster enabled keith to say vigorously  by jove you have been drinking  but it passed at once into deadly apprehension  what do you mean come here where i can see you whats the matter with you larry  with a sudden lurch and dive his brother left the shelter of the shadow and sank into a chair in the circle of light and another long broken sigh escaped him  theres nothing the matter with me keith its true  keith stepped quickly forward and stared down into his brothers face and instantly he saw that it was true no one could have simulated the look in those eyesof horrified wonder as if they would never again get on terms with the face to which they belonged to see them squeezed the heartonly real misery could look like that then that sudden pity became angry bewilderment  what in gods name is this nonsense  but it was significant that he lowered his voice went over to the door too to see if it were shut laurence had drawn his chair forward huddling over the firea thin figure a worn highcheekboned face with deepsunk blue eyes and wavy hair all ruffled a face that still had a certain beauty putting a hand on that lean shoulder keith said  come larry pull yourself together and drop exaggeration  its true i tell you ive killed a man  the noisy violence of that outburst acted like a douche what was the fellow aboutshouting out such words but suddenly laurence lifted his hands and wrung them the gesture was so utterly painful that it drew a quiver from keiths face  why did you come here he said and tell me this  larrys face was really unearthly sometimes such strange gleams passed up on to it  whom else should i tell i came to know what im to do keith give myself up or what  at that sudden introduction of the practical keith felt his heart twitch was it then as real as all that but he said very quietly  just tell mehow did it come about thisaffair  that question linked the dark gruesome fantastic nightmare on to actuality  when did it happen  last night  in larrys face there wasthere had always beensomething childishly truthful he would never stand a chance in court and keith said  how where youd better tell me quietly from the beginning drink this coffee itll clear your head  laurence took the little blue cup and drained it  yes he said its like this keith theres a girl ive known for some months now  women and keith said between his teeth well  her father was a pole who died over here when she was sixteen and left her all alone a man called walenn a mongrel american living in the same house married her or pretended toshes very pretty keithhe left her with a baby six months old and another coming that one died and she did nearly then she starved till another fellow took her on she lived with him two years then walenn turned up again and made her go back to him the brute used to beat her black and blue all for nothing then he left her again when i met her shed lost her elder child too and was taking anybody who came along  he suddenly looked up into keiths face  but ive never met a sweeter woman nor a truer that i swear woman shes only twenty now when i went to her last night that brutethat walennhad found her out again and when he came for me swaggering and bullyinglookhe touched a dark mark on his foreheadi took his throat in my hands and when i let go  yes  dead i never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him behind  again he made that gesturewringing his hands  in a hard voice keith said  what did you do then  we sat by it a long time then i carried it on my back down the street round a corner to an archway  how far  about fifty yards  was anyonedid anyone see  no  what time  three  and then  went back to her  whyin heavens name  she was lonely and afraid so was i keith  where is this place  fortytwo borrow street soho  and the archway  corner of glove lane  good god whyi saw it in the paper  and seizing the journal that lay on his bureau keith read again that paragraph the body of a man was found this morning under an archway in glove lane soho from marks about the throat grave suspicions of foul play are entertained the body had apparently been robbed and nothing was discovered leading to identification  it was real earnest then murder his own brother he faced round and said  you saw this in the paper and dreamed it understandyou dreamed it  the wistful answer came  if only i had keithif only i had  in his turn keith very nearly wrung his hands  did you take anything from thebody  this dropped while we were struggling  it was an empty envelope with a south american postmark addressed patrick walenn simons hotel farrier street london again with that twitching in his heart keith said  put it in the fire  then suddenly he stooped to pluck it out by that commandhe hadidentified himself with thisthisbut he did not pluck it out it blackened writhed and vanished and once more he said  what in gods name made you come here and tell me  you know about these things i didnt mean to kill him i love the girl what shall i do keith  simple how simple to ask what he was to do it was like larry and he said  you were not seen you think its a dark street there was no one about  when did you leave this girl the second time  about seven oclock  where did you go  to my rooms  in fitzroy street  yes  did anyone see you come in  no  what have

leave her in the morning  no  you were fortunate sit down again man i must think  think think out this accursed thingso beyond all thought and all belief but he could not think not a coherent thought would come and he began again  was it his first reappearance with her  yes  she told you so  yes  how did he find out where she was  i dont know  how drunk were you  i was not drunk  how much had you drunk  about two bottles of claretnothing  you say you didnt mean to kill him  nogod knows  thats something  what made you choose the arch  it was the first dark place  did his face look as if he had been strangled  dont  did it  yes  very disfigured  yes  did you look to see if his clothes were marked  no  why not  why not my god if you had done it  you say he was disfigured would he be recognisable  i dont know  when she lived with him lastwhere was that  i dont know for certain pimlico i think  not soho  no  how long has she been at the soho place  nearly a year  always the same rooms  yes  is there anyone living in that house or street who would be likely to know her as his wife  i dont think so  what was he  i should think he was a professional bully  i see spending most of his time abroad then  yes  do you know if he was known to the police  i havent heard of it  now listen larry when you leave here go straight home and dont go out till i come to you tomorrow morning promise that  i promise  ive got a dinner engagement ill think this out dont drink dont talk pull yourself together  dont keep me longer than you can help keith  that white face those eyes that shaking hand with a twinge of pity in the midst of all the turbulence of his revolt and fear and disgust keith put his hand on his brothers shoulder and said  courage  and suddenly he thought my god courage i shall want it all myself     ii  laurence darrant leaving his brothers house in the adelphi walked northwards rapidly slowly rapidly again for if there are men who by force of will do one thing only at a time there are men who from lack of will do now one thing now another with equal intensity to such natures to be gripped by the nemesis which attends the lack of selfcontrol is no reason for being more selfcontrolled rather does it foster their pet feeling what matter tomorrow we die the effort of will required to go to keith had relieved exhausted and exasperated him in accordance with those three feelings was the progress of his walk he started from the door with the fixed resolve to go home and stay there quietly till keith came he was in keiths hands keith would know what was to be done but he had not gone three hundred yards before he felt so utterly weary body and soul that if he had but had a pistol in his pocket he would have shot himself in the street not even the thought of the girlthis young unfortunate with her strange devotion who had kept him straight these last five months who had roused in him a depth of feeling he had never known beforewould have availed against that sudden black defection why go ona waif at the mercy of his own nature a straw blown here and there by every gust which rose in him why not have done with it for ever and take it out in sleep  he was approaching the fatal street where he and the girl that early morning had spent the hours clutched together trying in the refuge of love to forget for a moment their horror and fear should he go in he had promised keith not to why had he promised he caught sight of himself in a chemists lighted window miserable shadowy brute and he remembered suddenly a dog he had picked up once in the streets of pera a blackandwhite creaturedifferent from the other dogs not one of their breed a pariah of pariahs who had strayed there somehow he had taken it home to the house where he was staying contrary to all custom of the country had got fond of it had shot it himself sooner than leave it behind again to the mercies of its own kind in the streets twelve years ago and those sleevelinks made of little turkish coins he had brought back for the girl at the hairdressers in chancery lane where he used to get shavedpretty creature like a wild rose he had asked of her a kiss for payment what queer emotion when she put her face forward to his lipsa sort of passionate tenderness and shame at the softness and warmth of that flushed cheek at her beauty and trustful gratitude she would soon have given herself to himthat one he had never gone there again and to this day he did not know why he had abstained to this day he did not know whether he were glad or sorry not to have plucked that rose he must surely have been very different then queer business lifequeer queer businessto go through it never knowing what you would do next ah to be like keith steady buttonedup in success a brass pot a pillar of society once as a boy he had been within an ace of killing keith for sneering at him once in southern italy he had been near killing a driver who was flogging his horse and now that darkfaced swinish bully who had ruined the girl he had grown to lovehe had done it killed him killed a man  he who did not want to hurt a fly the chemists window comforted him with the sudden thought that he had at home that which made him safe in case they should arrest him he would never again go out without some of those little white tablets sewn into the lining of his coat restful even exhilarating thought they said a man should not take his own life let them taste horrorthose glib citizens let them live as that girl had lived as millions lived all the world over under their canting dogmas a man might rather even take his life than watch their cursed inhumanities  he went into the chemists for a bromide and while the man was mixing it stood resting one foot like a tired horse the life he had squeezed out of that fellow after all a billion living creatures gave up life each day had it squeezed out of them mostly and perhaps not one a day deserved death so much as that loathly fellow life a breathaflame nothing why then this icy clutching at his heart  the chemist brought the draught  not sleeping sir  no  the mans eyes seemed to say yes burning the candle at both endsi know odd life a chemists pills and powders all day long to hold the machinery of men together devilish odd trade  in going out he caught the reflection of his face in a mirror it seemed too good altogether for a man who had committed murder there was a sort of brightness underneath an amiability lurking about its shadows howhow could it be the face of a man who had done what he had done his head felt lighter now his feet lighter he walked rapidly again  curious feeling of relief and oppression all at once frightfulto long for company for talk for distraction andto be afraid of it the girlthe girl and keith were now the only persons who would not give him that feeling of dread and of those twokeith was not who could consort with one who was never wrong a successful righteous fellow a chap built so that he knew nothing about himself wanted to know nothing a chap all solid actions to be a quicksand swallowing up ones own resolutions was bad enough but to be like keithall willpower marching along treading down his own feelings and weaknesses no one could not make a comrade of a man like keith even if he were ones brother the only creature in all the world was the girl she alone knew and felt what he was feeling would put up with him and love him whatever he did or was done to him he stopped and took shelter in a doorway to light a cigarette he had suddenly a fearful wish to pass the archway where he had placed the body a fearful wish that had no sense no end in view no anything just an insensate craving to see the dark place again he crossed borrow street to the little lane there was only one person visible a man on the far side with his shoulders hunched against the wind a short dark figure which crossed and came towards him in the flickering lamplight what a face yellow ravaged clothed almost to the eyes in a stubbly greyish growth of beard with blackish teeth and haunting bloodshot eyes and what a figure of ragsone shoulder higher than the other one leg a little lame and thin a surge of feeling came up in laurence for this creature more unfortunate than himself there were lower depths than his  well brother he said you dont look too prosperous  the smile which gleamed out on the mans face seemed as unlikely as a smile on a scarecrow  prosperity doesnt come my way he said in a rusty voice im a failurealways been a failure and yet you wouldnt think it would youi was a minister of religion once  laurence held out a shilling but the man shook his head  keep your money he said ive got more than you today i daresay but thank you for taking a little interest thats worth more than money to a man thats down  youre right  yes the rusty voice went on id as soon die as go on living as i do and now ive lost my selfrespect often wondered how long a starving man could go without losing his selfrespect not so very long you take my word for that and without the slightest change in the monotony of that creaking voice he added  did you read of the murder just here ive been looking at the place  the words so have i leaped up to laurences lips he choked them down with a sort of terror  i wish you better luck he said goodnight and hurried away a sort of ghastly laughter was forcing its way up in his throat was everyone talking of the murder he had committed even the very scarecrows     iii  there are some natures so constituted that due to be hung at ten oclock they will play chess at eight such men invariably rise they make especially good bishops editors judges impresarios prime ministers moneylenders and generals in fact fill with exceptional credit any position of power over their fellowmen they have spiritual cold storage in which are preserved their nervous systems in such men there is little or none of that fluid sense and continuity of feeling known under those vague terms speculation poetry philosophy men of facts and of decision switching imagination on and off at will subordinating sentiment to reason one does not think of them when watching wind ripple over cornfields or swallows flying  keith darrant had need for being of that breed during his dinner at the tellassons it was just eleven when he issued from the big house in portland place and refrained from taking a cab he wanted to walk that he might better think what crude and wanton irony there was in his situation to have been made fatherconfessor to a murderer hewell on towards a judgeship with his contempt for the kind of weakness which landed men in such abysses he felt it all so sordid so impossible that he could hardly bring his mind to bear on it at all and yet he must because of two powerful instinctsselfpreservation and bloodloyalty  the wind had still the sapping softness of the afternoon but rain had held off so far it was warm and he unbuttoned his fur overcoat the nature of his thoughts deepened the dark austerity of his face whose thin wellcut lips were always pressing together as if by meeting to dispose of each thought as it came up he moved along the crowded pavements glumly that air of festive conspiracy which drops with the darkness on to lighted streets galled him he turned off on a darker route  this ghastly business convinced of its reality he yet could not see it the thing existed in his mind not as a picture but as a piece of irrefutable evidence larry had not meant to do it of course but it was murder all the same men like larryweak impulsive sentimental introspective creaturesdid they ever mean what they did this man this walenn was by all accounts better dead than alive no need to waste a thought on him but crimethe uglinessjustice unsatisfied crime concealedand his own share in the concealment and yetbrother to brother surely no one could demand action from him it was only a question of what he was going to advise larry to do to keep silent and disappear had that a chance of success perhaps if the answers to his questions had been correct but this girl suppose the dead mans relationship to her were ferreted out could she be relied on not to endanger larry these women were all the same unstable as water emotional shiftless pests of society then too a crime untracked dogging all his brothers after life a secret following him wherever he might vanish to hanging over him watching for some drunken moment to slip out of his lips it was bad to think of a clean breast of it but his heart twitched within him brother of mr keith darrant the wellknown kings counselvisiting a woman of the town strangling with his bare hands the womans husband no intention to murder buta dead man a dead man carried out of the house laid under a dark archway provocation recommended to mercypenal servitude for life was that the advice he was going to give larry tomorrow morning  and he had a sudden vision of shaven men with claycoloured features run as it were to seed as he had seen them once in pentonville when he had gone there to visit a prisoner larry whom as a baby creature he had watched straddling whom as a little fellow he had fagged whom he had seen through scrapes at college to whom he had lent money time and again and time and again admonished in his courses larry five years younger than himself and committed to his charge by their mother when she died to become for life one of those men with faces like diseased plants with no hair but a bushy stubble with arrows marked on their yellow clothes larry one of those men herded like sheep at the beck and call of common men a gentleman his own brother to live that slaves life to be ordered here and there year after year day in day out something snapped within him he could not give that advice impossible but if not he must make sure of his ground must verify must know this glove lanethis arch way it would not be far from where he was that very moment he looked for someone of whom to make enquiry a policeman was standing at the corner his stolid face illumined by a lamp capable and watchfulan excellent officer no doubt but turning his head away keith passed him without a word strange to feel that cold uneasy feeling in presence of the law a grim little driving home of what it all meant then suddenly he saw that the turning to his left was borrow street itself he walked up one side crossed over and returned he passed number fortytwo a small house with business names printed on the lifeless windows of the first and second floors with dark curtained windows on the ground floor or was there just a slink of light in one corner which way had larry turned which way under that grisly burden fifty paces of this squalid streetnarrow and dark and empty thank heaven glove lane here it was a tiny runlet of a street and here he had run right on to the arch a brick bridge connecting two portions of a warehouse and dark indeed  thats right govnor thats the place he needed all his selfcontrol to turn leisurely to the speaker eres where they found the bodyvery spot leanin up ere they aint got im yet lytestme lord  it was a ragged boy holding out a tattered yellowish journal his lynx eyes peered up from under lanky wisps of hair and his voice had the proprietary note of one making a corner in his news keith took the paper and gave him twopence he even found a sort of comfort in the young ghouls hanging about there it meant that others besides himself had come morbidly to look by the dim lamplight he read glove lane garrotting mystery nothing has yet been discovered of the murdered mans identity from the cut of his clothes he is supposed to be a foreigner the boy had vanished and keith saw the figure of a policeman coming slowly down this gutter of a street a seconds hesitation and he stood firm nothing obviously could have brought him here save this mystery and he stayed quietly staring at the arch the policeman moved up abreast keith saw that he was the one whom he had passed just now he noted the cold offensive question die out of the mans eyes when they caught the gleam of white shirtfront under the opened fur collar and holding up the paper he said  is this where the man was found  yes sir  still a mystery i see  well we cant always go by the papers but i dont fancy they do know much about it yet  dark spot do fellows sleep under here  the policeman nodded theres not an arch in london where we dont get em sometimes  nothing found on himi think i read  not a copper pockets inside out theres some funny characters about this quarter greeks hitaliansall sorts  queer sensation this of being glad of a policemans confidential tone  well goodnight  goodnight sir goodnight  he looked back from borrow street the policeman was still standing there holding up his lantern so that its light fell into the archway as if trying to read its secret  now that he had seen this dark deserted spot the chances seemed to him much better pockets inside out either larry had had presence of mind to do a very clever thing or someone had been at the body before the police found it that was the more likely a dead backwater of a place at three oclockloneliest of all hourslarrys five minutes grim excursion to and fro might well have passed unseen now it all depended on the girl on whether laurence had been seen coming to her or going away on whether if the mans relationship to her were discovered she could be relied on to say nothing there was not a soul in borrow street now hardly even a lighted window and he took one of those rather desperate decisions only possible to men daily accustomed to the instant taking of responsibility he would go to her and see for himself he came to the door of fortytwo obviously one of those which are only shut at night and tried the larger key it fitted and he was in a gaslighted passage with an oilclothed floor and a single door to his left he stood there undecided she must be made to understand that he knew everything she must not be told more than that he was a friend of larrys she must not be frightened yet must be forced to give her very soul away a hostile witnessnot to be treated as hostilea matter for delicate handling but his knock was not answered  should he give up this nerveracking bizarre effort to come at a basis of judgment go away and just tell laurence that he could not advise him and thenwhat something must be done he knocked again still no answer and with that impatience of being thwarted natural to him and fostered to the full by the conditions of his life he tried the other key it worked and he opened the door inside all was dark but a voice from some way off with a sort of breathless relief in its foreign tones said  oh then its you larry why did you knock i was so frightened turn up the light dear come in  feeling by the door for a switch in the pitch blackness he was conscious of arms round his neck a warm thinly clad body pressed to his own then withdrawn as quickly with a gasp and the most awful terrorstricken whisper  oh who is it  with a glacial shiver down his own spine keith answered  a friend of laurence dont be frightened  there was such silence that he could hear a clock ticking and the sound of his own hand passing over the surface of the wall trying to find the switch he found it and in the light which leaped up he saw stiffened against a dark curtain evidently screening off a bedroom a girl standing holding a long black coat together at her throat so that her face with its pale brown hair short and squarecut and curling up underneath had an uncanny look of being detached from any body her face was so alabaster pale that the staring startled eyes dark blue or brown and the faint rose of the parted lips were like colour stainings on a white mask and it had a strange delicacy truth and pathos such as only suffering brings though not susceptible to aesthetic emotion keith was curiously affected he said gently  you neednt be afraid i havent come to do you harmquite the contrary may i sit down and talk and holding up the keys he added laurence wouldnt have given me these would he if he hadnt trusted me  still she did not move and he had the impression that he was looking at a spirita spirit startled out of its flesh nor at the moment did it seem in the least strange that he should conceive such an odd thought he stared round the roomclean and tawdry with its tarnished gilt mirror marbletopped sidetable and plushcovered sofa twenty years and more since he had been in such a place and he said  wont you sit down im sorry to have startled you  but still she did not move whispering  who are you please  and moved suddenly beyond the realm of caution by the terror in that whisper he answered  larrys brother  she uttered a little sigh of relief which went to keiths heart and still holding the dark coat together at her throat came forward and sat down on the sofa he could see that her feet thrust into slippers were bare with her short hair and those candid startled eyes she looked like a tall child he drew up a chair and said  you must forgive me coming at such an hour hes told me you see he expected her to flinch and gasp but she only clasped her hands together on her knees and said  yes  then horror and discomfort rose up in him afresh  an awful business  her whisper echoed him  yes oh yes awfulit is awful  and suddenly realising that the man must have fallen dead just where he was sitting keith became stock silent staring at the floor  yes she whispered just there i see him now always falling  how she said that with what a strange gentle despair in this girl of evil life who had brought on them this tragedy what was it which moved him to a sort of unwilling compassion  you look very young he said  i am twenty  and you are fond ofmy brother  i would die for him  impossible to mistake the tone of her voice or the look in her eyes true deep slav eyes dark brown not blue as he had thought at first it was a very pretty faceeither her life had not eaten into it yet or the suffering of these last hours had purged away those marks or perhaps this devotion of hers to larry he felt strangely at sea sitting there with this child of twenty he over forty a man of the world professionally used to every side of human nature but he said stammering a little  ii have come to see how far you can save him listen and just answer the questions i put to you  she raised her hands squeezed them together and murmured  oh i will answer anything  this man thenyouryour husbandwas he a bad man  a dreadful man  before he came here last night how long since you saw him  eighteen months  where did you live when you saw him last  in pimlico  does anybody about here know you as mrs walenn  no when i came here after my little girl died i came to live a bad life nobody knows me at all i am quite alone  if they discover who he was they will look for his wife  i do not know he did not let people think i was married to him i was very young he treated many i think like me  do you think he was known to the police  she shook her head he was very clever  what is your name now  wanda livinska  were you known by that name before you were married  wanda is my christian name livinskai just call myself  i see since you came here  yes  did my brother ever see this man before last night  never  you had told him about his treatment of you  yes and that man first went for him  i saw the mark do you think anyone saw my brother come to you  i do not know he says not  can you tell if anyone saw him carrying thethe thing away  no one in this streeti was looking  nor coming back  no one  nor going out in the morning  i do not think it  have you a servant  only a woman who comes at nine in the morning for an hour  does she know larry  no  friends acquaintances  no i am very quiet and since i knew your brother i see no one nobody comes here but him for a long time now  how long  five months  have you been out today  no  what have you been doing  crying  it was said with a certain dreadful simplicity and pressing her hands together she went on  he is in danger because of me i am so afraid for him holding up his hand to check that emotion he said  look at me  she fixed those dark eyes on him and in her bare throat from which the coat had fallen back he could see her resolutely swallowing down her agitation  if the worst comes to the worst and this man is traced to you can you trust yourself not to give my brother away  her eyes shone she got up and went to the fireplace  look i have burned all the things he has given meeven his picture now i have nothing from him  keith too got up  good one more question do the police know you becausebecause of your life  she shook her head looking at him intently with those mournfully true eyes and he felt a sort of shame  i was obliged to ask do you know where he lives  yes  you must not go there and he must not come to you here  her lips quivered but she bowed her head suddenly he found her quite close to him speaking almost in a whisper  please do not take him from me altogether i will be so careful i will not do anything to hurt him but if i cannot see him sometimes i shall die please do not take him from me and catching his hand between her own she pressed it desperately it was several seconds before keith said  leave that to me i will see him i shall arrange you must leave that to me  but you will be kind  he felt her lips kissing his hand and the soft moist touch sent a queer feeling through him protective yet just a little brutal having in it a shiver of sensuality he withdrew his hand and as if warned that she had been too pressing she recoiled humbly but suddenly she turned and stood absolutely rigid then almost inaudibly whispered listen someone outout there and darting past him she turned out the light  almost at once came a knock on the door he could feelactually feel the terror of this girl beside him in the dark and he too felt terror who could it be no one came but larry she had said who else then could it be again came the knock louder he felt the breath of her whisper on his cheek if it is larry i must open he shrank back against the wall heard her open the door and say faintly yes please who  light painted a thin moving line on the wall opposite and a voice which keith recognised answered  all right miss your outer doors open here you ought to keep it shut after dark  god that policeman and it had been his own doing not shutting the outer door behind him when he came in he heard her say timidly in her foreign voice thank you sir the policemans retreating steps the outer door being shut and felt her close to him again that something in her youth and strange prettiness which had touched and kept him gentle no longer blunted the edge of his exasperation now that he could not see her they were all the same these women could not speak the truth and he said brusquely  you told me they didnt know you  her voice answered like a sigh  i did not think they did sir it is so long i was not out in the town not since i had larry  the repulsion which all the time seethed deep in keith welled up at those words his brotherson of his mother a gentlemanthe property of this girl bound to her body and soul by this unspeakable event but she had turned up the light had she some intuition that darkness was against her yes she was pretty with that soft face colourless save for its lips and dark eyes with that face somehow so touchingly so unaccountably good and like a childs  i am going now he said remember he mustnt come here you mustnt go to him i shall see him tomorrow if you are as fond of him as you saytake care take care  she sighed out yes oh yes and keith went to the door she was standing with her back to the wall and to follow him she only moved her headthat dovelike face with all its life in eyes which seemed saying look into us nothing we hide allall is there  and he went out  in the passage he paused before opening the outer door he did not want to meet that policeman again the fellows round should have taken him well out of the street by now and turning the handle cautiously he looked out no one in sight he stood a moment wondering if he should turn to right or left then briskly crossed the street a voice to his right hand said  goodnight sir  there in the shadow of a doorway the policeman was standing the fellow must have seen him coming out utterly unable to restrain a start and muttering goodnight keith walked on rapidly  he went full quarter of a mile before he lost that startled and uneasy feeling in sardonic exasperation that he keith darrant had been taken for a frequenter of a lady of the town the whole thingthe whole thinga vile and disgusting business his very mind felt dirty and breathless his spirit drawn out of sheath had slowly to slide back before he could at all focus and readjust his reasoning faculty certainly he had got the knowledge he wanted there was less danger than he thought that girls eyes no mistaking her devotion she would not give larry away yes larry must clear outsouth americathe eastit did not matter but he felt no relief the cheap tawdry room had wrapped itself round his fancy with its atmosphere of murky love with the feeling it inspired of emotion caged within those yellowish walls and the red stuff of its furniture that girls face devotion truth too and beauty rare and moving in its setting of darkness and horror in that nest of vice and of disorder the dark archway the street arab with his gleeful they aint got im yet the feel of those bare arms round his neck that whisper of horror in the darkness above all again her child face looking into his so truthful and suddenly he stood quite still in the street what in gods name was he about what grotesque juggling amongst shadows what strange and ghastly eccentricity was all this the forces of order and routine all the actualities of his daily life marched on him at that moment and swept everything before them it was a dream a nightmare not real it was ridiculous that hehe should thus be bound up with things so black and bizarre  he had come by now to the strand that street down which every day he moved to the law courts to his daily work his work so dignified and regular so irreproachable and solid no the thing was all a monstrous nightmare it would go if he fixed his mind on the familiar objects around read the names on the shops looked at the faces passing far down the thoroughfare he caught the outline of the old church and beyond the loom of the law courts themselves the bell of a fireengine sounded and the horses came galloping by with the shining metal rattle of hoofs and hoarse shouting here was a sensation real and harmless dignified and customary a woman flaunting round the corner looked up at him and leered out goodnight even that was customary tolerable two policemen passed supporting between them a man the worse for liquor full of fight and expletives the sight was soothing an ordinary thing which brought passing annoyance interest disgust it had begun to rain he felt it on his face with pleasurean actual thing not eccentric a thing which happened every day  he began to cross the street cabs were going at furious speed now that the last omnibus had ceased to run it distracted him to take this actual ordinary risk run so often every day during that crossing of the strand with the rain in his face and the cabs shooting past he regained for the first time his assurance shook off this unreal sense of being in the grip of something and walked resolutely to the corner of his home turning but passing into that darker stretch he again stood still a policeman had also turned into that street on the other side notsurely not absurd they were all alike to look atthose fellows absurd he walked on sharply and let himself into his house but on his way upstairs he could not for the life of him help raising a corner of a curtain and looking from the staircase window the policeman was marching solemnly about twentyfive yards away paying apparently no attention to anything whatever     iv  keith woke at five oclock his usual hour without remembrance but the grisly shadow started up when he entered his study where the lamp burned and the fire shone and the coffee was set ready just as when yesterday afternoon larry had stood out there against the wall for a moment he fought against realisation then drinking off his coffee sat down sullenly at the bureau to his customary three hours study of the days cases  not one word of his brief could he take in it was all jumbled with murky images and apprehensions and for full half an hour he suffered mental paralysis then the sheer necessity of knowing something of the case which he had to open at halfpast ten that morning forced him to a concentration which never quite subdued the malaise at the bottom of his heart nevertheless when he rose at halfpast eight and went into the bathroom he had earned his grim satisfaction in this victory of willpower by halfpast nine he must be at larrys a boat left london for the argentine tomorrow if larry was to get away at once money must be arranged for and then at breakfast he came on this paragraph in the paper             soho murder  enquiry late last night established the fact that the police have discovered the identity of the man found strangled yesterday morning under an archway in glove lane an arrest has been made  by good fortune he had finished eating for the words made him feel physically sick at this very minute larry might be locked up waiting to be chargedmight even have been arrested before his own visit to the girl last night if larry were arrested she must be implicated what then would be his own position idiot to go and look at that archway to go and see the girl had that policeman really followed him home accessory after the fact keith darrant kings counsel man of mark he forced himself by an effort which had something of the heroic to drop this panicky feeling panic never did good he must face it and see he refused even to hurry calmly collected the papers wanted for the day and attended to a letter or two before he set out in a taxicab to fitzroy street  waiting outside there in the grey morning for his ring to be answered he looked the very picture of a man who knew his mind a man of resolution but it needed all his willpower to ask without tremor mr darrant in to hear without sign of any kind the answer hes not up yet sir  never mind ill go in and see him mr keith darrant  on his way to laurences bedroom in the midst of utter relief he had the selfpossession to think this arrest is the best thing that could have happened itll keep their noses on a wrong scent till larrys got away the girl must be sent off too but not with him panic had ended in quite hardening his resolution he entered the bedroom with a feeling of disgust the fellow was lying there his bare arms crossed behind his tousled head staring at the ceiling and smoking one of many cigarettes whose ends littered a chair beside him whose sickly reek tainted the air that pale face with its jutting cheekbones and chin its hollow cheeks and blue eyes far sunk backwhat a wreck of goodness  he looked up at keith through the haze of smoke and said quietly well brother whats the sentence transportation for life and then to be fined forty pounds  the flippancy revolted keith it was larry all over last night horrified and humble this morning dont care and featherheaded he said sourly  oh you can joke about it now  laurence turned his face to the wall  must  fatalism how detestable were natures like that  ive been to see her he said  you  last night she can be trusted  laurence laughed  that i told you  i had to see for myself you must clear out at once larry she can come out to you by the next boat but you cant go together have you any money  no  i can foot your expenses and lend you a years income in advance but it must be a clean cut after you get out there your whereabouts must only be known to me  a long sigh answered him  youre very good to me keith youve always been very good i dont know why  keith answered drily  nor i theres a boat to the argentine tomorrow youre in luck theyve made an arrest its in the paper  what  the cigarette end dropped the thin pyjamad figure writhed up and stood clutching at the bedrail  what  the disturbing thought flitted through keiths brain i was a fool he takes it queerly what now  laurence passed his hand over his forehead and sat down on the bed  i hadnt thought of that he said it does me  keith stared in his relief that the arrested man was not laurence this had not occurred to him what folly  why he said quickly an innocent mans in no danger they always get the wrong man first its a piece of luck thats all it gives us time  how often had he not seen that expression on larrys face wistful questioning as if trying to see the thing with hiskeithseyes trying to submit to better judgment and he said almost gently  now look here larry this is too serious to trifle with dont worry about that leave it to me just get ready to be off ill take your berth and make arrangements heres some money for kit i can come round between five and six and let you know pull yourself together man as soon as the girls joined you out there youd better get across to chile the further the better you must simply lose yourself i must go now if im to get to the bank before i go down to the courts and looking very steadily at his brother he added  come youve got to think of me in this matter as well as of yourself no playing fast and loose with the arrangements understand  but still larry gazed up at him with that wistful questioning and not till he had repeated understand did he receive yes for answer  driving away he thought queer fellow i dont know him shall never know him and at once began to concentrate on the practical arrangements at his bank he drew out l400 but waiting for the notes to be counted he suffered qualms a clumsy way of doing things if there had been more time the thought accessory after the fact now infected everything notes were traceable no other way of getting him away at once though one must take lesser risks to avoid greater from the bank he drove to the office of the steamship line he had told larry he would book his passage but that would not do he must only ask anonymously if there were accommodation having discovered that there were vacant berths he drove on to the law courts if he could have taken a morning off he would have gone down to the police court and seen them charge this man but even that was not too safe with a face so well known as his what would come of this arrest nothing surely the police always took somebody up to keep the public quiet then suddenly he had again the feeling that it was all a nightmare larry had never done it the police had got the right man but instantly the memory of the girls awestricken face her figure huddling on the sofa her words i see him always falling came back god what a business  he felt he had never been more clearheaded and forcible than that morning in court when he came out for lunch he bought the most sensational of the evening papers but it was yet too early for news and he had to go back into court no whit wiser concerning the arrest when at last he threw off wig and gown and had got through a conference and other necessary work he went out to chancery lane buying a paper on the way then he hailed a cab and drove once more to fitzroy street     v  laurence had remained sitting on his bed for many minutes an innocent man in no danger keith had said itthe celebrated lawyer could he rely on that go out 8000 miles he and the girl and leave a fellowcreature perhaps in mortal peril for an act committed by himself  in the past night he had touched bottom as he thought become ready to face anything when keith came in he would without murmur have accepted the advice give yourself up he was prepared to pitch away the end of his life as he pitched from him the fagends of his cigarettes and the long sigh he had heaved hearing of reprieve had been only half relief then with incredible swiftness there had rushed through him a feeling of unutterable joy and hope clean awayinto a new country a new life the girl and he out there he wouldnt care would rejoice even to have squashed the life out of such a noisome beetle of a man out there under a new sun where blood ran quicker than in this foggy land and people took justice into their own hands for it had been justice on that brute even though he had not meant to kill him and then to hear of this arrest they would be charging the man today he could go and see the poor creature accused of the murder he himself had committed and he laughed go and see how likely it was that they might hang a fellowman in place of himself he dressed but too shaky to shave himself went out to a barbers shop while there he read the news which keith had seen in this paper the name of the arrested man was given john evan no address to be brought up on the charge at bow street yes he must go once twice three times he walked past the entrance of the court before at last he entered and screwed himself away among the tag and bobtail  the court was crowded and from the murmurs round he could tell that it was his particular case which had brought so many there in a dazed way he watched charge after charge disposed of with lightning quickness but were they never going to reach his business and then suddenly he saw the little scarecrow man of last night advancing to the dock between two policemen more ragged and miserable than ever by light of day like some shaggy wan grey animal surrounded by sleek hounds  a sort of satisfied purr was rising all round and with horror laurence perceived that thisthis was the man accused of what he himself had donethis queer battered unfortunate to whom he had shown a passing friendliness then all feeling merged in the appalling interest of listening the evidence was very short testimony of the hotelkeeper where walenn had been staying the identification of his body and of a snakeshaped ring he had been wearing at dinner that evening testimony of a pawnbroker that this same ring was pawned with him the first thing yesterday morning by the prisoner testimony of a policeman that he had noticed the man evan several times in glove lane and twice moved him on from sleeping under that arch testimony of another policeman that when arrested at midnight evan had said yes i took the ring off his finger i found him there dead  i know i oughtnt to have done it im an educated man it was stupid to pawn the ring i found him with his pockets turned inside out  fascinating and terrible to sit staring at the man in whose place he should have been to wonder when those small brightgrey bloodshot eyes would spy him out and how he would meet that glance like a baited raccoon the little man stood screwed back into a corner mournful cynical fierce with his ridged obtuse yellow face and his stubbly grey beard and hair and his eyes wandering now and again amongst the crowd but with all his might laurence kept his face unmoved then came the word remanded and more like a baited beast than ever the man was led away  laurence sat on a cold perspiration thick on his forehead someone else then had come on the body and turned the pockets inside out before john evan took the ring a man such as walenn would not be out at night without money besides if evan had found money on the body he would never have run the risk of taking that ring yes someone else had come on the body first it was for that one to come forward and prove that the ring was still on the dead mans finger when he left him and thus clear evan he clung to that thought it seemed to make him less responsible for the little mans position to remove him and his own deed one step further back if they found the person who had taken the money it would prove evans innocence he came out of the court in a sort of trance and a craving to get drunk attacked him one could not go on like this without the relief of some oblivion if he could only get drunk keep drunk till this business was decided and he knew whether he must give himself up or no he had now no fear at all of people suspecting him only fear of himselffear that he might go and give himself up now he could see the girl the danger from that was as nothing compared with the danger from his own conscience he had promised keith not to see her keith had been decent and loyal to himgood old keith but he would never understand that this girl was now all he cared about in life that he would rather be cut off from life itself than be cut off from her instead of becoming less and less she was becoming more and more to himexperience strange and thrilling out of deep misery she had grown happythrough him out of a sordid shifting life recovered coherence and bloom through devotion to him him of all people in the world it was a miracle she demanded nothing of him adored him as no other woman ever hadit was this which had anchored his drifting barque thisand her truthful mild intelligence and that burning warmth of a woman who long treated by men as but a sack of sex now loves at last  and suddenly mastering his craving to get drunk he made towards soho he had been a fool to give those keys to keith she must have been frightened by his visit and perhaps doubly miserable since knowing nothing imagining everything keith was sure to have terrified her poor little thing  down the street where he had stolen in the dark with the dead body on his back he almost ran for the cover of her house the door was opened to him before he knocked her arms were round his neck her lips pressed to his the fire was out as if she had been unable to remember to keep warm a stool had been drawn to the window and there she had evidently been sitting like a bird in a cage looking out into the grey street though she had been told that he was not to come instinct had kept her there or the pathetic aching hope against hope which lovers never part with  now that he was there her first thoughts were for his comfort the fire was lighted he must eat drink smoke there was never in her doings any of the i am doing this for you but you ought to be doing that for me which belongs to so many marriages and liaisons she was like a devoted slave so in love with the chains that she never knew she wore them and to laurence who had so little sense of property this only served to deepen tenderness and the hold she had on him he had resolved not to tell her of the new danger he ran from his own conscience but resolutions with him were but the opposites of what was sure to come and at last the words  theyve arrested someone escaped him  from her face he knew she had grasped the danger at once had divined it perhaps before he spoke but she only twined her arms round him and kissed his lips and he knew that she was begging him to put his love for her above his conscience who would ever have thought that he could feel as he did to this girl who had been in the arms of many the stained and suffering past of a loved woman awakens in some men only chivalry in others more respectable it rouses a tigerish itch a rancorous jealousy of what in the past was given to others sometimes it will do both when he had her in his arms he felt no remorse for killing the coarse handsome brute who had ruined her he savagely rejoiced in it but when she laid her head in the hollow of his shoulder turning to him her white face with the faint colourstaining on the parted lips the cheeks the eyelids when her dark wideapart brown eyes gazed up in the happiness of her abandonmenthe felt only tenderness and protection  he left her at five oclock and had not gone two streets length before the memory of the little grey vagabond screwed back in the far corner of the dock like a baited raccoon of his dreary creaking voice took possession of him again and a kind of savagery mounted in his brain against a world where one could be so tortured without having meant harm to anyone  at the door of his lodgings keith was getting out of a cab they went in together but neither of them sat down keith standing with his back to the carefully shut door laurence with his back to the table as if they knew there was a tug coming and keith said theres room on that boat go down and book your berth before they shut heres the money  im going to stick it keith  keith stepped forward and put a roll of notes on the table  now look here larry ive read the police court proceedings theres nothing in that out of prison or in prison for a few weeks its all the same to a nightbird of that sort dismiss it from your mindtheres not nearly enough evidence to convict this gives you your chance take it like a man and make a new life for yourself  laurence smiled but the smile had a touch of madness and a touch of malice he took up the notes  clear out and save the honour of brother keith put them back in your pocket keith or ill put them in the fire come take them and crossing to the fire he held them to the bars take them or in they go  keith took back the notes  ive still got some kind of honour keith if i clear out i shall have none not the rag of any left it may be worth more to me than thati cant tell yeti cant tell there was a long silence before keith answered i tell you youre mistaken no jury will convict if they did a judge would never hang on it a ghoul who can rob a dead body ought to be in prison what he did is worse than what you did if you come to that laurence lifted his face judge not brother he said the heart is a dark well keiths yellowish face grew red and swollen as though he were mastering the tickle of a bronchial cough what are you going to do then i suppose i may ask you not to be entirely oblivious of our name or is such a consideration unworthy of your honour laurence bent his head the gesture said more clearly than words dont kick a man when hes down  i dont know what im going to donothing at present im awfully sorry keith awfully sorry  keith looked at him and without another word went out     vi  to any save philosophers reputation may be threatened almost as much by disgrace to name and family as by the disgrace of self keiths instinct was always to deal actively with danger but this blow whether it fell on him by discovery or by confession could not be countered as blight falls on a rose from who knows where the scandalous murk would light on him no repulse possible not even a wriggling from under brother of a murderer hung or sent to penal servitude his daughter niece to a murderer his dead mothera murderers mother and to wait day after day week after week not knowing whether the blow would fall was an extraordinarily atrocious penance the injustice of which to a man of rectitude seemed daily the more monstrous  the remand had produced evidence that the murdered man had been drinking heavily on the night of his death and further evidence of the accuseds professional vagabondage and destitution it was shown too that for some time the archway in glove lane had been his favourite night haunt he had been committed for trial in january this time despite misgivings keith had attended the police court to his great relief larry was not there but the policeman who had come up while he was looking at the archway and given him afterwards that scare in the girls rooms was chief witness to the way the accused man haunted glove lane though keith held his silk hat high he still had the uncomfortable feeling that the man had recognised him  his conscience suffered few if any twinges for letting this man rest under the shadow of the murder he genuinely believed that there was not evidence enough to convict nor was it in him to appreciate the tortures of a vagabond shut up the scamp deserved what he had got for robbing a dead body and in any case such a scarecrow was better off in prison than sleeping out under archways in december sentiment was foreign to keiths character and his justice that of those who subordinate the fates of the weak and shiftless to the needful paramountcy of the strong and well established  his daughter came back from school for the christmas holidays it was hard to look up from her bright eyes and rosy cheeks and see this shadow hanging above his calm and ordered life as in a glowing room ones eye may catch an impending patch of darkness drawn like a spiders web across a corner of the ceiling  on the afternoon of christmas eve they went by her desire to a church in soho where the christmas oratorio was being given and coming away passed by chance of a wrong turning down borrow street ugh how that startled moment when the girl had pressed herself against him in the dark and her terrorstricken whisper oh who is it leaped out before him always that businessthat ghastly business after the trial he would have another try to get them both away and he thrust his arm within his young daughters hurrying her on out of this street where shadows filled all the winter air  but that evening when she had gone to bed he felt uncontrollably restless he had not seen larry for weeks what was he about what desperations were hatching in his disorderly brain was he very miserable had he perhaps sunk into a stupor of debauchery and the old feeling of protectiveness rose up in him a warmth born of long ago christmas eves when they had stockings hung out in the night stuffed by a santa claus whose hand never failed to tuck them up whose kiss was their nightly waft into sleep  stars were sparkling out there over the river the sky frostyclear and black bells had not begun to ring as yet and obeying an obscure deep impulse keith wrapped himself once more into his fur coat pulled a motoring cap over his eyes and sallied forth in the strand he took a cab to fitzroy street there was no light in larrys windows and on a card he saw the words to let gone had he after all cleared out for good but howwithout money and the girl bells were ringing now in the silent frostiness christmas eve and keith thought if only this wretched business were off my mind monstrous that one should suffer for the faults of others he took a route which led him past borrow street solitude brooded there and he walked resolutely down on the far side looking hard at the girls window there was a light the curtains just failed to meet so that a thin gleam shone through he crossed and after glancing swiftly up and down deliberately peered in  he only stood there perhaps twenty seconds but visual records gleaned in a moment sometimes outlast the visions of hours and days the electric light was not burning but in the centre of the room the girl was kneeling in her nightgown before a little table on which were four lighted candles her arms were crossed on her breast the candlelight shone on her fair cropped hair on the profile of cheek and chin on her bowed white neck for a moment he thought her alone then behind her saw his brother in a sleeping suit leaning against the wall with arms crossed watching it was the expression on his face which burned the whole thing in so that always afterwards he was able to see that little scenesuch an expression as could never have been on the face of one even faintly conscious that he was watched by any living thing on earth the whole of larrys heart and feeling seemed to have come up out of him yearning mockery love despair the depth of his feeling for this girl his stress of mind fears hopes the flotsam good and evil of his soul all transfigured there exposed and unforgettable the candlelight shone upward on to his face twisted by the strangest smile his eyes darker and more wistful than mortal eyes should be seemed to beseech and mock the whiteclad girl who all unconscious knelt without movement like a carved figure of devotion the words seemed coming from his lips pray for us bravo yes pray for us and suddenly keith saw her stretch out her arms and lift her face with a look of ecstasy and laurence starting forward what had she seen beyond the candle flames it is the unexpected which invests visions with poignancy nothing more strange could keith have seen in this nest of the murky and illicit but in sheer panic lest he might be caught thus spying he drew back and hurried on so larry was living there with her when the moment came he could still find him  before going in he stood full five minutes leaning on the terrace parapet before his house gazing at the starfrosted sky and the river cut by the trees into black pools oiled over by gleams from the embankment lamps and deep down behind his mere thoughts he achedsomehow somewhere ached beyond the cage of all that he saw and heard and thought he had perceived something he could not reach but the night was cold the bells silent for it had struck twelve entering his house he stole upstairs     vii  if for keith those six weeks before the glove lane murder trial came on were fraught with uneasiness and gloom they were for laurence almost the happiest since his youth from the moment when he left his rooms and went to the girls to live a kind of peace and exaltation took possession of him not by any effort of will did he throw off the nightmare hanging over him nor was he drugged by love he was in a sort of spiritual catalepsy in face of fate too powerful for his will his turmoil anxiety and even restlessness had ceased his life floated in the ether of what must come will out of this catalepsy his spirit sometimes fell headlong into black waters in one such whirlpool he was struggling on the night of christmas eve when the girl rose from her knees he asked her  what did you see  pressing close to him she drew him down on to the floor before the fire and they sat knees drawn up hands clasped like two children trying to see over the edge of the world  it was the virgin i saw she stood against the wall and smiled we shall be happy soon  when we die wanda he said suddenly let it be together we shall keep each other warm out there  huddling to him she whispered yes oh yes if you die i could not go on living  it was this utter dependence on him the feeling that he had rescued something which gave him sense of anchorage that and his buried life in the retreat of these two rooms just for an hour in the morning from nine to ten the charwoman would come but not another soul all day they never went out together he would stay in bed late while wanda bought what they needed for the days meals lying on his back hands clasped behind his head recalling her face the movements of her slim rounded supple figure robing itself before his gaze feeling again the kiss she had left on his lips the gleam of her soft eyes so strangely dark in so fair a face in a sort of trance he would lie till she came back then get up to breakfast about noon off things which she had cooked drinking coffee in the afternoon he would go out alone and walk for hours any where so long as it was east to the east there was always suffering to be seen always that which soothed him with the feeling that he and his troubles were only a tiny part of trouble that while so many other sorrowing and shadowy creatures lived he was not cut off to go west was to encourage dejection in the west all was like keith successful immaculate ordered resolute he would come back tired out and sit watching her cook their little dinner the evenings were given up to love queer trance of an existence which both were afraid to break no sign from her of wanting those excitements which girls who have lived her life even for a few months are supposed to need she never asked him to take her anywhere never in word deed look seemed anything but almost rapturously content and yet he knew and she knew that they were only waiting to see whether fate would turn her thumb down on them in these days he did not drink out of his quarters money when it came in he had paid his debtstheir expenses were very small he never went to see keith never wrote to him hardly thought of him and from those dread apparitionswalenn lying with the breath choked out of him and the little grey driven animal in the dockhe hid as only a man can who must hide or be destroyed but daily he bought a newspaper and feverishly furtively scanned its columns     viii  coming out of the law courts on the afternoon of january 28th at the triumphant end of a desperately fought will case keith saw on a poster the words glove lane murder trial and verdict and with a rush of dismay he thought good god i never looked at the paper this morning the elation which had filled him a second before the absorption he had felt for two days now in the case so hardly won seemed suddenly quite sickeningly trivial what on earth had he been doing to forget that horrible business even for an instant he stood quite still on the crowded pavement unable really unable to buy a paper but his face was like a piece of iron when he did step forward and hold his penny out there it was in the stop press glove lane murder the jury returned a verdict of guilty sentence of death was passed  his first sensation was simple irritation how had they come to commit such an imbecility monstrous the evidence then the futility of even reading the report of even considering how they had come to record such a verdict struck him with savage suddenness there it was and nothing he could do or say would alter it no condemnation of this idiotic verdict would help reverse it the situation was desperate indeed that five minutes walk from the law courts to his chambers was the longest he had ever taken  men of decided character little know beforehand what they will do in certain contingencies for the imaginations of decided people do not endow mere contingencies with sufficient actuality keith had never really settled what he was going to do if this man were condemned often in those past weeks he had said to himself of course if they bring him in guilty thats another thing but now that they had he was beset by exactly the same old arguments and feelings the same instincts of loyalty and protection towards laurence and himself intensified by the fearful imminence of the danger and yet here was this man about to be hung for a thing he had not done nothing could get over that but then he was such a worthless vagabond a ghoul who had robbed a dead body if larry were condemned in his stead would there be any less miscarriage of justice to strangle a brute who had struck you by the accident of keeping your hands on his throat a few seconds too long was there any more guilt in thatwas there even as much as in deliberate theft from a dead man reverence for order for justice and established fact will often march shoulder to shoulder with jesuitry in natures to whom success is vital  in the narrow stone passage leading to his staircase a friend had called out bravo darrant that was a squeak congratulations and with a bitter little smile keith thought congratulations i  at the first possible moment the hurried back to the strand and hailing a cab he told the man to put him down at a turning near to borrow street  it was the girl who opened to his knock startled clasping her hands she looked strange to keith in her black skirt and blouse of some soft velvety stuff the colour of faded roses her round rather long throat was bare and keith noticed fretfully that she wore gold earrings her eyes so pitch dark against her white face and the short fair hair which curled into her neck seemed both to search and to plead  my brother  he is not in sir yet  do you know where he is  no  he is living with you here now  yes  are you still as fond of him as ever then  with a movement as though she despaired of words she clasped her hands over her heart and he said  i see  he had the same strange feeling as on his first visit to her and when through the chink in the curtains he had watched her kneelingof pity mingled with some faint sexual emotion and crossing to the fire he asked  may i wait for him  oh please will you sit down  but keith shook his head and with a catch in her breath she said  you will not take him from me i should die  he turned round on her sharply  i dont want him taken from you i want to help you keep him are you ready to go away at any time  yes oh yes  and he  she answered almost in a whisper  yes but there is that poor man  that poor man is a graveyard thief a hyena a ghoulnot worth consideration and the rasp in his own voice surprised him  ah she sighed but i am sorry for him perhaps he was hungry i have been hungryyou do things then that you would not and perhaps he has no one to love if you have no one to love you can be very bad i think of him oftenin prison  between his teeth keith muttered and laurence  we do never speak of it we are afraid  hes not told you then about the trial  her eyes dilated  the trial oh he was strange last night this morning too he got up early is itis it over  yes  what has come  guilty  for a moment keith thought she was going to faint she had closed her eyes and swayed so that he took a step and put his hands on her arms  listen he said help me dont let laurence out of your sight we must have time i must see what they intend to do they cant be going to hang this man i must have time i tell you you must prevent his giving himself up  she stood staring in his face while he still held her arms gripping into her soft flesh through the velvety sleeves  do you understand  yesbut if he has already  keith felt the shiver which ran through her and the thought rushed into his mind my god suppose the police come round while im here if larry had indeed gone to them if that policeman who had seen him here the night after the murder should find him here again just after the verdict he said almost fiercely  can i trust you not to let larry out of your sight quick answer  clasping her hands to her breast she answered humbly  i will try  if he hasnt already done this watch him like a lynx dont let him go out without you ill come tomorrow morning early youre a catholic arent you swear to me that you wont let him do anything till hes seen me again  she did not answer looking past him at the door and keith heard a key in the latch there was laurence himself holding in his hand a great bunch of pink lilies and white narcissi his face was pale and haggard he said quietly  hallo keith  the girls eyes were fastened on larrys face and keith looking from one to the other knew that he had never had more need for wariness  have you seen he said  laurence nodded his expression as a rule so telltale of his emotions baffled keith utterly  well  ive been expecting it  the thing cant standthats certain but i must have time to look into the report i must have time to see what i can do dyou understand me larryi must have time he knew he was talking at random the only thing was to get them away at once out of reach of confession but he dared not say so  promise me that youll do nothing that you wont go out even till ive seen you tomorrow morning  again laurence nodded and keith looked at the girl would she see that he did not break that promise her eyes were still fixed immovably on larrys face and with the feeling that he could get no further keith turned to go  promise me he said  laurence answered i promise  he was smiling keith could make nothing of that smile nor of the expression in the girls eyes and saying i have your promise i rely on it he went     ix  to keep from any woman who loves knowledge of her lovers mood is as hard as to keep music from moving the heart but when that woman has lived in suffering and for the first time knows the comfort of love then let the lover try as he may to disguise his heartno use yet by virtue of subtler abnegation she will often succeed in keeping it from him that she knows  when keith was gone the girl made no outcry asked no questions managed that larry should not suspect her intuition all that evening she acted as if she knew of nothing preparing within him and through him within herself  his words caresses the very zest with which he helped her to prepare the feast the flowers he had brought the wine he made her drink the avoidance of any word which could spoil their happiness allall told her he was too inexorably gay and loving not for herto whom every word and every kiss had uncannily the desperate value of a last word and kissnot for her to deprive herself of these by any sign or gesture which might betray her prescience poor soulshe took all and would have taken more a hundredfold she did not want to drink the wine he kept tilting into her glass but with the acceptance learned by women who have lived her life she did not refuse she had never refused him anything so much had been required of her by the detestable that anything required by a loved one was but an honour  laurence drank deeply but he had never felt clearer never seen things more clearly the wine gave him what he wanted an edge to these few hours of pleasure an exaltation of energy it dulled his sense of pity too it was pity he was afraid offor himself and for this girl to make even this tawdry room look beautiful with firelight and candlelight dark amber wine in the glasses tall pink lilies spilling their saffron exuding their hot perfume he and even himself must look their best and with a weight as of lead on her heart she managed that for him letting him strew her with flowers and crush them together with herself not even music was lacking to their feast someone was playing a pianola across the street and the sound very faint came stealing when they were silentswelling sinking festive mournful having a faroff life of its own like the flickering fireflames before which they lay embraced or the lilies delicate between the candles listening to that music tracing with his finger the tiny veins on her breast he lay like one recovering from a swoon no parting none but sleep as the firelight sleeps when flames die as music sleeps on its deserted strings  and the girl watched him  it was nearly ten when he bade her go to bed and after she had gone obedient into the bedroom he brought ink and paper down by the fire the drifter the unstable the goodfornothingdid not falter he had thought when it came to the point he would fail himself but a sort of rage bore him forward if he lived on and confessed they would shut him up take from him the one thing he loved cut him off from her sand up his only well in the desert curse them and he wrote by firelight which mellowed the white sheets of paper while against the dark curtain the girl in her nightgown unconscious of the cold stood watching  men when they drown remember their pasts like the lost poet he had gone with the wind now it was for him to be true in his fashion a man may falter for weeks and weeks consciously subconsciously even in his dreams till there comes that moment when the only thing impossible is to go on faltering the black cap the little driven grey man looking up at it with a sort of wonderfaltering had ceased  he had finished now and was but staring into the fire           no more no more the moon is dead           and all the people in it           the poppy maidens strew the bed           well come in half a minute  why did doggerel start up in the mind like that wanda the weedflower become so rare he would not be parted from her the fire the candles and the fireno more the flame and flicker  and by the dark curtain the girl watched     x  keith went not home but to his club and in the room devoted to the reception of guests empty at this hour he sat down and read the report of the trial the fools had made out a case that looked black enough and for a long time on the thick soft carpet which let out no sound of footfall he paced up and down thinking he might see the defending counsel might surely do that as an expert who thought there had been miscarriage of justice they must appeal a petition too might be started in the last event the thing couldmust be put right yet if only larry and that girl did nothing  he had no appetite but the custom of dining is too strong and while he ate he glanced with irritation at his fellowmembers they looked so at their ease unjustthat this black cloud should hang over one blameless as any of them friends connoisseurs of such thingsa judge among themcame specially to his table to express their admiration of his conduct of that will case tonight he had real excuse for pride but he felt none yet in this wellwarmed quietly glowing room filled with decorously eating decorously talking men he gained insensibly some comfort this surely was reality that shadowy business out there only the drear sound of a wind one must and did keep outlike the poverty and grime which had no real existence for the secure and prosperous he drank champagne it helped to fortify reality to make shadows seem more shadowy and down in the smokingroom he sat before the fire in one of those chairs which embalm afterdinner dreams he grew sleepy there and at eleven oclock rose to go home but when he had once passed down the shallow marble steps out through the revolving door which let in no draughts he was visited by fear as if he had drawn it in with the breath of the january wind larrys face and the girl watching it why had she watched like that larrys smile and the flowers in his hand buying flowers at such a moment the girl was his slavewhatever he told her she would do but she would never be able to stop him at this very moment he might be rushing to give himself up  his hand thrust deep into the pocket of his fur coat came in contact suddenly with something cold the keys larry had given him all that time ago there they had lain forgotten ever since the chance touch decided him he turned off towards borrow street walking at full speed he could but go again and see he would sleep better if he knew that he had left no stone unturned at the corner of that dismal street he had to wait for solitude before he made for the house which he now loathed with a deadly loathing he opened the outer door and shut it to behind him he knocked but no one came perhaps they had gone to bed again and again he knocked then opened the door stepped in and closed it carefully candles lighted the fire burning cushions thrown on the floor in front of it and strewn with flowers the table too covered with flowers and with the remnants of a meal through the halfdrawn curtain he could see that the inner room was also lighted had they gone out leaving everything like this gone out his heart beat bottles larry had been drinking  had it really come must he go back home with this murk on him knowing that his brother was a confessed and branded murderer he went quickly to the halfdrawn curtains and looked in against the wall he saw a bed and those two in it he recoiled in sheer amazement and relief asleep with curtains undrawn lights left on asleep through all his knocking they must both be drunk the blood rushed up in his neck asleep and rushing forward again he called out larry then with a gasp he went towards the bed larry no answer no movement seizing his brothers shoulder he shook it violently it felt cold they were lying in each others arms breast to breast lips to lips their faces white in the light shining above the dressingtable and such a shudder shook keith that he had to grasp the brass rail above their heads then he bent down and wetting his finger placed it close to their joined lips no two could ever swoon so utterly as that not even a drunken sleep could be so fast his wet finger felt not the faintest stir of air nor was there any movement in the pulses of their hands no breath no life the eyes of the girl were closed how strangely innocent she looked larrys open eyes seemed to be gazing at her shut eyes but keith saw that they were sightless with a sort of sob he drew down the lids then by an impulse that he could never have explained he laid a hand on his brothers head and a hand on the girls fair hair the clothes had fallen down a little from her bare shoulder he pulled them up as if to keep her warm and caught the glint of metal a tiny gilt crucifix no longer than a thumbnail on a thread of steel chain had slipped down from her breast into the hollow of the arm which lay round larrys neck keith buried it beneath the clothes and noticed an envelope pinned to the coverlet bending down he read please give this at once to the policelaurence darrant he thrust it into his pocket like elastic stretched beyond its uttermost his reason will faculties of calculation and resolve snapped to within him he thought with incredible swiftness i must know nothing of this i must go and almost before he knew that he had moved he was out again in the street  he could never have told of what he thought while he was walking home he did not really come to himself till he was in his study there with a trembling hand he poured himself out whisky and drank it off if he had not chanced to go there the charwoman would have found them when she came in the morning and given that envelope to the police he took it out he had a righta right to know what was in it he broke it open   i laurence darrant about to die by my own hand declare that this is a solemn and true confession i committed what is known as the glove lane murder on the night of november the 27th last in the following wayon and on to the last wordswe didnt want to die but we could not bear separation and i couldnt face letting an innocent man be hung for me i do not see any other way i beg that there may be no postmortem on our bodies the stuff we have taken is some of that which will be found on the dressingtable please bury us together  laurence darrant  january the 28th about ten oclock pm   full five minutes keith stood with those sheets of paper in his hand while the clock ticked the wind moaned a little in the trees outside the flames licked the logs with the quiet click and ruffle of their intense faraway life down there on the hearth then he roused himself and sat down to read the whole again  there it was just as larry had told it to himnothing left out very clear even to the addresses of people who could identify the girl as having once been walenns wife or mistress it would convince yes it would convince  the sheets dropped from his hand very slowly he was grasping the appalling fact that on the floor beside his chair lay the life or death of yet another man that by taking this confession he had taken into his own hands the fate of the vagabond lying under sentence of death that he could not give him back his life without incurring the smirch of this disgrace without even endangering himself if he let this confession reach the authorities he could never escape the gravest suspicion that he had known of the whole affair during these two months he would have to attend the inquest be recognised by that policeman as having come to the archway to see where the body had lain as having visited the girl the very evening after the murder who would believe in the mere coincidence of such visits on the part of the murderers brother but apart from that suspicion the fearful scandal which so sensational an affair must make would mar his career his life his young daughters life larrys suicide with this girl would make sensation enough as it was but nothing to that other such a death had its romance involved him in no way save as a mourner could perhaps even be hushed up the othernothing could hush that up nothing prevent its ringing to the housetops he got up from his chair and for many minutes roamed the room unable to get his mind to bear on the issue images kept starting up before him the face of the man who handed him wig and gown each morning puffy and curious with a leer on it he had never noticed before his young daughters lifted eyebrows mouth drooping eyes troubled the tiny gilt crucifix glinting in the hollow of the dead girls arm the sightless look in larrys unclosed eyes even his own thumb and finger pulling the lids down and then he saw a street and endless people passing turning to stare at him and stopping in his tramp he said aloud let them go to hell seven days wonder was he not trustee to that confession trustee after all he had done nothing to be ashamed of even if he had kept knowledge dark a brother who could blame him and he picked up those sheets of paper but like a great murky hand the scandal spread itself about him its coarse malignant voice seemed shouting paiper paiper glove lane murder suicide and confession of brother of wellknown kc wellknown kcs brother murder and suicide paiper was he to let loose that flood of foulness was he who had done nothing to smirch his own little daughters life to smirch his dead brother their dead motherhimself his own valuable important future and all for a sewer rat let him hang let the fellow hang if he must and that was not certain appeal petition he mighthe should be saved to have got thus far and then by his own action topple himself down  with a sudden darting movement he thrust the confession in among the burning coals and a smile licked at the folds in his dark face like those flames licking the sheets of paper till they writhed and blackened with the toe of his boot he dispersed their scorched and crumbling wafer stamp them in stamp in that mans life burnt no more doubts no more of this gnawing fear burnt a manan innocentsewer rat recoiling from the fire he grasped his forehead it was burning hot and seemed to be going round  well it was done only fools without will or purpose regretted and suddenly he laughed so larry had died for nothing he had no will no purpose and was dead he and that girl might now have been living loving each other in the warm night away at the other end of the world instead of lying dead in the cold night here fools and weaklings regretted suffered from conscience and remorse a man trod firmly held to his purpose no matter what  he went to the window and drew back the curtain what was that a gibbet in the air a body hanging ah only the treesthe dark treesthe winter skeleton trees recoiling he returned to his armchair and sat down before the fire it had been shining like that the lamp turned low his chair drawn up when larry came in that afternoon two months ago bah he had never come at all it was a nightmare he had been asleep how his head burned and leaping up he looked at the calendar on his bureau january the 28th no dream his face hardened and darkened on not like larry on 1914     a stoic  i  1           aequam memento rebus in arduis           servare mentemhorace  in the city of liverpool on a january day of 1905 the boardroom of the island navigation company rested as it were after the labours of the afternoon the long table was still littered with the ink pens blottingpaper and abandoned documents of six personsa deserted battlefield of the brain and lonely in his chairmans seat at the top end old sylvanus heythorp sat with closed eyes still and heavy as an image one puffy feeble hand whose fingers quivered rested on the arm of his chair the thick white hair on his massive head glistened in the light from a greenshaded lamp he was not asleep for every now and then his sanguine cheeks filled and a sound half sigh half grunt escaped his thick lips between a white moustache and the tiny tuft of white hairs above his cleft chin sunk in the chair that square thick trunk of a body in short blackbraided coat seemed divested of all neck  young gilbert farney secretary of the island navigation company entering his hushed boardroom stepped briskly to the table gathered some papers and stood looking at his chairman not more than thirtyfive with the bright hues of the optimist in his hair beard cheeks and eyes he had a nose and lips which curled ironically for in his view he was the company and its board did but exist to chequer his importance five days in the week for seven hours a day he wrote and thought and wove the threads of its business and this lot came down once a week for two or three hours and taught their grandmother to suck eggs but watching that redcheeked whitehaired somnolent figure his smile was not so contemptuous as might have been expected for after all the chairman was a wonderful old boy a man of go and insight could not but respect him eighty half paralysed over head and ears in debt having gone the pace all his lifeor so they saidtill at last that mine in ecuador had done for himbefore the secretarys day of course but he had heard of it the old chap had bought it up on specde laudace toujours de laudace as he was so fond of sayingpaid for it half in cash and half in promises and thenthe thing had turned out empty and left him with l20000 worth of the old shares unredeemed the old boy had weathered it out without a bankruptcy so far indomitable old buffer and never fussy like the rest of them young farney though a secretary was capable of attachment and his eyes expressed a pitying affection the board meeting had been long and snadgya final settling of that pillin business rum go the chairman forcing it on them like this and with quiet satisfaction the secretary thought and he never would have got it through if i hadnt made up my mind that it really is good business for to expand the company was to expand himself still to buy four ships with the freight market so depressed was a bit startling and there would be opposition at the general meeting never mind he and the chairman could put it throughput it through and suddenly he saw the old man looking at him  only from those eyes could one appreciate the strength of life yet flowing underground in that wellnigh helpless carcasedeepcoloured little blue wells tiny jovial round windows  a sigh travelled up through layers of flesh and he said almost inaudibly  have they come mr farney  yes sir ive put them in the transfer office said youd be with them in a minute but i wasnt going to wake you  havent been asleep help me up  grasping the edge of the table with his trembling hands the old man pulled and with farney heaving him behind attained his feet he stood about five feet ten and weighed fully fourteen stone not corpulent but very thick all through his round and massive head alone would have outweighed a baby with eyes shut he seemed to be trying to get the better of his own weight then he moved with the slowness of a barnacle towards the door the secretary watching him thought marvellous old chap how he gets about by himself is a miracle and he cant retire they saylives on his fees  but the chairman was through the green baize door at his tortoise gait he traversed the inner office where the youthful clerks suspended their figuringto grin behind his backand entered the transfer office where eight gentlemen were sitting seven rose and one did not old heythorp raised a saluting hand to the level of his chest and moving to an armchair lowered himself into it  well gentlemen  one of the eight gentlemen got up again  mr heythorp weve appointed mr brownbee to voice our views mr brownbee and down he sat  mr brownbee rose a stoutish man some seventy years of age with little grey side whiskers and one of those utterly steady faces only to be seen in england faces which convey the sense of business from father to son for generations faces which make wars and passion and free thought seem equally incredible faces which inspire confidence and awaken in one a desire to get up and leave the room mr brownbee rose and said in a suave voice  mr heythorp we here represent about l14000 when we had the pleasure of meeting you last july you will recollect that you held out a prospect of some more satisfactory arrangement by christmas we are now in january and i am bound to say we none of us get younger  from the depths of old heythorp a preliminary rumble came travelling reached the surface and materialised  dont know about youfeel a boy myself  the eight gentlemen looked at him was he going to try and put them off again mr brownbee said with unruffled calm  im sure were very glad to hear it but to come to the point we have felt mr heythorp and im sure you wont think it unreasonable thaterbankruptcy would be the most satisfactory solution we have waited a long time and we want to know definitely where we stand for to be quite frank we dont see any prospect of improvement indeed we fear the opposite  you think im going to join the majority  this plumping out of what was at the back of their minds produced in mr brownbee and his colleagues a sort of chemical disturbance they coughed moved their feet and turned away their eyes till the one who had not risen a solicitor named ventnor said bluffly  well put it that way if you like  old heythorps little deep eyes twinkled  my grandfather lived to be a hundred my father ninetysixboth of them rips im only eighty gentlemen blameless life compared with theirs  indeed mr brownbee said we hope you have many years of this life before you  more of this than of another and a silence fell till old heythorp added youre getting a thousand a year out of my fees mistake to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs ill make it twelve hundred if you force me to resign my directorships by bankruptcy you wont get a rap you know  mr brownbee cleared his throat  we think mr heythorp you should make it at least fifteen hundred in that case we might perhaps consider  old heythorp shook his head  we can hardly accept your assertion that we should get nothing in the event of bankruptcy we fancy you greatly underrate the possibilities fifteen hundred a year is the least you can do for us  see you dd first  another silence followed then ventnor the solicitor said irascibly  we know where we are then  brownbee added almost nervously  are we to understand that twelve hundred a year is youryour last word  old heythorp nodded come again this day month and ill see what i can do for you and he shut his eyes  round mr brownbee six of the gentlemen gathered speaking in low voices mr ventnor nursed a leg and glowered at old heythorp who sat with his eyes closed mr brownbee went over and conferred with mr ventnor then clearing his throat he said  well sir we have considered your proposal we agree to accept it for the moment we will come again as you suggest in a months time  we hope that you will by then have seen your way to something more substantial with a view to avoiding what we should all regret but which i fear will otherwise become inevitable  old heythorp nodded the eight gentlemen took their hats and went out one by one mr brownbee courteously bringing up the rear  the old man who could not get up without assistance stayed musing in his chair he had diddled em for the moment into giving him another month and when that month was uphe would diddle em again a month ought to make the pillin business safe with all that hung on it that poor funkey chap joe pillin a gurgling chuckle escaped his red lips what a shadow the fellow had looked trotting in that evening just a month ago behind his valets announcement mr pillin sir  what a parchmenty precise threadpaper of a chap with his birds claw of a hand and his muffledup throat and his quavery  how do you do sylvanus im afraid youre not  first rate sit down have some port  port i never drink it poison to me poison  do you good  oh i know thats what you always say  youve a monstrous constitution sylvanus if i drank port and smoked cigars and sat up till one oclock i should be in my grave

knew you anything else joe  a quavering cough and out it had come  nowin a wordwont your island navigation company buy my ships  a pause a twinkle a puff of smoke make it worth my while he had said it in jest and then in a flash the idea had come to him rosamund and her youngsters what a chance to put something between them and destitution when he had joined the majority and so he said we dont want your silly ships  that claw of a hand waved in deprecation theyre very good shipsdoing quite well its only my wretched health if i were a strong man i shouldnt dream  what dyou want for em good lord how he jumped if you asked him a plain question the chap was as nervous as a guineafowl  here are the figuresfor the last four years i think youll agree that i couldnt ask less than seventy thousand  through the smoke of his cigar old heythorp had digested those figures slowly joe pillin feeling his teeth and sucking lozenges the while then he said  sixty thousand and out of that you pay me ten per cent if i get it through for you take it or leave it  my dear sylvanus thats almostcynical  too good a priceyoull never get it without me  but abut a commission you could never disclose it  arrange that all right think it over freightsll go lower yet have some port  no no thank you no so you think freights will go lower  sure of it  well ill be going im sure i dont know itsitsi must think  think your hardest  yes yes goodbye i cant imagine how you still go on smoking those things and drinking port  see you in your grave yet joe what a feeble smile the poor fellow had laughhe couldnt and alone again he had browsed developing the idea which had come to him  though to dwell in the heart of shipping sylvanus heythorp had lived at liverpool twenty years he was from the eastern counties of a family so old that it professed to despise the conquest each of its generations occupied nearly twice as long as those of less tenacious men traditionally of danish origin its men folk had as a rule bright reddishbrown hair red cheeks large round heads excellent teeth and poor morals they had done their best for the population of any county in which they had settled their offshoots swarmed born in the early twenties of the nineteenth century sylvanus heythorp after an education broken by escapades both at school and college had fetched up in that simple london of the late forties where claret opera and eight per cent for your money ruled a cheery roost made partner in his shipping firm well before he was thirty he had sailed with a wet sheet and a flowing tide dancers claret cliquot and piquet a cab with a tiger some travelall that delicious earlyvictorian consciousness of nothing save a golden time it was all so full and mellow that he was forty before he had his only love affair of any depthwith the daughter of one of his own clerks a liaison so awkward as to necessitate a sedulous concealment the death of that girl after three years leaving him a natural son had been the chief perhaps the only real sorrow of his life five years later he married what for god only knew as he was in the habit of remarking his wife had been a hard worldly wellconnected woman who presented him with two unnatural children a girl and a boy and grew harder more worldly less handsome in the process the migration to liverpool which took place when he was sixty and she fortytwo broke what she still had of heart but she lingered on twelve years finding solace in bridge and being haughty towards liverpool old heythorp saw her to her rest without regret he had felt no love for her whatever and practically none for her two childrenthey were in his view colourless pragmatical very unexpected characters his son ernestin the admiraltyhe thought a poor careful stick his daughter adela an excellent manager delighting in spiritual conversation and the society of tame men rarely failed to show him that she considered him a hopeless heathen they saw as little as need be of each other she was provided for under that settlement he had made on her mother fifteen years ago well before the not altogether unexpected crisis in his affairs very different was the feeling he had bestowed on that son of his under the rose the boy who had always gone by his mothers name of larne had on her death been sent to some relations of hers in ireland and there brought up he had been called to the dublin bar and married young a girl half cornish and half irish presently having cost old heythorp in all a pretty penny he had died impecunious leaving his fair rosamund at thirty with a girl of eight and a boy of five she had not spent six months of widowhood before coming over from dublin to claim the old mans guardianship a remarkably pretty woman like a fullblown rose with greenish hazel eyes she had turned up one morning at the offices of the island navigation company accompanied by her two childrenfor he had never divulged to them his private address and since then they had always been more or less on his hands occupying a small house in a suburb of liverpool he visited them there but never asked them to the house in sefton park which was in fact his daughters so that his proper family and friends were unaware of their existence  rosamund larne was one of those precarious ladies who make uncertain incomes by writing fullbodied storyettes in the most dismal circumstances she enjoyed a buoyancy bordering on the indecent which always amused old heythorps cynicism but of his grandchildren phyllis and jock wild as colts he had become fond and this chance of getting six thousand pounds settled on them at a stroke had seemed to him nothing but heavensent as things were if he went offand of course he might at any moment there wouldnt be a penny for them for he would cut up a good fifteen thousand to the bad he was now giving them some three hundred a year out of his fees and dead directors unfortunately earned no fees six thousand pounds at four and a half per cent settled so that their mother couldnt blue it would give them a certain two hundred and fifty pounds a yearbetter than beggary and the more he thought the better he liked it if only that shaky chap joe pillin didnt shy off when hed bitten his nails short over it  four evenings later the shaky chap had again appeared at his house in sefton park  ive thought it over sylvanus i dont like it  no but youll do it  its a sacrifice fiftyfour thousand for four shipsit means a considerable reduction in my income  it means security my boy  well there is that but you know i really cant be

interview he had thought the beggarll jump  and the beggar had that settlement was drawn and only awaited signature the board today had decided on the purchase and all that remained was to get it ratified at the general meeting let him but get that over and this provision for his grandchildren made and he would snap his fingers at brownbee and his crewthe canting humbugs hope you have many years of this life before you as if they cared for anything but his moneytheir money rather and becoming conscious of the length of his reverie he grasped the arms of his chair heaved at his own bulk in an effort to rise growing redder and redder in face and neck it was one of the hundred things his doctor had told him not to do for fear of apoplexy the humbug why didnt farney or one of those young fellows come and help him up to call out was undignified but was he to sit there all night three times he failed and after each failure sat motionless again crimson and exhausted the fourth time he succeeded and slowly made for the office passing through he stopped and said in his extinct voice  you young gentlemen had forgotten me  mr farney said you didnt wish to be disturbed sir  very good of him give me my hat and coat  yes sir  thank you what time is it  six oclock sir  tell mr farney to come and see me tomorrow at noon about my speech for the general meeting  yes sir  goodnight to you  goodnight sir  at his tortoise gait he passed between the office stools to the door opened it feebly and slowly vanished  shutting the door behind him a clerk said  poor old chairman hes on his last  another answered  gosh hes a tough old hulk hell go down fightin     2  issuing from the offices of the island navigation company sylvanus heythorp moved towards the corner whence he always took tram to sefton park the crowded street had all that prosperous air of catching or missing something which characterises the town where london and new york and dublin meet old heythorp had to cross to the far side and he sallied forth without regard to traffic that snaillike passage had in it a touch of the sublime the old man seemed saying knock me down and be dd to youim not going to hurry his life was saved perhaps ten times a day by the british character at large compounded of phlegm and a liking to take something under its protection the tram conductors on that line were especially used to him never failing to catch him under the arms and heave him like a sack of coals while with trembling hands he pulled hard at the rail and strap  all right sir  thank you  he moved into the body of the tram where somebody would always get up from kindness and the fear that he might sit down on them and there he stayed motionless his little eyes tight closed with his red face tuft of white hairs above his square cleft block of shaven chin and his big highcrowned bowler hat which yet seemed too petty for his head with its thick hairhe looked like some kind of an idol dug up and decked out in gear a size too small  one of those voices of young men from public schools and exchanges where things are bought and sold said  how de do mr heythorp  old heythorp opened his eyes that sleek cub joe pillins son what a young pupwith his round eyes and his round cheeks and his little moustache his fur coat his spats his diamond pin  hows your father he said  thanks rather below par worryin about his ships suppose you havent any news for him sir  old heythorp nodded the young man was one of his pet abominations embodying all the complacent littleheaded mediocrity of this new generation natty fellows all turned out of the same mould sippers and tasters chaps without drive or capacity without even vices and he did not intend to gratify the cubs curiosity  come to my house he said ill give you a note for him  thaanks id like to cheer the old man up  the old man cheeky brat and closing his eyes he relapsed into immobility the tram wound and ground its upward way and he mused when he was that cubs agetwentyeight or whatever it might behe had done most things been up vesuvius driven fourinhand lost his last penny on the derby and won it back on the oaks known all the dancers and operatic stars of the day fought a duel with a yankee at dieppe and winged him for saying through his confounded nose that old england was played out been a controlling voice already in his shipping firm drunk five other of the best men in london under the table broken his neck steeplechasing shot a burglar in the legs been nearly drowned for a bet killed snipe in chelsea been to court for his sins stared a ghost out of countenance and travelled with a lady of spain if this young pup had done the last it would be all he had and yet no doubt he would call himself a spark  the conductor touched his arm  ere you are sir  thank you  he lowered himself to the ground and moved in the bluish darkness towards the gate of his daughters house bob pillin walked beside him thinking poor old josser he is gettin a back number and he said i should have thought you ought to drive sir my old guvnor would knock up at once if he went about at night like this  the answer rumbled out into the misty air  your fathers got no chest never had  bob pillin gave vent to one of those fat cackles which come so readily from a certain type of man and old heythorp thought  laughing at his father parrot  they had reached the porch  a woman with dark hair and a thin straight face and figure was arranging some flowers in the hall she turned and said  you really ought not to be so late father its wicked at this time of year who is itoh mr pillin how do you do have you had tea wont you come to the drawingroom or do you want to see my father  thaanks i believe your father and he thought by jove the old chap is a caution for old heythorp was crossing the hall without having paid the faintest attention to his daughter murmuring again  thaanks awfully he wants to give me something he followed miss heythorp was not his style at all he had a kind of dread of that thin woman who looked as if she could never be unbuttoned they said she was a great churchgoer and all that sort of thing  in his sanctum old heythorp had moved to his writingtable and was evidently anxious to sit down  shall i give you a hand sir  receiving a shake of the head bob pillin stood by the fire and watched the old sport liked to paddle his own canoe fancy having to lower yourself into a chair like that when an old johnny got to such a state it was really a mercy when he snuffed out and made way for younger men how his companies could go on putting up with such a fossil for chairman was a marvel the fossil rumbled and said in that almost inaudible voice  i suppose youre beginning to look forward to your fathers shoes  bob pillins mouth opened the voice went on  dibs and no responsibility tell him from me to drink portadd five years to his life  to this unwarranted attack bob pillin made no answer save a laugh he perceived that a manservant had entered the room  a mrs larne sir will you see her  at this announcement the old man seemed to try and start then he nodded and held out the note he had written bob pillin received it together with the impression of a murmur which sounded like scratch a poll poll and passing the fine figure of a woman in a fur coat who seemed to warm the air as she went by he was in the hall again before he perceived that he had left his hat  a young and pretty girl was standing on the bearskin before the fire looking at him with roundeyed innocence he thought this is better i mustnt disturb them for my hat and approaching the fire said  jolly cold isnt it  the girl smiled yesjolly  he noticed that she had a large bunch of violets at her breast a lot of fair hair a short straight nose and round bluegrey eyes very frank and open er he said ive left my hat in there  what larks and at her little clear laugh something moved within bob pillin  you know this house well  she shook her head but its rather scrummy isnt it  bob pillin who had never yet thought so answered  quite ok  the girl threw up her head to laugh again ok whats that  bob pillin saw her white round throat and thought she is a ripper and he said with a certain desperation  my names pillin yours is larne isnt it are you a relation here  hes our guardy isnt he a chook  that rumbling whisper like scratch a poll poll recurring to bob pillin he said with reservation  you know him better than i do oh arent you his grandson or something  bob pillin did not cross himself  lord no my dads an old friend of his thats all  is your dad like him  not much  what a pity it would have been lovely if theyd been tweedles  bob pillin thought this bit is something new i wonder what her christian name is and he said  what did your godfather and godmothers in your baptism  the girl laughed she seemed to laugh at everything  phyllis  could he say is my only joy better keep it butfor what he wouldnt see her again if he didnt look out and he said  i live at the last house in the parkthe red one dyou know it where do you  oh a long way23 millicent villas its a poky little house i hate it we have awful larks though  who are we  mother and myself and jockhes an awful boy you cant conceive what an awful boy he is hes got nearly red hair i think hell be just like guardy when he gets old hes awful  bob pillin murmured  i should like to see him  would you ill ask mother if you can you wont want to again he goes off all the time like a squib she threw back her head and again bob pillin felt a little giddy he collected himself and drawled  are you going in to see your guardy  no mothers got something special to say weve never been here before you see isnt he fun though  fun  i think hes the greatest lark but hes awfully nice to me jock calls him the last of the stoicuns  a voice called from old heythorps den  phyllis it had a particular ring that voice as if coming from beautifully formed red lips of which the lower one must curve the least bit over it had too a caressing vitality and a kind of warm falsity  the girl threw a laughing look back over her shoulder and vanished through the door into the room  bob pillin remained with his back to the fire and his puppy round eyes fixed on the air that her figure had last occupied he was experiencing a sensation never felt before those travels with a lady of spain charitably conceded him by old heythorp had so far satisfied the emotional side of this young man they had stopped short at brighton and scarborough and been preserved from even the slightest intrusion of love a calculated and hygienic career had caused no anxiety either to himself or his father and this sudden swoop of something more than admiration gave him an uncomfortable choky feeling just above his high round collar and in the temples a sort of buzzingthose first symptoms of chivalry a man of the world does not however succumb without a struggle and if his hat had not been out of reach who knows whether he would not have left the house hurriedly saying to himself no no my boy millicent villas is hardly your form when your intentions are honourable for somehow that round and laughing face bob of glistening hair those wideopened grey eyes refused to awaken the beginnings of other intentionssuch is the effect of youth and innocence on even the steadiest young men with a kind of moral stammer he was thinking can idare i offer to see them to their tram couldnt i even nip out and get the car round and send them home in it no i might miss thembetter stick it out here what a jolly laugh what a tipping facestrawberries and cream hay and all that millicent villas and he wrote it on his cuff  the door was opening he heard that warm vibrating voice come along phyllisthe girls laugh so high and fresh righto coming and with perhaps the first real tremor he had ever known he crossed to the front door all the more chivalrous to escort them to the tram without a hat and suddenly he heard ive got your hat young man and her mothers voice warm and simulating shock phyllis you awful gairl did you ever see such an awful gairl mr  pillin mother  and thenhe did not quite know howinsulated from the january air by laughter and the scent of fur and violets he was between them walking to their tram it was like an experience out of the arabian nights or something of that sort an intoxication which made one say one was going their way though one would have to come all the way back in the same beastly tram nothing so warming had ever happened to him as sitting between them on that drive so that he forgot the note in his pocket and his desire to relieve the anxiety of the old man his father at the trams terminus they all got out there issued a purr of invitation to come and see them some time a clear jockll love to see you a low laugh you awful gairl and a flash of cunning zigzagged across his brain taking off his hat he said  thanks awfully rather and put his foot back on the step of the tram thus did he delicately expose the depths of his chivalry  oh you said you were going our way what oneers you do tell oh the words were as music the sight of those eyes growing rounder the most perfect he had ever seen and mrs larnes low laugh so warm yet so preoccupied and the tips of the girls fingers waving back above her head he heaved a sigh and knew no more till he was seated at his club before a bottle of champagne home not he he wished to drink and dream the old man would get his news all right tomorrow     3  the words a mrs larne to see you sir had been of a nature to astonish weaker nerves what had brought her here she knew she mustnt come old heythorp had watched her entrance with cynical amusement the way she whiffed herself at that young pup in passing the way her eyes slid round he had a very just appreciation of his sons widow and a smile settled deep between his chin tuft and his moustache she lifted his hand kissed it pressed it to her splendid bust and said  so here i am at last you see arent you surprised  old heythorp shook his head  i really had to come and see you guardy we havent had a sight of you for such an age and in this awful weather how are you dear old guardy  never better and watching her greengrey eyes he added  havent a penny for you  her face did not fall she gave her featherlaugh  how dreadful of you to think i came for that but i am in an awful fix guardy  never knew you not to be  just let me tell you dear itll be some relief im having the most terrible time  she sank into a low chair disengaging an overpowering scent of violets while melancholy struggled to subdue her face and body  the most awful fix i expect to be sold up any moment we may be on the streets tomorrow i darent tell the children theyre so happy poor darlings i shall be obliged to take jock away from school and phyllis will have to stop her piano and dancing its an absolute crisis and all due to those midland syndicate people ive been counting on at least two hundred for my new story and the wretches have refused it  with a tiny handkerchief she removed one tear from the corner of one eye it is hard guardy i worked my brain silly over that story  from old heythorp came a mutter which sounded suspiciously like  rats  heaving a sigh which conveyed nothing but the generosity of her breathing apparatus mrs larne went on  you couldnt i suppose let me have just one hundred  not a bob  she sighed again her eyes slid round the room then in her warm voice she murmured  guardy you were my dear philips father werent you ive never said anything but of course you were he was so like you and so is jock  nothing moved in old heythorps face no pagan image consulted with flowers and song and sacrifice could have returned less answer her dear philip she had led him the devil of a life or he was a dutchman and what the deuce made her suddenly trot out the skeleton like this but mrs larnes eyes were still wandering  what a lovely house you know i think you ought to help me guardy just imagine if your grandchildren were thrown out into the street  the old man grinned he was not going to deny his relationshipit was her lookout not his but neither was he going to let her rush him  and they will be you couldnt look on and see it do come to my rescue this once you really might do something for them  with a rumbling sigh he answered  wait cant give you a penny now poor as a church mouse  oh guardy  fact  mrs larne heaved one of her most buoyant sighs she certainly did not believe him  well she said youll be sorry when we come round one night and sing for pennies under your window wouldnt you like to see phyllis i left her in the hall shes growing such a sweet gairl guardy just fifty  not a rap  mrs larne threw up her hands well youll repent it im at my last gasp she sighed profoundly and the perfume of violets escaped in a cloud then getting up she went to the door and called phyllis  when the girl entered old heythorp felt the nearest approach to a flutter of the heart for many years she had put her hair up she was like a spring day in january such a relief from that scented humbug her mother pleasant the touch of her lips on his forehead the sound of her clear voice the sight of her slim movements the feeling that she did him creditcleanrun stock she and that young scamp jockbetter than the holy woman his daughter adela would produce if anyone were ever fool enough to marry her or that pragmatical fellow his son ernest  and when they were gone he reflected with added zest on the six thousand pounds he was getting for them out of joe pillin and his ships he would have to pitch it strong in his speech at the general meeting with freights so low there was bound to be opposition no dash nowadays nothing but gabby caution they were a scrimshanking lot on the boardhe had had to pull them round one by onethe deuce of a tug getting this thing through and yet the business was sound enough those ships would earn money properly handledgood money  his valet coming in to prepare him for dinner found him asleep he had for the old man as much admiration as may be felt for one who cannot put his own trousers on he would say to the housemaid molly hes a game old blightermust have been a rare one in his day cocks his hat at you even now i see to which the girl irish and pretty would reply well an sure i dont mind if it gives um a pleasure tis better anyway than the sad eye i get from herself  at dinner old heythorp always sat at one end of the rosewood table and his daughter at the other it was the eminent moment of the day with napkin tucked high into his waistcoat he gave himself to the meal with passion his palate was undimmed his digestion unimpaired he could still eat as much as two men and drink more than one and while he savoured each mouthful he never spoke if he could help it the holy woman had nothing to say that he cared to hear and he nothing to say that she cared to listen to she had a horror too of what she called the pleasures of the tablethose lusts of the flesh she was always longing to dock his grub he knew would see her further first what other pleasures were there at his age let her wait till she was eighty but she never would be too thin and holy  this evening however with the advent of the partridge she did speak  who were your visitors father  trust her for nosing anything out fixing his little blue eyes on her he mumbled with a very full mouth ladies  so i saw what ladies  he had a longing to say part of one of my families under the rose as a fact it was the best part of the only one but the temptation to multiply exceedingly was almost overpowering he checked himself however and went on eating partridge his secret irritation crimsoning his cheeks and he watched her eyes those cold precise and round grey eyes noting it and knew she was thinking he eats too much  she said sorry im not considered fit to be told you ought not to be drinking hock  old heythorp took up the long green glass drained it and repressing fumes and emotion went on with his partridge his daughter pursed her lips took a sip of water and said  i know their name is larne but it conveyed nothing to me perhaps its just as well  the old man mastering a spasm said with a grin  my daughterinlaw and my granddaughter  what ernest marriedoh nonsense  he chuckled and shook his head  then do you mean to say father that you were married before you married my mother  no  the expression on her face was as good as a play  she said with a sort of disgust not married i see i suppose those people are hanging round your neck then no wonder youre always in difficulties are there any more of them  again the old man suppressed that spasm and the veins in his neck and forehead swelled alarmingly if he had spoken he would infallibly have choked he ceased eating and putting his hands on the table tried to raise himself he could not and subsiding in his chair sat glaring at the stiff quiet figure of his daughter  dont be silly father and make a scene before meller finish your dinner  he did not answer he was not going to sit there to be dragooned and insulted his helplessness had never so weighed on him before it was like a revelation a logthat had to put up with anything a log and waiting for his valet to return he cunningly took up his fork  in that saintly voice of hers she said  i suppose you dont realise that its a shock to me i dont know what ernest will think  ernest be dd  i do wish father you wouldnt swear  old heythorps rage found vent in a sort of rumble how the devil had he gone on all these years in the same house with that woman dining with her day after day but the servant had come back now and putting down his fork he said  help me up  the man paused thunderstruck with the souffle balanced to leave dinner unfinishedit was a portent  help me up  mr heythorps not very well meller take his other arm  the old man shook off her hand  im very well help me up dine in my own room in future  raised to his feet he walked slowly out but in his sanctum he did not sit down obsessed by this first overwhelming realisation of his helplessness he stood swaying a little holding on to the table till the servant having finished serving dinner brought in his port  are you waiting to sit down sir  he shook his head hang it he could do that for himself anyway he must think of something to fortify his position against that woman and he said  send me molly  yes sir the man put down the port and went  old heythorp filled his glass drank and filled again he took a cigar from the box and lighted it the girl came in a greyeyed darkhaired damsel and stood with her hands folded her head a little to one side her lips a little parted the old man said  youre a human being  i would hope so sirr  im going to ask you something as a human beingnot a servantsee  no sirr but i will be glad to do anything you like  then put your nose in here every now and then to see if i want anything meller goes out sometimes dont say anything just put your nose in  oh an i will tis a pleasure twill be to do ut  he nodded and when she had gone lowered himself into his chair with a sense of appeasement pretty girl comfort to see a pretty facenot a pale peeky thing like adelas his anger burned up anew so she counted on his helplessness had begun to count on that had she she should see that there was life in the old dog yet and his sacrifice of the uneaten souffle the still less eaten mushrooms the peppermint sweet with which he usually concluded dinner seemed to consecrate that purpose they all thought he was a hulk without a shot left in the locker he had seen a couple of them at the board that afternoon shrugging at each other as though saying look at him and young farney pitying him pity forsooth and that coarsegrained solicitor chap at the creditors meeting curling his lip as much as to say one foot in the grave he had seen the clerks dowsing the glim of their grins and that young pup bob pillin screwing up his supercilious mug over his dogcollar he knew that scented humbug rosamund was getting scared that hed drop off before shed squeezed him dry and his valet was always looking him up and down queerly as to that holy woman not quite so fast not quite so fast and filling his glass for the fourth time he slowly sucked down the dark red fluid with the old boots flavour which his soul loved and drawing deep at his cigar closed his eyes     ii  1  the room in the hotel where the general meetings of the island navigation company were held was nearly full when the secretary came through the door which as yet divided the shareholders from their directors having surveyed their empty chairs their ink and papers and nodded to a shareholder or two he stood watch in hand contemplating the congregation a thicker attendance than he had ever seen due no doubt to the lower dividend and this pillin business and his tongue curled for if he had a natural contempt for his board with the exception of the chairman he had a still more natural contempt for his shareholders amusing spectacle when you came to think of it a general meeting unique eighty or a hundred men and five women assembled through sheer devotion to their money was any other function in the world so singlehearted church was nothing to itso many motives were mingled there with devotion to ones soul a welleducated young manreader of anatole france and other writershe enjoyed ironic speculation what earthly good did they think they got by coming here halfpast two he put his watch back into his pocket and passed into the boardroom  there the fumes of lunch and of a short preliminary meeting made cosy the february atmosphere by the fire four directors were conversing rather restlessly the fifth was combing his beard the chairman sat with eyes closed and red lips moving rhythmically in the sucking of a lozenge the slips of his speech ready in his hand the secretary said in his cheerful voice time sir  old heythorp swallowed lifted his arms rose with help and walked through to his place at the centre of the table the five directors followed and standing at the chairmans right the secretary read the minutes forming the words precisely with his curling tongue then assisting the chairman to his feet he watched those rows of faces and thought mistake to let them see he cant get up without help he ought to have let me read his speechi wrote it  the chairman began to speak  it is my duty and my pleasure ladies and gentlemen for the nineteenth consecutive year to present to you the directors report and the accounts for the past twelve months you will all have had special notice of a measure of policy on which your board has decided and to which you will be asked today to give your adherenceto that i shall come at the end of my remarks  excuse me sir we cant hear a word down here  ah thought the secretary i was expecting that  the chairman went on undisturbed but several shareholders now rose and the same speaker said testily we might as well go home if the chairmans got no voice cant somebody read for him  the chairman took a sip of water and resumed almost all in the last six rows were now on their feet and amid a hubbub of murmurs the chairman held out to the secretary the slips of his speech and fell heavily back into his chair  the secretary reread from the beginning and as each sentence fell from his tongue he thought how good that is thats very clear a neat touch this is getting them it seemed to him a pity they could not know it was all his composition when at last he came to the pillin sale he paused for a second  i come now to the measure of policy to which i made allusion at the beginning of my speech your board has decided to expand your enterprise by purchasing the entire fleet of pillin  co ltd by this transaction we become the owners of the four steamships smyrna damascus tyre and sidon vessels in prime condition with a total freightcarrying capacity of fifteen thousand tons at the low inclusive price of sixty thousand pounds gentlemen de laudace toujours de laudaceit was the chairmans phrase his bit of the speech and the secretary did it more than justice times are bad but your board is emphatically of the opinion that they are touching bottom and this in their view is the psychological moment for a forward stroke they confidently recommend your adoption of their policy and the ratification of this purchase which they believe will in the not far distant future substantially increase the profits of the company the secretary sat down with reluctance the speech should have continued with a number of appealing sentences which he had carefully prepared but the chairman had cut them out with the simple comment they ought to be glad of the chance it was in his view an error  the director who had combed his beard now rosea man of presence who might be trusted to say nothing long and suavely while he was speaking the secretary was busy noting whence opposition was likely to come the majority were sitting owllikea good sign but some dozen were studying their copies of the report and three at least were making noteswestgate for instance who wanted to get on the board and was sure to make himself unpleasantthe timehonoured method of vinegar and batterson who also desired to come on and might be trusted to support the boardthe timehonoured method of oil while if one knew anything of human nature the fellow who had complained that he might as well go home would have something uncomfortable to say the director finished his remarks combed his beard with his fingers and sat down  a momentary pause ensued then messieurs westgate and batterson rose together seeing the chairman nod towards the latter the secretary thought mistake he should have humoured westgate by giving him precedence but that was the worst of the old man he had no notion of the suaviter in modo mr batterson thus unchainedwould like if he might be so allowed to congratulate the board on having piloted their ship so smoothly through the troublous waters of the past year with their worthy chairman still at the helm he had no doubt that in spite of the still lowhe would not say fallingbarometer and theerunseasonable climacteric they might rely on weathering theerhe would not say storm he would confess that the present dividend of four per cent was not one which satisfied every aspiration hear hear but speaking for himself and he hoped for othersand here mr batterson looked roundhe recognised that in all the circumstances it was as much as they had the righterto expect but following the bold but to his mind prudent development which the board proposed to make he thought that they might reasonably if not sanguinely anticipate a more golden future no no a shareholder said no no that might seem to indicate a certain lack of confidence in the special proposal before the meeting yes from that lack of confidence he would like at once to dissociate himself their chairman a man of foresight and acumen and valour proved on many a field andersea would not have committed himself to this policy without good reason in his opinion they were in safe hands and he was glad to register his support of the measure proposed the chairman had well said in his speech de laudace toujours de laudace shareholders would agree with him that there could be no better motto for englishmen ahem  mr batterson sat down and mr westgate rose he wantedhe saidto know more much more about this proposition which to his mind was of a very dubious wisdom ah thought the secretary i told the old boy he must tell them more to whom for instance had the proposal first been made to himthe chairman said good but why were pillins selling if freights were to go up as they were told  matter of opinion  quite so and in my opinion they are going lower and pillins were right to sell it follows that we are wrong to buy hear hear no no pillins are shrewd people what does the chairman say nerves does he mean to tell us that this sale was the result of nerves  the chairman nodded  that appears to me a somewhat fantastic theory but i will leave that and confine myself to asking the grounds on which the chairman bases his confidence in fact what it is which is actuating the board in pressing on us at such a time what i have no hesitation in stigmatising as a rash proposal in a word i want light as well as leading in this matter  mr westgate sat down  what would the chairman do now the situation was distinctly awkwardseeing his helplessness and the lukewarmness of the board behind him and the secretary felt more strongly than ever the absurdity of his being an underling he who in a few wellchosen words could so easily have twisted the meeting round his thumb suddenly he heard the long rumbling sigh which preluded the chairmans speeches  has any other gentleman anything to say before i move the adoption of the report  phew that would put their backs up yes sure enough it had brought that fellow who had said he might as well go home to his feet now for something nasty  mr westgate requires answering i dont like this business i dont impute anything to anybody but it looks to me as if there were something behind it which the shareholders ought to be told not only that but to speak frankly im not satisfied to be ridden over roughshod in this fashion by one who whatever he may have been in the past is obviously not now in the prime of his faculties  with a gasp the secretary thought i knew that was a plainspoken man  he heard again the rumbling beside him the chairman had gone crimson his mouth was pursed his little eyes were very blue  help me up he said  the secretary helped him and waited rather breathless  the chairman took a sip of water and his voice unexpectedly loud broke an ominous hush  never been so insulted in my life my best services have been at your disposal for nineteen years you know what measure of success this company has attained i am the oldest man here and my experience of shipping is i hope a little greater than that of the two gentlemen who spoke last i have done my best for you ladies and gentlemen and we shall see whether you are going to endorse an indictment of my judgment and of my honour if i am to take the last speaker seriously this purchase is for your good there is a tide in the affairs of menand i for one am not content never have been to stagnate if that is what you want however by all means give your support to these gentlemen and have done with it i tell you freights will go up before the end of the year the purchase is a sound one more than a sound onei at any rate stand or fall by it refuse to ratify it if you like if you do i shall resign  he sank back into his seat the secretary stealing a glance thought with a sort of enthusiasm bravo whod have thought he could rally his voice like that a good touch too that about his honour i believe hes knocked them  its still dicky though if that fellow at the back gets up again the old chap cant work that stop a second time ah here was old applepie on his hind legs that was all right  i do not hesitate to say that i am an old friend of the chairman we are many of us old friends of the chairman and it has been painful to me and i doubt not to others to hear an attack made on him if he is old in body he is young in mental vigour and courage i wish we were all as young we ought to stand by him i say we ought to stand by him hear hear hear hear and the secretary thought thats done it and he felt a sudden odd emotion watching the chairman bobbing his body like a wooden toy at old appleby and old appleby bobbing back then seeing a shareholder close to the door get up thought whos that i know his faceah yes ventnor the solicitorhes one of the chairmans creditors that are coming again this afternoon what now  i cant agree that we ought to let sentiment interfere with our judgment in this matter the question is simply how are our pockets going to be affected i came here with some misgivings but the attitude of the chairman has been such as to remove them and i shall support the proposition the secretary thought thats all rightonly he said it rather queerlyrather queerly  then after a long silence the chairman without rising said  i move the adoption of the report and accounts  i second that  those in favour signify the same in the usual way contrary carried the secretary noted the dissentients six in number and that mr westgate did not vote  a quarter of an hour later he stood in the body of the emptying room supplying names to one of the gentlemen of the press the passionless fellow said haythorp with an a oh an e he seems an old man thank you i may have the slips would you like to see a proof with an a you saidoh an e good afternoon and the secretary thought those fellows what does go on inside them fancy not knowing the old chairman by now     2  back in the proper office of the island navigation company old heythorp sat smoking a cigar and smiling like a purring cat he was dreaming a little of his triumph sifting with his old brain still subtle the wheat from the chaff of the demurrers westgatenothing in thatprofessional discontent till they silenced him with a place on the boardbut not while he held the reins that chap at the backan illconditioned fellow something behind suspicious brute there was somethingbuthang it they might think themselves lucky to get four ships at that price and all due to him it was on the last speaker that his mind dwelt with a doubt that fellow ventnor to whom he owed moneythere had been something just a little queer about his toneas much as to say i smell a rat well one would see that at the creditors meeting in half an hour  mr pillin sir  show him in  in a fur coat which seemed to extinguish his thin form joe pillin entered it was snowing and the cold had nipped and yellowed his meagre face between its slight grey whiskering he said thinly  how are you sylvanus arent you perished in this cold  warm as a toast sit down take off your coat  oh i should be lost without it you must have a fire inside you soso its gone through  old heythorp nodded and joe pillin wandering like a spirit scrutinised the shut door he came back to the table and said in a low voice  its a great sacrifice  old heythorp smiled  have you signed the deed poll  producing a parchment from his pocket joe pillin unfolded it with caution to disclose his signature and said  i dont like itits irrevocable  a chuckle escaped old heythorp  as death  joe pillins voice passed up into the treble clef  i cant bear irrevocable things i consider you stampeded me playing on my nerves  examining the signatures old heythorp murmured  tell your lawyer to lock it up he must think you a sad dog joe  ah suppose on my death it comes to the knowledge of my wife  she wont be able to make it hotter for you than youll be already  joe pillin replaced the deed within his coat emitting a queer thin noise he simply could not bear joking on such subjects  well he said youve got your way you always do who is this mrs larne you oughtnt to keep me in the dark it seems my boy met her at your house you told me she didnt come there  old heythorp said with relish  her husband was my son by a woman i was fond of before i married her children are my grandchildren youve provided for them best thing you ever did  i dont knowi dont know im sorry you told me it makes it all the more doubtful as soon as the transfers complete i shall get away abroad this colds killing me i wish youd give me your recipe for keeping warm  get a new inside  joe pillin regarded his old friend with a sort of yearning and yet he said i suppose with your fullblooded habit your life hangs by a thread doesnt it  a stout one my boy  well goodbye sylvanus youre a jobs comforter i must be getting home he put on his hat and lost in his fur coat passed out into the corridor on the stairs he met a man who said  how do you do mr pillin i know your son been seeing the chairman i see your sales gone through all right i hope thatll do us some good but i suppose you think the other way  peering at him from under his hat joe pillin said  mr ventnor i think thank you its very cold isnt it and with that cautious remark he passed on down  alone again old heythorp thought by george what a wavering quavering thread paper of a fellow what misery life must be to a chap like that he walks in fearhe wallows in it poor devil and a curious feeling swelled his heart of elation of lightness such as he had not known for years those two young things were safe now from penurysafe after dealing with those infernal creditors of his he would go round and have a look at the children with a hundred and twenty a year the boy could go into the armybest place for a young scamp like that the girl would go off like hot cakes of course but she neednt take the first calf that came along as for their mother she must look after herself nothing under two thousand a year would keep her out of debt but trust her for wheedling and bluffing her way out of any scrape watching his cigarsmoke curl and disperse he was conscious of the strain he had been under these last six weeks aware suddenly of how greatly he had baulked at thought of todays general meeting yes it might have turned out nasty he knew well enough the forces on the board and off who would be only too glad to shelve him if he were shelved here his other two companies would be sure to follow suit and bang would go every penny of his incomehe would be a pauper dependant on that holy woman well safe now for another year if he could stave off these sharks once more it might be a harder job this time but he was in luckin luck and it must hold and taking a luxurious pull at his cigar he rang the handbell  bring em in here mr farney and let me have a cup of china tea as strong as you can make it  yes sir will you see the proof of the press report or will you leave it to me  to you  yes sir it was a good meeting wasnt it  old heythorp nodded  wonderful how your voice came back just at the right moment i was afraid things were going to be difficult the insult did it i think it was a monstrous thing to say i could have punched his head  again old heythorp nodded and looking into the secretarys fine blue eyes he repeated bring em in  the lonely minute before the entrance of his creditors passed in the thought so thats how it struck him short shrift i should get if it came out  the gentlemen who numbered ten this time bowed to their debtor evidently wondering why the deuce they troubled to be polite to an old man who kept them out of their money then the secretary reappearing with a cup of china tea they watched while their debtor drank it the feat was tremulous would he get through without spilling it all down his front or choking to those unaccustomed to his private life it was slightly miraculous he put the cup down empty tremblingly removed some yellow drops from the little white tuft below his lip refit his cigar and said  no use beating about the bush gentlemen i can offer you fourteen hundred a year so long as i live and hold my directorships and not a penny more if you cant accept that you must make me bankrupt and get about sixpence in the pound my qualifying shares will fetch a couple of thousand at market price i own nothing else the house i live in and everything in it barring my clothes my wine and my cigars belong to my daughter under a settlement fifteen years old my solicitors and bankers will give you every information thats the position in a nutshell  in spite of business habits the surprise of the ten gentlemen was only partially concealed a man who owed them so much would naturally say he owned nothing but would he refer them to his solicitors and bankers unless he were telling the truth then mr ventnor said  will you submit your pass books  no but ill authorise my bankers to give you a full statement of my receipts for the last five yearslonger if you like  the strategic stroke of placing the ten gentlemen round the board table had made it impossible for them to consult freely without being overheard but the lowvoiced transference of thought travelling round was summed up at last by mr brownbee  we think mr heythorp that your fees and dividends should enable you to set aside for us a larger sum sixteen hundred in fact is what we think you should give us yearly representing as we do sixteen thousand pounds the prospect is not cheering but we hope you have some good years before you yet we understand your income to be two thousand pounds  old heythorp shook his head nineteen hundred and thirty pounds in a good year must eat and drink must have a man to look after me not as active as i was cant do on less than five hundred pounds fourteen hundreds all i can give you gentlemen its an advance of two hundred pounds thats my last word  the silence was broken by mr ventnor  and its my last word that im not satisfied if these other gentlemen accept your proposition i shall be forced to consider what i can do on my own account  the old man stared at him and answered  oh you will sir we shall see  the others had risen and were gathered in a knot at the end of the table old heythorp and mr ventnor alone remained seated the old mans lower lip projected till the white hairs below stood out like bristles you ugly dog he was thinking you think youve got something up your sleeve well do your worst the ugly dog rose abruptly and joined the others and old heythorp closed his eyes sitting perfectly still with his cigar which had gone out sticking up between his teeth mr brownbee turning to voice the decision come to cleared his throat  mr heythorp he said if your bankers and solicitors bear out your statements we shall accept your offer faute de mieux in consideration of your but meeting the old mans eyes which said so very plainly blow your consideration he ended with a stammer perhaps you will kindly furnish us with the authorisation you spoke of  old heythorp nodded and mr brownbee with a little bow clasped his hat to his breast and moved towards the door the nine gentlemen followed mr ventnor bringing up the rear turned and looked back but the old mans eyes were already closed again  the moment his creditors were gone old heythorp sounded the handbell  help me up mr farney that ventnorwhats his holding  quite small only ten shares i think  ah what time is it  quarter to four sir  get me a taxi  after visiting his bank and his solicitors he struggled once more into his cab and caused it to be driven towards millicent villas a kind of sleepy triumph permeated his whole being bumped and shaken by the cabs rapid progress so he was free of those sharks now so long as he could hold on to his companies and he would still have a hundred a year or more to spare for rosamund and her youngsters he could live on four hundred or even threefifty without losing his independence for there would be no standing life in that holy womans house unless he could pay his own scot a good days work the best for many a long month  the cab stopped before the villa     3  there are rooms which refuse to give away their owners and rooms which seem to say they really are like this of such was rosamund larnesa sort of permanent confession seeming to remark to anyone who entered her taste well you can seecheerful and exuberant her habitsyes she sits here all the morning in a dressinggown smoking cigarettes and dropping ink kindly observe my carpet notice the pianoit has a look of coming and going according to the exchequer this very deepcushioned sofa is permanent however the

drumstick and saying wheres this ellen and wheres that you naughty gairl youve been tidying cast an eye on that pile of manuscriptshe has evidently a genius for composition it flows off her penlike shakespeare she never blots a line see how shes had the electric light put in instead of that horrid gas but try and turn either of them onyou cant last quarter isnt paid of course and she uses an oil lamp you can tell that by the ceiling the dog over there who will not answer to the name of carmen a pekinese spaniel like a little djin all prominent eyes rolling their blacks and no nose betweenyes carmen looks as if she didnt know what was coming next shes rightits a petandslapagain life consider too the fittings of the teatray rather soiled though not quite tin but i say unto you that no millionaires in all its glory ever had a liqueur bottle on it  when old heythorp entered this room which extended from back to front of the little house preceded by the announcement mr aesop it was resonant with a very clatterbodandigo of noises from phyllis playing the machiche from the boy jock on the hearthrug emitting at short intervals the most piercing notes from an ocarina from mrs larne on the sofa talking with her trailing volubility to bob pillin from bob pillin muttering yees quiite yees and gazing at phyllis over his collar and on the windowsill as far as she could get from all this noise the little dog carmen was rolling her eyes at sight of their visitor jock blew one rending screech and bolting behind the sofa placed his chin on its top so that nothing but his round pink unmoving face was visible and the dog carmen tried to climb the blind cord  encircled from behind by the arms of phyllis and preceded by the gracious perfumed bulk of mrs larne old heythorp was escorted to the sofa it was low and when he had plumped down into it the boy jock emitted a hollow groan bob pillin was the first to break the silence  how are you sir i hope its gone through  old heythorp nodded his eyes were fixed on the liqueur and mrs larne murmured  guardy you must try our new liqueur jock you awful boy get up and bring guardy a glass  the boy jock approached the teatable took up a glass put it to his eye and filled it rapidly  you horrible boy you could see that glass has been used  in a high round voice rather like an angels jock answered  all right mother ill get rid of it and rapidly swallowing the yellow liquor took up another glass  mrs larne laughed  what am i to do with him  a loud shriek prevented a response phyllis who had taken her brother by the ear to lead him to the door let him go to clasp her injured self  bob pillin went hastening towards her and following the young man with her chin mrs larne said smiling  arent those children awful hes such a nice fellow we like him so much guardy  the old man grinned so she was making up to that young pup rosamund larne watching him murmured  oh guardy youre as bad as jock he takes after you terribly look at the shape of his head jock come here the innocent boy approached with his girlish complexion his flowery blue eyes his perfect mouth he stood before his mother like a large cherub and suddenly he blew his ocarina in a dreadful manner mrs larne launched a box at his ears and receiving the wind of it he fell prone  thats the way he behaves be off with you you awful boy i want to talk to guardy  the boy withdrew on his stomach and sat against the wall crosslegged fixing his innocent round eyes on old heythorp mrs larne sighed  things are worse and worse guardy im at my wits end to tide over this quarter you wouldnt advance me a hundred on my new story im sure to get two for it in the end  the old man shook his head  ive done something for you and the children he said youll get notice of it in a day or two ask no questions  oh guardy oh you dear and her gaze rested on bob pillin leaning over the piano where phyllis again sat  old heythorp snorted what are you cultivating that young gaby for she mustnt be grabbed up by any fool who comes along  mrs larne murmured at once  of course the dear gairl is much too young phyllis come and talk to guardy  when the girl was installed beside him on the sofa and he had felt that little thrill of warmth the proximity of youth can bring he said  been a good girl  she shook her head  cant when jocks not at school mother cant pay for him this term  hearing his name the boy jock blew his ocarina till mrs larne drove him from the room and phyllis went on  hes more awful than anything you can think of was my dad at all like him guardy mothers always so mysterious about him i suppose you knew him well  old heythorp incapable of confusion answered stolidly  not very  who was his father i dont believe even mother knows  man about town in my day  oh your day must have been jolly did you wear pegtop trousers and dundrearys  old heythorp nodded  what larks and i suppose you had lots of adventures with opera dancers and gambling the young men are all so good now her eyes rested on bob pillin that young mans a perfect stick of goodness  old heythorp grunted  you wouldnt know how good he was phyllis went on musingly unless youd sat next him in a tunnel the other day he had his waist squeezed and he simply sat still and did nothing and then when the tunnel ended it was jock after all not me his face wasoh ah ha ha ah ha she threw back her head displaying all her white round throat then edging near she whispered  he likes to pretend of course that hes fearfully lively hes promised to take mother and me to the theatre and supper afterwards wont it be scrummy only i havent anything to go in  old heythorp said what do you want irish poplin  her mouth opened wide oh guardy soft white satin  how many yardsll go round you  i should think about twelve we could make it ourselves you are a chook  a scent of hair like hay enveloped him her lips bobbed against his noseand there came a feeling in his heart as when he rolled the first sip of a special wine against his palate this little house was a rumtytoo affair her mother was a humbug the boy a cheeky young rascal but there was a warmth here he never felt in that big house which had been his wifes and was now his holy daughters and once more he rejoiced at his days work and the success of his breach of trust which put some little ground beneath these young feet in a hard and unscrupulous world phyllis whispered in his ear  guardy do look he will stare at me like that isnt it awfullike a boiled rabbit  bob pillin attentive to mrs larne was gazing with all his might over her shoulder at the girl the young man was moonstruck that was clear there was something almost touching in the stare of those puppy dogs eyes and he thought young beggarwish i were his age the utter injustice of having an old and helpless body when your desire for enjoyment was as great as ever they said a man was as old as he felt fools a man was as old as his legs and arms and not a day younger he heard the girl beside him utter a discomfortable sound and saw her face cloud as if tears were not far off she jumped up and going to the window lifted the little dog and buried her face in its brown and white fur old heythorp thought she sees that her humbugging mother is using her as a decoy but she had come back and the little dog rolling its eyes horribly at the strange figure on the sofa in a desperate effort to escape succeeded in reaching her shoulder where it stayed perched like a cat held by one paw and trying to back away into space old heythorp said abruptly  are you very fond of your mother  of course i am guardy i adore her  hm listen to me when you come of age or marry youll have a hundred and twenty a year of your own that you cant get rid of dont ever be persuaded into doing what you dont want and remember your mothers a sieve no good giving her money keep what youll get for yourselfits only a pittance and youll want it allevery penny  phylliss eyes had opened very wide so that he wondered if she had taken in his words  oh isnt money horrible guardy  the want of it  no its beastly altogether if only we were like birds or if one could put out a plate overnight and have just enough in the morning to use during the day  old heythorp sighed  theres only one thing in life that mattersindependence lose that and you lose everything thats the value of money help me up  phyllis stretched out her hands and the little dog running down her back resumed its perch on the windowsill close to the blind cord  once on his feet old heythorp said  give me a kiss youll have your satin tomorrow  then looking at bob pillin he remarked  going my way ill give you a lift  the young man giving phyllis one appealing look answered dully thaanks and they went out together to the taxi in that draughtless vehicle they sat full of who knows what contempt of age for youth and youth for age the old man resenting this young pups aspiration to his granddaughter the young man annoyed that this old image had dragged him away before he wished to go old heythorp said at last  well  thus expected to say something bob pillin muttered  glad your meetin went off well sir you scored a triumph i should think  why  oh i dont know i thought you had a good bit of opposition to contend with  old heythorp looked at him  your grandmother he said then with his habitual instinct of attack added you make the most of your opportunities i see  at this rude assault bob pillins redcheeked face assumed a certain dignity i dont know what you mean sir mrs larne is very kind to me  no doubt but dont try to pick the flowers  thoroughly upset bob pillin preserved a dogged silence this fortnight since he had first met phyllis in old heythorps hall had been the most singular of his existence up to now he would never have believed that a fellow could be so quickly and completely bowled could succumb without a kick without even wanting to kick to one with his philosophy of having a good time and never committing himself too far it was in the nature of a fair knockout and yet so pleasurable except for the wear and tear about ones chances if only he knew how far the old boy really counted in the matter to say my intentions are strictly honourable would be oldfashioned besidesthe old fellow might have no right to hear it they called him guardy but without knowing more he did not want to admit the old curmudgeons right to interfere  are you a relation of theirs sir  old heythorp nodded  bob pillin went on with desperation  i should like to know what your objection to me is  the old man turned his head so far as he was able a grim smile bristled the hairs about his lips and twinkled in his eyes what did he object to whyeverything object to that sleek head those puppydog eyes fattish red cheeks high collars pearl pin spats and drawlpah the imbecility the smugness of his mug no go no devil in any of his sort in any of these fishveined coddledup young bloods nothing but playing for safety and he wheezed out  milk and water masquerading as port wine  bob pillin frowned  it was almost too much for the composure even of a man of the world that this paralytic old fellow should express contempt for his virility was really the last thing in jests luckily he could not take it seriously but suddenly he thought what if he really has the power to stop my going there and means to turn them against me and his heart quailed  awfully sorry sir he said if you dont think im wild enough anything i can do for you in that line  the old man grunted and realising that he had been quite witty bob pillin went on  i know im not in debt no entanglements got a decent income pretty good expectations and all that but i can soon put that all right if im not fit without  it was perhaps his first attempt at irony and he could not help thinking how good it was  but old heythorp preserved a deadly silence he looked like a stuffed man a regular aunt sally sitting there with the fixed red in his cheeks his stivered hair square block of a body and no neck that you could seeonly wanting the pipe in his mouth could there really be danger from such an old idol the idol spoke  ill give you a word of advice dont hang round there or youll burn your fingers remember me to your father goodnight  the taxi had stopped before the house in sefton park an insensate impulse to remain seated and argue the point fought in bob pillin with an impulse to leap out shake his fist in at the window and walk off he merely said however  thanks for the lift goodnight and getting out deliberately he walked off  old heythorp waiting for the driver to help him up thought fatter but no more guts than his father  in his sanctum he sank at once into his chair it was wonderfully still there every day at this hour just the click of the coals just the faintest ruffle from the wind in the trees of the park and it was cosily warm only the fire lightening the darkness a drowsy beatitude pervaded the old man a good days work a triumphthat young pup had said yes something of a triumph he had held on and won and dinner to look forward to yet a napa nap and soon rhythmic soft sonorous his breathing rose with now and then that pathetic twitching of the old who dream     iii  1  when bob pillin emerged from the little front garden of 23 millicent villas ten days later his sentiments were ravelled and he could not get hold of an end to pull straight the stuff of his mind  he had found mrs larne and phyllis in the sittingroom and phyllis had been crying he was sure she had been crying and that memory still infected the sentiments evoked by later happenings old heythorp had said youll burn your fingers the process had begun having sent her daughter away on a pretext really a bit too thin mrs larne had installed him beside her scented bulk on the sofa and poured into his ear such a tale of monetary woe and entanglement such a mass of present difficulties and rosy prospects that his brain still whirled and only one thing emerged clearlythat she wanted fifty pounds which she would repay him on quarterday for their guardy had made a settlement by which until the dear children came of age she would have sixty pounds every quarter it was only a question of a few weeks he might ask messrs scriven and coles they would tell him the security was quite safe he certainly might ask messrs scriven and colesthey happened to be his fathers solicitors but it hardly seemed to touch the point bob pillin had a certain shrewd caution and the point was whether he was going to begin to lend money to a woman who he could see might borrow up to seventy times seven on the strength of his infatuation for her daughter that was rather too strong yet if he didnt she might take a sudden dislike to him and where would he be then besides would not a loan make his position stronger and thensuch is the effect of love even on the younger generationthat thought seemed to him unworthy if he lent at all it should be from chivalryulterior motives might go hang and the memory of the tearmarks on phylliss pretty palepink cheeks and her petulantly mournful oh young man isnt money beastly scraped his heart and ravished his judgment all the same fifty pounds was fifty pounds and goodness knew how much more and what did he know of mrs larne after all except that she was a relative of old heythorps and wrote storiestold them too if he was not mistaken perhaps it would be better to see scrivens but again that absurd nobility assaulted him phyllis phyllis besides were not settlements always drawn so that they refused to form security for anything thus hampered and troubled he hailed a cab he was dining with the ventnors on the cheshire side and would be late if he didnt get home sharp to dress  driving whitetiedand waistcoated in his fathers car he thought with a certain contumely of the younger ventnor girl whom he had been wont to consider pretty before he knew phyllis and seated next her at dinner he quite enjoyed his new sense of superiority to her charms and the ease with which he could chaff and be agreeable and all the time he suffered from the suppressed longing which scarcely ever left him now to think and talk of phyllis ventnors fizz was good and plentiful his old madeira absolutely first chop and the only other man present a teetotal curate who withdrew with the ladies to talk his parish shop favoured by these circumstances and the perception that ventnor was an agreeable fellow bob pillin yielded to his secret itch to get near the subject of his affections  do you happen he said airily to know a mrs larnerelative of old heythorpsrather a handsome womanshe writes stories  mr ventnor shook his head a closer scrutiny than bob pillins would have seen that he also moved his ears  of old heythorps didnt know he had any except his daughter and that son of his in the admiralty  bob pillin felt the glow of his secret hobby spreading within him  she is thoughlives rather out of town got a son and daughter i thought you might know her storiesclever woman  mr ventnor smiled ah he said enigmatically these lady novelists does she make any money by them  bob pillin knew that to make money by writing meant success but that not to make money by writing was artistic and implied that you had private means which perhaps was even more distinguished and he said  oh she has private means i know  mr ventnor reached for the madeira  so shes a relative of old heythorps he said hes a very old friend of your fathers he ought to go bankrupt you know  to bob pillin glowing with passion and madeira the idea of bankruptcy seemed discreditable in connection with a relative of phyllis besides the old boy was far from that had he not just made this settlement on mrs larne and he said  i think youre mistaken thats of the past  mr ventnor smiled  will you bet he said  bob pillin also smiled i should be bettin on a certainty  mr ventnor passed his hand over his whiskered face dont you believe it he hasnt a mag to his name fill your glass  bob pillin said with a certain resentment  well i happen to know hes just made a settlement of five or six thousand pounds dont know if you call that being bankrupt  what on this mrs larne  confused uncertain whether he had said something derogatory or indiscreet or something which added distinction to phyllis bob pillin hesitated then gave a nod  mr ventnor rose and extended his short legs before the fire  no my boy he said no  unaccustomed to flat contradiction bob pillin reddened  ill bet you a tenner ask scrivens  mr ventnor ejaculated  scrivensbut theyre not then staring rather hard he added i wont bet you may be right scrivens are your fathers solicitors too arent they always been sorry he didnt come to me shall we join the ladies and to the drawingroom he preceded a young man more uncertain in his mind than on his feet  charles ventnor was not one to let you see that more was going on within than met the eye but there was a good deal going on that evening and after his conversation with young bob he had occasion more than once to turn away and rub his hands together when after that second creditors meeting he had walked down the stairway which led to the offices of the island navigation company he had been deep in thought short squarely built rather stout with moustache and large muttonchop whiskers of a red brown and a faint floridity in face and dress he impressed at first sight only by a certain truly british vulgarity one felt that here was a hailfellowwellmet man who liked lunch and dinner went to scarborough for his summer holidays sat on his wife took his daughters out in a boat and was never sick one felt that he went to church every sunday morning looked upwards as he moved through life disliked the unsuccessful and expanded with his second glass of wine but then a clear look into his wellclothed face and redbrown eyes would give the feeling theres something fulvous here he might be a bit too foxy a third look brought the thought hes certainly a bully he was not a large creditor of old heythorp with interest on the original he calculated his claim at three hundred poundsunredeemed shares in that old ecuador mine but he had waited for his money eight years and could never imagine how it came about that he had been induced to wait so long there had been of course for one who liked big pots a certain glamour about the personality of old heythorp still a bit of a swell in shipping circles and a bit of an aristocrat in liverpool but during the last year charles ventnor had realised that the old chaps star had definitely setwhen that happens of course there is no more glamour and the time has come to get your money weakness in oneself and others is despicable besides he had food for thought and descending the stairs he chewed it he smelt a ratcreatures for which both by nature and profession he had a nose through bob pillin on whom he sometimes dwelt in connection with his younger daughter he knew that old pillin and old heythorp had been friends for thirty years and more that to an astute mind suggested something behind this sale the thought had already occurred to him when he read his copy of the report a commission would be a breach of trust of course but there were ways of doing things the old chap was devilish hard pressed and human nature was human nature his lawyerish mind habitually put two and two together the old fellow had deliberately appointed to meet his creditors again just after the general meeting which would decide the purchasehad said he might do something for them then had that no significance  in these circumstances charles ventnor had come to the meeting with eyes wide open and mouth tight closed and he had watched it was certainly remarkable that such an old and feeble man with no neck at all who looked indeed as if he might go off with apoplexy any moment should actually say that he stood or fell by this purchase knowing that if he fell he would be a beggar why should the old chap be so keen on getting it through it would do him personally no good unlessexactly he had left the meeting therefore secretly confident that old heythorp had got something out of this transaction which would enable him to make a substantial proposal to his creditors so that when the old man had declared that he was going to make none something had turned sour in his heart and he had said to himself all right you old rascal you dont know c v the cavalier manner of that beggarly old rip the defiant look of his deep little eyes had put a polish on the rancour of one who prided himself on letting no man get the better of him all that evening seated on one side of the fire while mrs ventnor sat on the other and the younger daughter played gounods serenade on the violinhe cogitated and now and again he smiled but not too much he did not see his way as yet but had little doubt that before long he would it would not be hard to knock that chipped old idol off his perch there was already a healthy feeling among the shareholders that he was past work and should be scrapped the old chap should find that charles v was not to be defied that when he got his teeth into a thing he did not let it go by hook or crook he would have the old man off his boards or his debt out of him as the price of leaving him alone his life or his moneyand the old fellow should determine which with the memory of that defiance fresh within him he almost hoped it might come to be the first and turning to mrs ventnor he said abruptly  have a little dinner friday week and ask young pillin and the curate he specified the curate a teetotaller because he had two daughters and males and females must be paired but he intended to pack him off after dinner to the drawingroom to discuss parish matters while he and bob pillin sat over their wine what he expected to get out of the young man he did not as yet know  on the day of the dinner before departing for the office he had gone to his cellar would three bottles of perrier jouet do the trick or must he add one of the old madeira he decided to be on the safe side a bottle or so of champagne went very little way with him personally and young pillin might be another  the madeira having done its work by turning the conversation into such an admirable channel he had cut it short for fear young pillin might drink the lot or get wind of the rat and when his guests were gone and his family had retired he stood staring into the fire putting together the pieces of the puzzle five or six thousand poundssix would be ten per cent on sixty exactly scrivensyoung pillin had said but crow  donkin not scriven  coles were old heythorps solicitors what could that mean save that the old man wanted to cover the tracks of a secret commission and had handled the matter through solicitors who did not know the state of his affairs but why pillins solicitors with this sale just going through it must look deuced fishy to them too was it all a mares nest after all in such circumstances he himself would have taken the matter to a london firm who knew nothing of anybody puzzled therefore and rather disheartened feeling too that touch of liver which was wont to follow his old madeira he went up to bed and woke his wife to ask her why the dickens they couldnt always have soup like that  next day he continued to brood over his puzzle and no fresh light came but having a matter on which his firm and scrivens were in touch he decided to go over in person and see if he could surprise something out of them feeling from experience that any really delicate matter would only be entrusted to the most responsible member of the firm he had asked to see scriven himself and just as he had taken his hat to go he said casually  by the way you do some business for old mr heythorp dont you  scriven raising his eyebrows a little murmured erno in exactly the tone mr ventnor himself used when he wished to imply that though he didnt as a fact do business he probably soon would he knew therefore that the answer was a true one and nonplussed he hazarded  oh i thought you did in regard to a mrs larne  this time he had certainly drawn blood of sorts for down came scrivens eyebrows and he said  mrs larnewe know a mrs larne but not in that connection why  oh young pillin told me  young pillin why its his a little pause and then old mr heythorps solicitors are crow  donkin i believe  mr ventnor held out his hand yes yes he said goodbye glad to have got that matter settled up and out he went and down the street important smiling by george he had got it its his fatherscriven had been going to say what a plant exactly oh neat old pillin had made the settlement direct and the solicitors were in the dark that disposed of his difficulty about them no money had passed between old pillin and old heythorp not a penny oh neat but not neat enough for charles ventnor who had that nose for rats then his smile died and with a little chill he perceived that it was all based on suppositionnot quite good enough to go on what then somehow he must see this mrs larne or betterold pillin himself the point to ascertain was whether she had any connection of her own with pillin clearly young pillin didnt know of it for according to him old heythorp had made the settlement by jove that old rascal was deepall the more satisfaction in proving that he was not as deep as c v to unmask the old cheat was already beginning to seem in the nature of a public service but on what pretext could he visit pillin a subscription to the windeatt almshouses that would make him talk in selfdefence and he would take care not to press the request to the actual point of getting a subscription he caused himself to be driven to the pillin residence in sefton park ushered into a room on the ground floor heated in american fashion mr ventnor unbuttoned his coat a man of sanguine constitution he found this hothouse atmosphere a little trying and having sympathetically obtained joe pillins reluctant refusalquite so one could not indefinitely extend ones subscriptions even for the best of causeshe said gently  by the way you know mrs larne dont you  the effect of that simple shot surpassed his highest hopes joe pillins face never highly coloured turned a sort of grey he opened his thin lips shut them quickly as birds do and something seemed to pass with difficulty down his scraggy throat the hollows which nerve exhaustion delves in the cheeks of men whose cheekbones are not high increased alarmingly for a moment he looked deathly then moistening his lips he said  larnelarne no i dont seem  mr ventnor who had taken care to be drawing on his gloves murmured  oh i thoughtyour son knows her a relation of old heythorps and he looked up  joe pillin had his handkerchief to his mouth he coughed feebly then with more and more vigour  im in very poor health he said at last im getting abroad at once this colds killing me what name did you say and he remained with his handkerchief against his teeth  mr ventnor repeated  larne writes stories  joe pillin muttered into his handkerchief  ali hm noino my son knows all sorts of people i shall have to try mentone are you going goodbye goodbye im sorry ah ha my coughah ha hhm very distressing yehes my coughah ha hhm most distressing yehes  out in the drive mr ventnor took a deep breath of the frosty air not much doubt now the two names had worked like charms this weakly old fellow would make a pretty witness would simply crumple under crossexamination what a contrast to that hoary old sinner heythorp whose brazenness nothing could affect the rat was as large as life and the only point was how to make the best use of it thenfor his experience was widethe possibility dawned on him that after all this mrs larne might only have been old pillins mistressor be his natural daughter or have some other blackmailing hold on him any such connection would account for his agitation for his denying her for his sons ignorance only it wouldnt account for young pillins saying that old heythorp had made the settlement he could only have got that from the woman herself still to make absolutely sure he had better try and see her but how it would never do to ask bob pillin for an introduction after this interview with his father he would have to go on his own and chance it wrote stories did she perhaps a newspaper would know her address or the directory would give itnot a common name and hot on the scent he drove to a post office yes there it was right enough larne mrs r 23 millicent villas and thinking to himself no time like the present he turned in that direction the job was delicate he must be careful not to do anything which might compromise his power of making public use of his knowledge yesticklish what he did now must have a proper legal bottom still anyway you looked at it he had a right to investigate a fraud on himself as a shareholder of the island navigation company and a fraud on himself as a creditor of old heythorp quite but suppose this mrs larne was really entangled with old pillin and the settlement a mere reward of virtue easy or otherwise well in that case thered be no secret commission to make public and he neednt go further so that in either event he would be all right onlyhow to introduce himself he might pretend he was a newspaper man wanting a story no that wouldnt do he must not represent that he was what he was not in case he had afterwards to justify his actions publicly always a difficult thing if you were not careful at that moment there came into his mind a question bob pillin had asked the other night by the way you cant borrow on a settlement can you isnt there generally some clause against it had this woman been trying to borrow from him on that settlement but at this moment he reached the house and got out of his cab still undecided as to how he was going to work the oracle impudence constitutional and professional sustained him in saying to the little maid  mrs larne at home say mr charles ventnor will you  his quick brown eyes took in the apparel of the passage which served for hallthe deep blue paper on the walls lilacpatterned curtains over the doors the wellknown print of a nude young woman looking over her shoulder and he thought hm distinctly tasty they noted too a small brownandwhite dog cowering in terror at the very end of the passage and he murmured affably fluffy come here fluffy till carmens teeth chattered in her head  will you come in sir  mr ventnor ran his hand over his whiskers and entering a room was impressed at once by its air of domesticity on a sofa a handsome woman and a pretty young girl were surrounded by sewing apparatus and some white material the girl looked up but the elder lady rose  mr ventnor said easily  you know my young friend mr robert pillin i think  the lady whose bulk and bloom struck him to the point of admiration murmured in a full sweet drawl  oh yees are you from messrs scrivens  with the swift reflection as i thought mr ventnor answered  ernot exactly i am a solicitor though came just to ask about a certain settlement that mr pillin tells me youre entitled under  phyllis dear  seeing the girl about to rise from underneath the white stuff mr ventnor said quickly  pray dont disturb yourselfjust a formality it had struck him at once that the lady would have to speak the truth in the presence of this third party and he went on quite recent i think thisll be your first intereston six thousand pounds is that right and at the limpid assent of that rich sweet voice he thought fine woman what eyes  thank you thats quite enough i can go to scrivens for any detail nice young fellow bob pillin isnt he he saw the girls chin tilt and mrs larnes full mouth curling in a smile  delightful young man were very fond of him  and he proceeded  im quite an old friend of his have you known him long  oh no how long phyllis since we met him at guardys about a month but hes so unaffectedquite at home with us a nice fellow  mr ventnor murmured  very different from his father isnt he  is he we dont know his father hes a shipowner i think  mr ventnor rubbed his hands yees he said just giving upa warm man young pillins a lucky fellowonly son so you met him at old mr heythorps i know him toorelation of yours i believe  our dear guardy such a wonderful man  mr ventnor echoed wonderfulregular old roman  oh but hes so kind mrs larne lifted the white stuff look what hes given this naughty gairl  mr ventnor murmured charming charming bob pillin said i think that mr heythorp was your settlor  one of those little clouds which visit the brows of women who have owed money in their time passed swiftly athwart mrs larnes eyes for a moment they seemed saying dont you want to know too much then they slid from under it  wont you sit down she said you must forgive our being at work  mr ventnor who had need of sorting his impressions shook his head  thank you i must be getting on then messrs scriven cana mere formality goodbye goodbye miss larne im sure the dress will be most becoming  and with memories of a too clear look from the girls eyes of a warm firm pressure from the womans hand mr ventnor backed towards the door and passed away just in time to avoid hearing in two voices  what a nice lawyer  what a horrid man  back in his cab he continued to rub his hands no she didnt know old pillin that was certain not from her words but from her face she wanted to know him or about him anyway she was trying to hook young bob for that sprig of a girlit was clear as mud hm it would astonish his young friend to hear that he had called well let it and a curious mixture of emotions beset mr ventnor he saw the whole thing now so plainly and really could not refrain from a certain admiration the law had been properly diddled there was nothing to prevent a man from settling money on a woman he had never seen and so old pillins settlement could probably not be upset but old heythorp could it was neat though oh neat and that was a fine womanremarkably he had a sort of feeling that if only the settlement had been in danger it might have been worth while to have made a bargaina woman like that could have made it worth while and he believed her quite capable of entertaining the proposition her eye pityquite a pity mrs ventnor was not a wife who satisfied every aspiration but alas the settlement was safe this baulking of the sentiment of love whipped up if anything the longing for justice in mr ventnor that old chap should feel his teeth now as a piece of investigation it was not so badnot so bad at all he had had a bit of luck of courseno not luckjust that knack of doing the right thing at the right moment which marks a real genius for affairs  but getting into his train to return to mrs ventnor he thought a woman like that would have been and he sighed     2  with a neatly written cheque for fifty pounds in his pocket bob pillin turned in at 23 millicent villas on the afternoon after mr ventnors visit chivalry had won the day and he rang the bell with an elation which astonished him for he knew he was doing a soft thing  mrs larne is out sir miss phyllis is at home  his heart leaped  ohh im sorry i wonder if shed see me  the little maid answered  i think shes been washin erair sir but it may be dry be now ill see  bob pillin stood stock still beneath the young woman on the wall he could scarcely breathe if her hair were not dryhow awful suddenly he heard floating down a clear but smothered oh gefoozleme and other words which he could not catch the little maid came running down  miss phyllis says sir shell be with you in a jiffy and i was to tell you that master jock is loose sir  bob pillin answered thaanks and passed into the drawingroom he went to the bureau took an envelope enclosed the cheque and addressing it mrs larne replaced it in his pocket then he crossed over to the mirror never till this last month had he really doubted his own face but now he wanted for it things he had never wanted it had too much flesh and colour it did not reflect his passion this was a handicap with a narrow white piping round his waistcoat opening and a buttonhole of tuberoses he had tried to repair its deficiencies but do what he would he was never easy about himself nowadays never up to that pitch which could make him confident in her presence and until this month to lack confidence had never been his wont a clear high mocking voice said  ohh conceited young man  and spinning round he saw phyllis in the doorway her light brown hair was fluffed out on her shoulders so that he felt a kind of faintingsweet sensation and murmured inarticulately  oh i sayhow jolly  lawks its awful have you come to see mother  balanced between fear and daring conscious of a scent of hay and verbena and camomile bob pillin stammered  yees iim glad shes not in though  her laugh seemed to him terribly unfeeling  oh oh dont be foolish sit down isnt washing ones head awful  bob pillin answered feebly  of course i havent much experience  her mouth opened  oh you arearent you  and he thought desperately dare ioughtnt icouldnt i somehow take her hand or put my arm round her or something instead he sat very rigid at his end of the sofa while she sat lax and lissom at the other and one of those crises of paralysis which beset wouldbe lovers fixed him to the soul  sometimes during this last month memories of a past existence when chaff and even kisses came readily to the lips and girls were fair game would make him think is she really such an innocent doesnt she really want me to kiss her alas such intrusions lasted but a moment before a blast of awe and chivalry withered them and a strange and tragic delicacylike nothing he had ever knownresumed its sway and suddenly he heard her say  why do you know such awful men  what i dont know any awful men  oh yes you do one came here yesterday he had whiskers and he was awful  whiskers his soul revolted in disclaimer i believe i only know one man with whiskersa lawyer  yesthat was him a perfectly horrid man mother didnt mind him but i thought he was a beast  ventnor came here how dyou mean  he did about some business of yours too her face had clouded over bob pillin had of late been harassed by the stillborn beginning of a poem           i rode upon my way and saw           a maid who watched me from the door  it never grew longer and was prompted by the feeling that her face was like an april day the cloud which came on it now was like an april cloud as if a bright shower of rain must follow brushing aside the two distressful lines he said  look here miss larnephyllislook here  all right im looking  what does it meanhow did he come what did he say  she shook her head and her hair quivered the scent of camomile verbena hay was wafted then looking at her lap she muttered  i wish you wouldnti wish mother wouldnti hate it oh money beastlybeastly and a tearful sigh shivered itself into bob pillins reddening ears  i saydont and do tell me because  oh you know  i donti dont know anything at all i never  phyllis looked up at him dont tell fibs you know mothers borrowing money from you and its hateful  a desire to lie roundly a sense of the cheque in his pocket a feeling of injustice the emotion of pity and a confused and black astonishment about ventnor caused bob pillin to stammer  well im dd and to miss the look which phyllis gave him through her lashesa look saying  ah thats better  i am dd look here dyou mean to say that ventnor came here about my lending money i never said a word to him  there you seeyou are lending  he clutched his hair  weve got to have this out he added  not by the roots oh you do look funny ive never seen you with your hair untidy oh oh  bob pillin rose and paced the room in the midst of his emotion he could not help seeing himself sidelong in the mirror and on pretext of holding his head in both his hands tried earnestly to restore his hair then coming to a halt he said  suppose i am lending money to your mother what does it matter its only till quarterday anybody might want money  phyllis did not raise her face  why are you lending it  becausebecausewhy shouldnt i and diving suddenly he seized her hands  she wrenched them free and with the emotion of despair bob pillin took out the envelope  if you like he said ill tear this up i dont want to lend it if you dont want me to but i thoughti thought it was for her alone he had been going to lend this money  phyllis murmured through her hair  yes you thought that ithats whats so hateful  apprehension pierced his mind  oh i neveri swear i never  yes you did you thought i wanted you to lend it  she jumped up and brushed past him into the window  so she thought she was being used as a decoy that was awfulespecially since it was true he knew well enough that mrs larne was working his admiration for her daughter for all that it was worth and he said with simple fervour  what rot it produced no effect and at his wits end he almost shouted look phyllis if you dont want me tohere goes phyllis turned tearing the envelope across he threw the bits into the fire there it is he said  her eyes grew round she said in an awed voice oh  in a sort of agony of honesty he said  it was only a cheque now youve got your way  staring at the fire she answered slowly  i expect youd better go before mother comes  bob pillins mouth fell afar he secretly agreed but the idea of sacrificing a moment alone with her was intolerable and he said hardily  no i shall stick it  phyllis sneezed  my hair isnt a bit dry and she sat down on the fender with her back to the fire  a certain spirituality had come into bob pillins face if only he could get that wheeze off phyllis is my only joy or even phyllisdo youwont youmaynt i but nothing camenothing  and suddenly she said  oh dont breathe so loud its awful  breathe i wasnt  you were just like carmen when shes dreaming  he had walked three steps towards the door before he thought what does it matter i can stand anything from her and walked the three steps back again  she said softly  poor young man  he answered gloomily  i suppose you realise that this may be the last time youll see me  why i thought you were going to take us to the theatre  i dont know whether your mother willafter  phyllis gave a little clear laugh  you dont know mother nothing makes any difference to her  and bob pillin muttered  i see he did not but it was of no consequence then the thought of ventnor again ousted all others what on earthhow on earth he searched his mind for what he could possibly have said the other night surely he had not asked him to do anything certainly not given him their address there was something very odd about it that had jolly well got to be cleared up and he said  are you sure the name of that johnny who came here yesterday was ventnor  phyllis nodded  and he was short and had whiskers  yes red and red eyes  he murmured reluctantly  it must be him jolly good cheek i simply cant understand i shall go and see him how on earth did he know your address  i expect you gave it him  i did not i wont have you thinking me a squirt  phyllis jumped up oh lawks heres mother mrs larne was coming up the garden bob pillin made for the door goodbye he said im going but mrs larne was already in the hall enveloping him in fur and her rich personality she drew him with her into the drawingroom where the back window was open and phyllis gone  i hope she said those naughty children have been making you comfortable that nice lawyer of yours came yesterday he seemed quite satisfied  very red above his collar bob pillin stammered  i never told him to he isnt my lawyer i dont know what it means  mrs larne smiled my dear boy its all right you neednt be so squeamish i want it to be quite on a business footing  restraining a fearful inclination to blurt out its not going to be on any footing bob pillin mumbled i must go im late  and when will you be able  oh illill sendill write goodbye and suddenly he found that mrs larne had him by the lapel of his coat the scent of violets and fur was overpowering and the thought flashed through him i believe she only wanted to take money off old joseph in the bible i cant leave my coat in her hands what shall i do  mrs larne was murmuring  it would be so sweet of you if you could manage it today and her hand slid over his chest oh you have brought your chequebookwhat a nice boy  bob pillin took it out in desperation and sitting down at the bureau wrote a cheque similar to that which he had torn and burned a warm kiss lighted on his eyebrow his head was pressed for a moment to a furry bosom a hand took the cheque a voice said how delightful and a sigh immersed him in a bath of perfume backing to the door he gasped  dont mention it andand dont tell phyllis please goodbye  once through the garden gate he thought by gum ive done it now that phyllis should know about it at all that beast ventnor  his face grew almost grim he would go and see what that meant anyway     3  mr ventnor had not left his office when his young friends card was brought to him tempted for a moment to deny his own presence he thought no whats the good bound to see him some time if he had not exactly courage he had that peculiar blend of selfconfidence and insensibility which must needs distinguish those who follow the law nor did he ever forget that he was in the right  show him in he said  he would be quite bland but young pillin might whistle for an explanation he was still tormented too by the memory of rich curves and moving lips and the possibilities of better acquaintanceship  while shaking the young mans hand his quick and fulvous eye detected at once the discomposure behind that mask of cheek and collar and relapsing into one of those swivel chairs which give one an advantage over men more statically seated he said  you look pretty bobbish anything i can do for you  bob pillin in the fixed chair of the consultor nursed his bowler on his knee  well yes there is ive just been to see mrs larne  mr ventnor did not flinch  ah nice woman pretty daughter too and into those words he put a certain meaning he never waited to be bullied bob pillin felt the pressure of his blood increasing  look here ventnor he said i want an explanation  what of  why of your going there and using my name and god knows what  mr ventnor gave his chair two little twiddles before he said  well you wont get it  bob pillin remained for a moment taken aback then he muttered resolutely  its not the conduct of a gentleman  every man has his illusions and no man likes them disturbed the gingery tint underlying mr ventnors colouring overlaid it even the whites of his eyes grew red  oh he said indeed you mind your own business will you  it is my businessvery much so you made use of my name and i dont choose  the devil you dont now i tell you what  mr ventnor leaned forwardyoud better hold your tongue and not exasperate me im a goodtempered man but i wont stand your impudence  clenching his bowler hat and only kept in his seat by that sense of something behind bob pillin ejaculated  impudence thats goodafter what you did look here why did you its so extraordinary  mr ventnor answered  oh is it you wait a bit my friend  still more moved by the mystery of this affair bob pillin could only mutter  i never gave you their address we were only talking about old heythorp  and at the smile which spread between mr ventnors whiskers he jumped up crying  its not the thing and youre not going to put me off i insist on an explanation  mr ventnor leaned back crossing his stout legs joining the tips of his thick fingers in this attitude he was always selfpossessed  you dodo you  yes you must have had some reason  mr ventnor gazed up at him  ill give you a piece of advice young cock and charge you nothing for it too ask no questions and youll be told no lies and heres another go away before you forget yourself again  the natural stolidity of bob pilings face was only just proof against this speech he said thickly  if you go there again and use my name ill well its lucky for you youre not my age anyway ill relieve you of my acquaintanceship in future goodevening and he went to the door mr ventnor had risen  very well he said loudly good riddance you wait and see which boot the leg is on  but bob pillin was gone leaving the lawyer with a very red face a very angry heart and a vague sense of disorder in his speech not only bob pillin but his tender aspirations had all left him he no longer dallied with the memory of mrs larne but like a man and a briton thought only of how to get his own back and punish evildoers the atrocious words of his young friend its not the conduct of a gentleman festered in the heart of one who was made gentle not merely by nature but by act of parliament and he registered a solemn vow to wipe the insult out if not with blood with verjuice it was his duty and they should dd well see him do it     iv  sylvanus heythorp seldom went to bed before one or rose before eleven the latter habit alone kept his valet from handing in the resignation which the former habit prompted almost every night  propped on his pillows in a crimson dressinggown and freshly shaved he looked more roman than he ever did except in his bath having disposed of coffee he was wont to read his letters and the morning post for he had always been a tory and could not stomach paying a halfpenny for his news not that there were many letterswhen a man has reached the age of eighty who should write to him except to ask for money  it was valentines day through his bedroom window he could see the trees of the park where the birds were in song though he could not hear them he had never been interested in naturefullblooded men with short necks seldom are  this morning indeed there were two letters and he opened that which smelt of something inside was a thing like a christmas card save that the naked babe had in his hands a bow and arrow and words coming out of his mouth to be your valentine there was also a little pink note with one blue forgetmenot printed at the top it ran   dearest guardyim sorry this is such a mangy little valentine i couldnt go out to get it because ive got a beastly cold so i asked jock and the pig bought this the satin is simply scrumptious if you dont come and see me in it some time soon i shall come and show it to you i wish i had a moustache because my top lip feels just like a matchbox but its rather ripping having breakfast in bed mr pillins taking us to the theatre the day after tomorrow evening isnt it nummy im going to have rum and honey for my cold  goodbye  your phyllis   so this that quivered in his thick fingers too insensitive to feel it was a valentine for him  forty years ago that young things grandmother had given him his last it made him out a very old chap forty years ago had that been himself living then and himself who as a youth came on the town in fortyfive not a thought not a feeling the same they said you changed your body every seven years the mind with it too perhaps well he had come to the last of his bodies now and that holy woman had been urging him to take it to bath with her face as long as a teatray and some gammon from that doctor of his too full a habitdock his portno alcoholmight go off in a coma any night knock off not he rather die any day than turn teetotaller when a man had nothing left in life except his dinner his bottle his cigar and the dreams they gave himthese doctors forsooth must want to cut them off no no carpe diem while you lived get something out of it and now that he had made all the provision he could for those youngsters his life was no good to any one but himself and the sooner he went off the better if he ceased to enjoy what there was left or lost the power to say ill do this and that and you be jiggered keep a stiff lip until you crashed and then go clean he sounded the bell beside him twicefor molly not his man and when the girl came in and stood pretty in her print frock her fluffy overfine dark hair escaping from under her cap he gazed at her in silence  yes sirr  want to look at you thats all  oh i an im not tidy sirr  never mind had your valentine  no sirr who would send me one then  havent you a young man  well i might but hes over in my country  what dyou think of this  he held out the little boy  the girl took the card and scrutinised it reverently she said in a detached voice  indeed an uts pretty too  would you like it  oh i if tis not taking ut from you  old heythorp shook his head and pointed to the dressingtable  over thereyoull find a sovereign little present for a good girl  she uttered a deep sigh oh sirr tis too much tis kingly  take it  she took it and came back her hands clasping the sovereign and the valentine in an attitude as of prayer  the old mans gaze rested on her with satisfaction  i like pretty facescant bear sour ones tell meller to get my bath ready  when she had gone he took up the other lettersome lawyers writing and opening it with the usual difficulty read   february 13 1905  sircertain facts having come to my knowledge i deem it my duty to call a special meeting of the shareholders of the island navigation coy to consider circumstances in connection with the purchase of mr joseph pillins fleet and i give you notice that at this meeting your conduct will be called in question  i am sir  yours faithfully  charles ventnor sylvanus heythorpesq   having read this missive old heythorp remained some minutes without stirring ventnor that solicitor chap who had made himself unpleasant at the creditors meetings  there are men whom a really bad bit of news at once stampedes out of all power of coherent thought and action and men who at first simply do not take it in old heythorp took it in fast enough coming from a lawyer it was about as nasty as it could be but at once with stoic wariness his old brain began casting round what did this fellow really know and what exactly could he do one thing was certain even if he knew everything he couldnt upset that settlement the youngsters were all right the old man grasped the fact that only his own position was at stake but this was enough in all conscience a name which had been before the public fifty odd yearsincome independence more perhaps it would take little seeing his age and feebleness to make his companies throw him over but what had the fellow got hold of how decide whether or no to take notice to let him do his worst or try and get into touch with him and what was the fellows motive he held ten shares that would never make a man take all this trouble and over a purchase which was really firstrate business for the company yes his conscience was quite clean he had not betrayed his companyon the contrary had done it a good turn got them four sound ships at a low priceagainst much opposition that he might have done the company a better turn and got the ships at fiftyfour thousand did not trouble himthe six thousand was a deuced sight better employed and he had not pocketed a penny piece himself but the fellows motive spite looked like it spite because he had been disappointed of his money and defied into the bargain hm if that were so he might still be got to blow cold again his eyes lighted on the pink note with the blue forgetmenot it marked as it were the high water mark of what was left to him of life and this other letter in his handby jove low water mark and with a deep and rumbling sigh he thought no im not going to be beaten by this fellow  your bath is ready sir  crumpling the two letters into the pocket of his dressinggown he said  help me up and telephone to mr farney to be good enough to come round   an hour later when the secretary entered his chairman was sitting by the fire perusing the articles of association and waiting for him to look up watching the articles shaking in that thick feeble hand the secretary had one of those moments of philosophy not too frequent with his kind some said the only happy time of life was when you had no passions nothing to hope and live for but did you really ever reach such a stage the old chairman for instance still had his passion for getting his own way still had his prestige and set a lot of store by it and he said  good morning sir i hope youre all right in this east wind the purchase is completed  best thing the company ever did have you heard from a shareholder called ventnor you know the man i mean  no sir i havent  well you may get a letter thatll make you open your eyes an impudent scoundrel just write at my dictation  february 14th 1905  charles ventnor esq  siri have your letter of yesterdays date the contents of which i am at a loss to understand my solicitors will be instructed to take the necessary measures  phew whats all this about the secretary thought  yours truly  ill sign and the shaky letters closed the page sylvanus heythorp  post that as you go  anything else i can do for you sir  nothing except to let me know if you hear from this fellow  when the secretary had gone the old man thought so the ruffian hasnt called the meeting yet thatll bring him round here fast enough if its his money he wantsblackmailing scoundrel  mr pillin sir and will you wait lunch or will you have it in the diningroom  in the diningroom  at sight of that deathshead of a fellow old heythorp felt a sort of pity he looked bad enough alreadyand this news would make him look worse joe pillin glanced round at the two closed doors  how are you sylvanus im very poorly he came closer and lowered his voice why did you get me to make that settlement i must have been mad ive had a man called ventnori didnt like his manner he asked me if i knew a mrs larne  ha what did you say  what could i say i dont know her but why did he ask  smells a rat  joe pillin grasped the edge of the table with both hands  oh he murmured oh dont say that  old heythorp held out to him the crumpled letter  when he had read it joe pillin sat down abruptly before the fire  pull yourself together joe they cant touch you and they cant upset either the purchase or the settlement they can upset me thats all  joe pillin answered with trembling lips  how you can sit there and look the same as ever are you sure they cant touch me  old heyworth nodded grimly  they talk of an act but they havent passed it yet they might prove a breach of trust against me but ill diddle them keep your pecker up and get off abroad  yes yes i must im very bad i was going tomorrow but i dont know im sure with this hanging over me my son knowing her makes it worse he picks up with everybody he knows

meetingdyou think they mean to have it dyou think this man really knows if my name gets into the newspapers but encountering his old friends deep little eyes he stopped so you advise me to get off tomorrow then  old heythorp nodded  your lunch is served sir  joe pillin started violently and rose  well goodbye sylvanusgoodbye i dont suppose i shall be back till the summer if i ever come back he sank his voice i shall rely on you you wont let them will you  old heythorp lifted his hand and joe pillin put into that swollen shaking paw his pale and spindly fingers i wish i had your pluck he said sadly goodbye sylvanus and turning he passed out  old heythorp thought poor shaky chap all to pieces at the first shot and going to his lunch ate more heavily than usual     2  mr ventnor on reaching his office and opening his letters found as he had anticipated one from that old rascal its contents excited in him the need to know his own mind fortunately this was not complicated by a sense of dignityhe only had to consider the position with an eye on not being made to look a fool the point was simply whether he set more store by his money than by his desire forerjustice if not he had merely to convene the special meeting and lay before it the plain fact that mr joseph pillin selling his ships for sixty thousand pounds had just made a settlement of six thousand pounds on a lady whom he did not know a daughter ward or whatnotof the purchasing companys chairman who had said moreover at the general meeting that he stood or fell by the transaction he had merely to do this and demand that an explanation be required from the old man of such a startling coincidence convinced that no explanation would hold water he felt sure that his action would be at once followed by the collapse if nothing more of that old image and the infliction of a nasty slur on old pillin and his hopeful son on the other hand three hundred pounds was money and if old heythorp were to say to him what do you want to make this fuss forheres what i owe you could a man of business and the world let his sense of justicehowever he might itch to have it satisfiedstand in the way of what was after all also his sense of justicefor this money had been owing to him for the deuce of along time in this dilemma the words  my solicitors will be instructed were of notable service in helping him to form a decision for he had a certain dislike of other solicitors and an intimate knowledge of the law of libel and slander if by any remote chance there should be a slip between the cup and the lip charles ventnor might be in the soupa position which he deprecated both by nature and profession high thinking therefore decided him at last to answer thus  february 19th 1905  siri have received your note i think it may be fair before taking further steps in this matter to ask you for a personal explanation of the circumstances to which i alluded i therefore propose with your permission to call on you at your private residence at five oclock tomorrow afternoon  yours faithfully charles ventnor  sylvanus heythorp esq  having sent this missive and arranged in his mind the damning if circumstantial evidence he had accumulated he awaited the hour with confidence for his nature was not lacking in the cocksurety of a briton all the same he dressed himself particularly well that morning putting on a blue and white striped waistcoat which with a creamcoloured tie set off his fulvous whiskers and full blue eyes and he lunched if anything more fully than his wont eating a stronger cheese and taking a glass of special club ale he took care to be late too to show the old fellow that his coming at all was in the nature of an act of grace a strong scent of hyacinths greeted him in the hall and mr ventnor who was an amateur of flowers stopped to put his nose into a fine bloom and think uncontrollably of mrs larne pity the things one had to give up in lifefine womenone thing and another pity the thought inspired in him a timely anger and he followed the servant intending to stand no nonsense from this paralytic old rascal  the room he entered was lighted by a bright fire and a single electric lamp with an orange shade on a table covered by a black satin cloth there were heavily gleaming oil paintings on the walls a heavy old brass chandelier without candles heavy dark red curtains and an indefinable scent of burnt acorns coffee cigars and old man he became conscious of a candescent spot on the far side of the hearth where the light fell on old heythorps thick white hair  mr ventnor sir  the candescent spot moved a voice said sit down  mr ventnor sat in an armchair on the opposite side of the fire and finding a kind of somnolence creeping over him pinched himself he wanted all his wits about him  the old man was speaking in that extinct voice of his and mr ventnor said rather pettishly  beg pardon i dont get you  old heythorps voice swelled with sudden force  your letters are greek to me  oh indeed i think we can soon make them into plain english  sooner the better  mr ventnor passed through a moment of indecision should he lay his cards on the table it was not his habit and the proceeding was sometimes attended with risk the knowledge however that he could always take them up again seeing there was no third person here to testify that he had laid them down decided him and he said  well mr heythorp the long and short of the matter is this our friend mr pillin paid you a commission of ten per cent on the sale of his ships oh yes he settled the money not on you but on your relative mrs larne and her children this as you know is a breach of trust on your part  the old mans voice where did you get hold of that cockandbull story brought him to his feet before the fire  it wont do mr heythorp my witnesses are mr pillin mrs larne and mr scriven  what have you come here for thenblackmail  mr ventnor straightened his waistcoat a rush of conscious virtue had dyed his face  oh you take that tone he said do you you think you can ride roughshod over everything well youre very much mistaken i advise you to keep a civil tongue and consider your position or ill make a beggar of you im not sure this isnt a case for a prosecution  gammon  the choler in charles ventnor kept him silent for a moment then he burst out  neither gammon nor spinach you owe me three hundred pounds youve owed it me for years and you have the impudence to take this attitude with me have you now i never bluster i say what i mean you just listen to me either you pay me what you owe me at once or i call this meeting and make what i know public youll very soon find out where you are and a good thing too for a more unscrupulousunscrupulous he paused for breath  occupied with his own emotion he had not observed the change in old heythorps face the imperial on that lower lip was bristling the crimson of those cheeks had spread to the roots of his white hair he grasped the arms of his chair trying to rise his swollen hands trembled a little saliva escaped one corner of his lips and the words came out as if shaken by his teeth  sosoyouyou bully me  conscious that the interview had suddenly passed from the phase of negotiation mr ventnor looked hard at his opponent he saw nothing but a decrepit passionate crimsonfaced old man at bay and all the instincts of one with everything on his side boiled up in him the miserable old turkeycockthe apoplectic image and he said  and youll do no good for yourself by getting into a passion at your age and in your condition i recommend a little prudence now just take my terms quietly or you know whatll happen im not to be intimidated by any of your airs and seeing that the old mans rage was such that he simply could not speak he took the opportunity of going on i dont care two straws which you doim out to show you whos master if you think in your dotage you can domineer any longerwell youll find two can play at that game come now which are you going to do  the old man had sunk back in his chair and only his little deepblue eyes seemed living then he moved one hand and mr ventnor saw that he was fumbling to reach the button of an electric bell at the end of a cord ill show him he thought and stepping forward he put it out of reach  thus frustrated the old man remainedmotionless staring up the word blackmail resumed its buzzing in mr ventnors ears the impudence the consummate impudence of it from this fraudulent old ruffian with one foot in bankruptcy and one foot in the grave if not in the dock  yes he said its never too late to learn and for once youve come up against someone a leetle bit too much for you havent you now youd better cry peccavi  then in the deathly silence of the room the moral force of his position and the collapse as it seemed of his opponent awakening a faint compunction he took a turn over the turkey carpet to readjust his mind  youre an old man and i dont want to be too hard on you im only showing you that you cant play fast and loose as if you were god almighty any longer youve had your own way too many years and now you cant have it see then as the old man again moved forward in his chair he added now dont get into a passion again calm yourself because i warn youthis is your last chance im a man of my word and what i say i do  by a violent and unsuspected effort the old man jerked himself up and reached the bell mr ventnor heard it ring and said sharply  mind you its nothing to me which you do i came for your own good please yourself well  he was answered by the click of the door and the old mans husky voice  show this hound out and then come back  mr ventnor had presence of mind enough not to shake his fist muttering very well mr heythorp ah very well he moved with dignity to the door the careful shepherding of the servant renewed the fire of his anger hound he had been called a hound     3  after seeing mr ventnor off the premises the man meller returned to his master whose face looked very oddall patchylike as he put it in the servants hall as though the blood driven to his head had mottled for good the snowy whiteness of the forehead he received the unexpected order  get me a hot bath ready and put some pine stuff in it  when the old man was seated there the valet asked  how long shall i give you sir  twenty minutes  very good sir  lying in that steaming brown fragrant liquid old heythorp heaved a stertorous sigh by losing his temper with that illconditioned cur he had cooked his goose it was done to a turn and he was a ruined man if onlyoh if only he could have seized the fellow by the neck and pitched him out of the room to have lived to be so spoken to to have been unable to lift hand or foot hardly even his voicehe would sooner have been dead yessooner have been dead a dumb and measureless commotion was still at work in the recesses of that thick old body silverbrown in the dark water whose steam he drew deep into his wheezing lungs as though for spiritual relief to be beaten by a cur like that to have that common cad of a pettifogging lawyer drag him down and kick him about tumble a name which had stood high in the dust the fellow had the power to make him a byword and a beggar it was incredible but it was a fact and tomorrow he would begin to do itperhaps had begun already his tree had come down with a crash eighty yearseighty good years he regretted none of themregretted nothing least of all this breach of trust which had provided for his grandchildrenone of the best things he had ever done the fellow was a cowardly hound too the way he had snatched the bellpull out of his reachdespicable cur and a chap like that was to put paid to the account of sylvanus heythorp to scratch him out of lifeso near the end of everything the very end his hand raised above the surface fell back on his stomach through the dark water and a bubble or two rose not so fastnot so fast he had but to slip down a foot let the water close over his head and goodbye to master ventnors triumph dead men could not be kicked off the boards of companies dead men could not be beggared deprived of their independence he smiled and stirred a little in the bath till the water reached the white hairs on his lower lip it smelt nice and he took a long sniff he had had a good life a good life and with the thought that he had it in his power at any moment to put master ventnors nose out of jointto beat the beggar after all a sense of assuagement and wellbeing crept over him his blood ran more evenly again he closed his eyes they talked about an afterlifepeople like that holy woman gammon you went to sleepa long sleep no dreams a nap after dinner dinner his tongue sought his palate yes he could eat a good dinner that dog hadnt put him off his stroke the best dinner he had ever eaten was the one he gave to jack herring chichester thornworthy nick treffry and jolyon forsyte at poles good lord in sixtyyessixtyfive just before he fell in love with alice larneten years before he came to liverpool that was a dinner cost twentyfour pounds for the six of themand forsyte an absurdly moderate fellow only nick treffry and himself had been threebottle men dead every jack man of them and suddenly he thought my names a good onei was never down beforenever beaten  a voice above the steam said  the twenty minutes is up sir  all right ill get out evening clothes  and meller taking out dress suit and shirt thought now what does the old bloomer want dressin up again for why cant he go to bed and have his dinner there when a mans like a baby the cradles the place for him  an hour later at the scene of his encounter with mr ventnor where the table was already laid for dinner old heythorp stood and gazed the curtains had been drawn back the window thrown open to air the room and he could see out there the shapes of the dark trees and a sky grapecoloured in the mild moist night it smelt good a sensuous feeling stirred in him warm from his bath clothed from head to foot in fresh garments deuce of a time since he had dined in full fig he would have liked a woman dining oppositebut not the holy woman no by georgewould have liked to see light falling on a womans shoulders once again and a pair of bright eyes he crossed snaillike towards the fire there that bullying fellow had stood with his back to itconfound his impudenceas if the place belonged to him and suddenly he had a vision of his three secretaries facesespecially young farneys as they would look when the pack got him by the throat and pulled him down his codirectors too old heythorp how are the mighty fallen and that hound jubilant  his valet passed across the room to shut the window and draw the curtains this chap too the day he could no longer pay his wages and had lost the power to say shant want your services any morewhen he could no longer even pay his doctor for doing his best to kill him off power interest independence allgone to be dressed and undressed given pap like a baby in arms served as they chose to serve him and wished out of the waybroken dishonoured  by money alone an old man had his being meat drink movement breath when all his money was gone the holy woman would let him know it fast enough they would all let him know it or if they didnt it would be out of pity he had never been pitied yetthank god and he said  get me up a bottle of perrier jouet whats the menu  germane soup sir filly de sole sweetbread cutlet soubees rum souffly  tell her to give me a hors doeuvre and put on a savoury  yes sir  when the man had gone he thought i should have liked an oystertoo late now and going over to his bureau he fumblingly pulled out the top drawer there was little in itjust a few papers business papers on his companies and a schedule of his debts not even a copy of his willhe had not made one nothing to leave letters he had never kept half a dozen bills a few receipts and the little pink note with the blue forgetmenot that was the lot an old tree gives up bearing leaves and its roots dry up before it comes down in a wind an old mans world slowly falls away from him till he stands alone in the night looking at the pink note he thought suppose id married alicea man never had a better mistress he fumbled the drawer to but still he strayed feebly about the room with a curious shrinking from sitting down legacy from the quarter of an hour he had been compelled to sit while that hound worried at his throat he was opposite one of the pictures now it gleamed dark and oily limning a scots grey who had mounted a wounded russian on his horse and was bringing him back prisoner from the balaclava charge a very old friendbought in fiftynine it had hung in his chambers in the albanyhung with him ever since with whom would it hang when he was gone for that holy woman would scrap it to a certainty and stick up some crucifixion or other some newfangled high art thing she could even do that now if she likedfor she owned it owned every mortal stick in the room to the very glass he would drink his champagne from all made over under the settlement fifteen years ago before his last big gamble went wrong de laudace toujours de laudace the gamble which had brought him down till his throat at last was at the mercy of a bullying hound the pitcher and the well at the mercy the sound of a popping cork dragged him from reverie he moved to his seat back to the window and sat down to his dinner by george they had got him an oyster and he said  ive forgotten my teeth  while the man was gone for them he swallowed the oysters methodically touching them one by one with cayenne chili vinegar and lemon ummm not quite what they used to be at pimms in the best days but not badnot bad then seeing the little blue bowl lying before him he looked up and said  my compliments to cook on the oysters give me the champagne and he lifted his trembling teeth thank god he could still put em in for himself the creaming goldenish fluid from the napkined bottle slowly reached the brim of his glass which had a hollow stem raising it to his lips very red between the white hairs above and below he drank with a gurgling noise and put the glass downempty nectar and just cold enough  i frapped it the least bit sir  quite right whats that smell of flowers  its from those yacinths on the sideboard sir they come from mrs larne this afternoon  put em on the table wheres my daughter  shes had dinner sir goin to a ball i think  a ball  charity ball i fancy sir  ummm give me a touch of the old sherry with the soup  yes sir i shall have to open a bottle  very well then do  on his way to the cellar the man confided to molly who was carrying the soup  the govnors going it tonight what hell be like tomorrow i dunno  the girl answered softly  poor old man let um have his pleasure and in the hall with the soup tureen against her bosom she hummed above the steam and thought of the ribbons on her new chemises bought out of the sovereign he had given her  and old heythorp digesting his osyters snuffed the scent of the hyacinths and thought of the st germain his favourite soup it would nt be firstrate at this time of yearshould be made with little young homegrown peas paris was the place for it ah the french were the fellows for eating andlooking things in the face not hypocritesnot ashamed of their reason or their senses  the soup came in he sipped it bending forward as far as he could his napkin tucked in over his shirtfront like a bib he got the bouquet of that sherry to a this sense of smell was very keen tonight rare old stuff it wasmore than a year since he had tasted itbut no one drank sherry nowadays hadnt the constitution for it the fish came up and went down and with the sweetbread he took his second glass of champagne always the best that second glassthe stomach well warmed and the palate not yet dulled umm so that fellow thought he had him beaten did he and he said suddenly  the fur coat in the wardrobe ive no use for it you can take it away tonight  with tempered gratitude the valet answered  thank you sir much obliged im sure so the old buffer had found out there was moth in it  have i worried you much  no sir not at all sirthat is no more than reason  afraid i have very sorrycant help it youll find that when you get like me  yes sir ive always admired your pluck sir  um very good of you to say so  always think of you keepin the flag flying sir  old heythorp bent his body from the waist  much obliged to you  not at all sir cooks done a little spinach in cream with the soubees  ah tell her from me its a capital dinner so far  thank you sir  alone again old heythorp sat unmoving his brain just narcotically touched the flag flyinthe flag flyin he raised his glass and sucked he had an appetite now and finished the three cutlets and all the sauce and spinach pity he could have managed a snipe fresh shot a desire to delay to lengthen dinner was strong upon him there were but the souffle and the savoury to come he would have enjoyed too someone to talk to he had always been fond of good companybeen good company himself or so they saidnot that he had had a chance of late even at the boards they avoided talking to him he had noticed for a long time well that wouldnt trouble him againhe had sat through his last board no doubt they shouldnt kick him off though he wouldnt give them that pleasurehad seen the beggars hankering after his chairmans shoes too long the souffle was before him now and lifting his glass he said  fill up  these are the special glasses sir only four to the bottle  fill up  the servant filled screwing up his mouth  old heythorp drank and put the glass down empty with a sigh he had been faithful to his principles finished the bottle before touching the sweeta good bottleof a good brand and now for the souffle delicious flipped down with the old sherry so that holy woman was going to a ball was she how deuced funny who would dance with a dry stick like that all eaten up with a piety which was just sexual disappointment ah yes lots of women like thathad often noticed empitied em too until you had to do with them and they made you as unhappy as themselves and were tyrants into the bargain and he asked  whats the savoury  cheese remmykin sir  his favourite  ill have my port with itthe sixtyeight the man stood gazing with evident stupefaction he had not expected this the old mans face was very flushed but that might be the bath he said feebly  are you sure you ought sir  no but im going to  would you mind if i spoke to miss heythorp sir  if you do you can leave my service  well sir i dont accept the responsibility  who asked you to  no sir  well get it then and dont be an ass  yes sir if the old man were not humoured he would have a fit perhaps  and the old man sat quietly staring at the hyacinths he felt happy his whole being lined and warmed and drowsedand there was more to come what had the holy folk to give you compared with the comfort of a good dinner could they make you dream and see life rosy for a little no they could only give you promissory notes which never would be cashed a man had nothing but his pluckthey only tried to undermine it and make him squeal for help he could see his precious doctor throwing up his hands port after a bottle of champagneyoull die of it and a very good death toonone better a sound broke the silence of the closedup room music his daughter playing the piano overhead singing too what a trickle of a voice jenny lind the swedish nightingalehe had never missed the nights when she was singingjenny lind  its very hot sir shall i take it out of the case  ah the ramequin  touch of butter and the cayenne  yes sir  he ate it slowly savouring each mouthful had never tasted a better with cheeseport he drank one glass and said  help me to my chair  and settled there before the fire with decanter and glass and handbell on the little low table by his side he murmured  bring coffee and my cigar in twenty minutes  tonight he would do justice to his wine not smoking till he had finished as old horace said  aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem  and raising his glass he sipped slowly spilling a drop or two shutting his eyes  the faint silvery squealing of the holy woman in the room above the scent of hyacinths the drowse of the fire on which a cedar log had just been laid the feeling of the port soaking down into the crannies of his being made up a momentary paradise then the music stopped and no sound rose but the tiny groans of the log trying to resist the fire dreamily he thought life wears you outwears you out logs on a fire and he filled his glass again that fellow had been careless there were dregs at the bottom of the decanter and he had got down to them then as the last drop from his tilted glass trickled into the white hairs on his chin he heard the coffee tray put down and taking his cigar he put it to his ear rolling it in his thick fingers in prime condition and drawing a first whiff he said  open that bottle of the old brandy in the sideboard  brandy sir i really darent sir  are you my servant or not  yes sir but  a minute of silence then the man went hastily to the sideboard took out the bottle and drew the cork the tide of crimson in the old mans face had frightened him  leave it there  the unfortunate valet placed the bottle on the little table ill have to tell her he thought but if i take away the port decanter and the glass it wont look so bad and carrying them he left the room  slowly the old man drank his coffee and the liqueur of brandy the whole gamut and watching his cigarsmoke wreathing blue in the orange glow he smiled the last night to call his soul his own the last night of his independence send in his resignations tomorrownot wait to be kicked off not give that fellow a chance  a voice which seemed to come from far off said  father youre drinking brandy how can youyou know its simple poison to you a figure in white scarcely actual loomed up close he took the bottle to fill up his liqueur glass in defiance but a hand in a long white glove with another dangling from its wrist pulled it away shook it at him and replaced it in the sideboard and just as when mr ventnor stood there accusing him a swelling and churning in his throat prevented him from speech his lips moved but only a little froth came forth  his daughter had approached again she stood quite close in white satin thinfaced sallow with eyebrows raised and her dark hair frizzedyes frizzedthe holy woman with all his might he tried to say so you bully me do youyou bully me tonight but only the word so and a sort of whispering came forth he heard her speaking its no good your getting angry father after champagneits wicked then her form receded in a sort of rustling white mist she was gone and he heard the sputtering and growling of her taxi bearing her to the ball so she tyrannised and bullied even before she had him at her mercy did she she should see anger had brightened his eyes the room came clear again and slowly raising himself he sounded the bell twice for the girl not for that fellow meller who was in the plot as soon as her pretty black and whiteaproned figure stood before him he said  help me up  twice her soft pulling was not enough and he sank back the third time he struggled to his feet  thank you thatll do then waiting till she was gone he crossed the room fumbled open the sideboard door and took out the bottle reaching over the polished oak he grasped a sherry glass and holding the bottle with both hands tipped the liquor into it put it to his lips and sucked drop by drop it passed over his palate mild very old old as himself coloured like sunlight fragrant to the last drop he drank it then hugging the bottle to his shirtfront he moved snaillike to his chair and fell back into its depths for some minutes he remained there motionless the bottle clasped to his chest thinking this is not the attitude of a gentleman i must put it down on the tableon the table but a thick cloud was between him and everything it was with his hands he would have to put the bottle on the table but he could not find his hands could not feel them his mind seesawed in strophe and antistrophe you cant movei will move youre beatenim not beat give upi wont that struggle to find his hands seemed to last for everhe must find them after thatgo downall standingafter that everything round him was red then the red cloud cleared just a little and he could hear the clocktickticktick a faint sensation spread from his shoulders down to his wrists down his palms and yeshe could feel the bottle he redoubled his struggle to get forward in his chair to get forward and put the bottle down it was not dignified like this one arm he could move now but he could not grip the bottle nearly tight enough to put it down working his whole body forward inch by inch he shifted himself up in the chair till he could lean sideways and the bottle slipping down his chest dropped slanting to the edge of the low stooltable then with all his might he screwed his trunk and arms an inch further and the bottle stood he had done itdone it his lips twitched into a smile his body sagged back to its old position he had done it and he closed his eyes   at halfpast eleven the girl molly opening the door looked at him and said softly sirr theres some ladies and a gentleman but he did not answer and still holding the door she whispered out into the hall  hes asleep miss  a voice whispered back  oh just let me go in i wont wake him unless he does but i do want to show him my dress  the girl moved aside and on tiptoe phyllis passed in she walked to where between the lampglow and the fireglow she was lighted up white satinher first lowcut dressthe flush of her first supper partya gardenia at her breast another in her fingers oh what a pity he was asleep how red he looked how funnily old men breathed and mysteriously as a child might she whispered  guardy  no answer and pouting she stood twiddling the gardenia then suddenly she thought ill put it in his buttonhole when he wakes up and sees it how hell jump  and stealing close she bent and slipped it in two faces looked at her from round the door she heard bob pillins smothered chuckle her mothers rich and feathery laugh oh how red his forehead was she touched it with her lips skipped back twirled round danced silently a second blew a kiss and like quicksilver was gone  and the whispering the chuckling and one little outpealing laugh rose in the hall  but the old man slept nor until meller came at his usual hour of halfpast twelve was it known that he would never wake     the apple tree                the appletree the singing and the gold                murrays hippolytus of euripides  in their silverwedding day ashurst and his wife were motoring along the outskirts of the moor intending to crown the festival by stopping the night at torquay where they had first met this was the idea of stella ashurst whose character contained a streak of sentiment if she had long lost the blueeyed flowerlike charm the cool slim purity of face and form the appleblossom colouring which had so swiftly and so oddly affected ashurst twentysix years ago she was still at fortythree a comely and faithful companion whose cheeks were faintly mottled and whose greyblue eyes had acquired a certain fullness  it was she who had stopped the car where the common rose steeply to the left and a narrow strip of larch and beech with here and there a pine stretched out towards the valley between the road and the first long high hill of the full moor she was looking for a place where they might lunch for ashurst never looked for anything and this between the golden furze and the feathery green larches smelling of lemons in the last sun of

top of the common crossed it at right angles and ran through a gate past the narrow wood was a thin mound of turf six feet by one with a moorstone to the west and on it someone had thrown a blackthorn

sepulchre among other hideous graves carved with futilitiesjust a rough stone the wide sky and wayside blessings and without comment for he had learned not to be a philosopher in the bosom of his family he strode away up on to the common dropped the luncheon basket under a wall spread a rug for his wife to sit onshe would turn up from her sketching when she was hungryand took from his pocket murrays translation of the hippolytus he had soon finished reading of the cyprian and her revenge and looked at the sky instead and watching the white clouds so bright against the intense blue ashurst on his silverwedding day longed forhe knew not what maladjusted to lifemans organism ones mode of life might be high and scrupulous but there was always an undercurrent of greediness a hankering and

glimmering or golden visions one had of the soul in nature glimpses of its remote and brooding spirit here with the sun hot on his face a cuckoo calling from a thorn tree and in the air the honey savour of gorsehere among the little fronds of the young fern the starry blackthorn while the bright clouds drifted by high above the hills and dreamy valleys here and now was such a glimpse but in a moment it would passas the face of pan which looks round the corner of a rock vanishes at your stare and suddenly he sat up surely there was something familiar about this view this bit of common that ribbon of road the old wall behind him while they were driving he had not been taking noticenever did thinking of far things or of nothingbut now he saw twentysix years ago just at this time of year from the farmhouse within half a mile of this very spot he had started for that day in torquay whence it might be said he had never returned and a sudden ache beset his heart he had stumbled on just one of those past moments in his life whose beauty and rapture he had failed to arrest whose wings had fluttered away into the unknown he had stumbled on a buried memory a wild sweet time swiftly choked and ended and turning on his face he rested his chin on his hands and stared at the short grass where the little blue milkwort was growing     i  and this is what he remembered  on the first of may after their last year together at college frank ashurst and his friend robert garton were on a tramp they had walked that day from brent intending to make chagford but ashursts football knee had given out and according to their map they had still some seven miles to go they were sitting on a bank beside theroad where a track crossed alongside a wood resting the knee and talking of the universe as young men will both were over six feet and thin as rails ashurst pale idealistic full of absence garton queer roundthecorner knotted curly like some primeval beast both had a literary bent neither wore a hat  ashursts hair was smooth pale wavy and had a way of rising on either side of his brow as if always being flung back cartons was a kind of dark unfathomed mop they had not met a soul for miles  my dear fellow garton was saying pitys only an effect of selfconsciousness its a disease of the last five thousand years the world was happier without  ashurst following the clouds with his eyes answered  its the pearl in the oyster anyway  my dear chap all our modern unhappiness comes from pity look at animals and red indians limited to feeling their own occasional misfortunes then look at ourselvesnever free from feeling the toothaches of others lets get back to feeling for nobody and have a better time  youll never practise that  garton pensively stirred the hotchpotch of his hair  to attain full growth one mustnt be squeamish to starve oneself emotionallys a mistake all emotion is to the goodenriches life  yes and when it runs up against chivalry  ah thats so english if you speak of emotion the english always think you want something physical and are shocked theyre afraid of passion but not of lustoh noso long as they can keep it secret  ashurst did not answer he had plucked a blue floweret and was twiddling it against the sky a cuckoo began calling from a thorn tree the sky the flowers the songs of birds robert was talking through his hat and he said  well lets go on and find some farm where we can put up in uttering those words he was conscious of a girl coming down from the common just above them she was outlined against the sky carrying a basket and you could see that sky through the crook of her arm and ashurst who saw beauty without wondering how it could advantage him thought how pretty the wind blowing her dark frieze skirt against her legs lifted her battered peacock tamoshanter her greyish blouse was worn and old her shoes were split her little hands rough and red her neck browned her dark hair waved untidy across her broad forehead her face was short her upper lip short showing a glint of teeth her brows were straight and dark her lashes long and dark her nose straight but her grey eyes were the wonderdewy as if opened for the first time that day she looked at ashurstperhaps he struck her as strange limping along without a hat with his large eyes on her and his hair falling back he could not take off what was not on his head but put up his hand in a salute and said  can you tell us if theres a farm near here where we could stay the night ive gone lame  theres only our farm near sir she spoke without shyness in a pretty soft crisp voice  and where is that  down here sir  would you put us up  oh i think we would  will you show us the way  yes sir  he limped on silent and garton took up the catechism  are you a devonshire girl  no sir  what then  from wales  ah i thought you were a celt so its not your farm  my aunts sir  and your uncles  he is dead  who farms it then  my aunt and my three cousins  but your uncle was a devonshire man  yes sir  have you lived here long  seven years  and how dyou like it after wales  i dont know sir  i suppose you dont remember  oh yes but it is different  i believe you  ashurst broke in suddenly how old are you  seventeen sir  and whats your name  megan david  this is robert garton and i am frank ashurst we wanted to get on to chagford  it is a pity your leg is hurting you  ashurst smiled and when he smiled his face was rather beautiful  descending past the narrow wood they came on the farm suddenlya long low stonebuilt dwelling with casement windows in a farmyard where pigs and fowls and an old mare were straying a short steepup grass hill behind was crowned with a few scotch firs and in front an old orchard of apple trees just breaking into flower stretched down to a stream and a long wild meadow a little boy with oblique dark eyes was shepherding a pig and by the house door stood a woman who came towards them the girl said  it is mrs narracombe my aunt  mrs narracombe my aunt had a quick dark eye like a mother wildducks and something of the same snaky turn about her neck  we met your niece on the road said ashurst she thought you might perhaps put us up for the night  mrs narracombe taking them in from head to heel answered  well i can if you dont mind one room megan get the spare room ready and a bowl of cream youll be wanting tea i suppose  passing through a sort of porch made by two yew trees and some floweringcurrant bushes the girl disappeared into the house her peacock tamoshanter bright athwart that rosypink and the dark green of the yews  will you come into the parlour and rest your leg youll be from college perhaps  we were but weve gone down now  mrs narracombe nodded sagely  the parlour brickfloored with bare table and shiny chairs and sofa stuffed with horsehair seemed never to have been used it was so terribly clean ashurst sat down at once on the sofa holding his lame knee between his hands and mrs narracombe gazed at him he was the only son of a late professor of chemistry but people found a certain lordliness in one who was often so sublimely unconscious of them  is there a stream where we could bathe  theres the strame at the bottom of the orchard but sittin down youll not be covered  how deep  well tis about a foot and a half maybe  oh thatll do fine which way  down the lane through the second gate on the right an the pools by the big apple tree that stands by itself theres trout there if you can tickle them  theyre more likely to tickle us  mrs narracombe smiled therell be the tea ready when you come back  the pool formed by the damming of a rock had a sandy bottom and the big apple tree lowest in the orchard grew so close that its boughs almost overhung the water it was in leaf and all but in flowerits crimson buds just bursting there was not room for more than one at a time in that narrow bath and ashurst waited his turn rubbing his knee and gazing at the wild meadow all rocks and thorn trees and feld flowers with a grove of beeches beyond raised up on a flat mound every bough was swinging in the wind every spring bird calling and a slanting sunlight dappled the grass he thought of theocritus and the river cherwell of the moon and the maiden with the dewy eyes of so many things that he seemed to think of nothing and he felt absurdly happy     2  during a late and sumptuous tea with eggs to it cream and jam and thin fresh cakes touched with saffron garton descanted on the celts it was about the period of the celtic awakening and the discovery that there was celtic blood about this family had excited one who believed that he was a celt himself sprawling on a horse hair chair with a handmade cigarette dribbling from the corner of his curly lips he had been plunging his cold pinpoints of eyes into ashursts and praising the refinement of the welsh to come out of wales into england was like the change from china to earthenware frank as a dd englishman had not of course perceived the exquisite refinement and emotional capacity of that welsh girl and delicately stirring in the dark mat of his still wet hair he explained how exactly she illustrated the writings of the welsh bard morganapsomething in the twelfth century  ashurst full length on the horsehair sofa and jutting far beyond its end smoked a deeplycoloured pipe and did not listen thinking of the girls face when she brought in a relay of cakes it had been exactly like looking at a flower or some other pretty sight in naturetill with a funny little shiver she had lowered her glance and gone out quiet as a mouse  lets go to the kitchen said garton and see some more of her  the kitchen was a whitewashed room with rafters to which were attached smoked hams there were flowerpots on the windowsill and guns hanging on nails queer mugs china and pewter and portraits of queen victoria a long narrow table of plain wood was set with bowls and spoons under a string of highhung onions two sheepdogs and three cats lay here and there on one side of the recessed fireplace sat two small boys idle and good as gold on the other sat a stout lighteyed redfaced youth with hair and lashes the colour of the tow he was running through the barrel of a gun between them mrs narracombe dreamily stirred some savouryscented stew in a large pot two other youths obliqueeyed darkhaired rather slyfaced like the two little boys were talking together and lolling against the wall and a short elderly cleanshaven man in corduroys seated in the window was conning a battered journal the girl megan seemed the only active creaturedrawing cider and passing with the jugs from cask to table seeing them thus about to eat garton said  ah if youll let us well come back when suppers over and without waiting for an answer they withdrew again to the parlour but the colour in the kitchen the warmth the scents and all those faces heightened the bleakness of their shiny room and they resumed their seats moodily  regular gipsy type those boys there was only one saxonthe fellow cleaning the gun that girl is a very subtle study psychologically  ashursts lips twitched garton seemed to him an ass just then subtle study she was a wild flower a creature it did you good to look at study  garton went on  emotionally she would be wonderful she wants awakening  are you going to awaken her  garton looked at him and smiled how coarse and english you are that curly smile seemed saying  and ashurst puffed his pipe awaken her that fool had the best opinion of himself he threw up the window and leaned out dusk had gathered thick the farm buildings and the wheelhouse were all dim and bluish the apple trees but a blurred wilderness the air smelled of woodsmoke from the kitchen fire one bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a halfhearted twitter as though surprised at the darkness from the stable came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse and away over there was the loom of the moor and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet full light pricking white through the deep blue heavens a quavering owl hooted ashurst drew a deep breath what a night to wander out in a padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane and three dim dark shapes passedponies on an evening march their heads black and fuzzy showed above the gate at the tap of his pipe and a shower of little sparks they shied round and scampered a bat went fluttering past uttering its almost inaudible chip chip ashurst held out his hand on the upturned palm he could feel the dew suddenly from overhead he heard little burring boys voices little thumps of boots thrown down and another voice crisp and softthe girls putting them to bed no doubt and nine clear words no rick you cant have the cat in bed then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles a soft slap a laugh so low and pretty that it made him shiver a little a blowing sound and the glim of the candle which was fingering the dusk above went out silence reigned ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down his knee pained him and his soul felt gloomy  you go to the kitchen he said im going to bed     3  for ashurst the wheel of slumber was wont to turn noiseless and slick and swift but though he seemed sunk in sleep when his companion came up he was really wide awake and long after carton smothered in the other bed of that lowroofed room was worshipping darkness with his upturned nose he heard the owls barring the discomfort of his knee it was not unpleasantthe cares of life did not loom large in night watches for this young man in fact he had none just enrolled a barrister with literary aspirations the world before him no father or mother and four hundred a year of his own did it matter where he went what he did or when he did it his bed too was hard and this preserved him from fever he lay sniffing the scent of the night which drifted into the low room through the open casement close to his head except for a definite irritation with his friend natural when you have tramped with a man for three days ashursts memories and visions that sleepless night were kindly and wistful and exciting one vision specially clear and unreasonable for he had not even been conscious of noting it was the face of the youth cleaning the gun its intent stolid yet startled uplook at the kitchen doorway quickly shifted to the girl carrying the cider jug this red blueeyed lightlashed towhaired face stuck as firmly in his memory as the girls own face so dewy and simple but at last in the square of darkness through the uncurtained casement he saw day coming and heard one hoarse and sleepy caw then followed silence dead as ever till the song of a blackbird not properly awake adventured into the hush and from staring at the framed brightening light ashurst fell asleep  next day his knee was badly swollen the walking tour was obviously over garton due back in london on the morrow departed at midday with an ironical smile which left a scar of irritationhealed the moment his loping figure vanished round the corner of the steep lane all day ashurst rested his knee in a greenpainted wooden chair on the patch of grass by the yewtree porch where the sunlight distilled the scent of stocks and gillyflowers and a ghost of scent from the floweringcurrant bushes beatifically he smoked dreamed watched  a farm in spring is all birthyoung things coming out of bud and shell and human beings watching over the process with faint excitement feeding and tending what has been born so still the young man sat that a mothergoose with stately crossfooted waddle brought her six yellownecked greybacked goslings to strop their little beaks against the grass blades at his feet now and again mrs narracombe or the girl megan would come and ask if he wanted anything and he would smile and say nothing thanks its splendid here towards teatime they came out together bearing a long poultice of some dark stuff in a bowl and after a long and solemn scrutiny of his swollen knee bound it on when they were gone he thought of the girls soft ohof her pitying eyes and the little wrinkle in her brow and again he felt that unreasoning irritation against his departed friend who had talked such rot about her when she brought out his tea he said  how did you like my friend megan  she forced down her upper lip as if afraid that to smile was not polite he was a funny gentleman he made us laugh i think he is very clever  what did he say to make you laugh  he said i was a daughter of the bards what are they  welsh poets who lived hundreds of years ago  why am i their daughter please  he meant that you were the sort of girl they sang about  she wrinkled her brows i think he likes to joke am i  would you believe me if i told you  oh yes  well i think he was right  she smiled  and ashurst thought you are a pretty thing  he said too that joe was a saxon type what would that be  which is joe with the blue eyes and red face  yes my uncles nephew  not your cousin then  no  well he meant that joe was like the men who came over to england about fourteen hundred years ago and conquered it  oh i know about them but is he  gartons crazy about that sort of thing but i must say joe does look a bit early saxon  yes  that yes tickled ashurst it was so crisp and graceful so conclusive and politely acquiescent in what was evidently greek to her  he said that all the other boys were regular gipsies he should not have said that my aunt laughed but she didnt like it of course and my cousins were angry uncle was a farmerfarmers are not gipsies it is wrong to hurt people  ashurst wanted to take her hand and give it a squeeze but he only answered  quite right megan by the way i heard you putting the little ones to bed last night  she flushed a little please to drink your teait is getting cold shall i get you some fresh  do you ever have time to do anything for yourself  oh yes  ive been watching but i havent seen it yet  she wrinkled her brows in a puzzled frown and her colour deepened  when she was gone ashurst thought did she think i was chaffing her i wouldnt for the world he was at that age when to some men beautys a flower as the poet says and inspires in them the thoughts of chivalry never very conscious of his surroundings it was some time before he was aware that the youth whom garton had called a saxon type was standing outside the stable door and a fine bit of colour he made in his soiled brown velvetcords muddy gaiters and blue shirt redarmed redfaced the sun turning his hair from tow to flax immovably stolid persistent unsmiling he stood then seeing ashurst looking at him he crossed the yard at that gait of the young countryman always ashamed not to be slow and heavydwelling on each leg and disappeared round the end of the house towards the kitchen entrance a chill came over ashursts mood clods with all the good will in the world how impossible to get on terms with them and yetsee that girl her shoes were split her hands rough butwhat was it was it really her celtic blood as garton had saidshe was a lady born a jewel though probably she could do no more than just read and write  the elderly cleanshaven man he had seen last night in the kitchen had come into the yard with a dog driving the cows to their milking ashurst saw that he was lame  youve got some good ones there  the lame mans face brightened he had the upward look in his eyes which prolonged suffering often brings  yeas theym praaper buties gude milkers tu  i bet they are  ope as yure legs better zurr  thank you its getting on  the lame man touched his own i know what tes meself tes a main worritin thing the knee ive aad mine bad this ten year  ashurst made the sound of sympathy which comes so readily from those who have an independent income and the lame man smiled again  mustnt complain thoughthey mighty near ad it off  ho  yeas an compared with what twas tes almost so gude as nu  theyve put a bandage of splendid stuff on mine  the maid she picks et shem a gude maid wi the flowers theres folks zeem to know the healin in things my mother was a rare one for that ope as yull zune be better zurr goo ahn therr  ashurst smiled wi the flowers a flower herself  that evening after his supper of cold duck junket and cider the girl came in  please auntie sayswill you try a piece of our mayday cake  if i may come to the kitchen for it  oh yes youll be missing your friend  not i but are you sure no one minds  who would mind we shall be very pleased  ashurst rose too suddenly for his stiff knee staggered and subsided the girl gave a little gasp and held out her hands ashurst took them small rough brown checked his impulse to put them to his lips and let her pull him up she came close beside him offering her shoulder and leaning on her he walked across the room that shoulder seemed quite the pleasantest thing he had ever touched but he had presence of mind enough to catch his stick out of the rack and withdraw his hand before arriving at the kitchen  that night he slept like a top and woke with his knee of almost normal size he again spent the morning in his chair on the grass patch scribbling down verses but in the afternoon he wandered about with the two little boys nick and rick it was saturday so they were early home from school quick shy dark little rascals of seven and six soon talkative for ashurst had a way with children by four oclock they had shown him all their methods of destroying life except the tickling of trout and with breeches tucked up lay on their stomachs over the trout stream pretending they had this accomplishment also they tickled nothing of course for their giggling and shouting scared every spotted thing away ashurst on a rock at the edge of the beech clump watched them and listened to the cuckoos till nick the elder and less persevering came up and stood beside him  the gipsy bogle zets on that stone he said  what gipsy bogie  dunno never zeen e megan zays e zets there an old jim zeed e once e was zettin there naight afore our pony kickedin fathers ead e plays the viddle  what tune does he play  dunno  whats he like  es black old jim zays es all over air es a praaper bogle e don come only at naight the little boys oblique dark eyes slid round dyu think e might want to take me away megans feared of e  has she seen him  no shes not afeared o yu  i should think not why should she be  she zays a prayer for yu  how do you know that you little rascal  when i was asleep she said god bless us all an mr ashes i yeard er whisperin  youre a little ruffian to tell what you hear when youre not meant to hear it  the little boy was silent then he said aggressively  i can skin rabbets megan she cant bear skinnin em i like blood  oh you do you little monster  whats that  a creature that likes hurting others  the little boy scowled theym only dead rabbets what us eats  quite right nick i beg your pardon  i can skin frogs tu  but ashurst had become absent god bless us all and mr ashes and puzzled by that sudden inaccessibility nick ran back to the stream where the giggling and shouts again uprose at once  when megan brought his tea he said  whats the gipsy bogle megan  she looked up startled  he brings bad things  surely you dont believe in ghosts  i hope i will never see him  of course you wont there arent such things what old jim saw was a pony  no there are bogies in the rocks they are the men who lived long ago  they arent gipsies anyway those old men were dead long before gipsies came  she said simply they are all bad  why if there are any theyre only wild like the rabbits the flowers arent bad for being wild the thorn trees were never plantedand you dont mind them i shall go down at night and look for your bogie and have a talk with him  oh no oh no  oh yes i shall go and sit on his rock  she clasped her hands together oh please  why what does it matter if anything happens to me  she did not answer and in a sort of pet he added  well i daresay i shant see him because i suppose i must be off soon  soon  your aunt wont want to keep me here  oh yes we always let lodgings in summer  fixing his eyes on her face he asked  would you like me to stay  yes  im going to say a prayer for you tonight  she flushed crimson frowned and went out of the room he sat cursing himself till his tea was stewed it was as if he had hacked with his thick boots at a clump of bluebells why had he said such a silly thing was he just a towny college ass like robert garton as far from understanding this girl  ashurst spent the next week confirming the restoration of his leg by exploration of the country within easy reach spring was a revelation to him this year in a kind of intoxication he would watch the pinkwhite buds of some backward beech tree sprayed up in the sunlight against the deep blue sky or the trunks and limbs of the few scotch firs tawny in violent light or again on the moor the galebent larches which had such a look of life when the wind streamed in their young green above the rusty black underboughs or he would lie on the banks gazing at the clusters of dogviolets or up in the dead bracken fingering the pink transparent buds of the dewberry while the cuckoos called and yafes laughed or a lark from very high dripped its beads of song it was certainly different from any spring he had ever known for spring was within him not without in the daytime he hardly saw the family and when megan brought in his meals she always seemed too busy in the house or among the young things in the yard to stay talking long but in the evenings he installed himself in the window seat in the kitchen smoking and chatting with the lame man jim or mrs narracombe while the girl sewed or moved about clearing the supper things away and sometimes with the sensation a cat must feel when it purrs he would become conscious that megans eyesthose dewgrey eyeswere fixed on him with a sort of lingering soft look which was strangely flattering  it was on sunday week in the evening when he was lying in the orchard listening to a blackbird and composing a love poem that he heard the gate swing to and saw the girl come running among the trees with the redcheeked stolid joe in swift pursuit about twenty yards away the chase ended and the two stood fronting each other not noticing the stranger in the grassthe boy pressing on the girl fending him off ashurst could see her face angry disturbed and the youthswho would have thought that redfaced yokel could look so distraught and painfully affected by that sight he jumped up they saw him then megan dropped her hands and shrank behind a tree trunk the boy gave an angry grunt rushed at the bank scrambled over and vanished ashurst went slowly up to her she was standing quite still biting her lipvery pretty with her fine dark hair blown loose about her face and her eyes cast down  i beg your pardon he said  she gave him one upward look from eyes much dilated then catching her breath turned away ashurst followed  megan  but she went on and taking hold of her arm he turned her gently round to him  stop and speak to me  why do you beg my pardon it is not to me you should do that  well then to joe  how dare he come after me  in love with you i suppose  she stamped her foot  ashurst uttered a short laugh would you like me to punch his head  she cried with sudden passion  you laugh at meyou laugh at us  he caught hold of her hands but she shrank back till her passionate little face and loose dark hair were caught among the pink clusters of the apple blossom ashurst raised one of her imprisoned hands and put his lips to it he felt how chivalrous he was and superior to that clod joejust brushing that small rough hand with his mouth i her shrinking ceased suddenly she seemed to tremble towards him a sweet warmth overtook ashurst from top to toe this slim maiden so simple and fine and pretty was pleased then at the touch of his lips and yielding to a swift impulse he put his arms round her pressed her to him and kissed her forehead then he was frightenedshe went so pale closing her eyes so that the long dark lashes lay on her pale cheeks her hands too lay inert at her sides the touch of her breast sent a shiver through him megan he sighed out and let her go in the utter silence a blackbird shouted then the girl seized his hand put it to her cheek her heart her lips kissed it passionately and fled away among the mossy trunks of the apple trees till they hid her from him  ashurst sat down on a twisted old tree growing almost along the ground and all throbbing and bewildered gazed vacantly at the blossom which had crowned her hairthose pink buds with one white open apple star what had he done how had he let himself be thus stampeded by beautypityorjust the spring he felt curiously happy all the same happy and triumphant with shivers running through his limbs and a vague alarm this was the beginning ofwhat the midges bit him the dancing gnats tried to fly into his mouth and all the spring around him seemed to grow more lovely and alive the songs of the cuckoos and the blackbirds the laughter of the yaflies the levelslanting sunlight the apple blossom which had crowned her head he got up from the old trunk and strode out of the orchard wanting space an open sky to get on terms with these new sensations he made for the moor and from an ash tree in the hedge a magpie flew out to herald him  of manat any age from five years onwho can say he has never been in love ashurst had loved his partners at his dancing class loved his nursery governess girls in schoolholidays perhaps never been quite out of love cherishing always some more or less remote admiration but this was different not remote at all quite a new sensation terribly delightful bringing a sense of completed manhood to be holding in his fingers such a wild flower to be able to put it to his lips and feel it tremble with delight against them what intoxication andembarrassment what to do with ithow meet her next time his first caress had been cool pitiful but the next could not be now that by her burning little kiss on his hand by her pressure of it to her heart he knew that she loved him some natures are coarsened by love bestowed on them others like ashursts are swayed and drawn warmed and softened almost exalted by what they feel to be a sort of miracle  and up there among the tors he was racked between the passionate desire to revel in this new sensation of spring fulfilled within him and a vague but very real uneasiness at one moment he gave himself up completely to his pride at having captured this pretty trustful dewyeyed thing at the next he thought with factitious solemnity yes my boy but look out what youre doing you know what comes of it  dusk dropped down without his noticingdusk on the carved assyrianlooking masses of the rocks and the voice of nature said this is a new world for you as when a man gets up at four oclock and goes out into a summer morning and beasts birds trees stare at him and he feels as if all had been made new  he stayed up there for hours till it grew cold then groped his way down the stones and heather roots to the road back into the lane and came again past the wild meadow to the orchard there he struck a match and looked at his watch nearly twelve it was black and unstirring in there now very different from the lingering birdbefriended brightness of six hours ago and suddenly he saw this idyll of his with the eyes of the outer worldhad mental vision of mrs narracombes snakelike neck turned her quick dark glance taking it all in her shrewd face hardening saw the gipsylike cousins coarsely mocking and distrustful joe stolid and furious only the lame man jim with the suffering eyes seemed tolerable to his mind and the village pubthe gossiping matrons he passed on his walks and thenhis own friendsrobert cartons smile when he went off that morning ten days ago so ironical and knowing disgusting for a minute he literally hated this earthy cynical world to which one belonged willynilly the gate where he was leaning grew grey a sort of shimmer passed be fore him and spread into the bluish darkness the moon he could just see it over the bank be hind red nearly rounda strange moon and turning away he went up the lane which smelled of the night and cowdung and young leaves in the strawyard he could see the dark shapes of cattle broken by the pale sickles of their horns like so many thin moons fallen endsup he unlatched the farm gate stealthily all was dark in the house muffling his footsteps he gained the porch and blotted against one of the yew trees looked up at megans window it was open was she sleeping or lying awake perhaps disturbedunhappy at his absence an owl hooted while he stood there peering up and the sound seemed to fill the whole night so quiet was all else save for the neverending murmur of the stream running below the orchard the cuckoos by day and now the owlshow wonderfully they voiced this troubled ecstasy within him and suddenly he saw her at her window looking out he moved a little from the yew tree and whispered megan she drew back vanished reappeared leaning far down he stole forward on the grass patch hit his shin against the greenpainted chair and held his breath at the sound the pale blur of her stretcheddown arm and face did not stir he moved the chair and noiselessly mounted it by stretching up his arm he could just reach her hand held the huge key of the front door and he clasped that burning hand with the cold key in it he could just see her face the glint of teeth between her lips her tumbled hair she was still dressedpoor child sitting up for him no doubt pretty megan her hot roughened fingers clung to his her face had a strange lost look to have been able to reach iteven with his hand the owl hooted a scent of sweetbriar crept into his nostrils then one of the farm dogs barked her grasp relaxed she shrank back  goodnight megan  goodnight sir she was gone with a sigh he dropped back to earth and sitting on that chair took off his boots nothing for it but to creep in and go to bed yet for a long while he sat unmoving his feet chilly in the dew drunk on the memory of her lost halfsmiling face and the clinging grip of her burning fingers pressing the cold key into his hand     5  he awoke feeling as if he had eaten heavily overnight instead of having eaten nothing and far off unreal seemed yesterdays romance yet it was a golden morning full spring had burst at lastin one night the goldiecups as the little boys called them seemed to have made the field their own and from his window he could see apple blossoms covering the orchard as with a rose and white quilt he went down almost dreading to see megan and yet when not she but mrs narracombe brought in his breakfast he felt vexed and disappointed the womans quick eye and snaky neck seemed to have a new alacrity this morning had she noticed  so you an the moon went walkin last night mr ashurst did ye have your supper anywheres  ashurst shook his head  we kept it for you but i suppose you was too busy in your brain to think o such a thing as that  was she mocking him in that voice of hers which still kept some welsh crispness against the invading burr of the west country if she knew and at that moment he thought no no ill clear out i wont put myself in such a beastly false position  but after breakfast the longing to see megan began and increased with every minute together with fear lest something should have been said to her which had spoiled everything sinister that she had not appeared not given him even a glimpse of her and the love poem whose manufacture had been so important and absorbing yesterday afternoon under the apple trees now seemed so paltry that he tore it up and rolled it into pipe spills what had he known of love till she seized his hand and kissed it and nowwhat did he not know but to write of it seemed mere insipidity he went up to his bedroom to get a book and his heart began to beat violently for she was in there making the bed he stood in the doorway watching and suddenly with turbulent joy he saw her stoop and kiss his pillow just at the hollow made by his head last night  how let her know he had seen that pretty act of devotion and yet if she heard him stealing away it would be even worse she took the pillow up holding it as if reluctant to shake out the impress of his cheek dropped it and turned round  megan  she put her hands up to her cheeks but her eyes seemed to look right into him he had never before realised the depth and purity and touching faithfulness in those dewbright eyes and he stammered  it was sweet of you to wait up for me last night  she still said nothing and he stammered on  i was wandering about on the moor it was such a jolly night iive just come up for a book  then the kiss he had seen her give the pillow afflicted him with sudden headiness and he went up to her touching her eyes with his lips he thought with queer excitement ive done it yesterday all was suddenanyhow but nowive done it the girl let her forehead rest against his lips which moved downwards till they reached hers that first real lovers kissstrange wonderful still almost innocentin which heart did it make the most disturbance  come to the big apple tree tonight after theyve gone to bed meganpromise  she whispered back i promise  then scared at her white face scared at everything he let her go and went downstairs again yes he had done it now accepted her love declared his own he went out to the green chair as devoid of a book as ever and there he sat staring vacantly before him triumphant and remorseful while under his nose and behind his back the work of the farm went on how long he had been sitting in that curious state of vacancy he had no notion when he saw joe standing a little behind him to the right the youth had evidently come from hard work in the fields and stood shifting his feet breathing loudly his face coloured like a setting sun and his arms below the rolledup sleeves of his blue shirt showing the hue and furry sheen of ripe peaches his red lips were open his blue eyes with their flaxen lashes stared fixedly at ashurst who said ironically  well joe anything i can do for you  yeas  what then  yu can goo away from yere us don want yu  ashursts face never too humble assumed its most lordly look  very good of you but do you know i prefer the others should speak for themselves  the youth moved a pace or two nearer and the scent of his honest heat afflicted ashursts nostrils  what dyu stay yere for  because it pleases me  twont please yu when ive bashed yure head in  indeed when would you like to begin that  joe answered only with the loudness of his breathing but his eyes looked like those of a young and angry bull then a sort of spasm seemed to convulse his face  megan don want yu  a rush of jealousy of contempt and anger with this thick loudbreathing rustic got the better of ashursts selfpossession he jumped up and pushed back his chair  you can go to the devil  and as he said those simple words he saw megan in the doorway with a tiny brown spaniel puppy in her arms she came up to him quickly  its eyes are blue she said  joe turned away the back of his neck was literally crimson  ashurst put his finger to the mouth of the little brown bullfrog of a creature in her arms how cosy it looked against her  its fond of you already ah i megan everything is fond of you  what was joe saying to you please  telling me to go away because you didnt want me here  she stamped her foot then looked up at ashurst at that adoring look he felt his nerves quiver just as if he had seen a moth scorching its wings  tonight he said dont forget  no and smothering her face against the puppys little fat brown body she slipped back into the house  ashurst wandered down the lane at the gate of the wild meadow he came on the lame man and his cows  beautiful day jim  ah tes brave weather for the grass the ashes be later than th oaks this year when th oak before th ash  ashurst said idly where were you standing when you saw the gipsy bogie jim  it might be under that big apple tree as you might say  and you really do think it was there  the lame man answered cautiously  i shouldnt like to say rightly that t was there twas in my mind as twas there  what do you make of

lovinearted  ashurst who felt colour coming into his cheeks held out his tobacco pouch  have a fill jim  thank ee sir shem one in an underd i think  i expect so said ashurst shortly and folding up his pouch walked on  lovinhearted yes and what was he doing what were his intentionsas they say towards this lovinghearted girl the thought dogged him wandering through fields bright with buttercups where the little red calves were feeding and the swallows flying high yes the oaks were before the ashes browngold already every tree in different stage and hue the cuckoos and a thousand birds were singing the little streams were very bright the ancients believed in a golden age in the garden of the hesperides a queen wasp settled on his sleeve each queen wasp killed meant two thousand fewer wasps to thieve the apples which would grow from that blossom in the orchard but who with love in his heart could kill anything on a day like this he entered a field where a young red bull was feeding it seemed to ashurst that he looked like joe but the young bull took no notice of this visitor a little drunk himself perhaps on the singing and the glamour of the golden pasture under his short legs ashurst crossed out unchallenged to the hillside above the stream from that slope a for mounted to its crown of rocks the ground there was covered with a mist of bluebells and nearly a score of crabapple trees were in full bloom he threw himself down on the grass the change from the buttercup glory and oakgoldened glamour of the fields to this ethereal beauty under the grey for filled him with a sort of wonder nothing the same save the sound of running water and the songs of the cuckoos he lay there a long time watching the sunlight wheel till the crabtrees threw shadows over the bluebells his only companions a few wild bees he was not quite sane thinking of that mornings kiss and of tonight under the apple tree in such a spot as this fauns and dryads surely lived nymphs white as the crabapple blossom retired within those trees fauns brown as the dead bracken with pointed ears lay in wait for them the cuckoos were still calling when he woke there was the sound of running water but the sun had couched behind the tor the hillside was cool and some rabbits had come out tonight he thought just as from the earth everything was pushing up unfolding under the soft insistent fingers of an unseen hand so were his heart and senses being pushed unfolded he got up and broke off a spray from a crabapple tree the buds were like meganshelllike rosepink wild and fresh and so too the opening flowers white and wild and touching he put the spray into his coat and all the rush of the spring within him escaped in a triumphant sigh but the rabbits scurried away     6  it was nearly eleven that night when ashurst put down the pocket odyssey which for half an hour he had held in his hands without reading and slipped through the yard down to the orchard the moon had just risen very golden over the hill and like a bright powerful watching spirit peered through the bars of an ash trees halfnaked boughs in among the apple trees it was still dark and he stood making sure of his direction feeling the rough grass with his feet a black mass close behind him stirred with a heavy grunting sound and three large pigs settled down again close to each other under the wall he listened there was no wind but the streams burbling whispering chuckle had gained twice its daytime strength one bird he could not tell what cried pippip pippip with perfect monotony he could hear a nightjar spinning very far off an owl hooting ashurst moved a step or two and again halted aware of a dim living whiteness all round his head on the dark unstirring trees innumerable flowers and buds all soft and blurred were being bewitched to life by the creeping moonlight he had the oddest feeling of actual companionship as if a million white moths or spirits had floated in and settled between dark sky and darker ground and were opening and shutting their wings on a level with his eyes in the bewildering still scentless beauty of that moment he almost lost memory of why he had come to the orchard the flying glamour which had clothed the earth all day had not gone now that night had fallen but only changed into this new form he moved on through the thicket of stems and boughs covered with that live powdering whiteness till he reached the big apple tree no mistaking that even in the dark nearly twice the height and size of any other and leaning out towards the open meadows and the stream under the thick branches he stood still again to listen the same sounds exactly and a faint grunting from the sleepy pigs he put his hands on the dry almost warm tree trunk whose rough mossy surface gave forth a peaty scent at his touch would she comewould she and among these quivering haunted moonwitched trees he was seized with doubts of everything all was unearthly here fit for no earthly lovers fit only for god and goddess faun and nymph not for him and this little country girl would it not be almost a relief if she did not come but all the time he was listening and still that unknown bird went pippip pippip and there rose the busy chatter of the little trout stream whereon the moon was flinging glances through the bars of her treeprison the blossom on a level with his eyes seemed to grow more living every moment seemed with its mysterious white beauty more and more a part of his suspense he plucked a fragment and held it closethree blossoms sacrilege to pluck fruittree blossomsoft sacred young blossomand throw it away then suddenly he heard the gate close the pigs stirring again and grunting and leaning against the trunk he pressed his hands to its mossy sides behind him and held his breath she might have been a spirit threading the trees for all the noise she made then he saw her quite closeher dark form part of a little tree her white face part of its blossom so still and peering towards him he whispered megan and held out his hands she ran forward straight to his breast when he felt her heart beating against him ashurst knew to the full the sensations of chivalry and passion because she was not of his world because she was so simple and young and headlong adoring and defenceless how could he be other than her protector in the dark because she was all simple nature and beauty as much a part of this spring night as was the living blossom how should he not take all that she would give him how not fulfil the spring in her heart and his and torn between these two emotions he clasped her close and kissed her hair how long they stood there without speaking he knew not the stream went on chattering the owls hooting the moon kept stealing up and growing whiter the blossom all round them and above brightened in suspense of living beauty their lips had sought each others and they did not speak the moment speech began all would be unreal spring has no speech nothing but rustling and whispering spring has so much more than speech in its unfolding flowers and leaves and the coursing of its streams and in its sweet restless seeking and sometimes spring will come alive and like a mysterious presence stand encircling lovers with its arms laying on them the fingers of enchantment so that standing lips to lips they forget everything but just a kiss while her heart beat against him and her lips quivered on his ashurst felt nothing but simple rapturedestiny meant her for his arms love could not be flouted but when their lips parted for breath division began again at once only passion now was so much the stronger and he sighed  oh megan why did you come she looked up hurt amazed  sir you asked me to  dont call me sir my pretty sweet  what should i be callin you  frank  i could not oh no  but you love medont you  i could not help lovin you i want to be with youthats all  all  so faint that he hardly heard she whispered i shall die if i cant be with you  ashurst took a mighty breath  come and be with me then  oh  intoxicated by the awe and rapture in that oh he went on whispering  well go to london ill show you the world  and i will take care of you i promise megan ill never be a brute to you  if i can be with youthat is all  he stroked her hair and whispered on  tomorrow ill go to torquay and get some money and get you some clothes that wont be noticed and then well steal away and when we get to london soon perhaps if you love me well enough well be married  he could feel her hair shiver with the shake of her head  oh no i could not i only want to be with you  drunk on his own chivalry ashurst went on murmuring its i who am not good enough for you oh megan when did you begin to love me  when i saw you in the road and you looked at me the first night i loved you but i never thought you would want me  she slipped down suddenly to her knees trying to kiss his feet  a shiver of horror went through ashurst he lifted her up bodily and held her fasttoo upset to speak  she whispered why wont you let me  its i who will kiss your feet  her smile brought tears into his eyes the whiteness of her moonlit face so close to his the faint pink of her opened lips had the living unearthly beauty of the apple blossom  and then suddenly her eyes widened and stared past him painfully she writhed out of his arms and whispered look  ashurst saw nothing but the brightened stream the furze faintly gilded the beech trees glistening and behind them all the wide loom of the moonlit hill behind him came her frozen whisper the gipsy bogie  where  thereby the stoneunder the trees  exasperated he leaped the stream and strode towards the beech clump prank of the moonlight nothing in and out of the boulders and thorn trees muttering and cursing yet with a kind of terror he rushed and stumbled absurd silly then he went back to the apple tree but she was gone he could hear a rustle the grunting of the pigs the sound of a gate closing instead of her only this old apple tree he flung his arms round the trunk what a substitute for her soft body the rough moss against his facewhat a substitute for her soft cheek only the scent as of the woods a little the same and above him and around the blossoms more living more moonlit than ever seemed to glow and breathe     7  descending from the train at torquay station ashurst wandered uncertainly along the front for he did not know this particular queen of english watering places having little sense of what he had on he was quite unconscious of being remarkable among its inhabitants and strode along in his rough norfolk jacket dusty boots and battered hat without observing that people gazed at him rather blankly he was seeking a branch of his london bank and having found one found also the first obstacle to his mood did he know anyone in torquay no in that case if he would wire to his bank in london they would be happy to oblige him on receipt of the reply that suspicious breath from the matteroffact world somewhat tarnished the brightness of his visions but he sent the telegram  nearly opposite to the post office he saw a shop full of ladies garments and examined the window with strange sensations to have to undertake the clothing of his rustic love was more than a little disturbing he went in a young woman came forward she had blue eyes and a faintly puzzled forehead ashurst stared at her in silence  yes sir  i want a dress for a young lady  the young woman smiled ashurst frowned the peculiarity of his request struck him with sudden force  the young woman added hastily  what style would you likesomething modish  no simple  what figure would the young lady be  i dont know about two inches shorter than you i should say  could you give me her waist measurement  megans waist  oh anything usual  quite  while she was gone he stood disconsolately eyeing the models in the window and suddenly it seemed to him incredible that meganhis megan could ever be dressed save in the rough tweed skirt coarse blouse and tamoshanter cap he was wont to see her in the young woman had come back with several dresses in her arms and ashurst eyed her laying them against her own modish figure there was one whose colour he liked a dovegrey but to imagine megan clothed in it was beyond him the young woman went away and brought some more but on ashurst there had now come a feeling of paralysis how choose she would want a hat too and shoes and gloves and suppose when he had got them all they commonised her as sunday clothes always commonised village folk why should she not travel as she was ah but conspicuousness would matter this was a serious elopement and staring at the young woman he thought i wonder if she guesses and thinks me a blackguard  do you mind putting aside that grey one for me he said desperately at last i cant decide now ill come in again this afternoon  the young woman sighed  oh certainly its a very tasteful costume i dont think youll get anything that will suit your purpose better  i expect not ashurst murmured and went out  freed again from the suspicious matteroffactness of the world he took a long breath and went back to visions in fancy he saw the trustful pretty creature who was going to join her life to his saw himself and her stealing forth at night walking over the moor under the moon he with his arm round her and carrying her new garments till in some faroff wood when dawn was coming she would slip off her old things and put on these and an early train at a distant station would bear them away on their honeymoon journey till london swallowed them up and the dreams of love came true  frank ashurst havent seen you since rugby old chap  ashursts frown dissolved the face close to his own was blueeyed suffused with sunone of those faces where sun from within and without join in a sort of lustre and he answered  phil halliday by jove  what are you doing here  oh nothing just looking round and getting some money im staying on the moor  are you lunching anywhere come and lunch with us im here with my young sisters theyve had measles  hooked in by that friendly arm ashurst went along up a hill down a hill away out of the town while the voice of halliday redolent of optimism as his face was of sun explained how in this mouldy place the only decent things were the bathing and boating and so on till presently they came to a crescent of houses a little above and back from the sea and into the centre one an hotelmade their way  come up to my room and have a wash lunchll be ready in a jiffy  ashurst contemplated his visage in a lookingglass after his farmhouse bedroom the comb and one spare shirt regime of the last fortnight this room littered with clothes and brushes was a sort of capua and he thought queerone doesnt realise but whathe did not quite know  when he followed halliday into the sitting room for lunch three faces very fair and blueeyed were turned suddenly at the words this is frank ashurst my young sisters  two were indeed young about eleven and ten the third was perhaps seventeen tall and fairhaired too with pinkandwhite cheeks just touched by the sun and eyebrows rather darker than the hair running a little upwards from her nose to their outer points the voices of all three were like hallidays high and cheerful they stood up straight shook hands with a quick movement looked at ashurst critically away again at once and began to talk of what they were going to do in the afternoon a regular diana and attendant nymphs after the farm this crisp slangy eager talk this cool clean offhand refinement was queer at first and then so natural that what he had come from became suddenly remote the names of the two little ones seemed to be sabina and freda of the eldest stella  presently the one called sabina turned to him and said  i say will you come shrimping with usits awful fun  surprised by this unexpected friendliness ashurst murmured  im afraid ive got to get back this afternoon  oh  cant you put it off  ashurst turned to the new speaker stella shook his head and smiled she was very pretty sabina said regretfully you might then the talk switched off to caves and swimming  can you swim far  about two miles  oh  i say  how jolly  the three pairs of blue eyes fixed on him made him conscious of his new importancethe sensation was agreeable halliday said  i say you simply must stop and have a bathe youd better stay the night  yes do  but again ashurst smiled and shook his head then suddenly he found himself being catechised about his physical achievements he had rowedit seemedin his college boat played in his college football team won his college mile and he rose from table a sort of hero the two little girls insisted that he must see their cave and they set forth chattering like magpies ashurst between them stella and her brother a little behind in the cave damp and darkish like any other cave the great feature was a pool with possibility of creatures which might be caught and put into bottles sabina and freda who wore no stockings on their shapely brown legs exhorted ashurst to join them in the middle of it and help sieve the water he too was soon bootless and sockless time goes fast for one who has a sense of beauty when there are pretty children in a pool and a young diana on the edge to receive with wonder anything you can catch ashurst never had much sense of time it was a shock when pulling out his watch he saw it was well past three no cashing his cheque todaythe bank would be closed before he could get there watching his expression the little girls cried out at once  hurrah now youll have to stay  ashurst did not answer he was seeing again megans face when at breakfast time he had whispered im going to torquay darling to get everything i shall be back this evening if its fine we can go tonight be ready he was seeing again how she quivered and hung on his words what would she think then he pulled himself together conscious suddenly of the calm scrutiny of this other young girl so tall and fair and dianalike at the edge of the pool of her wondering blue eyes under those brows which slanted up a little if they knew what was in his mindif they knew that this very night he had meant well there would be a little sound of disgust and he would be alone in the cave and with a curious mixture of anger chagrin and shame he put his watch back into his pocket and said abruptly  yes im dished for today  hurrah now you can bathe with us  it was impossible not to succumb a little to the contentment of these pretty children to the smile on stellas lips to hallidays ripping old chap i can lend you things for the night but again a spasm of longing and remorse throbbed through ashurst and he said moodily  i must send a wire  the attractions of the pool palling they went back to the hotel ashurst sent his wire addressing it to mrs narracombe sorry detained for the night back tomorrow surely megan would understand that he had too much to do and his heart grew lighter it was a lovely afternoon warm the sea calm and blue and swimming his great passion the favour of these pretty children flattered him the pleasure of looking at them at stella at hallidays sunny face the slight unreality yet extreme naturalness of it allas of a last peep at normality before he took this plunge with megan he got his borrowed bathing dress and they all set forth halliday and he undressed behind one rock the three girls behind another he was first into the sea and at once swam out with the bravado of justifying his selfgiven reputation when he turned he could see halliday swimming along shore and the girls flopping and dipping and riding the little waves in the way he was accustomed to despise but now thought pretty and sensible since it gave him the distinction of the only deepwater fish but drawing near he wondered if they would like him a stranger to come into their splashing group he felt shy approaching that slim nymph then sabina summoned him to teach her to float and between them the little girls kept him so busy that he had no time even to notice whether stella was accustomed to his presence till suddenly he heard a startled sound from her she was standing submerged to the waist leaning a little forward her slim white arms stretched out and pointing her wet face puckered by the sun and an expression of fear  look at phil is he all right oh look  ashurst saw at once that phil was not all right he was splashing and struggling out of his depth perhaps a hundred yards away suddenly he gave a cry threw up his arms and went down ashurst saw the girl launch herself towards him and crying out go back stella go back he dashed out he had never swum so fast and reached halliday just as he was coming up a second time it was a case of cramp but to get him in was not difficult for he did not struggle the girl who had stopped where ashurst told her to helped as soon as he was in his depth and once on the beach they sat down one on each side of him to rub his limbs while the little ones stood by with scared faces halliday was soon smiling it washe saidrotten of him absolutely rotten if frank would give him an arm he could get to his clothes all right now ashurst gave him the arm and as he did so caught sight of stellas face wet and flushed and tearful all broken up out of its calm and he thought i called her stella wonder if she minded  while they were dressing halliday said quietly you saved my life old chap  rot  clothed but not quite in their right minds they went up all together to the hotel and sat down to tea except halliday who was lying down in his room after some slices of bread and jam sabina said  i say you know you are a brick and freda chimed in  rather  ashurst saw stella looking down he got up in confusion and went to the window from there he heard sabina mutter i say lets swear blood bond wheres your knife freda and out of the corner of his eye could see each of them solemnly prick herself squeeze out a drop of blood and dabble on a bit of paper he turned and made for the door  dont be a stoat come back his arms were seized imprisoned between the little girls he was brought back to the table on it lay a piece of paper with an effigy drawn in blood and the three names stella halliday sabina halliday freda hallidayalso in blood running towards it like the rays of a star sabina said  thats you we shall have to kiss you you know  and freda echoed  oh blowyes  before ashurst could escape some wettish hair dangled against his face something like a bite descended on his nose he felt his left arm pinched and other teeth softly searching his cheek then he was released and freda said  now stella  ashurst red and rigid looked across the table at a red and rigid stella sabina giggled freda cried  buck upit spoils everything  a queer ashamed eagerness shot through ashurst then he said quietly  shut up you little demons  again sabina giggled  well then she can kiss her hand and you can put it against your nose it is on one side  to his amazement the girl did kiss her hand and stretch it out solemnly he took that cool slim hand and laid it to his cheek the two little girls broke into clapping and freda said  now then we shall have to save your life at any time thats settled can i have another cup stella not so beastly weak tea was resumed and ashurst folding up the paper put it in his pocket the talk turned on the advantages of measles tangerine oranges honey in a spoon no lessons and so forth ashurst listened silent exchanging friendly looks with stella whose face was again of its normal suntouched pink and white it was soothing to be so taken to the heart of this jolly family fascinating to watch their faces and after tea while the two little girls pressed seaweed he talked to stella in the window seat and looked at her watercolour sketches the whole thing was like a pleasurable dream time and incident hung up importance and reality suspended tomorrow he would go back to megan with nothing of all this left save the paper with the blood of these children in his pocket children stella was not quite thatas old as megan her talkquick rather hard and shy yet friendlyseemed to flourish on his silences and about her there was something cool and virginala maiden in a bower at dinner to which halliday who had swallowed too much seawater did not come sabina said  im going to call you frank  freda echoed  frank frank franky  ashurst grinned and bowed  every time stella calls you mr ashurst shes got to pay a forfeit its ridiculous  ashurst looked at stella who grew slowly red sabina giggled freda cried  shes smokingsmokingyah  ashurst reached out to right and left and grasped some fair hair in each hand  look here he said you two leave stella alone or ill tie you together  freda gurgled  ouch you are a beast  sabina murmured cautiously  you call her stella you see  why shouldnt i its a jolly name  all right we give you leave to  ashurst released the hair stella what would she call himafter this but she called him nothing till at bedtime he said deliberately  goodnight stella  goodnight mrgoodnight frank it was jolly of you you know  ohthat bosh  her quick straight handshake tightened suddenly and as suddenly became slack  ashurst stood motionless in the empty sittingroom only last night under the apple tree and the living blossom he had held megan to him kissing her eyes and lips and he gasped swept by that rush of remembrance tonight it should have begunhis life with her who only wanted to be with him and now twentyfour hours and more must pass becauseof not looking at his watch why had he made friends with this family of innocents just when he was saying goodbye to innocence and all the rest of it but i mean to marry her he thought i told her so  he took a candle lighted it and went to his bedroom which was next to hallidays his friends voice called as he was passing  is that you old chap i say come in  he was sitting up in bed smoking a pipe and reading  sit down a bit  ashurst sat down by the open window  ive been thinking about this afternoon you know said halliday rather suddenly they say you go through all your past i didnt i suppose i wasnt far enough gone  what did you think of  halliday was silent for a little then said quietly  well i did think of one thingrather oddof a girl at cambridge that i might haveyou know i was glad i hadnt got her on my mind anyhow old chap i owe it to you that im here i should have been in the big dark by now no more bed or baccy no more anything i say what dyou suppose happens to us  ashurst murmured  go out like flames i expect  phew  we may flicker and cling about a bit perhaps  hm i think thats rather gloomy i say i hope my young sisters have been decent to you  awfully decent  halliday put his pipe down crossed his hands behind his neck and turned his face towards the window  theyre not bad kids he said  watching his friend lying there with that smile and the candlelight on his face ashurst shuddered quite true he might have been lying there with no smile with all that sunny look gone out for ever he might not have been lying there at all but sanded at the bottom of the sea waiting for resurrection on the ninth day was it and that smile of hallidays seemed to him suddenly something wonderful as if in it were all the difference between life and deaththe little flamethe all he got up and said softly  well you ought to sleep i expect shall i blow out  halliday caught his hand  i cant say it you know but it must be rotten to be dead goodnight old boy  stirred and moved ashurst squeezed the hand and went downstairs the hall door was still open and he passed out on to the lawn before the crescent the stars were bright in a very dark blue sky and by their light some lilacs had that mysterious colour of flowers by night which no one can describe ashurst pressed his face against a spray and before his closed eyes megan started up with the tiny brown spaniel pup against her breast i thought of a girl that i might have you know i was glad i hadnt got her on my mind he jerked his head away from the lilac and began pacing up and down over the grass a grey phantom coming to substance for a moment in the light from the lamp at either end he was with her again under the living breathing white ness of the blossom the stream chattering by the moon glinting steelblue on the bathingpool back in the rapture of his kisses on her upturned face of innocence and humble passion back in the suspense and beauty of that pagan night he stood still once more in the shadow of the lilacs here the sea not the stream was nights voice the sea with its sigh and rustle no little bird no owl no nightjar called or spun but a piano tinkled and the white houses cut the sky with solid curve and the scent from the lilacs filled the air a window of the hotel high up was lighted he saw a shadow move across the blind and most queer sensations stirred within him a sort of churning and twining and turning of a single emotion on itself as though spring and love bewildered and confused seeking the way were baffled this girl who had called him frank whose hand had given his that sudden little clutch this girl so cool and purewhat would she think of such wild unlawful loving he sank down on the grass sitting there crosslegged with his back to the house motionless as some carved buddha was he really going to break through innocence and steal sniff the scent out of a wild flower andperhapsthrow it away of a girl at cambridge that i might haveyou know he put his hands to the grass one on each side palms downwards and pressed it was just warm stillthe grass barely moist soft and firm and friendly what am i going to do he thought perhaps megan was at her window looking out at the blossom thinking of him poor little megan why not he thought i love her but do i really love her or do i only want her because she is so pretty and loves me what am i going to do the piano tinkled on the stars winked and ashurst gazed out before him at the dark sea as if spellbound he got up at last cramped and rather chilly there was no longer light in any window and he went in to bed  out of a deep and dreamless sleep he was awakened by the sound of thumping on the door a shrill voice called  hi breakfasts ready  he jumped up where was he ah  he found them already eating marmalade and sat down in the empty place between stella and sabina who after watching him a little said  i say do buck up were going to start at halfpast nine  were going to berry head old chap you must come  ashurst thought come impossible i shall be getting things and going back he looked at stella she said quickly  do come  sabina chimed in  itll be no fun without you  freda got up and stood behind his chair  youve got to come or else ill pull your hair  ashurst thought wellone day moreto think it over one day more and he said  all right you neednt tweak my mane  hurrah  at the station he wrote a second telegram to the farm and then tore it up he could not have explained why from brixham they drove in a very little wagonette there squeezed between sabina and freda with his knees touching stellas they played up jenkins  and the gloom he was feeling gave way to frolic in this one day more to think it over he did not want to think they ran races wrestled paddledfor today nobody wanted to bathethey sang catches played games and ate all they had brought the little girls fell asleep against him on the way back and his knees still touched stellas in the narrow wagonette it seemed incredible that thirty hours ago he had never set eyes on any of those three flaxen heads in the train he talked to stella of poetry discovering her favourites and telling her his own with a pleasing sense of superiority till suddenly she said rather low  phil says you dont believe in a future life frank i think thats dreadful  disconcerted ashurst muttered  i dont either believe or not believei simply dont know  she said quickly  i couldnt bear that what would be the use of living  watching the frown of those pretty oblique brows ashurst answered  i dont believe in believing things because a one wants to  but why should one wish to live again if one isnt going to  and she looked full at him  he did not want to hurt her but an itch to dominate pushed him on to say  while ones alive one naturally wants to go on living for ever thats part of being alive but it probably isnt anything more  dont you believe in the bible at all then  ashurst thought now i shall really hurt her  i believe in the sermon on the mount because its beautiful and good for all time  but dont you believe christ was divine  he shook his head  she turned her face quickly to the window and there sprang into his mind megans prayer repeated by little nick god bless us all and mr ashes who else would ever say a prayer for him like her who at this moment must be waitingwaiting to see him come down the lane and he thought suddenly what a scoundrel i am  all that evening this thought kept coming back but as is not unusual each time with less poignancy till it seemed almost a matter of course to be a scoundrel andstrangehe did not know whether he was a scoundrel if he meant to go back to megan or if he did not mean to go back to her  they played cards till the children were sent off to bed then stella went to the piano from over on the window seat where it was nearly dark ashurst watched her between the candlesthat fair head on the long white neck bending to the movement of her hands she played fluently without much expression but what a picture she made the faint golden radiance a sort of angelic atmosphere hovering about her who could have passionate thoughts or wild desires in the presence of that swaying whiteclothed girl with the seraphic head she played a thing of schumanns called warum then halliday brought out a flute and the spell was broken after this they made ashurst sing stella playing him accompaniments from a book of schumann songs till in the middle of ich grolle nicht two small figures clad in blue dressinggowns crept in and tried to conceal themselves beneath the piano the evening broke up in confusion and what sabina called a splendid rag  that night ashurst hardly slept at all he was thinking tossing and turning the intense domestic intimacy of these last two days the strength of this halliday atmosphere seemed to ring him round and make the farm and meganeven meganseem unreal had he really made love to herreally promised to take her away to live with him he must have been bewitched by the spring the night the apple blossom this may madness could but destroy them both the notion that he was going to make her his mistressthat simple child not yet eighteennow filled him with a sort of horror even while it still stung and whipped his blood he muttered to himself its awful what ive doneawful and the sound of schumanns music throbbed and mingled with his fevered thoughts and he saw again stellas cool white fairhaired figure and bending neck the queer angelic radiance about her i must have beeni must bemad he thought what came into me poor little megan god bless us all and mr ashes i want to be with youonly to be with you and burying his face in his pillow he smothered down a fit of sobbing not to go back was awful to go backmore awful still  emotion when you are young and give real vent to it loses its power of torture and he fell asleep thinking what was ita few kissesall forgotten in a month  next morning he got his cheque cashed but avoided the shop of the dovegrey dress like the plague and instead bought himself some necessaries he spent the whole day in a queer mood cherishing a kind of sullenness against himself instead of the hankering of the last two days he felt nothing but a blankall passionate longing gone as if quenched in that outburst of tears after tea stella put a book down beside him and said shyly  have you read that frank  it was farrars life of christ ashurst smiled her anxiety about his beliefs seemed to him comic but touching infectious too perhaps for he began to have an itch to justify himself if not to convert her and in the evening when the children and halliday were mending their shrimping nets he said  at the back of orthodox religion so far as i can see theres always the idea of rewardwhat you can get for being good a kind of begging for favours i think it all starts in fear  she was sitting on the sofa making reefer knots with a bit of string she looked up quickly  i think its much deeper than that  ashurst felt again that wish to dominate  you think so he said but wanting the quid pro quo is about the deepest thing in all of us its jolly hard to get to the bottom of it  she wrinkled her brows in a puzzled frown  i dont think i understand  he went on obstinately  well think and see if the most religious people arent those who feel that this life doesnt give them all they want i believe in being good because to be good is good in itself  then you do believe in being good  how pretty she looked nowit was easy to be good with her and he nodded and said  i say show me how to make that knot  with her fingers touching his in manoeuvring the bit of string he felt soothed and happy and when he went to bed he wilfully kept his thoughts on her wrapping himself in her fair cool sisterly radiance as in some garment of protection  next day he found they had arranged to go by train to totnes and picnic at berry pomeroy castle still in that resolute oblivion of the past he took his place with them in the landau beside halliday back to the horses and then along the sea front nearly at the turning to the railway station his heart almost leaped into his mouth meganmegan herselfwas walking on the far pathway in her old skirt and jacket and her tamoshanter looking up into the faces of the passersby instinctively he threw his hand up for cover then made a feint of clearing dust out of his eyes but between his fingers he could see her still moving not with her free country step but wavering lostlooking pitifullike some little dog which has missed its master and does not know whether to run on to run backwhere to run how had she come like thiswhat excuse had she found to get awaywhat did she hope for but with every turn of the wheels bearing him away from her his heart revolted and cried to him to stop them to get out and go to her when the landau turned the corner to the station he could stand it no more and opening the carriage door muttered ive forgotten something go ondont wait for me ill join you at the castle by the next train he jumped stumbled spun round recovered his balance and walked forward while the carriage with the astonished hallidays rolled on  from the corner he could only just see megan a long way ahead now he ran a few steps checked himself and dropped into a walk with each step nearer to her further from the hallidays he walked more and more slowly how did it alter anythingthis sight of her how make the going to her and that which must come of it less ugly for there was no hiding itsince he had met the hallidays he had become gradually sure that he would not marry megan it would only be a wild lovetime a troubled remorseful difficult timeand thenwell then he would get tired just because she gave him everything was so simple and so trustful so dewy and dewwears off the little spot of faded colour her tamoshanter cap wavered on far in front of him she was looking up into every face and at the house windows had any man ever such a cruel moment to go through whatever he did he felt he would be a beast and he uttered a groan which made a nursemaid turn and stare he saw megan stop and lean against the seawall looking at the sea and he too stopped quite likely she had never seen the sea before and even in her distress could not resist that sight yesshes seen nothing he thought everythings before her and just for a few weeks passion i shall be cutting her life to ribbons id better go and hang myself rather than do it and suddenly he seemed to see stellas calm eyes looking into his the wave of fluffy hair on her forehead stirred by the wind ah it would be madness would mean giving up all that he respected and his own selfrespect he turned and walked quickly back towards the station but memory of that poor bewildered little figure those anxious eyes searching the passersby smote him too hard again and once more he turned towards the sea  the cap was no longer visible that little spot of colour had vanished in the stream of the noon promenaders and impelled by the passion of longing the dearth which comes on one when life seems to be whirling something out of reach he hurried forward she was nowhere to be seen for half an hour he looked for her then on the beach flung himself face downward in the sand to find her again he knew he had only to go to the station and wait till she returned from her fruitless quest to take her train home or to take train himself and go back to the farm so that she found him there when she returned but he lay inert in the sand among the indifferent groups of children with their spades and buckets pity at her little figure wandering seeking was wellnigh merged in the springrunning of his blood for it was all wild feeling nowthe chivalrous part what there had been of it was gone he wanted her again wanted her kisses her soft little body her abandonment all her quick warm pagan emotion wanted the wonderful feeling of that night under the moonlit apple boughs wanted it all with a horrible intensity as the faun wants the nymph the quick chatter of the little bright troutstream the dazzle of the buttercups the rocks of the old wild men the calling of the cuckoos and yaffles the hooting of the owls and the red moon peeping out of the velvet dark at the living whiteness of the blossom and her face just out of reach at the window lost in its lovelook and her heart against his her lips answering his under the apple treeall this besieged him yet he lay inert what was it which struggled against pity and this feverish longing and kept him there paralysed in the warm sand three flaxen headsa fair face with friendly bluegrey eyes a slim hand pressing his a quick voice speaking his nameso you do believe in being good yes and a sort of atmosphere as of some old walledin english garden with pinks and cornflowers and roses and scents of lavender and lilaccool and fair untouched almost holyall that he had been brought up to feel was clean and good and suddenly he thought she might come along the front again and see me and he got up and made his way to the rock at the far end of the beach there with the spray biting into his face he could think more coolly to go back to the farm and love megan out in the woods among the rocks with everything around wild and fittingthat he knew was impossible utterly to transplant her to a great town to keep in some little flat or rooms one who belonged so wholly to naturethe poet in him shrank from it his passion would be a mere sensuous revel soon gone in london her very simplicity her lack of all intellectual quality would make her his secret playthingnothing else the longer he sat on the rock with his feet dangling over a greenish pool from which the sea was ebbing the more clearly he saw this but it was as if her arms and all of her were slipping slowly slowly down from him into the pool to be carried away out to sea and her face looking up her lost face with beseeching eyes and dark wet hairpossessed haunted tortured him he got up at last scaled the low rockcliff and made his way down into a sheltered cove perhaps in the sea he could get back his controllose this fever and stripping off his clothes he swam out he wanted to tire himself so that nothing mattered and swam recklessly fast and far then suddenly for no reason felt afraid suppose he could not reach shore againsuppose the current set him outor he got cramp like halliday he turned to swim in the red cliffs looked a long way off if he were drowned they would find his clothes the hallidays would know but megan perhaps neverthey took no newspaper at the farm and phil hallidays words came back to him again a girl at cambridge i might have glad i havent got her on my mind and in that moment of unreasoning fear he vowed he would not have her on his mind then his fear left him he swam in easily enough dried himself in the sun and put on his clothes his heart felt sore but no longer ached his body cool and refreshed  when one is as young as ashurst pity is not a violent emotion and back in the hallidays sittingroom eating a ravenous tea he felt much like a man recovered from fever everything seemed new and clear the tea the buttered toast and jam tasted absurdly good tobacco had never smelt so nice and walking up and down the empty room he stopped here and there to touch or look he took up stellas workbasket fingered the cotton reels and a gailycoloured plait of sewing silks smelt at the little bag filled with woodroffe she kept among them he sat down at the piano playing tunes with one finger thinking tonight shell play i shall watch her while shes playing it does me good to watch her he took up the book which still lay where she had placed it beside him and tried to read but megans little sad figure began to come back at once and he got up and leaned in the window listening to the thrushes in the crescent gardens gazing at the sea dreamy and blue below the trees a servant came in and cleared the tea away and he still stood inhaling the evening air trying not to think then he saw the hallidays coming through the gate of the crescent stella a little in front of phil and the children with their baskets and instinctively he drew back his heart too sore and discomfited shrank from this encounter yet wanted its friendly solacebore a grudge against this influence yet craved its cool innocence and the pleasure of watching stellas face from against the wall behind the piano he saw her come in and stand looking a little blank as though disappointed then she saw him and smiled a swift brilliant smile which warmed yet irritated ashurst  you never came after us frank  no i found i couldnt  look we picked such lovely late violets she held out a bunch ashurst put his nose to them and there stirred within him vague longings chilled instantly by a vision of megans anxious face lifted to the faces of the passersby  he said shortly how jolly and turned away he went up to his room and avoiding the children who were coming up the stairs threw himself on his bed and lay there with his arms crossed over his face now that he felt the die really cast and megan given up he hated himself and almost hated the hallidays and their atmosphere of healthy happy english homes  why should they have chanced here to drive away first loveto show him that he was going to be no better than a common seducer what right had stella with her fair shy beauty to make him know for certain that he would never marry megan and tarnishing it all bring him such bitterness of regretful longing and such pity megan would be back by now worn out by her miserable seekingpoor little thingexpecting perhaps to find him there when she reached home ashurst bit at his sleeve to stifle a groan of remorseful longing he went to dinner glum and silent and his mood threw a dinge even over the children it was a melancholy rather ill tempered evening for they were all tired several times he caught stella looking at him with a hurt puzzled expression and this pleased his evil mood he slept miserably got up quite early and wandered out he went down to the beach alone there with the serene the blue the sunlit sea his heart relaxed a little conceited foolto think that megan would take it so hard in a week or two she would almost have forgotten and he well he would have the reward of virtue a good young man if stella knew she would give him her blessing for resisting that devil she believed in and he uttered a hard laugh but slowly the peace and beauty of sea and sky the flight of the lonely seagulls made him feel ashamed he bathed and turned homewards  in the crescent gardens stella herself was sitting on a camp stool sketching he stole up close behind how fair and pretty she was bent diligently holding up her brush measuring wrinkling her brows  he said gently  sorry i was such a beast last night stella  she turned round startled flushed very pink and said in her quick way  its all right i knew there was something between friends it doesnt matter does it  ashurst answered  between friendsand we are arent we  she looked up at him nodded vehemently and her upper teeth gleamed again in that swift brilliant smile  three days later he went back to london travelling with the hallidays he had not written to the farm what was there he could say  on the last day of april in the following year he and stella were married  such were ashursts memories sitting against the wall among the gorse on his silverwedding day at this very spot where he had laid out the lunch megan must have stood outlined against the sky when he had first caught sight of her of all queer coincidences and there moved in him a longing to go down and see again the farm and the orchard and the meadow of the gipsy bogle it would not take long stella would be an hour yet perhaps  how well he remembered it allthe little crowning group of pine trees the steepup grass hill behind he paused at the farm gate the low stone house the yewtree porch the flowering currantsnot changed a bit even the old green chair was out there on the grass under the window where he had reached up to her that night to take the key then he turned down the lane and stood leaning on the orchard gategrey skeleton of a gate as then a black pig even was wandering in there among the trees was it true that twentysix years had passed or had he dreamed and awakened to find megan waiting for him by the big apple tree unconsciously he put up his hand to his grizzled beard and brought himself back to reality opening the gate he made his way down through the docks and nettles till he came to the edge and the old apple tree itself unchanged a little more of the greygreen lichen a dead branch or two and for the rest it might have been only last night that he had embraced that mossy trunk after megans flight and inhaled its woody savour while above his head the moonlit blossom had seemed to breathe and live in that early spring a few buds were showing already the blackbirds shouting their songs a cuckoo calling the sunlight bright and warm incredibly the samethe chattering troutstream the narrow pool he had lain in every morning splashing the water over his flanks and chest and out there in the wild meadow the beech clump and the stone where the gipsy bogie was supposed to sit and an ache for lost youth a hankering a sense of wasted love and sweetness gripped ashurst by the throat surely on this earth of such wild beauty one was meant to hold rapture to ones heart as this earth and sky held it and yet one could not  he went to the edge of the stream and looking down at the little pool thought youth and spring what has become of them all i wonder  and then in sudden fear of having this memory jarred by human encounter he went back to the lane and pensively retraced his steps to the crossroads  beside the car an old greybearded labourer was leaning on a stick talking to the chauffeur he broke off at once as though guilty of disrespect and touching his hat prepared to limp on down the lane  ashurst pointed to the narrow green mound can you tell me what this is  the old fellow stopped on his face had come a look as though he were thinking youve come to the right shop mister  tes a grave he said  but why out here  the old man smiled thats a tale as yu may say an not the first time as ive atold ettheres plenty folks asks bout that bit o turf maids grave us calls et ereabouts  ashurst held out his pouch have a fill  the old man touched his hat again and slowly filled an old clay pipe his eyes looking upward out of a mass of wrinkles and hair were still quite bright  if yu don mind zurr ill zet down my legs urtin a bit today and he sat down on the mound of

du for love she ad a lovineart i guess twas broken but us never knu nothin  he looked up as if for approval of his story but ashurst had walked past him as if he were not there  up on the top of the hill beyond where he had spread the lunch over out of sight he lay down on his face so had his virtue been rewarded and the cyprian goddess of love taken her revenge and before his eyes dim with tears came megans face with the sprig of apple blossom in her dark wet hair what did i do that was wrong he thought what did i do but he could not answer spring with its rush of passion its flowers and songthe spring in his heart and megans was it just love seeking a victim the greek was right thenthe words of the hippolytus as true today      for mad is the heart of love      and gold the gleam of his wing      and all to the spell thereof      bend when he makes his spring      all life that is wild and young      in mountain and wave and stream      all that of earth is sprung      or

tree waiting and looking megan dead with beauty printed on her  a voice said  oh there you are look  ashurst rose took his wifes sketch and stared at it in silence  is the foreground right frank  yes  but theres something wanting isnt there  ashurst nodded wanting the apple tree the singing and the gold  and solemnly he put his lips to her forehead it was his silverwedding day 1916     the juryman       dont you see brother i was reading yesterday the gospel      about christ the little father how he suffered how he walked      on the earth  i suppose you have heard about it       indeed i have replied stepanuitch but we are people in      darkness we cant readtolstoi  mr henry bosengate of the london stock exchange seated himself in his car that morning during the great war with a sense of injury major in a volunteer corps member of all the local committees lending this very car to the neighbouring hospital at times even driving it himself for their benefit subscribing to funds so far as his diminished income permittedhe was conscious of being an asset to the country and one whose time could not be wasted with impunity to be summoned to sit on a jury at the local assizes and not even the grand jury at that it was in the nature of an outrage  strong and upright with hazel eyes and dark eyebrows pinkishbrown cheeks a forehead white wellshaped and getting high with greyish hair glossy and wellbrushed and a trim moustache he might have been taken for that colonel of volunteers which indeed he was in a fair way of becoming  his wife had followed him out under the porch and stood bracing her supple body clothed in lilac linen red rambler roses formed a sort of crown to her dark head her ivorycoloured face had in it just a suggestion of the japanese  mr bosengate spoke through the whirr of the engine  i dont expect to be late dear this business is ridiculous there oughtnt to be any crime in these days  his wifeher name was kathleensmiled she looked very pretty and cool mr bosengate thought to him bound on this dull and stuffy business everything he owned seemed pleasantthe geranium beds beside the gravel drive his long redbrick house mellowing decorously in its creepers and ivy the little clocktower over stables now converted to a garage the dovecote masking at the other end the conservatory which adjoined the billiardroom close to the redbrick lodge his two children kate and harry ran out from under the acacia trees and waved to him scrambling barelegged on to the low red ivycovered wall which guarded his domain of eleven acres mr bosengate waved back thinking jolly coupleby jove they are above their heads through the trees he could see right away to some downs faint in the july heat haze and he thought pretty a spot as one could have got so close to town  despite the war he had enjoyed these last two years more than any of the ten since he built charmleigh and settled down to semirural domesticity with his young wife there had been a certain piquancy a savour added to existence by the countrys peril and all the public service and sacrifice it demanded his chauffeur was gone and one gardener did the work of three he enjoyedpositively enjoyed his committee work even the serious decline of business and increase of taxation had not much worried one continually conscious of the national crisis and his own part therein the country had wanted waking up wanted a lesson in effort and economy and the feeling that he had not spared himself in these strenuous times had given a zest to those quiet pleasures of bed and board which at his age even the most patriotic could retain with a good conscience he had denied himself many thingsnew clothes presents for kathleen and the children travel and that pineapple house which he had been on the point of building when the war broke out new wine too and cigars and membership of the two clubs which he had never used in the old days the hours had seemed fuller and longer sleep better earnedwonderful the things one could do without when put to it he turned the car into the high road driving dreamily for he was in plenty of time the war was going pretty well now he was no fool optimist but now that conscription was in force one might reasonably hope for its end within a year then there would be a boom and one might let oneself go a little visions of theatres and supper with his wife at the savoy afterwards and cosy night drives back into the sweetsmelling country behind your own chauffeur once more teased a fancy which even now did not soar beyond the confines of domestic pleasures he pictured his wife in new dresses by jayshe was fifteen years younger than himself and paid for dressing as they said he had always delightedas men older than their wives willin the admiration she excited from others not privileged to enjoy her charms her rather queer and ironical beauty her cool irreproachable wifeliness was a constant balm to him they would give dinner parties again have their friends down from town and he would once more enjoy sitting at the foot of the dinner table while kathleen sat at the head with the light soft on her ivory shoulders behind flowers she had arranged in that original way of hers and fruit which he had grown in his hothouses once more he would take legitimate interest in the wine he offered to his guestsonce more stock that chinese cabinet wherein he kept cigars yesthere was a certain satisfaction in these days of privation if only from the anticipation they created  the sprinkling of villas had become continuous on either side of the high road and women going out to shop tradesmens boys delivering victuals young men in khaki began to abound now and then a limping or bandaged form would passsome bit of human wreckage and mr bosengate would think mechanically another of those poor devils wonder if weve had his case before us  running his car into the best hotel garage of the little town he made his way leisurely over to the court it stood back from the marketplace and was already lapped by a sea of persons having as in the outer ring at race meetings an air of business at which one must not be caught out together with a soaked or flushed appearance mr bosengate could not resist putting his handkerchief to his nose he had carefully drenched it with lavender water and to this fact owed perhaps his immunity from the post of foreman on the juryfor say what you will about the english they have a deep instinct for affairs  he found himself second in the front row of the jury box and through the odour of sanitas gazed at the judges face expressionless up there for all the world like a bewigged bust his fellows in the box had that appearance of falling between two classes characteristic of jurymen mr bosengate was not impressed on one side of him the foreman sat a prominent upholsterer known in the town as gentleman fox his dark and beautifully brushed and oiled hair and moustache his radiant linen gold watch and chain the white piping to his waistcoat and a habit of never saying sir had long marked him out from commoner men he undertook to bury people too to save them trouble and was altogether superior on the other side mr bosengate had one of those men who except when they sit on juries are never seen without a little brown bag and the appearance of having been interrupted in a drink pale and shiny with large loose eyes shifting from side to side he had an underdone voice and uneasy flabby hands mr bosengate disliked sitting next to him beyond this commercial traveller sat a dark pale young man with spectacles beyond him again a short old man with grey moustache mutton chops and innumerable wrinkles and the front row was completed by a chemist the three immediately behind mr bosengate did not thoroughly master but the three at the end of the second row he learned in their order of an oldish man in a grey suit given to winking an inanimate person with the mouth of a moustachioed codfish over whose long bald crown three wisps of damp hair were carefully arranged and a dried dapperish cleanshorn man whose mouth seemed terrified lest it should be surprised without a smile their first and second verdicts were recorded without the necessity for withdrawal and mr bosengate was already sleepy when the third case was called the sight of khaki revived his drooping attention but what a weedylooking specimen this prisoner had a truly nerveless pitiable dejected air if he had ever had a military bearing it had shrunk into him during his confinement his illshaped brown tunic whose little brass buttons seemed trying to keep smiling struck mr bosengate as ridiculously short used though he was to such things absurd he thoughtlumbago just where they ought to be covered then the officer and gentleman stirred in him and he added to himself still there must be some distinction made the little soldiers visage had once perhaps been tanned but was now the colour of dark dough his large brown eyes with white showing below the iris as so often in the eyes of very nervous peoplewandered from face to face of judge counsel jury and public there were hollows in his cheeks his dark hair looked damp around his neck he wore a bandage the commercial traveller on mr bosengates left turned and whispered felo de se my hat what a guy mr bosengate pretended not to hearhe could not bear that fellowand slowly wrote on a bit of paper owen lewis welsh well he looked itnot at all an english face attempted suicidenot at all an english crime suicide implied surrender a puttingup of hands to fateto say nothing of the religious aspect of the matter and suicide in khaki seemed to mr bosengate particularly abhorrent like turning tail in face of the enemy almost meriting the fate of a deserter he looked at the prisoner trying not to give way to this prejudice and the prisoner seemed to look at him though this perhaps was fancy  the counsel for the prosecution a little alert grey decided man above military age began detailing the circumstances of the crime mr bosengate though not particularly sensitive to atmosphere could perceive a sort of current running through the court it was as if jury and public were thinking rhythmically in obedience to the same unexpressed prejudice of which he himself was conscious even the caesarlike pale face up there presiding seemed in its ironic serenity responding to that current  gentlemen of the jury before i call my evidence i direct your attention to the bandage the accused is still wearing he gave himself this wound with his army razor adding if i may say so insult to the injury he was inflicting on his country he pleads not guilty and before the magistrates he said that absence from his wife was preying on his mindthe advocates close lips widenedwell gentlemen if such an excuse is to weigh with us in these days im sure i dont know whats to happen to the empire  no by george thought mr bosengate  the evidence of the first witness a roommate who had caught the prisoners hand and of the sergeant who had at once been summoned was conclusive and he began to cherish a hope that they would get through without withdrawing and he would be home before five but then a hitch occurred the regimental doctor failed to respond when his name was called and the judge having for the first time that day showed himself capable of human emotion intimated that he would adjourn until the morrow  mr bosengate received the announcement with equanimity he would be home even earlier and gathering up the sheets of paper he had scribbled on he put them in his pocket and got up the wouldbe suicide was being taken out of the courta shambling drab figure with shoulders hunched what good were men like that in these days what good the prisoner looked up mr bosengate encountered in full the gaze of those large brown eyes with the white showing underneath what a suffering wretched pitiful face a man had no business to give you a look like that the prisoner passed on down the stairs and vanished mr bosengate went out and across the market place to the garage of the hotel where he had left his car the sun shone fiercely and he thought i must do some watering in the garden he brought the car out and was about to start the engine when someone passing said good evenin seedylookin beggar that last prisoner aint he we dont want men of that stamp it was his neighbour on the jury the commercial traveller in a straw hat with a little brown bag already in his hand and the froth of an interrupted drink on his moustache answering curtly good evening and thinking nor of yours my friend mr bosengate started the car with unnecessary clamour but as if brought back to life by the commercial travellers remark the prisoners figure seemed to speed along too turning up at mr bosengate his pitifully unhappy eyes want of his wifequeer excuse that for trying to put it out of his power ever to see her again why half a loaf even a slice was better than no bread not many of that neurotic type in the armythank heaven the lugubrious figure vanished and mr bosengate pictured instead the form of his own wife bending over her gloire de dijon roses in the rosery where she generally worked a little before tea now that they were short of gardeners he saw her as often he had seen her raise herself and stand head to one side a gloved hand on her slender hip gazing as it were ironically from under drooped lids at buds which did not come out fast enough and the word caline for he was something of a french scholar shot through his mind kathleencaline if he found her there when he got in he would steal up on the grass andah but with great care not to crease her dress or disturb her hair if only she werent quite so selfcontained he thought its like a cat you cant get near not really near  the car returning faster than it had come down that morning had already passed the outskirt villas and was breasting the hill to where among fields and the old trees charmleigh lay apart from commoner life turning into his drive mr bosengate thought with a certain surprise i wonder what she does think of i wonder he put his gloves and hat down in the outer hall and went into the lavatory to dip his face in cool water and wash it with sweetsmelling soapdelicious revenge on the unclean atmosphere in which he had been stewing so many hours he came out again into the hall dazed by soap and the mellowed light and a voice from halfway up the stairs said daddy look his little daughter was standing up there with one hand on the banisters she scrambled on to them and came sliding down her frock up to her eyes and her holland knickers to her middle mr bosengate said mildly  well thats elegant  teas in the summerhouse mummys waiting come on  with her hand in his mr bosengate went on through the drawingroom long and cool with sunblinds down through the billiardroom high and cool through the conservatory green and sweetsmelling out on to the terrace and the upper lawn he had never felt such sheer exhilarated joy in his home surroundings so cool glistening and green under the july sun and he said  well kit what have you all been doing  ive fed my rabbits and harrys and weve been in the attic harry got his leg through the skylight  mr bosengate drew in his breath with a hiss  its all right daddy we got it out again its only grazed the skin and weve been making swabsi made seventeen mummy made thirtythree and then she went to the hospital did you put many men in prison  mr bosengate cleared his throat the question seemed to him untimely  only two  whats it like in prison daddy  mr bosengate who had no more knowledge than his little daughter replied in an absent voice  not very nice  they were passing under a young oak tree where the path wound round to the rosery and summerhouse something shot down and clawed mr bosengates neck his little daughter began to hop and suffocate with laughter  oh daddy arent you caught i led you on purpose  looking up mr bosengate saw his small son lying along a low branch above himlike the leopard he was declaring himself to be for fear of error and thought blithely what an active little chap it is let me drop on your shoulders daddylike they do on the deer  oh yes do be a deer daddy  mr bosengate did not see being a deer his hair had just been brushed but he entered the rosery buoyantly between his offspring his wife was standing precisely as he had imagined her in a pale blue frock open at the neck with a narrow black band round the waist and little accordion pleats below she looked her coolest her smile when she turned her head hardly seemed to take mr bosengate seriously enough he placed his lips below one of her halfdrooped eyelids she even smelled of roses his children began to dance round their mother and mr bosengatefirmly held between them was also compelled to do this until she said  when youve quite done lets have tea  it was not the greeting he had imagined coming along in the car earwigs were plentiful in the summerhouseused perhaps twice a year but indispensable to every country residenceand mr bosengate was not sorry for the excuse to get out again though all was so pleasant he felt oddly restless rather suffocated and lighting his pipe began to move about among the roses blowing tobacco at the greenfly in wartime one was never quite idle and suddenly he said  were trying a wretched tommy at the assizes  his wife looked up from a rose  what for  attempted suicide  why did he  cant stand the separation from his wife  she looked at him gave a low laugh and said  oh dear  mr bosengate was puzzled why did she laugh he looked round saw that the children were gone took his pipe from his mouth and approached her  you look very pretty he said give me a kiss  his wife bent her body forward from the waist and pushed her lips out till they touched his moustache mr bosengate felt a sensation as if he had arisen from breakfast without having eaten marmalade he mastered it and said  that jury are a rum lot  his wifes eyelids flickered i wish women sat on juries  why  it would be an experience  not the first time she had used that curious expression yet her life was far from dull so far as he could see with the new interests created by the war and the constant calls on her time made by the perfection of their home life she had a useful and busy existence again the random thought passed through him but she never tells me anything and suddenly that lugubrious khakiclad figure started up among the rose bushes weve got a lot to be thankful for he said abruptly i must go to work his wife raising one eyebrow smiled and i to weep mr bosengate laughedshe had a pretty wit and stroking his comely moustache where it had been kissed he moved out into the sunshine all the evening throughout his labours not inconsiderable for this jury business had put him behind time he was afflicted by that restless pleasure in his surroundings would break off in mowing the lower lawn to look at the house through the trees would leave his study and committee papers to cross into the drawingroom and sniff its dainty fragrance paid a special goodnight visit to the children having supper in the schoolroom pottered in and out from his dressing room to admire his wife while she was changing for dinner dined with his mind perpetually on the next course talked volubly of the war and in the billiard room afterwards smoking the pipe which had taken the place of his cigar could not keep still but roamed about now in conservatory now in the drawingroom where his wife and the governess were still making swabs it seemed to him that he could not have enough of anything about eleven oclock he strolled out beautiful night only just dark enoughunder the new arrangement with timeand went down to the little round fountain below the terrace his wife was playing the piano mr bosengate looked at the water and the flat dark water lily leaves which floated there looked up at the house where only narrow chinks of light showed because of the lighting order the dreamy music drifted out there was a scent of heliotrope he moved a few steps back and sat in the childrens swing under an old lime tree jollyblissfulin the warm bloomy dark of all hours of the day this before going to bed was perhaps the pleasantest he saw the light go up in his wifes bed room unscreened for a full minute and thought aha if i did my duty as a special i should strafe her for that she came to the window her figure lighted hands up to the back of her head so that her bare arms gleamed mr bosengate wafted her a kiss knowing he could not be seen lucky chap he mused shes a great joy up went her arm down came the blind the house was dark again he drew a long breath another ten minutes he thought then ill go in and shut up by jove the limes are beginning to smell already and the better to take in that acme of his wellbeing he tilted the swing lifted his feet from the ground and swung himself toward the scented blossoms he wanted to whelm his senses in their perfume and closed his eyes but instead of the domestic vision he expected the face of the little welsh soldier hareeyed shadowy pinched and dark and pitiful started up with such disturbing vividness that he opened his eyes again at once curse the fellow almost haunted one where would he be now poor little devillying in his cell thinkingthinking of his wife feeling suddenly morbid mr bosengate arrested the swing and stood up absurdall his wellbeing and mood of warm anticipation had deserted him a dd world he thought such a lot of misery why should i have to sit in judgment on that poor beggar and condemn him he moved up on to the terrace and walked briskly to rid himself of this disturbance before going in that commercial traveller chap he thought the rest of those fellowsthey see nothing and abruptly turning up the three stone steps he entered the conservatory locked it passed into the billiard room and drank his barley water one of the pictures was hanging crooked he went up to put it straight still life grapes and apples andlobsters they struck him as odd for the first time why lobsters the whole picture seemed dead and oily he turned off the light and went upstairs passed his wifes door into his own room and undressed clothed in his pyjamas he opened the door between the rooms by the light coming from his own he could see her dark head on the pillow was she asleep nonot asleep certainly the moment of fruition had come the crowning of his pride and pleasure in his home but he continued to stand there he had suddenly no pride no pleasure no desire nothing but a sort of dull resentment against everything he turned back shut the door and slipping between the heavy curtains and his open window stood looking out at the night full of misery he thought full of dd misery     ii  filing into the jury box next morning mr bosengate collided slightly with a short juryman whose square figure and square head of stiff yellowred hair he had only vaguely noticed the day before the man looked angry and mr bosengate thought an illbred dog that  he sat down quickly and to avoid further recognition of his fellows gazed in front of him his appearance on saturdays was always military by reason of the route march of his volunteer corps in the afternoon gentleman fox who belonged to the corps too was also looking square but that commercial traveller on his other side seemed more louche and as if surprised in immorality than ever only the proximity of gentleman fox on the other side kept mr bosengate from shrinking then he saw the prisoner being brought in shadowy and dark behind the brightness of his buttons and he experienced a sort of shock this figure was so exactly that which had several times started up in his mind somehow he had expected a fresh sight of the fellow to dispel and disprove what had been haunting him had expected to find him just an outside phenomenon not as it were a part of his own life and he gazed at the carven immobility of the judges face trying to steady himself as a drunken man will by looking at a light the regimental doctor unabashed by the judges comment on his absence the day before gave his evidence like a man who had better things to do and the case for the prosecution was forthwith rounded in by a little speech from counsel the matterhe saidwas clear as daylight those who wore his majestys uniform charged with the responsibility and privilege of defending their country were no more entitled to desert their regiments by taking their own lives than they were entitled to desert in any other way he asked for a conviction mr bosengate felt a sympathetic shuffle passing through all feet the judge was speaking  prisoner you can either go into the witness box and make your statement on oath in which case you may be crossexamined on it or you can make your statement there from the dock in which case you will not be crossexamined which do you elect to do  from here my lord  seeing him now full face and as it might be come to life in the effort to convey his feelings mr bosengate had suddenly a quite different impression of the fellow it was as if his khaki had fallen off and he had stepped out of his own shadow a live and quivering creature his pinched cleanshaven face seemed to have an irregular wilder hairier look his large nervous brown eyes darkened and glowed he jerked his shoulders his arms his whole body like a man suddenly freed from cramp or a suit of armour  he spoke too in a quick crisp rather high voice pinching his consonants a little sharpening his vowels like a true welshman  my lord and misters the jury he said i was a hairdresser when the call came on me to join the army i had a little home and a wife i never thought what it would be like to be away from them i surely never did and im ashamed to be speaking it out like thishow it can squeeze and squeeze a man how it can prey on your mind when youre nervous like i am tis not everyone that cares for his hometheres lots o them never wants to see their wives again but for me tis like being shut up in a cage it is mr bosengate saw daylight between the skinny fingers of the mans hand thrown out with a jerk i cannot bear it shut up away from wife and home like what you are in the army so when i took my razor that morning i was wildan i wouldnt be here now but for that man catching my hand there was no reason in it im willing to confess it was foolish but wait till you get feeling like what i was and see how it draws you misters the jury dont send me back to prison it is worse still there if you have wives you will know what it is like for lots of us only some is more nervous than others i swear to you sirs i could not help it again the little man flung out his hand his whole thin body shook and mr bosengate felt the same sensation as when he drove his car over a dogmisters the jury i hope you may never in your lives feel as ive been feeling  the little man ceased his eyes shrank back into their sockets his figure back into its mask of shadowy brown and gleaming buttons and mr bosengate was conscious that the judge was making a series of remarks and very soon of being seated at a mahogany table in the jurys withdrawing room hearing the voice of the man with hair like an irish terriers saying didnt he talk through his hat that little blighter conscious too of the commercial traveller still on his leftalways on his leftmopping his brow and muttering phew its hot in there today while an effluvium as of an inside accustomed to whisky came from him then the man with the underlip and the three plastered wisps of hair said  dont know why we withdrew mr foreman  mr bosengate looked round to where at the head of the table gentleman fox sat in defensive gentility and the little white piping to his waistcoat saying blandly  i shall be happy to take the sense of the jury  there was a short silence then the chemist murmured  i should say he must have what they call claustrophobia  clauster fiddlesticks the fellers a shirker thats all missed his wifepretty excuse indecent i call it  the speaker was the little wirehaired man and emotion deep and angry stirred in mr bosengate that illbred little cur he gripped the edge of the table with both hands  i think its dd natural he muttered but almost before the words had left his lips he felt dismay what had he saidhe nearly a colonel of volunteersendorsing such a want of patriotism and hearing the commercial traveller murmuring ear ear he reddened violently  the wireheaded man said roughly  theres too many of these blighted shirkers and too much pampering of them  the turmoil in mr bosengate increased he remarked in an icy voice  i agree to no verdict thatll send the man back to prison  at this a real tremor seemed to go round the table as if they all saw themselves sitting there through lunch time then the large greyhaired man given to winking said  oh come sirafter what the judge said come sir what do you say mr foreman  gentleman foxas who should say this is excellent value but i dont wish to press it on youanswered  we are only concerned with the facts did he or did he not try to shorten his life  of course he didsaid so himself mr bosengate heard the wirehaired man snap out and from the following murmur of assent he alone abstained guilty wellyes there was no way out of admitting that but his feelings revolted against handing that poor little beggar over to the tender mercy of his countrys law his whole soul rose in arms against agreeing with that illbred little cur and the rest of this joblot he had an impulse to get up and walk out saying settle it your own way good morning  it seems sir gentleman fox was saying that were all agreed to guilty except yourself if you will allow me i dont see how you can go behind what the prisoner himself admitted  thus brought up to the very guns mr bosengate red in the face thrust his hands deep into the side pockets of his tunic and staring straight before him said  very well on condition we recommend him to mercy  what do you say gentlemen shall we recommend him to mercy  ear ear burst from the commercial traveller and from the chemist came the murmur  no harm in that  well i think there is they shoot deserters at the front and we let this fellow off id hang the cur  mr bosengate stared at that little wirehaired brute havent you any feeling for others he wanted to say cant you see that this poor devil suffers tortures but the sheer impossibility of doing this before ten other men brought a slight sweat out on his face and hands and in agitation he smote the table a blow with his fist the effect was instantaneous everybody looked at the wirehaired man as if saying yes youve gone a bit too far there the little brute stood it for a moment then muttered surlily  well commend im to mercy if you like i dont care  thats right they never pay any attention to it said the greyhaired man winking heartily and mr bosengate filed back with the others into court  but when from the jury box his eyes fell once more on the hareeyed figure in the dock he had his worst moment yet why should this poor wretch suffer sofor no fault no fault while he and these others and that snapping counsel and the caesarlike judge up there went off to their women and their homes blithe as bees and probably never thought of him again and suddenly he was conscious of the judges voice  you will go back to your regiment and endeavour to serve your country with better spirit you may thank the jury that you are not sent to prison and your good fortune that you were not at the front when you tried to commit this cowardly act you are lucky to be alive  a policeman pulled the little soldier by the arm his drab figure with eyes fixed and lustreless passed down and away from his very soul mr bosengate wanted to lean out and say cheer up cheer up i understand  it was nearly ten oclock that evening before he reached home motoring back from the route march his physical tiredness was abated for he had partaken of a snack and a whisky and soda at the hotel but mentally he was in a curious mood his body felt appeased his spirit hungry tonight he had a yearning not for his wifes kisses but for her understanding he wanted to go to her and say ive learnt a lot todayfound out things i never thought of lifes a wonderful thing kate a thing one cant live all to oneself a thing one shares with everybody so that when another suffers one suffers too its come to me that what one has doesnt matter a bitits what one does and how one sympathises with other people it came to me in the most extraordinary vivid way when i was on that jury watching that poor little rat of a soldier in his trap its the first time ive ever feltthethe spirit of christ you know its a wonderful thing katewonderful we havent been closereally close you and i so that we each understand what the other is feeling its all in that you know understandingsympathyits priceless when i saw that poor little devil taken down and sent back to his regiment to begin his sorrows all over againwanting his wife thinking and thinking of her just as you know i would be thinking and wanting you i felt what an awful outside sort of life we lead never telling each other what we really think and feel never being really close i daresay that little chap and his wife keep nothing from each otherlive each others lives thats what we ought to do lets get to feeling that what really matters isunderstanding and loving and not only just saying it as we all do those fellows on the jury and even that poor devil of a judgewhat an awful life judging ones fellowcreatures  when i left that poor little tommy this morning and ever since ive longed to get back here quietly to you and tell you about it and make a beginning theres something wonderful in this and i want you to feel it as i do because you mean such a lot to me  this was what he wanted to say to his wife not touching or kissing her just looking into her eyes watching them soften and glow as they surely must catching the infection of his new ardour and he felt unsteady fearfully unsteady with the desire to say it all as it should be said swiftly quietly with the truth and fervour of his feeling  the hall was not lit up for daylight still lingered under the new arrangement he went towards the drawingroom but from the very door shied off to his study and stood irresolute under the picture of a man catching a flea dutch school which had come down to him from his father the governess would be in there with his wife he must wait essential to go straight to kathleen and pour it all out or he would never do it he felt as nervous as an undergraduate going up for his viva voce this thing was so big so astoundingly and unexpectedly important he was suddenly afraid of his wife afraid of her coolness and her grace and that something japanese about herof all those attributes he had been accustomed to admire most afraid as it were of her attraction he felt young tonight almost boyish would she see that he was not really fifteen years older than herself and she not really a part of his collection of all the admirable appointments of his home but a companion spirit to one who wanted a companion badly in this agitation of his soul he could keep still no more than he could last night in the agitation of his senses and he wandered into the diningroom a dainty supper was set out there sandwiches and cake whisky and the cigaretteseven an early peach mr bosengate looked at this peach with sorrow rather than disgust the perfection of it was of a piece with all that had gone before this new and sudden feeling its delicious bloom seemed to heighten his perception of the hedge around him that hedge of the things he so enjoyed carefully planted and tended these many years he passed it by uneaten and went to the window out there all was darkening the fountain the lime tree the flowerbeds and the fields below with the jersey cows who would come to your call darkening slowly losing form blurring into soft blackness vanishing but there none the lessall therethe hedge of his possessions he heard the door of the drawingroom open the voices of his wife and the governess in the hall going up to bed if only they didnt look in here if only the voices ceased he was safe nowhad but to follow in a few minutes to make sure of kathleen alone he turned round and stared down the length of the dark diningroom over the rosewood table to where in the mirror above the sideboard at the far end his figure bathed a stain a mere blurred shadow he made his way down to it along the table edge and stood before himself as close as he could get his throat and the roof of his mouth felt dry with nervousness he put out his finger and touched his face in the glass youre an ass he thought pull yourself together and get it over she will see of course she will he swallowed smoothed his moustache and walked out going up the stairs his heart beat painfully but he was in for it now and marched straight into her room dressed only in a loose blue wrapper she was brushing her dark hair before the glass mr bosengate went up to her and stood there silent looking down the words he had thought of were like a swarm of bees buzzing in his head yet not one would fly from between his lips his wife went on brushing her hair under the light which shone on her polished elbows she looked up at him from beneath one lifted eyebrow  well deartired  with a sort of vehemence the single word no passed out a faint a quizzical smile flitted over her face she shrugged her shoulders ever so gently that gesturehe had seen it before and in desperate desire to make her understand he put his hand on her lifted arm  kathleen stoplisten to me his fingers tightened in his agitation and eagerness to make his great discovery known but before he could get out a word he became conscious of that cool round arm conscious of her eyes halfclosed sliding round at him of her halfsmiling lips of her neck under the wrapper and he stammered  i wanti mustkathleen i  she lifted her shoulders again in that little shrug yesi know all right  a wave of heat and shame and of god knows what came over mr bosengate he fell on his knees and pressed his forehead to her arm and he was silent more silent than the grave nothingnothing came from him but two long sighs suddenly he felt her hand stroke his cheekcompassionately it seemed to him she made a little movement towards him her lips met his and he remembered nothing but that  in his own room mr bosengate sat at his wide open window smoking a cigarette there was no light moths went past the moon was creeping up he sat very calm puffing the smoke out in to the night air curious thinglife curious world curious forces in itmaking one do the opposite of what one wished alwaysalways making one do the opposite it seemed the furtive light from that creeping moon was getting hold of things down there stealing in among the boughs of the trees theres something ironical he thought which walks about things dont come off as you think they will i meant i tried but one doesnt change like that all of a sudden it seems fact is lifes too big a thing for one all the same im not the man i was yesterdaynot quite he closed his eyes and in one of those flashes of vision which come when the senses are at rest he saw himself as it were far down belowdown on the floor of a street narrow as a grave high as a mountain a deep dark slit of a street walking down there a black midget of a fellow among other black midgetshis wife and the little soldier the judge and those jury chapsfantoches straight up on their tiny feet wandering down there in that dark infinitely tall and narrow street too much for one he thought too high for oneno getting on top of it weve got to be kind and help one another and not expect too much and not think too much thatsall and squeezing out his cigarette he took six deep breaths of the night air and got into bed     indian summer of a forsyte        and summers lease hath all                 too short a date                 shakespeare     i  in the last day of may in the early nineties about six oclock of the evening old jolyon forsyte sat under the oak tree below the terrace of his house at robin hill he was waiting for the midges to bite him before abandoning the glory of the afternoon his thin brown hand where blue veins stood out held the end of a cigar in its tapering longnailed fingersa pointed polished nail had survived with him from those earlier victorian days when to touch nothing even with the tips of the fingers had been so distinguished his domed forehead great white moustache lean cheeks and long lean jaw were covered from the westering sunshine by an old brown panama hat his legs were crossed in all his attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance as of an old man who every morning put eau de cologne upon his silk handkerchief at his feet lay a woolly brownandwhite dog trying to be a pomeranianthe dog balthasar between whom and old jolyon primal aversion had changed into attachment with the years close to his chair was a swing and on the swing was seated one of hollys dollscalled duffer alicewith her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black petticoat she was never out of disgrace so it did not matter to her how she sat below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank stretched to the fernery and beyond that refinement became fields dropping to the pond the coppice and the prospectfine remarkableat which swithin forsyte from under this very tree had stared five years ago when he drove down with irene to look at the house old jolyon had heard of his brothers exploitthat drive which had become quite celebrated on forsyte change swithin and the fellow had gone and died last november at the age of only seventynine renewing the doubt whether forsytes could live for ever which had first arisen when aunt ann passed away died and left only jolyon and james roger and nicholas and timothy julia hester susan and old jolyon thought eightyfive i dont feel itexcept when i get that pain  his memory went searching he had not felt his age since he had bought his nephew soames illstarred house and settled into it here at robin hill over three years ago it was as if he had been getting younger every spring living in the country with his son and his grandchildrenjune and the little ones of the second marriage jolly and holly living down here out of the racket of london and the cackle of forsyte change free of his boards in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its twenty acres and in ministering to the whims of holly and jolly all the knots and crankiness which had gathered in his heart during that long and tragic business of june soames irene his wife and poor young bosinney had been smoothed out even june had thrown off her melancholy at lastwitness this travel in spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother curiously perfect peace was left by their departure blissful yet blank because his son was not there jo was never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadaysan amiable chap but women somehoweven the bestgot a little on ones nerves unless of course one admired them  faroff a cuckoo called a woodpigeon was cooing from the first elmtree in the field and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the last mowing the wind had got into the sou west tooa delicious air sappy he pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and cheek somehow today he wanted companywanted a pretty face to look at people treated the old as if they wanted nothing and with the unforsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul he thought ones never had enough with a foot in the grave onell want something i shouldnt be surprised down hereaway from the exigencies of affairshis grandchildren and the flowers trees birds of his little domain to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them said open sesame to him day and night and sesame had openedhow much perhaps he did not know he had always been responsive to what they had begun to call nature genuinely almost religiously responsive though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view however deeply they might move him but nowadays nature actually made him ache he appreciated it so every one of these calm bright lengthening days with hollys hand in his and the dog balthasar in front looking studiously for what he never found he would stroll watching the roses open fruit budding on the walls sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice watching the waterlily leaves unfold and glisten and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field listening to the starlings and skylarks and the alderney cows chewing the cud flicking slow their tufted tails and every one of these fine days he ached a little from sheer love of it all feeling perhaps deep down that he had not very much longer to enjoy it the thought that some dayperhaps not ten years hence perhaps not fiveall this world would be taken away from him before he had exhausted his powers of loving it seemed to him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon if anything came after this life it wouldnt be what he wanted not robin hill and flowers and birds and pretty facestoo few even now of those about him with the years his dislike of humbug had increased the orthodoxy he had worn in the sixties as he had worn sidewhiskers out of sheer exuberance had long dropped off leaving him reverent before three things alonebeauty upright conduct and the sense of property and the greatest of these now was beauty he had always had wide interests and indeed could still read the times but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a blackbird sing upright conduct propertysomehow they were tiring the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him only gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them staring into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and white flowers on the lawn a thought came to him this weather was like the music of orfeo which he had recently heard at covent garden a beautiful opera not like meyerbeer nor even quite mozart but in its way perhaps even more lovely something classical and of the golden age about it chaste and mellow and the ravogli almost worthy of the old dayshighest praise he could bestow the yearning of orpheus for the beauty he was losing for his love going down to hades as in life love and beauty did gothe yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden music stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that evening and with the tip of his corksoled elasticsided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog balthasar causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas for though he was supposed to have none nothing could persuade him of the fact when he had finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his masters calf and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot and into old jolyons mind came a sudden recollectiona face he had seen at that opera three weeks agoirene the wife of his precious nephew soames that man of property though he had not met her since the day of the at home in his old house at stanhope gate which celebrated his granddaughter junes illstarred engagement to young bosinney he had remembered her at once for he had always admired hera very pretty creature after the death of young bosinney whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become he had heard that she had left soames at once goodness only knew what she had been doing since that sight of her facea side viewin the row in front had been literally the only reminder these three years that she was still alive no one ever spoke of her and yet jo had told him something oncesomething which had upset him completely the boy had got it from george forsyte he believed who had seen bosinney in the fog the day he was run oversomething which explained the young fellows distressan act of soames towards his wifea shocking act jo had seen her too that afternoon after the news was out seen her for a moment and his description had always lingered in old jolyons mindwild and lost he had called her and next day june had gone therebottled up her feelings and gone there and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the night and vanished a tragic business altogether one thing was certainsoames had never been able to lay hands on her again and he was living at brighton and journeying up and downa fitting fate the man of property for when he once took a dislike to anyoneas he had to his nephewold jolyon never got over it he remembered still the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of irenes disappearance it had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have wandered back when jo saw her wandered back for a momentlike a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that news tragic death of an architect in the street her face had struck him very much the other nightmore beautiful than he had remembered but like a mask with something going on beneath it a young woman stilltwentyeight perhaps ah well very likely she had another lover by now but at this subversive thoughtfor married women should never love once even had been too muchhis instep rose and with it the dog balthasars head the sagacious animal stood up and looked into old jolyons face walk he seemed to say and old jolyon answered come on old chap  slowly as was their wont they crossed among the constellations of buttercups and daisies and entered the fernery this feature where very little grew as yet had been judiciously dropped below the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity so important in horticulture its rocks and earth were beloved of the dog balthasar who sometimes found a mole there old jolyon made a point of passing through it because though it was not beautiful he intended that it should be some day and he would think i must get varr to come down and look at it hes better than beech for plants like houses and human complaints required the best expert consideration it was inhabited by snails and if accompanied by his grandchildren he would point to one and tell them the story of the little boy who said have plummers got leggers mother no sonny then darned if i havent been and swallowed a snileybob and when they skipped and clutched his hand thinking of the snileybob going down the little boys red lane his eyes would twinkle emerging from the fernery he opened the wicket gate which just there led into the first field a large and parklike area out of which within brick walls the vegetable garden had been carved old jolyon avoided this which did not suit his mood and made down the hill towards the pond balthasar who knew a waterrat or two gambolled in front at the gait which marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day arrived at the edge old jolyon stood noting another waterlily opened since yesterday he would show it to holly tomorrow when his little sweet had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunchher little arrangements were very delicate now that jolly had gone to schoolhis first termholly was with him nearly all day long and he missed her badly he felt that pain too which often bothered him now a little dragging at his left side he looked back up the hill really poor young bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house he would have done very well for himself if he had lived and where was he now perhaps still haunting this the site of his last work of his tragic love affair or was philip bosinneys spirit diffused in the general who could say that dog was getting his legs muddy and he moved towards the coppice there had been the most delightful lot of bluebells and he knew where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees away out of the sun he passed the cowhouses and the henhouses there installed and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings making for one of the bluebell plots balthasar preceding him once more uttered a low growl old jolyon stirred him with his foot but the dog remained motionless just where there was no room to pass and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back whether from the growl and the look of the dogs stivered hair or from the sensation which a man feels in a wood old jolyon also felt something move along his spine and then the path turned and there was an old mossy log and on it a woman sitting her face was turned away and he had just time to think shes trespassingi must have a board put up before she turned powers above the face he had seen at the operathe very woman he had just been thinking of in that confused moment he saw things blurred as if a spiritqueer effectthe slant of sunlight perhaps on her violetgrey frock and then she rose and stood smiling her head a little to one side old jolyon thought how pretty she is she did not speak neither did he and he realized why with a certain admiration she was here no doubt because of some memory and did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation  dont let that dog touch your frock he said hes got wet feet come here you  but the dog balthasar went on towards the visitor who put her hand down and stroked his head old jolyon said quickly  i saw you at the opera the other night you didnt notice me  oh yes i did  he felt a subtle flattery in that as though she had added do you think one could miss seeing you  theyre all in spain he remarked abruptly im alone i drove up for the opera the ravoglis good have you seen the cowhouses  in a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property and she moved beside him her figure swayed faintly like the best kind of french figures her dress too was a sort of french grey he noticed two or three silver threads in her ambercoloured hair strange hair with those dark eyes of hers and that creamypale face a sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him it seemed to come from deep and far from another world almost or at all events from some one not living very much in this and he said mechanically  where are you living now  i have a little flat in chelsea  he did not want to hear what she was doing did not want to hear anything but the perverse word came out  alone  she nodded it was a relief to know that and it came into his mind that but for a twist of fate she would have been mistress of this coppice showing these cowhouses to him a visitor  all alderneys he muttered they give the best milk this ones a pretty creature woa myrtle  the fawncoloured cow with eyes as soft and brown as irenes own was standing absolutely still not having long been milked she looked round at them out of the corner of those lustrous mild cynical eyes and from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the straw the scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of the cool cowhouse and old jolyon said  you must come up and have some dinner with me ill send you home in the carriage  he perceived a struggle going on within her natural no doubt with her memories but he wanted her company a pretty face a charming figure beauty he had been alone all the afternoon perhaps his eyes were wistful for she answered thank you uncle jolyon i should like to  he rubbed his hands and said  capital lets go up then and preceded by the dog balthasar they ascended through the field the sun was almost level in their faces now and he could see not only those silver threads but little lines just deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coinlike finenessthe special look of life unshared with others ill take her in by the terrace he thought i wont make a common visitor of her  what do you do all day he said  teach music i have another interest too  work said old jolyon picking up the doll from off the swing and smoothing its black petticoat nothing like it is there i dont do any now im getting on what interest is that  trying to help women whove come to grief old jolyon did not quite understand to grief he repeated then realised with a shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that expression assisting the magdalenes of london what a weird and terrifying interest and curiosity overcoming his natural shrinking he asked  why what do you do for them  not much ive no money to spare i can only give sympathy and food sometimes  involuntarily old jolyons hand sought his purse he said hastily how dyou get hold of them  i go to a hospital  a hospital phew  what hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of beauty  old jolyon straightened the doll beauty he ejaculated ha yes a sad business and he moved towards the house through a french window under sunblinds not yet drawn up he preceded her into the room where he was wont to study the times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels and the like which provided holly with material for her paint brush  dinners in half an hour youd like to wash your hands ill take you to junes room  he saw her looking round eagerly what changes since she had last visited this house with her husband or her lover or both perhapshe did not know could not say all that was dark and he wished to leave it so but what changes and in the hall he said  my boy jos a painter you know hes got a lot of taste it isnt mine of course but ive let him have his way  she was standing very still her eyes roaming through the hall and music room as it now wasall thrown into one under the great skylight old jolyon had an odd impression of her was she trying to conjure somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all pearlgrey and silver he would have had gold himself more lively and solid but jo had french tastes and it had come out shadowy like that with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour it was not his dream mentally he had hung this space with those goldframed masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity was precious and now where were they sold for a song that something which made him alone among forsytes move with the times had warned him against the struggle to retain them but in his study he still had dutch fishing boats at sunset  he began to mount the stairs with her slowly for he felt his side  these are the bathrooms he said and other arrangements ive had them tiled the nurseries are along there and this is jos and his wifes they all communicate but you remember i expect  irene nodded they passed on up the gallery and entered a large room with a small bed and several windows  this is mine he said the walls were covered with the photographs of children and watercolour sketches and he added doubtfully  these are jos the views firstrate you can see the grand stand at epsom in clear weather  the sun was down now behind the house and over the prospect a luminous haze had settled emanation of the long and prosperous day few houses showed but fields and trees faintly glistened away to a loom of downs  the countrys changing he said abruptly but there itll be when were all gone look at those thrushesthe birds are sweet here in the mornings im glad to have washed my hands of london  her face was close to the window pane and he was struck by its mournful look wish i could make her look happy he thought a pretty face but sad and taking up his can of hot water he went out into the gallery  this is junes room he said opening the next door and putting the can down i think youll find everything and closing the door behind her he went back to his own room brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes and dabbing his forehead with eau de cologne he mused she had come so strangelya sort of visitation mysterious even romantic as if his desire for company for beauty had been fulfilled by whatever it was which fulfilled that sort of thing and before the mirror he straightened his still upright figure passed the brushes over his great white moustache touched up his eyebrows with eau de cologne and rang the bell  i forgot to let them know that i have a lady to dinner with me let cook do something extra and tell beacon to have the landau and pair at halfpast ten to drive her back to town tonight is miss holly asleep  the maid thought not and old jolyon passing down the gallery stole on tiptoe towards the nursery and opened the door whose hinges he kept specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without being heard  but holly was asleep and lay like a miniature madonna of that type which the old painters could not tell from venus when they had completed her her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks on her face was perfect peaceher little arrangements were evidently all right again and old jolyon in the twilight of the room stood adoring her it was so charming solemn and lovingthat little face he had more than his share of the blessed capacity of living again in the young they were to him his future lifeall of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted there she was with everything before her and his bloodsome of itin her tiny veins there she was his little companion to be made as happy as ever he could make her so that she knew nothing but love his heart swelled and he went out stilling the sound of his patentleather boots in the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him to think that children should come to that which irene had told him she was helping women who were all once little things like this one sleeping there i must give her a cheque he mused cant bear to think of them they had never borne reflecting on those poor outcasts wounding too deeply the core of true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to the sense of propertywounding too grievously the deepest thing in hima love of beauty which could give him even now a flutter of the heart thinking of his evening in the society of a pretty woman and he went downstairs through the swinging doors to the back regions there in the winecellar was a hock worth at least two pounds a bottle a steinberg cabinet better than any johannisberg that ever went down throat a wine of perfect bouquet sweet as a nectarinenectar indeed he got a bottle out handling it like a baby and holding it level to the light to look enshrined in its coat of dust that mellow coloured slendernecked bottle gave him deep pleasure three years to settle down again since the move from townought to be in prime condition thirtyfive years ago he had bought itthank god he had kept his palate and earned the right to drink it she would appreciate this not a spice of acidity in a dozen he wiped the bottle drew the cork with his own hands put his nose down inhaled its perfume and went back to the music room  irene was standing by the piano she had taken off her hat and a lace scarf she had been wearing so that her goldcoloured hair was visible and the pallor of her neck in her grey frock she made a pretty picture for old jolyon against the rosewood of the piano  he gave her his arm and solemnly they went the room which had been designed to enable twentyfour people to dine in comfort held now but a little round table in his present solitude the big diningtable oppressed old jolyon he had caused it to be removed till his son came back here in the company of two really good copies of raphael madonnas he was wont to dine alone it was the only disconsolate hour of his day this summer weather he had never been a large eater like that great chap swithin or sylvanus heythorp or anthony thornworthy those cronies of past times and to dine alone overlooked by the madonnas was to him but a sorrowful occupation which he got through quickly that he might come to the more spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar but this evening was a different matter his eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he spoke of italy and switzerland telling her stories of his travels there and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and granddaughter because they knew them this fresh audience was precious to him he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round the fields of reminiscence himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive he instinctively avoided fatiguing others and his natural flirtatiousness towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman he would have liked to draw her out but though she murmured and smiled and seemed to be enjoying what he told her he remained conscious of that mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination he could not bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you and chattered away or hardmouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did there was only one quality in a woman that appealed to himcharm and the quieter it was the more he liked it and this one had charm shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those italian hills and valleys he had loved the feeling too that she was as it were apart cloistered made her seem nearer to himself a strangely desirable companion when a man is very old and quite out of the running he loves to feel secure from the rivalries of youth for he would still be first in the heart of beauty and he drank his hock and watched her lips and felt nearly young but the dog balthasar lay watching her lips too and despising in his heart the interruptions of their talk and the tilting of those greenish glasses full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him  the light was just failing when they went back into the musicroom and cigar in mouth old jolyon said  play me some chopin  by the cigars they smoke and the composers they love ye shall know the texture of mens souls old jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or wagners music he loved beethoven and mozart handel and gluck and schumann and for some occult reason the operas of meyerbeer but of late years he had been seduced by chopin just as in painting he had succumbed to botticelli in yielding to these tastes he had been conscious of divergence from the standard of the golden age their poetry was not that of milton and byron and tennyson of raphael and titian mozart and beethoven it was as it were behind a veil their poetry hit no one in the face but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted and melted up the heart and never certain that this was healthy he did not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the music of the other  irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with pearlgrey and old jolyon in an armchair whence he could see her crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar she sat a few moments with her hands on the keys evidently searching her mind for what to give him then she began and within old jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure not quite like anything else in the world he fell slowly into a trance interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at long intervals and replacing it she was there and the hock within him and the scent of tobacco but there too was a world of sunshine lingering into moonlight and pools with storks upon them and bluish trees above glowing with blurs of winered roses and fields of lavender where milkwhite cows were grazing and a woman all shadowy with dark eyes and a white neck smiled holding out her arms and through air which was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cows horn he opened his eyes beautiful piece she played wellthe touch of an angel and he closed them again he felt miraculously sad and happy as one does standing under a limetree in full honey flower not live ones own life again but just stand there and bask in the smile of a womans eyes and enjoy the bouquet and he jerked his hand the dog balthasar had reached up and licked it  beautiful he said go onmore chopin  she began to play again this time the resemblance between her and chopin struck him the swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her playing too and the nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her eyes the light on her hair as of moonlight from a golden moon seductive yes but nothing of delilah in her or in that music a long blue spiral from his cigar ascended and dispersed so we go out he thought no more beauty nothing  again irene stopped  would you like some gluck he used to write his music in a sunlit garden with a bottle of rhine wine beside him  ah yes lets have orfeo round about him now were fields of gold and silver flowers white forms swaying in the sunlight bright birds flying to and fro all was summer lingering waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul some cigar ash dropped and taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and eau de cologne ah he thought indian summerthats all and he said you havent played me che faro  she did not answer did not move he was conscious of somethingsome strange upset suddenly he saw her rise and turn away and a pang of remorse shot through him what a clumsy chap like orpheus she of courseshe too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory and disturbed to the heart he got up from his chair she had gone to the great window at the far end gingerly he followed her hands were folded over her breast he could just see her cheek very white and quite emotionalized he said  there there my love the words had escaped him mechanically for they were those he used to holly when she had a pain but their effect was instantaneously distressing she raised her arms covered her face with them and wept  old jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age the passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment so unlike the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before broken down in the presence of another being  there therethere there he murmured and putting his hand out reverently touched her she turned and leaned the arms which covered her face against him old jolyon stood very still keeping one thin hand on her shoulder let her cry her heart outit would do her good  and the dog balthasar puzzled sat down on his stern to examine them  the window was still open the curtains had not been drawn the last of daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within there was a scent of newmown grass with the wisdom of a long life old jolyon did not speak even grief sobbed itself out in time only time was good for sorrowtime who saw the passing of each mood each emotion in turn time the layertorest there came into his mind the words as panteth the hart after cooling streamsbut they were of no use to him then conscious of a scent of violets he knew she was drying her eyes he put his chin forward pressed his moustache against her forehead and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops she put his hand to her lips as if saying all over now forgive me  the kiss filled him with a strange comfort he led her back to where she had been so upset and the dog balthasar following laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet  anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion he could think of nothing better than china and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet he kept taking up bits of dresden and lowestoft and chelsea turning them round and round with his thin veined hands whose skin faintly freckled had such an aged look  i bought this at jobsons he would say cost me thirty pounds its very old that dog leaves his bones all over the place this old shipbowl i picked up at the sale when that precious rip the marquis came to grief but you dont remember heres a nice piece of chelsea now what would you say this was and he was comforted feeling that with her taste she was taking a real interest in these things for after all nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china  when the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last he said  you must come again you must come to lunch then i can show you these by daylight and my little sweetshes a dear little thing this dog seems to have taken a fancy to you  for balthasar feeling that she was about to leave was rubbing his side against her leg going out under the porch with her he said  hell get you up in an hour and a quarter take this for your protegees and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand he saw her brightened eyes and heard her murmur oh uncle jolyon and a real throb of pleasure went through him that meant one or two poor creatures helped a little and it meant that she would come again he put his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more the carriage rolled away he stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees and thought a sweet night she     ii  two days of rain and summer set in bland and sunny old jolyon walked and talked with holly at first he felt taller and full of a new vigour then he felt restless almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice and walk as far as the log well shes not there he would think of course not and he would feel a little shorter and drag his feet walking up the hill home with his hand clapped to his left side now and then the thought would move in him did she comeor did i dream it and he would stare at space while the dog balthasar stared at him of course she would not come again he opened the letters from spain with less excitement they were not returning till july he felt oddly that he could bear it every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at where she had sat she was not there so he unscrewed his eyes again  on the seventh afternoon he thought i must go up and get some boots he ordered beacon and set out passing from putney towards hyde park he reflected i might as well go to chelsea and see her and he called out just drive me to where you took that lady the other night the coachman turned his broad red face and his juicy lips answered the lady in grey sir  yes the lady in grey what other ladies were there stodgy chap  the carriage stopped before a small threestoried block of flats standing a little back from the river with a practised eye old jolyon saw that they were cheap i should think about sixty pound a year he mused and entering he looked at the nameboard the name forsyte was not on it but against first floor flat c were the words mrs irene heron ah she had taken her maiden name again and somehow this pleased him he went upstairs slowly feeling his side a little he stood a moment before ringing to lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there she would not be in and thenboots the thought was black what did he want with boots at his age he could not wear out all those he had  your mistress at home  yes sir  say mr jolyon forsyte  yes sir will you come this way  old jolyon followed a very little maidnot more than sixteen one would sayinto a very small drawingroom where the sunblinds were drawn it held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste he stood in the middle with his top hat in his hand and thought i expect shes very badly off there was a mirror above the fireplace and he saw himself reflected an oldlooking chap he heard a rustle and turned round she was so close that his moustache almost brushed her forehead just under her hair  i was driving up he said thought id look in on you and ask you how you got up the other night  and seeing her smile he felt suddenly relieved she was really glad to see him perhaps  would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the park  but while she was gone to put her hat on he frowned the park james and emily mrs nicholas or some other member of his precious family would be there very likely prancing up and down and they would go and wag their tongues about having seen him with her afterwards better not he did not wish to revive the echoes of the past on forsyte change he removed a white hair from the lapel of his closelybuttonedup frock coat and passed his hand over his cheeks moustache and square chin it felt very hollow there under the cheekbones he had not been eating much latelyhe had better get that little whippersnapper who attended holly to give him a tonic but she had come back and when they were in the carriage he said  suppose we go and sit in kensington gardens instead and added with a twinkle no prancing up and down there as if she had been in the secret of his thoughts  leaving the carriage they entered those select precincts and strolled towards the water  youve gone back to your maiden name i see he said im not sorry  she slipped her hand under his arm has june forgiven me uncle jolyon  he answered gently yesyes of course why not  and have you  i i forgave you as soon as i saw how the land really lay and perhaps he had his instinct had always been to forgive the beautiful  she drew a deep breath i never regrettedi couldnt did you ever love very deeply uncle jolyon  at that strange question old jolyon stared before him had he he did not seem to remember that he ever had but he did not like to say this to the young woman whose hand was touching his arm whose life was suspended as it were by memory of a tragic love and he thought if i had met you when i was young ii might have made a fool of myself perhaps and a longing to escape in generalities beset him  loves a queer thing he said fatal thing often it was the greekswasnt itmade love into a goddess they were right i dare say but then they lived in the golden age  phil adored them  phil the word jarred him for suddenlywith his power to see all round a thing he perceived why she was putting up with him like this she wanted to talk about her lover well if it was any pleasure to her and he said ah there was a bit of the sculptor in him i fancy  yes he loved balance and symmetry he loved the wholehearted way the greeks gave themselves to art  balance the chap had no balance at all if he remembered as for symmetrycleanbuilt enough he was no doubt but those queer eyes of his and high cheekbonessymmetry  youre of the golden age too uncle jolyon  old jolyon looked round at her was she chaffing him no her eyes were soft as velvet was she flattering him but if so why there was nothing to be had out of an old chap like him  phil thought so he used to say but i can never tell him that i admire him  ah there it was again her dead lover her desire to talk of him and he pressed her arm half resentful of those memories half grateful as if he recognised what a link they were between herself and him  he was a very talented young fellow he murmured its hot i feel the heat nowadays lets sit down  they took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves covered them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon a pleasure to sit there and watch her and feel that she liked to be with him and the wish to increase that liking if he could made him go on  i expect he showed you a side of him i never saw hed be at his best with you his ideas of art were a little newto me he had stiffed the word fangled  yes but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty old jolyon thought the devil he did but answered with a twinkle well i have or i shouldnt be sitting here with you she was fascinating when she smiled with her eyes like that  he thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old phil had real insight  he was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past out of a longing to talk of her dead lovernot a bit and yet it was precious to hear because she pleased his eyes and heart whichquite truehad never grown old was that becauseunlike her and her dead lover he had never loved to desperation had always kept his balance his sense of symmetry well it had left him power at eightyfour to admire beauty and he thought if i were a painter or a sculptor but im an old chap make hay while the sun shines  a couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them at the edge of the shadow from their tree the sunlight fell cruelly on their pale squashed unkempt young faces were an ugly lot said old jolyon suddenly it amazes me to see howlove triumphs over that  love triumphs over everything  the young think so he muttered  love has no age no limit and no death  with that glow in her pale face her breast heaving her eyes so large and dark and soft she looked like venus come to life but this extravagance brought instant reaction and twinkling he said well if it had limits we shouldnt be born for by george its got a lot to put up with  then removing his top hat he brushed it round with a cuff the great clumsy thing heated his forehead in these days he often got a rush of blood to the headhis circulation was not what it had been  she still sat gazing straight before her and suddenly she murmured  its strange enough that im alive  those words of jos wild and lost came back to him  ah he said my son saw you for a momentthat day  was it your son i heard a voice in the hall i thought for a second it wasphil  old jolyon saw her lips tremble she put her hand over them took it away again and went on calmly that night i went to the embankment a woman caught me by the dress she told me about herself when one knows that others suffer ones ashamed  one of those  she nodded and horror stirred within old jolyon the horror of one who has never known a struggle with desperation almost against his will he muttered tell me wont you  i didnt care whether i lived or died when youre like that fate ceases to want to kill you she took care of me three daysshe never left me i had no money thats why i do what i can for them now  but old jolyon was thinking no money what fate could compare with that every other was involved in it  i wish you had come to me he said why didnt you but irene did not answer  because my name was forsyte i suppose or was it june who kept you away how are you getting on now his eyes involuntarily swept her body perhaps even now she was and yet she wasnt thinnot really  oh with my fifty pounds a year i make just enough the answer did not reassure him he had lost confidence and that fellow soames but his sense of justice stifled condemnation no she would certainly have died rather than take another penny from him soft as she looked there must be strength in her somewherestrength and fidelity but what business had young bosinney to have got run over and left her stranded like this  well you must come to me now he said for anything you want or i shall be quite cut up and putting on his hat he rose lets go and get some tea i told that lazy chap to put the horses up for an hour and come for me at your place well take a cab presently i cant walk as i used to  he enjoyed that stroll to the kensington end of the gardensthe sound of her voice the glancing of her eyes the subtle beauty of a charming form moving beside him he enjoyed their tea at ruffels in the high street and came out thence with a great box of chocolates swung on his little finger he enjoyed the drive back to chelsea in a hansom smoking his cigar she had promised to come down next sunday and play to him again and already in thought he was plucking carnations and early roses for her to carry back to town it was a pleasure to give her a little pleasure if it were pleasure from an old chap like him the carriage was already there when they arrived just like that fellow who was always late when he was wanted old jolyon went in for a minute to say goodbye the little dark hall of the flat was impregnated with a disagreeable odour of patchouli and on a bench against the wallits only furniturehe saw a figure sitting he heard irene say softly just one minute in the little drawingroom when the door was shut he asked gravely one of your protegees  yes now thanks to you i can do something for her  he stood staring and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so many in its time the idea of her thus actually in contact with this outcast grieved and frightened him what could she do for them nothing only soil and make trouble for herself perhaps and he said take care my dear the world puts the worst construction on everything  i know that  he was abashed by her quiet smile well thensunday he murmured goodbye  she put her cheek forward for him to kiss  goodbye he said again take care of yourself and he went out not looking towards the figure on the bench he drove home by way of hammersmith that he might stop at a place he knew of and tell them to send her in two dozen of their best burgundy she must want pickingup sometimes only in richmond park did he remember that he had gone up to order himself some boots and was surprised that he could have had so paltry an idea     iii  the little spirits of the past which throng an old mans days had never pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy hours elapsing before sunday came the spirit of the future with the charm of the unknown put up her lips instead old jolyon was not restless now and paid no visits to the log because she was coming to lunch there is wonderful finality about a meal it removes a world of doubts for no one misses meals except for reasons beyond control he played many games with holly on the lawn pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be ready to bowl to jolly in the holidays for she was not a forsyte but jolly wasand forsytes always bat until they have resigned and reached the age of eightyfive the dog balthasar in attendance lay on the ball as often as he could and the pageboy fielded till his face was like the harvest moon and because the time was getting shorter each day was longer and more golden than the last on friday night he took a liver pill his side hurt him rather and though it was not the liver side there is no remedy like that anyone telling him that he had found a new excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him would have been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deepset irongrey eyes which seemed to say i know my own business best he always had and always would  on sunday morning when holly had gone with her governess to church he visited the strawberry beds there accompanied by the dog balthasar he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe stooping was not good for him and he became very dizzy and red in the forehead having placed the strawberries in a dish on the diningtable he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau de cologne there before the mirror it occurred to him that he was thinner what a threadpaper he had been when he was young it was nice to be slimhe could not bear a fat chap and yet perhaps his cheeks were too thin she was to arrive by train at halfpast twelve and walk up entering from the road past drages farm at the far end of the coppice and having looked into junes room to see that there was hot water ready he set forth to meet her leisurely for his heart was beating the air smelled sweet larks sang and the grand stand at epsom was visible a perfect day on just such a one no doubt six years ago soames had brought young bosinney down with him to look at the site before they began to build it was bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for the houseas june had often told him in these days he was thinking much about that young fellow as if his spirit were really haunting the field of his last work on the chance of seeingher bosinneythe one man who had possessed her heart to whom she had given her whole self with rapture at his age one could not of course imagine such things but there stirred in him a queer vague achingas it were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy and a feeling too more generous of pity for that love so early lost all over in a few poor months well well he looked at his watch before entering the coppiceonly a quarter past twentyfive minutes to wait and then turning the corner of the path he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time on the log and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least two hours of her society missed what memory could make that log so dear to her his face showed what he was thinking for she said at once  forgive me uncle jolyon it was here that i first knew  yes yes there it is for you whenever you like youre looking a little londony youre giving too many lessons  that she should have to give lessons worried him lessons to a parcel of young girls thumping out scales with their thick fingers  where do you go to give them he asked  theyre mostly jewish families luckily  old jolyon stared to all forsytes jews seem strange and doubtful  they love music and theyre very kind  they had better be by george he took her armhis side always hurt him a little going uphilland said  did you ever see anything like those buttercups they came like that in a night  her eyes seemed really to fly over the field like bees after the flowers and the honey i wanted you to see themwouldnt let them turn the cows in yet then remembering that she had come to talk about bosinney he pointed to the clocktower over the stables  i expect he wouldnt have let me put that therehad no notion of time if i remember  but pressing his arm to her she talked of flowers instead and he knew it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover  the best flower i can show you he said with a sort of triumph is my little sweet shell be back from church directly theres something about her which reminds me a little of you and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus instead of saying theres something about you which reminds me a little of her ah and here she was  holly followed closely by her elderly french governess whose digestion had been ruined twentytwo years ago in the siege of strasbourg came rushing towards them from under the oak tree she stopped about a dozen yards away to pat balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her mind old jolyon who knew better said  well my darling heres the lady in grey i promised you  holly raised herself and looked up he watched the two of them with a twinkle irene smiling holly beginning with grave inquiry passing into a shy smile too and then to something deeper she had a sense of beauty that childknew what was what he enjoyed the sight of the kiss between them  mrs heron mamzelle beauce well mamzellegood sermon  for now that he had not much more time before him the only part of the service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church remained to him mamzelle beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad in a black kid gloveshe had been in the best familiesand the rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask are you wellbrrred whenever holly or jolly did anything unpleasing to hera not uncommon occurrenceshe would say to them the little tayleurs never did thatthey were such wellbrrred little children jolly hated the little tayleurs holly wondered dreadfully how it was she fell so short of them a thin rum little soul old jolyon thought hermamzelle beauce  luncheon was a successful meal the mushrooms which he himself had picked in the mushroom house his chosen strawberries and another bottle of the steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality and a conviction that he would have a touch of eczema tomorrow  after lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking turkish coffee it was no matter of grief to him when mademoiselle beauce withdrew to write her sunday letter to her sister whose future had been endangered in the past by swallowing a pinan event held up daily in warning to the children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten at the foot of the bank on a carriage rug holly and the dog balthasar teased and loved each other and in the shade old jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured gazed at irene sitting in the swing a light vaguely swaying grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon it lips just opened eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped she looked content surely it did her good to come and see him the selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him for he could still feel pleasure in the pleasure of others realising that what he wanted though much was not quite all that mattered  its quiet here he said you mustnt come down if you find it dull but its a pleasure to see you my little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure except yours  from her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated and this reassured him thats not humbug he said i never told a woman i admired her when i didnt in fact i dont know when ive told a woman i admired her except my wife in the old days and wives are funny he was silent but resumed abruptly  she used to expect me to say it more often than i felt it and there we were her face looked mysteriously troubled and afraid that he had said something painful he hurried on when my little sweet marries i hope shell find someone who knows what women feel i shant be here to see it but theres too much topsyturvydom in marriage i dont want her to pitch up against that and aware that he had made bad worse he added that dog will scratch  a silence followed of what was she thinking this pretty creature whose life was spoiled who had done with love and yet was made for love some day when he was gone perhaps she would find another matenot so disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over ah but her husband  does soames never trouble you he asked  she shook her head her face had closed up suddenly for all her softness there was something irreconcilable about her and a glimpse of light on the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which belonging to early victorian civilisationso much older than this of his old agehad never thought about such primitive things  thats a comfort he said you can see the grand stand today shall we take a turn round  through the flower and fruit garden against whose high outer walls peach trees and nectarines were trained to the sun through the stables the vinery the mushroom house the asparagus beds the rosery the summerhouse he conducted hereven into the kitchen garden to see the tiny green peas which holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her finger and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand many delightful things he showed her while holly and the dog balthasar danced ahead or came to them at intervals for attention it was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the music room and let her give him tea a special little friend of hollys had come ina fair child with short hair like a boys and the two sported in the distance under the stairs on the stairs and up in the gallery old jolyon begged for chopin she played studies mazurkas waltzes till the two children creeping near stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward listening old jolyon watched  lets see you dance you two  shyly with a false start they began bobbing and circling earnest not very adroit they went past and past his chair to the strains of that waltz he watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling towards those little dancers thinking  sweetest picture ive seen for ages  a voice said  hollee mais enfinquestce que tu fais ladanser le dimanche viens donc  but the children came close to old jolyon knowing that he would save them and gazed into a face which was decidedly caught out  better the day better the deed mamzelle its all my doing trot along chicks and have your tea  and when they were gone followed by the dog balthasar who took every meal he looked at irene with a twinkle and said  well there we are arent they sweet have you any little ones among your pupils  yes threetwo of them darlings  pretty  lovely  old jolyon sighed he had an insatiable appetite for the very young my little sweet he said is devoted to music shell be a musician some day you wouldnt give me your opinion of her playing i suppose  of course i will  you wouldnt like but he stifled the words to give her lessons the idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him yet it would mean that he would see her regularly she left the piano and came over to his chair  i would like very much but there isjune when are they coming back  old jolyon frowned not till the middle of next month what does that matter  you said june had forgiven me but she could never forget uncle jolyon  forget she must forget if he wanted her to  but as if answering irene shook her head you know she couldnt one doesnt forget  always that wretched past and he said with a sort of vexed finality  well we shall see  he talked to her an hour or more of the children and a hundred little things till the carriage came round to take her home and when she had gone he went back to his chair and sat there smoothing his face and chin dreaming over the day  that evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper he stayed for some minutes without writing then rose and stood under the masterpiece dutch fishing boats at sunset he was not thinking of that picture but of his life he was going to leave her something in his will nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory he was going to leave her a portion of his wealth of his aspirations deeds qualities workall that had made that wealth going to leave her too a part of all he had missed in life by his sane and steady pursuit of wealth all what had he missed dutch fishing boats responded blankly he crossed to the french window and drawing the curtain aside opened it a wind had got up and one of last years oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardeners brooms was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight except for that it was very quiet out there and he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since a bat went by a bird uttered its last cheep and right above the oak tree the first star shone faust in the opera had bartered his soul for some fresh years of youth morbid notion no such bargain was possible that was real tragedy no making oneself new again for love or life or anything nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you could and leave it something in your will but how much and as if he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the country night he turned back and went up to the chimneypiece there were his pet bronzesa cleopatra with the asp at her breast a socrates a greyhound playing with her puppy a strong man reining in some horses they last he thought and a pang went through his heart they had a thousand years of life before them  how much well enough at all events to save her getting old before her time to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible and grey from soiling that bright hair he might live another five years she would be well over thirty by then how much she had none of his blood in her in loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty years and more ever since he married and founded that mysterious thing a family came this warning thoughtnone of his blood no right to anything it was a luxury then this notion an extravagance a petting of an old mans whim one of those things done in dotage his real future was vested in those who had his blood in whom he would live on when he was gone he turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds of cigars and suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her grey dress fragrant soft darkeyed graceful looking up at him why she cared nothing for him really all she cared for was that lost lover of hers but she was there whether she would or no giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace one had no right to inflict an old mans company no right to ask her down to play to him and let him look at herfor no reward pleasure must be paid for in this world how much after all there was plenty his son and his three grandchildren would never miss that little lump he had made it himself nearly every penny he could leave it where he liked allow himself this little pleasure he went back to the bureau well im going to he thought let them think what they like im going to and he sat down  how much ten thousand twenty thousandhow much if only with his money he could buy one year one month of youth and startled by that thought he wrote quickly  dear herringdraw me a codicil to this effect i leave to my niece irene forsyte born irene heron by which name she now goes fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty yours faithfully jolyon forsyte  when he had sealed and stamped the envelope he went back to the window and drew in a long breath it was dark but many stars shone now     iv  he woke at halfpast two an hour which long experience had taught him brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts experience had also taught him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of such panic on this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid momentum was that if he became ill at his age not improbable he would not see her from this it was but a step to realisation that he would be cut off too when his son and june returned from spain how could he justify desire for the company of one who had stolenearly morning does not mince wordsjunes lover that lover was dead but june was a stubborn little thing warmhearted but stubborn as wood andquite truenot one who forgot by the middle of next month they would be back he had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had come into what remained of his life darkness showed up to him absurdly clear the nature of his feeling admiration for beautya craving to see that which delighted his eyes  preposterous at his age and yetwhat other reason was there for asking june to undergo such painful reminder and how prevent his son and his sons wife from thinking him very queer he would be reduced to sneaking up to london which tired him and the least indisposition would cut him off even from that he lay with eyes open setting his jaw against the prospect and calling himself an old fool while his heart beat loudly and then seemed to stop beating altogether he had seen the dawn lighting the window chinks heard the birds chirp and twitter and the cocks crow before he fell asleep again and awoke tired but sane five weeks before he need bother at his age an eternity but that early morning panic had left its mark had slightly fevered the will of one who had always had his own way he would see her as often as he wished why not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitors instead of writing about it she might like to go to the opera but by train for he would not have that fat chap beacon grinning behind his back servants were such fools and as likely as not they had known all the past history of irene and young bosinneyservants knew everything and suspected the rest he wrote to her that morning  my dear irenei have to be up in town tomorrow if you would like to have a look in at the opera come and dine with me quietly   but where it was decades since he had dined anywhere in london save at his club or at a private house ah that newfangled place close to covent garden   let me have a line tomorrow morning to the piedmont hotel whether to expect you there at 7 oclock  yours affectionately  jolyon forsyte   she would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was instinctively unpleasant to him it was not seemly that one so old should go out of his way to see beauty especially in a woman  the journey next day short though it was and the visit to his lawyers tired him it was hot too and after dressing for dinner he lay down on the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little he must have had a sort of fainting fit for he came to himself feeling very queer and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell why it was past seven and there he was and she would be waiting but suddenly the dizziness came on again and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa he heard the maids voice say  did you ring sir  yes come here he could not see her clearly for the cloud in front of his eyes im not well i want some sal volatile  yes sir her voice sounded frightened  old jolyon made an effort  dont go take this message to my niecea lady waiting in the halla lady in grey say mr forsyte is not wellthe heat he is very sorry if he is not down directly she is not to wait dinner  when she was gone he thought feebly why did i say a lady in greyshe may be in anything sal volatile he did not go off again yet was not conscious of how irene came to be standing beside him holding smelling salts to his nose and pushing a pillow up behind his head he heard her say anxiously dear uncle jolyon what is it was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand then drew a long breath of smelling salts suddenly discovered strength in them and sneezed  ha he said its nothing how did you get here go down and dinethe tickets are on the dressingtable i shall be all right in a minute  he felt her cool hand on his forehead smelled violets and sat divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right  why you are in grey he said help me up once on his feet he gave himself a shake  what business had i to go off like that and he moved very slowly to the glass what a cadaverous chap her voice behind him murmured  you mustnt come down uncle you must rest  fiddlesticks a glass of champagnell soon set me to rights i cant have you missing the opera  but the journey down the corridor was troublesome what carpets they had in these newfangled places so thick that you tripped up in them at every step in the lift he noticed how concerned she looked and said with the ghost of a twinkle  im a pretty host  when the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its slipping under him but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much better and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him  i should have liked you for a daughter he said suddenly and watching the smile in her eyes went on  you mustnt get wrapped up in the past at your time of life plenty of that when you get to my age thats a nice dressi like the style  i made it myself  ah a woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her interest in life  make hay while the sun shines he said and drink that up i want to see some colour in your cheeks we mustnt waste life it doesnt do theres a new marguerite tonight lets hope she wont be fat and mephistoanything more dreadful than a fat chap playing the devil i cant imagine  but they did not go to the opera after all for in getting up from dinner the dizziness came over him again and she insisted on his staying quiet and going to bed early when he parted from her at the door of the hotel having paid the cabman to drive her to chelsea he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her words you are such a darling to me uncle jolyon why who wouldnt be he would have liked to stay up another day and take her to the zoo but two days running of him would bore her to death no he must wait till next sunday she had promised to come then they would settle those lessons for holly if only for a month it would be something that little mamzelle beauce wouldnt like it but she would have to lump it and crushing his old opera hat against his chest he sought the lift  he drove to waterloo next morning struggling with a desire to say drive me to chelsea but his sense of proportion was too strong besides he still felt shaky and did not want to risk another aberration like that of last night away from home holly too was expecting him and what he had in his bag for her not that there was any cupboard love in his little sweetshe was a bundle of affection then with the rather bitter cynicism of the old he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard love which made irene put up with him no she was not that sort either she had if anything too little notion of how to butter her bread no sense of property poor thing besides he had not breathed a word about that codicil nor should hesufficient unto the day was the good thereof  in the victoria which met him at the station holly was restraining the dog balthasar and their caresses made jubey his drive home all the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and peaceful reposing in the shade while the long lingering sunshine showered gold on the lawns and the flowers but on thursday evening at his lonely dinner he began to count the hours sixtyfive till he would go down to meet her again in the little coppice and walk up through the fields at her side he had intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit but the fellow would be sure to insist on quiet no excitement and all that and he did not mean to be tied by the leg did not want to be told of an infirmityif there were one could not afford to hear of it at his time of life now that this new interest had come and he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his son it would only bring them back with a run how far this silence was due to consideration for their pleasure how far to regard for his own he did not pause to consider  that night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off when he heard the rustle of a gown and was conscious of a scent of violets opening his eyes he saw her dressed in grey standing by the fireplace holding out her arms the odd thing was that though those arms seemed to hold nothing they were curved as if round someones neck and her own neck was bent back her lips open her eyes closed she vanished at once and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes but those bronzes and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was only the fireplace and the wall shaken and troubled he got up i must take medicine he thought i cant be well his heart beat too fast he had an asthmatic feeling in the chest and going to the window he opened it to get some air a dog was barking far away one of the dogs at gages farm no doubt beyond the coppice a beautiful still night but dark i dropped off he mused thats it and yet ill swear my eyes were open a sound like a sigh seemed to answer  whats that he said sharply whos there  putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart he stepped out on the terrace something soft scurried by in the dark shoo it was that great grey cat young bosinney was like a great cat he thought it was him in there that shethat she washes got her still he walked to the edge of the terrace and looked down into the darkness he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn here today and gone tomorrow and there came the moon who saw all young and old alive and dead and didnt care a dump his own turn soon for a single day of youth he would give what was left and he turned again towards the house he could see the windows of the night nursery up there his little sweet would be asleep hope that dog wont wake her he thought what is it makes us love and makes us die i must go to bed  and across the terrace stones growing grey in the moonlight he passed back within  how should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his wellspent past in that at all events there is no agitating warmth only pale winter sunshine the shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos of memory the present he should distrust the future shun from beneath thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes if there be sun of summer let him not go out into it mistaking it for the indiansummer sun thus peradventure he shall decline softly slowly imperceptibly until impatient nature clutches his windpipe and he gasps away to death some early morning before the world is aired and they put on his tombstone in the fulness of years yea if he preserve his principles in perfect order a forsyte may live on long after he is dead  old jolyon was conscious of all this and yet there was in him that which transcended forsyteism for it is written that a forsyte shall not love beauty more than reason nor his own way more than his own health and something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at the thinning shell his sagacity knew this but it knew too that he could not stop that beating nor would if he could and yet if you had told him he was living on his capital he would have stared you down no no a man did not live on his capital it was not done the shibboleths of the past are ever more real than the actualities of the present and he to whom living on ones capital had always been anathema could not have borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case pleasure is healthful beauty good to see to live again in the youth of the youngand what else on earth was he doing  methodically as had been the way of his whole life he now arranged his time on tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train irene came and dined with him and they went to the opera on thursdays he drove to town and putting that fat chap and his horses up met her in kensington gardens picking up the carriage after he had left her and driving home again in time for dinner he threw out the casual formula that he had business in london on those two days on wednesdays and saturdays she came down to give holly music lessons the greater the pleasure he took in her society the more scrupulously fastidious he became just a matteroffact and friendly uncle not even in feeling really was he morefor after all there was his age and yet if she were late he fidgeted himself to death if she missed coming which happened twice his eyes grew sad as an old dogs and he failed to sleep  and so a month went bya month of summer in the fields and in his heart with summers heat and the fatigue thereof who could have believed a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his sons and his granddaughters return with something like dread there was such a delicious freedom such recovery of that independence a man enjoys before he founds a family about these weeks of lovely weather and this new companionship with one who demanded nothing and remained always a little unknown retaining the fascination of mystery it was like a draught of wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood the narcotic to his brain the flowers were coloured brighter scents and music and the sunlight had a living valuewere no longer mere reminders of past enjoyment there was something now to live for which stirred him continually to anticipation he lived in that not in retrospection the difference is considerable to any so old as he the pleasures of the table never of much consequence to one naturally abstemious had lost all value he ate little without knowing what he ate and every day grew thinner and more worn to look at he was again a threadpaper and to this thinned form his massive forehead with hollows at the temples gave more dignity than ever he was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor but liberty was too sweet he could not afford to pet his frequent shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense of liberty return to the vegetable existence he had led among the agricultural journals with the lifesize mangold wurzels before this new attraction came into his lifeno he exceeded his allowance of cigars two a day had always been his rule now he smoked three and sometimes foura man will when he is filled with the creative spirit but very often he thought i must give up smoking and coffee i must give up rattling up to town but he did not there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him and this was a priceless boon  the servants perhaps wondered but they were naturally dumb mamzelle beauce was too concerned with her own digestion and too wellbrrred to make personal allusions holly had not as yet an eye for the relative appearance of him who was her plaything and her god it was left for irene herself to beg him to eat more to rest in the hot part of the day to take a tonic and so forth but she did not tell him that she was the a cause of his thinnessfor one cannot see the havoc oneself is working a man of eightyfive has no passions but the beauty which produces passion works on in the old way till death closes the eyes which crave the sight of her  on the first day of the second week in july he received a letter from his son in paris to say that they would all be back on friday this had always been more sure than fate but with the pathetic improvidence given to the old that they may endure to the end he had never quite admitted it now he did and something would have to be done he had ceased to be able to imagine life without this new interest but that which is not imagined sometimes exists as forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost he sat in his old leather chair doubling up the letter and mumbling with his lips the end of an unlighted cigar after tomorrow his tuesday expeditions to town would have to be abandoned he could still drive up perhaps once a week on the pretext of seeing his man of business but even that would be dependent on his health for now they would begin to fuss about him the lessons the lessons must go on she must swallow down her scruples and june must put her feelings in her pocket she had done so once on the day after the news of bosinneys death what she had done then she could surely do again now four years since that injury was inflicted on hernot christian to keep the memory of old sores alive junes will was strong but his was stronger for his sands were running out irene was soft surely she would do this for him subdue her natural shrinking sooner than give him pain the lessons must continue for if they did he was secure and lighting his cigar at last he began trying to shape out how to put it to them all and explain this strange intimacy how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truththat he could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty ah holly holly was fond of her holly liked her lessons she would save himhis little sweet and with that happy thought he became serene and wondered what he had been worrying about so fearfully he must not worry it left him always curiously weak and as if but half present in his own body  that evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness though he did not faint he would not ring the bell because he knew it would mean a fuss and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous when one grew old the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom and for what reasonjust to keep the breath in him a little longer he did not want it at such cost only the dog balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy instead of giving him a biscuit when at last old jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed and though still shaky next morning the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him it was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinnerhe suspected her of undereating when she was alone and at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten the unconscious smiling of her lips she hadnt much pleasure and this was the last time he would be able to give her that treat but when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him and the exertion too of telling her about junes return  the opera that evening was carmen and he chose the last entracte to break the news instinctively putting it off till the latest moment  she took it quietly queerly in fact he did not know how she had taken it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary the mask was down over her face that mask behind which so much went on that he could not see she wanted time to think it over no doubt he would not press her for she would be coming to give her lesson tomorrow afternoon and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea in the cab he talked only of the carmen he had seen better in the old days but this one was not bad at all when he took her hand to say goodnight she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead  goodbye dear uncle jolyon you have been so sweet to me  tomorrow then he said goodnight sleep well she echoed softly sleep well and from the cab window already moving away he saw her face screwed round towards him and her hand put out in a gesture which seemed to linger  he sought his room slowly they never gave him the same and he could not get used to these spickandspandy bedrooms with new furniture and greygreen carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses he was wakeful and that wretched habanera kept throbbing in his head  his french had never been equal to its words but its sense he knew if it had any sense a gipsy thingwild and unaccountable well there was in life something which upset all your care and planssomething which made men and women dance to its pipes and he lay staring from deepsunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway you thought you had hold of life but it slipped away behind you took you by the scruff of the neck forced you here and forced you there and then likely as not squeezed life out of you it took the very stars like that he shouldnt wonder rubbed their noses together and flung them apart it had never done playing its pranks five million people in this great blunderbuss of a town and all of them at the mercy of that lifeforce like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when you struck your fist on it ah well himself would not hop much longera good long sleep would do him good  how hot it was up herehow noisy his forehead burned she had kissed it just where he always worried just thereas if she had known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him but instead her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness she had never spoken in quite that voice had never before made that lingering gesture or looked back at him as she drove away  he got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside his room faced down over the river there was little air but the sight of that breadth of water flowing by calm eternal soothed him the great thing he thought is not to make myself a nuisance ill think of my little sweet and go to sleep but it was long before the heat and throbbing of the london night died out into the short slumber of the summer morning and old jolyon had but forty winks  when he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden and with the help of holly who was very delicate with flowers gathered a great bunch of carnations they were he told her for the lady in greya name still bandied between them and he put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle irene the moment she came on the subject of june and future lessons their fragrance and colour would help after lunch he lay down for he felt very tired and the carriage would not bring her from the station till four oclock but as the hour approached he grew restless and sought the schoolroom which overlooked the drive the sunblinds were down and holly was there with mademoiselle beauce sheltered from the heat of a stifling july day attending to their silkworms old jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical creatures whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green leaves and smelled as he thought horrid he sat down on a chintzcovered windowseat whence he could see the drive and get what air there was and the dog balthasar who appreciated chintz on hot days jumped up beside him over the cottage piano a violet dustsheet faded almost to grey was spread and on it the first lavender whose scent filled the room in spite of the coolness here perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his ebbeddown senses each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying brilliance that dog smelled very strong the lavender perfume was overpowering those silkworms heaving up their greygreen backs seemed horribly alive and hollys dark head bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen a marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old and weak it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality he had never till those last few weeks had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life and with the other half left on the bank watching that helpless progress only when irene was with him did he lose this double consciousness  holly turned her head pointed with her little brown fist to the pianofor to point with a finger was not wellbrrredand said slyly  look at the lady in grey gran isnt she pretty today  old jolyons heart gave a flutter and for a second the room was clouded then it cleared and he said with a twinkle  whos been dressing her up  mamzelle  hollee dont be foolish  that prim little frenchwoman she hadnt yet got over the music lessons being taken away from her that wouldnt help his little sweet was the only friend they had well they were her lessons and he shouldnt budge shouldnt budge for anything he stroked the warm wool on balthasars head and heard holly say when mothers home there wont be any changes will there she doesnt like strangers you know  the childs words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition about old jolyon and disclose all the menace to his newfound freedom ah he would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of care and love or fight to keep this new and prized companionship and to fight tired him to death but his thin worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all jaw this was his house and his affair he should not budge he looked at his watch old and thin like himself he had owned it fifty years past four already and kissing the top of hollys head in passing he went down to the hall he wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson at the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch and saw at once that the victoria was empty  the trains in sir but the lady asnt come  old jolyon gave him a sharp upward look his eyes seemed to push away that fat chaps curiosity and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was feeling  very well he said and turned back into the house he went to his study and sat down quivering like a leaf what did this mean she might have lost her train but he knew well enough she hadnt goodbye dear uncle jolyon why goodbye and not goodnight and that hand of hers lingering in the air and her kiss what did it mean vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him he got up and began to pace the turkey carpet between window and wall she was going to give him up he felt it for certainand he defenceless an old man wanting to look on beauty it was ridiculous age closed his mouth paralysed his power to fight he had no right to what was warm and living no right to anything but memories and sorrow he could not plead with her even an old man has his dignity defenceless for an hour lost to bodily fatigue he paced up and down past the bowl of carnations he had plucked which mocked him with its scent of all things hard to bear the prostration of willpower is hardest for one who has always had his way nature had got him in its net and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes here and there found no hole no breaking point they brought him tea at five oclock and a letter for a moment hope beat up in him he cut the envelope with the butter knife and read  dearest uncle jolyoni cant bear to write anything that may disappoint you but i was too cowardly to tell you last night i feel i cant come down and give holly any more lessons now that june is coming back some things go too deep to be forgotten it has been such a joy to see you and holly perhaps i shall still see you sometimes when you come up though im sure its not good for you i can see you are tiring yourself too much i believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather and now you have your son and june coming back you will be so happy thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me  lovingly your irene  so there it was not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly cared about to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things the approach of death with its stealthy rustling footsteps not good for him not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him  his tea grew cold his cigar remained unlit and up and down he paced torn between his dignity and his hold on life intolerable to be squeezed out slowly without a say of your own to live on when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love intolerable he would see what telling her the truth would dothe truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on he sat down at his old bureau and took a pen but he could not write there was something revolting in having to plead like this plead that she should warm his eyes with her beauty it was tantamount to confessing dotage he simply could not and instead he wrote   i had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little granddaughter but old men learn to forego their whims they are obliged to even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later and perhaps the sooner the better  my love to you  jolyon forsyte   bitter he thought but i cant help it im tired he sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post and hearing it fall to the bottom thought there goes all ive looked forward to  that evening after dinner which he scarcely touched after his cigar which he left halfsmoked for it made him feel faint he went very slowly upstairs and stole into the nightnursery he sat down on the windowseat a nightlight was burning and he could just see hollys face with one hand underneath the cheek an early cockchafer buzzed in the japanese paper with which they had filled the grate and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly to sleep like that child he pressed apart two rungs of the venetian blind and looked out the moon was rising bloodred he had never seen so red a moon the woods and fields out there were dropping to sleep too in the last glimmer of the summer light and beauty like a spirit walked ive had a long life he thought the best of nearly everything im an ungrateful chap ive seen a lot of beauty in my time poor young bosinney said i had a sense of beauty theres a man in the moon tonight a moth went by another another ladies in grey he closed his eyes a feeling that he would never open them again beset him he let it grow let himself sink then with a shiver dragged the lids up there was something wrong with him no doubt deeply wrong he would have to have the doctor after all it didnt much matter now into that coppice the moonlight would have crept there would be shadows and those shadows would be the only things awake no birds beasts flowers insects just the shadowsmoving ladies in grey over that log they would climb would whisper together she and bosinney funny thought and the frogs and little things would whisper too how the clock ticked in here it was all eerieout there in the light of that red moon in here with the little steady nightlight and the ticking clock and the nurses dressinggown hanging from the edge of the screen tall like a womans figure lady in grey and a very odd thought beset him did she exist had she ever come at all or was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon the violetgrey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair who walks the dawn and the moonlight and at bluebell time what was she who was she did she exist he rose and stood a moment clutching the windowsill to give him a sense of reality again then began tiptoeing towards the door he stopped at the foot of the bed and holly as if conscious of his eyes fixed on her stirred sighed and curled up closer in defence he tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage reached his room undressed at once and stood before a mirror in his nightshirt what a scarecrowwith temples fallen in and thin legs his eyes resisted his own image and a look of pride came on his face all was in league to pull him down even his reflection in the glass but he was not downyet he got into bed and lay a long time without sleeping trying to reach resignation only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for him  he woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for the doctor after sounding him the fellow pulled a face as long as your arm and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking that was no hardship there was nothing to get up for and when he felt ill tobacco always lost its savour he spent the morning languidly with the sunblinds down turning and returning the times not reading much the dog balthasar lying beside his bed with his lunch they brought him a telegram running thus  your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at fourthirty irene  coming down after all then she did existand he was not deserted coming down a glow ran through his limbs his cheeks and forehead felt hot he drank his soup and pushed the traytable away lying very quiet until they had removed lunch and left him alone but every now and then his eyes twinkled coming down his heart beat fast and then did not seem to beat at all at three oclock he got up and dressed deliberately noiselessly holly and mamzelle would be in the schoolroom and the servants asleep after their dinner he shouldnt wonder he opened his door cautiously and went downstairs in the hall the dog balthasar lay solitary and followed by him old jolyon passed into his study and out into the burning afternoon he meant to go down and meet her in the coppice but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat he sat down instead under the oak tree by the swing and the dog balthasar who also felt the heat lay down beside him he sat there smiling what a revel of bright minutes what a hum of insects and cooing of pigeons it was the quintessence of a summer day lovely and he was happyhappy as a sandboy whatever that might be she was coming she had not given him up he had everything in life he wantedexcept a little more breath and less weightjust here he would see her when she emerged from the fernery come swaying just a little a violetgrey figure passing over the daisies and dandelions and soldiers on the lawnthe soldiers with their flowery crowns he would not move but she would come up to him and say dear uncle jolyon i am sorry and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but was all right now and that dog would lick her hand that dog knew his master was fond of her that dog was a good dog  it was quite shady under the tree the sun could not get at him only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the grand stand at epsom away out there very far and the cows cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails he smelled the scent of limes and lavender ah that was why there was such a racket of bees they were excitedbusy as his heart was busy and excited drowsy too drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness as his heart was drugged and drowsy summersummerthey seemed saying great bees and little bees and the flies too  the stable clock struck four in half an hour she would be here he would have just one tiny nap because he had had so little sleep of late and then he would be fresh for her fresh for youth and beauty coming towards him across the sunlit lawnlady in grey and settling back in his chair he closed his eyes some thistledown came on what little air there was and pitched on his moustache more white than itself he did not know but his breathing stirred it caught there a ray of sunlight struck through and lodged on his boot a bumblebee alighted and strolled on the crown of his panama hat and the delicious surge of slumber reached the brain beneath that hat and the head swayed forward and rested on his breast summersummer so went the hum  the stable clock struck the quarter past the dog balthasar stretched and looked up at his master the thistledown no longer moved the dog placed his chin over the sunlit foot it did not stir the dog withdrew his chin quickly rose and leaped on old jolyons lap looked in his face whined then leaping down sat on his haunches gazing up and suddenly he uttered a long long howl  but the thistledown was still as death and the face of his old master  summersummersummer the soundless footsteps on the grass  1917
