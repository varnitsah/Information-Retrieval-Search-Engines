realism    my first book  treasure island    the genesis of the master of ballantrae    preface to the master of ballantrae    on some technical elements of style in literature 1    there is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art  all our arts and occupations lie wholly on the surface it is on the surface that we perceive their beauty fitness and significance and to pry below is to be appalled by their emptiness and shocked by the coarseness of the strings and pulleys  in a similar way psychology itself when pushed to any nicety discovers an abhorrent baldness but rather from the fault of our analysis than from any poverty native to the mind  and perhaps in aesthetics the reason is the same  those disclosures which seem fatal to the dignity of art seem so perhaps only in the proportion of our ignorance and those conscious and unconscious artifices which it seems unworthy of the serious artist to employ were yet if we had the power to trace them to their springs indications of a delicacy of the sense finer than we conceive and hints of ancient harmonies in nature  this ignorance at least is largely irremediable  we shall never learn the affinities of beauty for they lie too deep in nature and too far back in the mysterious history of man  the amateur in consequence will always grudgingly receive details of method which can be stated but never can wholly be explained nay on the principle laid down in hudibras that   still the less they understand the more they admire the sleightofhand   many are conscious at each new disclosure of a diminution in the ardour of their pleasure  i must therefore warn that wellknown character the general reader that i am here embarked upon a most distasteful business  taking down the picture from the wall and looking on the back and like the inquiring child pulling the musical cart to pieces  1  choice of wordsthe art of literature stands apart from among its sisters because the material in which the literary artist works is the dialect of life hence on the one hand a strange freshness and immediacy of address to the public mind which is ready prepared to understand it but hence on the other a singular limitation  the sister arts enjoy the use of a plastic and ductile material like the modellers clay literature alone is condemned to work in mosaic with finite and quite rigid words  you have seen these blocks dear to the nursery  this one a pillar that a pediment a third a window or a vase  it is with blocks of just such arbitrary size and figure that the literary architect is condemned to design the palace of his art  nor is this all for since these blocks or words are the acknowledged currency of our daily affairs there are here possible none of those suppressions by which other arts obtain relief continuity and vigour  no hieroglyphic touch no smoothed impasto no inscrutable shadow as in painting no blank wall as in architecture but every word phrase sentence and paragraph must move in a logical progression and convey a definite conventional import  now the first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed  it is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions restore to them their primal energy wittily shift them to another issue or make of them a drum to rouse the passions  but though this form of merit is without doubt the most sensible and seizing it is far from being equally present in all writers  the effect of words in shakespeare their singular justice significance and poetic charm is different indeed from the effect of words in addison or fielding  or to take an example nearer home the words in carlyle seem electrified into an energy of lineament like the faces of men furiously moved whilst the words in macaulay apt enough to convey his meaning harmonious enough in sound yet glide from the memory like undistinguished elements in a general effect  but the first class of writers have no monopoly of literary merit  there is a sense in which addison is superior to carlyle a sense in which cicero is better than tacitus in which voltaire excels montaigne  it certainly lies not in the choice of words it lies not in the interest or value of the matter it lies not in force of intellect of poetry or of humour the three first are but infants to the three second and yet each in a particular point of literary art excels his superior in the whole  what is that point  2  the webliterature although it stands apart by reason of the great destiny and general use of its medium in the affairs of men is yet an art like other arts  of these we may distinguish two great classes  those arts like sculpture painting acting which are representative or as used to be said very clumsily imitative and those like architecture music and the dance which are selfsufficient and merely presentative  each class in right of this distinction obeys principles apart yet both may claim a common ground of existence and it may be said with sufficient justice that the motive and end of any art whatever is to make a pattern a pattern it may be of colours of sounds of changing attitudes geometrical figures or imitative lines but still a pattern  that is the plane on which these sisters meet it is by this that they are arts and if it be well they should at times forget their childish origin addressing their intelligence to virile tasks and performing unconsciously that necessary function of their life to make a pattern it is still imperative that the pattern shall be made  music and literature the two temporal arts contrive their pattern of sounds in time or in other words of sounds and pauses communication may be made in broken words the business of life be carried on with substantives alone but that is not what we call literature and the true business of the literary artist is to plait or weave his meaning involving it around itself so that each sentence by successive phrases shall first come into a kind of knot and then after a moment of suspended meaning solve and clear itself  in every properly constructed sentence there should be observed this knot or hitch so that however delicately we are led to foresee to expect and then to welcome the successive phrases  the pleasure may be heightened by an element of surprise as very grossly in the common figure of the antithesis or with much greater subtlety where an antithesis is first suggested and then deftly evaded  each phrase besides is to be comely in itself and between the implication and the evolution of the sentence there should be a satisfying equipoise of sound for nothing more often disappoints the ear than a sentence solemnly and sonorously prepared and hastily and weakly finished  nor should the balance be too striking and exact for the one rule is to be infinitely various to interest to disappoint to surprise and yet still to gratify to be ever changing as it were the stitch and yet still to give the effect of an ingenious neatness  the conjurer juggles with two oranges and our pleasure in beholding him springs from this that neither is for an instant overlooked or sacrificed  so with the writer  his pattern which is to please the supersensual ear is yet addressed throughout and first of all to the demands of logic  whatever be the obscurities whatever the intricacies of the argument the neatness of the fabric must not suffer or the artist has been proved unequal to his design  and on the other hand no form of words must be selected no knot must be tied among the phrases unless knot and word be precisely what is wanted to forward and illuminate the argument for to fail in this is to swindle in the game  the genius of prose rejects the cheville no less emphatically than the laws of verse and the cheville i should perhaps explain to some of my readers is any meaningless or very watered phrase employed to strike a balance in the sound  pattern and argument live in each other and it is by the brevity clearness charm or emphasis of the second that we judge the strength and fitness of the first  style is synthetic and the artist seeking so to speak a peg to plait about takes up at once two or more elements or two or more views of the subject in hand combines implicates and contrasts them and while in one sense he was merely seeking an occasion for the necessary knot he will be found in the other to have greatly enriched the meaning or to have transacted the work of two sentences in the space of one  in the change from the successive shallow statements of the old chronicler to the dense and luminous flow of highly synthetic narrative there is implied a vast amount of both philosophy and wit  the philosophy we clearly see recognising in the synthetic writer a far more deep and stimulating view of life and a far keener sense of the generation and affinity of events  the wit we might imagine to be lost but it is not so for it is just that wit these perpetual nice contrivances these difficulties overcome this double purpose attained these two oranges kept simultaneously dancing in the air that consciously or not afford the reader his delight  nay and this wit so little recognised is the necessary organ of that philosophy which we so much admire  that style is therefore the most perfect not as fools say which is the most natural for the most natural is the disjointed babble of the chronicler but which attains the highest degree of elegant and pregnant implication unobtrusively or if obtrusively then with the greatest gain to sense and vigour even the derangement of the phrases from their socalled natural order is luminous for the mind and it is by the means of such designed reversal that the elements of a judgment may be most pertinently marshalled or the stages of a complicated action most perspicuously bound into one  the web then or the pattern  a web at once sensuous and logical an elegant and pregnant texture  that is style that is the foundation of the art of literature  books indeed continue to be read for the interest of the fact or fable in which this quality is poorly represented but still it will be there  and on the other hand how many do we continue to peruse and reperuse with pleasure whose only merit is the elegance of texture  i am tempted to mention cicero and since mr anthony trollope is dead i will it is a poor diet for the mind a very colourless and toothless criticism of life but we enjoy the pleasure of a most intricate and dexterous pattern every stitch a model at once of elegance and of good sense and the two oranges even if one of them be rotten kept dancing with inimitable grace  up to this moment i have had my eye mainly upon prose for though in verse also the implication of the logical texture is a crowning beauty yet in verse it may be dispensed with  you would think that here was a deathblow to all i have been saying and far from that it is but a new illustration of the principle involved  for if the versifier is not bound to weave a pattern of his own it is because another pattern has been formally imposed upon him by the laws of verse  for that is the essence of a prosody  verse may be rhythmical it may be merely alliterative it may like the french depend wholly on the quasi regular recurrence of the rhyme or like the hebrew it may consist in the strangely fanciful device of repeating the same idea  it does not matter on what principle the law is based so it be a law  it may be pure convention it may have no inherent beauty all that we have a right to ask of any prosody is that it shall lay down a pattern for the writer and that what it lays down shall be neither too easy nor too hard hence it comes that it is much easier for men of equal facility to write fairly pleasing verse than reasonably interesting prose for in prose the pattern itself has to be invented and the difficulties first created before they can be solved  hence again there follows the peculiar greatness of the true versifier such as shakespeare milton and victor hugo whom i place beside them as versifier merely not as poet  these not only knit and knot the logical texture of the style with all the dexterity and strength of prose they not only fill up the pattern of the verse with infinite variety and sober wit but they give us besides a rare and special pleasure by the art comparable to that of counterpoint with which they follow at the same time and now contrast and now combine the double pattern of the texture and the verse  here the sounding line concludes a little further on the wellknit sentence and yet a little further and both will reach their solution on the same ringing syllable  the best that can be offered by the best writer of prose is to show us the development of the idea and the stylistic pattern proceed hand in hand sometimes by an obvious and triumphant effort sometimes with a great air of ease and nature  the writer of verse by virtue of conquering another difficulty delights us with a new series of triumphs  he follows three purposes where his rival followed only two and the change is of precisely the same nature as that from melody to harmony  or if you prefer to return to the juggler behold him now to the vastly increased enthusiasm of the spectators juggling with three oranges instead of two  thus it is  added difficulty added beauty and the pattern with every fresh element becoming more interesting in itself  yet it must not be thought that verse is simply an addition something is lost as well as something gained and there remains plainly traceable in comparing the best prose with the best verse a certain broad distinction of method in the web  tight as the versifier may draw the knot of logic yet for the ear he still leaves the tissue of the sentence floating somewhat loose  in prose the sentence turns upon a pivot nicely balanced and fits into itself with an obtrusive neatness like a puzzle  the ear remarks and is singly gratified by this return and balance while in verse it is all diverted to the measure  to find comparable passages is hard for either the versifier is hugely the superior of the rival or if he be not and still persist in his more delicate enterprise he fails to be as widely his inferior  but let us select them from the pages of the same writer one who was ambidexter let us take for instance rumours prologue to the second part of henry iv a fine flourish of eloquence in shakespeares second manner and set it side by side with falstaffs praise of sherris act iv scene iii or let us compare the beautiful prose spoken throughout by rosalind and orlando compare for example the first speech of all orlandos speech to adam with what passage it shall please you to selectthe seven ages from the same play or even such a stave of nobility as othellos farewell to war and still you will be able to perceive if you have an ear for that class of music a certain superior degree of organisation in the prose a compacter fitting of the parts a balance in the swing and the return as of a throbbing pendulum  we must not in things temporal take from those who have little the little that they have the merits of prose are inferior but they are not the same it is a little kingdom but an independent  3  rhythm of the phrasesome way back i used a word which still awaits an application  each phrase i said was to be comely but what is a comely phrase  in all ideal and material points literature being a representative art must look for analogies to painting and the like but in what is technical and executive being a temporal art it must seek for them in music  each phrase of each sentence like an air or a recitative in music should be so artfully compounded out of long and short out of accented and unaccented as to gratify the sensual ear  and of this the ear is the sole judge  it is impossible to lay down laws  even in our accentual and rhythmic language no analysis can find the secret of the beauty of a verse how much less then of those phrases such as prose is built of which obey no law but to be lawless and yet to please  the little that we know of verse and for my part i owe it all to my friend professor fleeming jenkin is however particularly interesting in the present connection  we have been accustomed to describe the heroic line as five iambic feet and to be filled with pain and confusion whenever as by the conscientious schoolboy we have heard our own description put in practice  all night  the dread  less an  gel un  pursued 2  goes the schoolboy but though we close our ears we cling to our definition in spite of its proved and naked insufficiency  mr jenkin was not so easily pleased and readily discovered that the heroic line consists of four groups or if you prefer the phrase contains four pauses   all night  the dreadless  angel  unpursued   four groups each practically uttered as one word  the first in this case an iamb the second an amphibrachys the third a trochee and the fourth an amphimacer and yet our schoolboy with no other liberty but that of inflicting pain had triumphantly scanned it as five iambs  perceive now this fresh richness of intricacy in the web this fourth orange hitherto unremarked but still kept flying with the others  what had seemed to be one thing it now appears is two and like some puzzle in arithmetic the verse is made at the same time to read in fives and to read in fours  but again four is not necessary  we do not indeed find verses in six groups because there is not room for six in the ten syllables and we do not find verses of two because one of the main distinctions of verse from prose resides in the comparative shortness of the group but it is even common to find verses of three  five is the one forbidden number because five is the number of the feet and if five were chosen the two patterns would coincide and that opposition which is the life of verse would instantly be lost  we have here a clue to the effect of polysyllables above all in latin where they are so common and make so brave an architecture in the verse for the polysyllable is a group of natures making  if but some roman would return from hades martial for choice and tell me by what conduct of the voice these thundering verses should be utteredaut lacedoe monium tarentum for a case in pointi feel as if i should enter at last into the full enjoyment of the best of human verses  but again the five feet are all iambic or supposed to be by the mere count of syllables the four groups cannot be all iambic as a question of elegance i doubt if any one of them requires to be so and i am certain that for choice no two of them should scan the same  the singular beauty of the verse analysed above is due so far as analysis can carry us part indeed to the clever repetition of l d and n but part to this variety of scansion in the groups  the groups which like the bar in music break up the verse for utterance fall uniambically and in declaiming a so called iambic verse it may so happen that we never utter one iambic foot  and yet to this neglect of the original beat there is a limit   athens the eye of greece mother of arts 3   is with all its eccentricities a good heroic line for though it scarcely can be said to indicate the beat of the iamb it certainly suggests no other measure to the ear  but begin   mother athens eye of greece   or merely mother athens and the game is up for the trochaic beat has been suggested  the eccentric scansion of the groups is an adornment but as soon as the original beat has been forgotten they cease implicitly to be eccentric  variety is what is sought but if we destroy the original mould one of the terms of this variety is lost and we fall back on sameness  thus both as to the arithmetical measure of the verse and the degree of regularity in scansion we see the laws of prosody to have one common purpose to keep alive the opposition of two schemes simultaneously followed to keep them notably apart though still coincident and to balance them with such judicial nicety before the reader that neither shall be unperceived and neither signally prevail  the rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate  here too we write in groups or phrases as i prefer to call them for the prose phrase is greatly longer and is much more nonchalantly uttered than the group in verse so that not only is there a greater interval of continuous sound between the pauses but for that very reason word is linked more readily to word by a more summary enunciation  still the phrase is the strict analogue of the group and successive phrases like successive groups must differ openly in length and rhythm  the rule of scansion in verse is to suggest no measure but the one in hand in prose to suggest no measure at all  prose must be rhythmical and it may be as much so as you will but it must not be metrical  it may be anything but it must not be verse  a single heroic line may very well pass and not disturb the somewhat larger stride of the prose style but one following another will produce an instant impression of poverty flatness and disenchantment  the same lines delivered with the measured utterance of verse would perhaps seem rich in variety  by the more summary enunciation proper to prose as to a more distant vision these niceties of difference are lost  a whole verse is uttered as one phrase and the ear is soon wearied by a succession of groups identical in length  the prose writer in fact since he is allowed to be so much less harmonious is condemned to a perpetually fresh variety of movement on a larger scale and must never disappoint the ear by the trot of an accepted metre  and this obligation is the third orange with which he has to juggle the third quality which the prose writer must work into his pattern of words  it may be thought perhaps that this is a quality of ease rather than a fresh difficulty but such is the inherently rhythmical strain of the english language that the bad writerand must i take for example that admired friend of my boyhood captain reidthe inexperienced writer as dickens in his earlier attempts to be impressive and the jaded writer as any one may see for himself all tend to fall at once into the production of bad blank verse  and here it may be pertinently asked why bad and i suppose it might be enough to answer that no man ever made good verse by accident and that no verse can ever sound otherwise than trivial when uttered with the delivery of prose  but we can go beyond such answers  the weak side of verse is the regularity of the beat which in itself is decidedly less impressive than the movement of the nobler prose and it is just into this weak side and this alone that our careless writer falls  a peculiar density and mass consequent on the nearness of the pauses is one of the chief good qualities of verse but this our accidental versifier still following after the swift gait and large gestures of prose does not so much as aspire to imitate  lastly since he remains unconscious that he is making verse at all it can never occur to him to extract those effects of counterpoint and opposition which i have referred to as the final grace and justification of verse and i may add of blank verse in particular  4  contents of the phrasehere is a great deal of talk about rhythmand naturally for in our canorous language rhythm is always at the door  but it must not be forgotten that in some languages this element is almost if not quite extinct and that in our own it is probably decaying  the even speech of many educated americans sounds the note of danger  i should see it go with something as bitter as despair but i should not be desperate as in verse no element not even rhythm is necessary so in prose also other sorts of beauty will arise and take the place and play the part of those that we outlive  the beauty of the expected beat in verse the beauty in prose of its larger and more lawless melody patent as they are to english hearing are already silent in the ears of our next neighbours for in france the oratorical accent and the pattern of the web have almost or altogether succeeded to their places and the french prose writer would be astounded at the labours of his brother across the channel and how a good quarter of his toil above all invita minerva is to avoid writing verse  so wonderfully far apart have races wandered in spirit and so hard it is to understand the literature next door  yet french prose is distinctly better than english and french verse above all while hugo lives it will not do to place upon one side  what is more to our purpose a phrase or a verse in french is easily distinguishable as comely or uncomely  there is then another element of comeliness hitherto overlooked in this analysis the contents of the phrase  each phrase in literature is built of sounds as each phrase in music consists of notes  one sound suggests echoes demands and harmonises with another and the art of rightly using these concordances is the final art in literature it used to be a piece of good advice to all young writers to avoid alliteration and the advice was sound in so far as it prevented daubing  none the less for that was it abominable nonsense and the mere raving of those blindest of the blind who will not see the beauty of the contents of a phrase or of a sentence depends implicitly upon alliteration and upon assonance  the vowel demands to be repeated the consonant demands to be repeated and both cry aloud to be perpetually varied  you may follow the adventures of a letter through any passage that has particularly pleased you find it perhaps denied a while to tantalise the ear find it fired again at you in a whole broadside or find it pass into congenerous sounds one liquid or labial melting away into another  and you will find another and much stranger circumstance  literature is written by and for two senses  a sort of internal ear quick to perceive unheard melodies and the eye which directs the pen and deciphers the printed phrase  well even as there are rhymes for the eye so you will find that there are assonances and alliterations that where an author is running the open a deceived by the eye and our strange english spelling he will often show a tenderness for the flat a and that where he is running a particular consonant he will not improbably rejoice to write it down even when it is mute or bears a different value  here then we have a fresh patterna pattern to speak grossly of letterswhich makes the fourth preoccupation of the prose writer and the fifth of the versifier  at times it is very delicate and hard to perceive and then perhaps most excellent and winning i say perhaps but at times again the elements of this literal melody stand more boldly forward and usurp the ear  it becomes therefore somewhat a matter of conscience to select examples and as i cannot very well ask the reader to help me i shall do the next best by giving him the reason or the history of each selection  the two first one in prose one in verse i chose without previous analysis simply as engaging passages that had long reechoed in my ear  i cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and unbreathed that never sallies out and sees her adversary but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for not without dust and heat 4  down to virtue the current s and r are both announced and repeated unobtrusively and by way of a gracenote that almost inseparable group pvf is given entire 5  the next phrase is a period of repose almost ugly in itself both s and r still audible and b given as the last fulfilment of pvf  in the next four phrases from that never down to run for the mask is thrown off and but for a slight repetition of the f and v the whole matter turns almost too obtrusively on s and r first s coming to the front and then r  in the concluding phrase all these favourite letters and even the flat a a timid preference for which is just perceptible are discarded at a blow and in a bundle and to make the break more obvious every word ends with a dental and all but one with t for which we have been cautiously prepared since the beginning  the singular dignity of the first clause and this hammerstroke of the last go far to make the charm of this exquisite sentence  but it is fair to own that s and r are used a little coarsely   in xanady did kubla khan                 kandl a stately pleasure dome decree        kdlsr where alph the sacred river ran         kandlsr through caverns measureless to man   kanlsr down to a sunless sea 6                ndls   here i have put the analysis of the main group alongside the lines and the more it is looked at the more interesting it will seem but there are further niceties  in lines two and four the current s is most delicately varied with z  in line three the current flat a is twice varied with the open a already suggested in line two and both times where and sacred in conjunction with the current r  in the same line f and v a harmony in themselves even when shorn of their comrade p are admirably contrasted  and in line four there is a marked subsidiary m which again was announced in line two  i stop from weariness for more might yet be said  my next example was recently quoted from shakespeare as an example of the poets colour sense  now i do not think literature has anything to do with colour or poets anyway the better of such a sense and i instantly attacked this passage since purple was the word that had so pleased the writer of the article to see if there might not be some literary reason for its use  it will be seen that i succeeded amply and i am bound to say i think the passage exceptional in shakespeareexceptional indeed in literature but it was not i who chose it   the barge she sat in like a burnished throne burnt on the water  the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so pur fumed that      per the winds were lovesick with them 7   it may be asked why i have put the f of perfumed in capitals and i reply because this change from p to f is the completion of that from b to p already so adroitly carried out  indeed the whole passage is a monument of curious ingenuity and it seems scarce worth while to indicate the subsidiary s l and w  in the same article a second passage from shakespeare was quoted once again as an example of his colour sense   a mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops i the bottom of a cowslip 8   it is very curious very artificial and not worth while to analyse at length  i leave it to the reader  but before i turn my back on shakespeare i should like to quote a passage for my own pleasure and for a very model of every technical art   but in the wind and tempest of her frown w p v9 f st ow distinction with a loud and powerful fan wp f st ow l  puffing at all winnows the light away w p f l and what hath mass and matter by itself w f l m a lies rich in virtue and unmingled 10 v l m   from these delicate and choice writers i turned with some curiosity to a player of the big drummacaulay  i had in hand the two volume edition and i opened at the beginning of the second volume here was what i read  the violence of revolutions is generally proportioned to the degree of the maladministration which has produced them  it is therefore not strange that the government of scotland having been during many years greatly more corrupt than the government of england should have fallen with a far heavier ruin  the movement against the last king of the house of stuart was in england conservative in scotland destructive  the english complained not of the law but of the violation of the law  this was plainsailing enough it was our old friend pvf floated by the liquids in a body but as i read on and turned the page and still found pvf with his attendant liquids i confess my mind misgave me utterly  this could be no trick of macaulays it must be the nature of the english tongue  in a kind of despair i turned halfway through the volume and coming upon his lordship dealing with general cannon and fresh from claverhouse and killiecrankie here with elucidative spelling was my reward  meanwhile the disorders of kannons kamp went on inkreasing  he kalled a kouncil of war to konsider what kourse it would be advisable to take  but as soon as the kouncil had met a preliminary kuestion was raised  the army was almost eksklusively a highland army  the recent vkktory had been won eksklusively by highland warriors  great chiefs who had brought siks or seven hundred fighting men into the field did not think it fair that they should be outvoted by gentlemen from ireland and from the low kountries who bore indeed king jamess kommission and were kalled kolonels and kaptains but who were kolonels without regiments and kaptains without kompanies  a moment of fv in all this world of ks  it was not the english language then that was an instrument of one string but macaulay that was an incomparable dauber  it was probably from this barbaric love of repeating the same sound rather than from any design of clearness that he acquired his irritating habit of repeating words i say the one rather than the other because such a trick of the ear is deeperseated and more original in man than any logical consideration  few writers indeed are probably conscious of the length to which they push this melody of letters  one writing very diligently and only concerned about the meaning of his words and the rhythm of his phrases was struck into amazement by the eager triumph with which he cancelled one expression to substitute another  neither changed the sense both being monosyllables neither could affect the scansion and it was only by looking back on what he had already written that the mystery was solved  the second word contained an open a and for nearly half a page he had been riding that vowel to the death  in practice i should add the ear is not always so exacting and ordinary writers in ordinary moments content themselves with avoiding what is harsh and here and there upon a rare occasion buttressing a phrase or linking two together with a patch of assonance or a momentary jingle of alliteration  to understand how constant is this preoccupation of good writers even where its results are least obtrusive it is only necessary to turn to the bad  there indeed you will find cacophony supreme the rattle of incongruous consonants only relieved by the jawbreaking hiatus and whole phrases not to be articulated by the powers of man  conclusionwe may now briefly enumerate the elements of style we have peculiar to the prose writer the task of keeping his phrases large rhythmical and pleasing to the ear without ever allowing them to fall into the strictly metrical  peculiar to the versifier the task of combining and contrasting his double treble and quadruple pattern feet and groups logic and metre harmonious in diversity  common to both the task of artfully combining the prime elements of language into phrases that shall be musical in the mouth the task of weaving their argument into a texture of committed phrases and of rounded periodsbut this particularly binding in the case of prose  and again common to both the task of choosing apt explicit and communicative words we begin to see now what an intricate affair is any perfect passage how many faculties whether of taste or pure reason must be held upon the stretch to make it and why when it is made it should afford us so complete a pleasure  from the arrangement of according letters which is altogether arabesque and sensual up to the architecture of the elegant and pregnant sentence which is a vigorous act of the pure intellect there is scarce a faculty in man but has been exercised  we need not wonder then if perfect sentences are rare and perfect pages rarer    the morality of the profession of letters 11    the profession of letters has been lately debated in the public prints and it has been debated to put the matter mildly from a point of view that was calculated to surprise highminded men and bring a general contempt on books and reading  some time ago in particular a lively pleasant popular writer 12 devoted an essay lively and pleasant like himself to a very encouraging view of the profession  we may be glad that his experience is so cheering and we may hope that all others who deserve it shall be as handsomely rewarded but i do not think we need be at all glad to have this question so important to the public and ourselves debated solely on the ground of money  the salary in any business under heaven is not the only nor indeed the first question  that you should continue to exist is a matter for your own consideration but that your business should be first honest and second useful are points in which honour and morality are concerned  if the writer to whom i refer succeeds in persuading a number of young persons to adopt this way of life with an eye set singly on the livelihood we must expect them in their works to follow profit only and we must expect in consequence if he will pardon me the epithets a slovenly base untrue and empty literature  of that writer himself i am not speaking  he is diligent clean and pleasing we all owe him periods of entertainment and he has achieved an amiable popularity which he has adequately deserved  but the truth is he does not or did not when he first embraced it regard his profession from this purely mercenary side  he went into it i shall venture to say if not with any noble design at least in the ardour of a first love and he enjoyed its practice long before he paused to calculate the wage  the other day an author was complimented on a piece of work good in itself and exceptionally good for him and replied in terms unworthy of a commercial traveller that as the book was not briskly selling he did not give a copper farthing for its merit it must not be supposed that the person to whom this answer was addressed received it as a profession of faith he knew on the other hand that it was only a whiff of irritation just as we know when a respectable writer talks of literature as a way of life like shoemaking but not so useful that he is only debating one aspect of a question and is still clearly conscious of a dozen others more important in themselves and more central to the matter in hand  but while those who treat literature in this pennywise and virtuefoolish spirit are themselves truly in possession of a better light it does not follow that the treatment is decent or improving whether for themselves or others  to treat all subjects in the highest the most honourable and the pluckiest spirit consistent with the fact is the first duty of a writer  if he be well paid as i am glad to hear he is this duty becomes the more urgent the neglect of it the more disgraceful  and perhaps there is no subject on which a man should speak so gravely as that industry whatever it may be which is the occupation or delight of his life which is his tool to earn or serve with and which if it be unworthy stamps himself as a mere incubus of dumb and greedy bowels on the shoulders of labouring humanity  on that subject alone even to force the note might lean to virtues side  it is to be hoped that a numerous and enterprising generation of writers will follow and surpass the present one but it would be better if the stream were stayed and the roll of our old honest english books were closed than that esurient bookmakers should continue and debase a brave tradition and lower in their own eyes a famous race  better that our serene temples were deserted than filled with trafficking and juggling priests  there are two just reasons for the choice of any way of life  the first is inbred taste in the chooser the second some high utility in the industry selected  literature like any other art is singularly interesting to the artist and in a degree peculiar to itself among the arts it is useful to mankind  these are the sufficient justifications for any young man or woman who adopts it as the business of his life  i shall not say much about the wages a writer can live by his writing  if not so luxuriously as by other trades then less luxuriously  the nature of the work he does all day will more affect his happiness than the quality of his dinner at night  whatever be your calling and however much it brings you in the year you could still you know get more by cheating  we all suffer ourselves to be too much concerned about a little poverty but such considerations should not move us in the choice of that which is to be the business and justification of so great a portion of our lives and like the missionary the patriot or the philosopher we should all choose that poor and brave career in which we can do the most and best for mankind  now nature faithfully followed proves herself a careful mother  a lad for some liking to the jingle of words betakes himself to letters for his life byandby when he learns more gravity he finds that he has chosen better than he knew that if he earns little he is earning it amply that if he receives a small wage he is in a position to do considerable services that it is in his power in some small measure to protect the oppressed and to defend the truth  so kindly is the world arranged such great profit may arise from a small degree of human reliance on oneself and such in particular is the happy star of this trade of writing that it should combine pleasure and profit to both parties and be at once agreeable like fiddling and useful like good preaching  this is to speak of literature at its highest and with the four great elders who are still spared to our respect and admiration with carlyle ruskin browning and tennyson before us it would be cowardly to consider it at first in any lesser aspect  but while we cannot follow these athletes while we may none of us perhaps be very vigorous very original or very wise i still contend that in the humblest sort of literary work we have it in our power either to do great harm or great good  we may seek merely to please we may seek having no higher gift merely to gratify the idle nine days curiosity of our contemporaries or we may essay however feebly to instruct  in each of these we shall have to deal with that remarkable art of words which because it is the dialect of life comes home so easily and powerfully to the minds of men and since that is so we contribute in each of these branches to build up the sum of sentiments and appreciations which goes by the name of public opinion or public feeling  the total of a nations reading in these days of daily papers greatly modifies the total of the nations speech and the speech and reading taken together form the efficient educational medium of youth  a good man or woman may keep a youth some little while in clearer air but the contemporary atmosphere is allpowerful in the end on the average of mediocre characters  the copious corinthian baseness of the american reporter or the parisian chroniquear both so lightly readable must exercise an incalculable influence for ill they touch upon all subjects and on all with the same ungenerous hand they begin the consideration of all in young and unprepared minds in an unworthy spirit on all they supply some pungency for dull people to quote  the mere body of this ugly matter overwhelms the rare utterances of good men the sneering the selfish and the cowardly are scattered in broad sheets on every table while the antidote in small volumes lies unread upon the shelf  i have spoken of the american and the french not because they are so much baser but so much more readable than the english their evil is done more effectively in america for the masses in french for the few that care to read but with us as with them the duties of literature are daily neglected truth daily perverted and suppressed and grave subjects daily degraded in the treatment the journalist is not reckoned an important officer yet judge of the good he might do the harm he does judge of it by one instance only  that when we find two journals on the reverse sides of politics each on the same day openly garbling a piece of news for the interest of its own party we smile at the discovery no discovery now as over a good joke and pardonable stratagem lying so open is scarce lying it is true but one of the things that we profess to teach our young is a respect for truth and i cannot think this piece of education will be crowned with any great success so long as some of us practise and the rest openly approve of public falsehood  there are two duties incumbent upon any man who enters on the business of writing  truth to the fact and a good spirit in the treatment  in every department of literature though so low as hardly to deserve the name truth to the fact is of importance to the education and comfort of mankind and so hard to preserve that the faithful trying to do so will lend some dignity to the man who tries it  our judgments are based upon two things  first upon the original preferences of our soul but second upon the mass of testimony to the nature of god man and the universe which reaches us in divers manners from without  for the most part these divers manners are reducible to one all that we learn of past times and much that we learn of our own reaching us through the medium of books or papers and even he who cannot read learning from the same source at secondhand and by the report of him who can  thus the sum of the contemporary knowledge or ignorance of good and evil is in large measure the handiwork of those who write  those who write have to see that each mans knowledge is as near as they can make it answerable to the facts of life that he shall not suppose himself an angel or a monster nor take this world for a hell nor be suffered to imagine that all rights are concentred in his own caste or country or all veracities in his own parochial creed  each man should learn what is within him that he may strive to mend he must be taught what is without him that he may be kind to others  it can never be wrong to tell him the truth for in his disputable state weaving as he goes his theory of life steering himself cheering or reproving others all facts are of the first importance to his conduct and even if a fact shall discourage or corrupt him it is still best that he should know it for it is in this world as it is and not in a world made easy by educational suppressions that he must win his way to shame or glory  in one word it must always be foul to tell what is false and it can never be safe to suppress what is true the very fact that you omit may be the fact which somebody was wanting for one mans meat is another mans poison and i have known a person who was cheered by the perusal of candide  every fact is a part of that great puzzle we must set together and none that comes directly in a writers path but has some nice relations unperceivable by him to the totality and bearing of the subject under hand  yet there are certain classes of fact eternally more necessary than others and it is with these that literature must first bestir itself  they are not hard to distinguish nature once more easily leading us for the necessary because the efficacious facts are those which are most interesting to the natural mind of man  those which are coloured picturesque human and rooted in morality and those on the other hand which are clear indisputable and a part of science are alone vital in importance seizing by their interest or useful to communicate  so far as the writer merely narrates he should principally tell of these  he should tell of the kind and wholesome and beautiful elements of our life he should tell unsparingly of the evil and sorrow of the present to move us with instances  he should tell of wise and good people in the past to excite us by example and of these he should tell soberly and truthfully not glossing faults that we may neither grow discouraged with ourselves nor exacting to our neighbours  so the body of contemporary literature ephemeral and feeble in itself touches in the minds of men the springs of thought and kindness and supports them for those who will go at all are easily supported on their way to what is true and right and if in any degree it does so now how much more might it do so if the writers chose  there is not a life in all the records of the past but properly studied might lend a hint and a help to some contemporary  there is not a juncture in todays affairs but some useful word may yet be said of it  even the reporter has an office and with clear eyes and honest language may unveil injustices and point the way to progress  and for a last word  in all narration there is only one way to be clever and that is to be exact  to be vivid is a secondary quality which must presuppose the first for vividly to convey a wrong impression is only to make failure conspicuous  but a fact may be viewed on many sides it may be chronicled with rage tears laughter indifference or admiration and by each of these the story will be transformed to something else  the newspapers that told of the return of our representatives from berlin even if they had not differed as to the facts would have sufficiently differed by their spirits so that the one description would have been a second ovation and the other a prolonged insult the subject makes but a trifling part of any piece of literature and the view of the writer is itself a fact more important because less disputable than the others  now this spirit in which a subject is regarded important in all kinds of literary work becomes allimportant in works of fiction meditation or rhapsody for there it not only colours but itself chooses the facts not only modifies but shapes the work  and hence over the far larger proportion of the field of literature the health or disease of the writers mind or momentary humour forms not only the leading feature of his work but is at bottom the only thing he can communicate to others  in all works of art widely speaking it is first of all the authors attitude that is narrated though in the attitude there be implied a whole experience and a theory of life an author who has begged the question and reposes in some narrow faith cannot if he would express the whole or even many of the sides of this various existence for his own life being maim some of them are not admitted in his theory and were only dimly and unwillingly recognised in his experience  hence the smallness the triteness and the inhumanity in works of merely sectarian religion and hence we find equal although unsimilar limitation in works inspired by the spirit of the flesh or the despicable taste for high society  so that the first duty of any man who is to write is intellectual  designedly or not he has so far set himself up for a leader of the minds of men and he must see that his own mind is kept supple charitable and bright  everything but prejudice should find a voice through him he should see the good in all things where he has even a fear that he does not wholly understand there he should be wholly silent and he should recognise from the first that he has only one tool in his workshop and that tool is sympathy  13  the second duty far harder to define is moral  there are a thousand different humours in the mind and about each of them when it is uppermost some literature tends to be deposited  is this to be allowed  not certainly in every case and yet perhaps in more than rigourists would fancy  it were to be desired that all literary work and chiefly works of art issued from sound human healthy and potent impulses whether grave or laughing humorous romantic or religious  yet it cannot be denied that some valuable books are partially insane some mostly religious partially inhuman and very many tainted with morbidity and impotence  we do not loathe a masterpiece although we gird against its blemishes  we are not above all to look for faults but merits  there is no book perfect even in design but there are many that will delight improve or encourage the reader  on the one hand the hebrew psalms are the only religious poetry on earth yet they contain sallies that savour rankly of the man of blood  on the other hand alfred de musset had a poisoned and a contorted nature i am only quoting that generous and frivolous giant old dumas when i accuse him of a bad heart yet when the impulse under which he wrote was purely creative he could give us works like carmosine or fantasio in which the last note of the romantic comedy seems to have been found again to touch and please us  when flaubert wrote madame bovary i believe he thought chiefly of a somewhat morbid realism and behold the book turned in his hands into a masterpiece of appalling morality  but the truth is when books are conceived under a great stress with a soul of ninefold power nine times heated and electrified by effort the conditions of our being are seized with such an ample grasp that even should the main design be trivial or base some truth and beauty cannot fail to be expressed  out of the strong comes forth sweetness but an ill thing poorly done is an ill thing top and bottom  and so this can be no encouragement to knockkneed feeblewristed scribes who must take their business conscientiously or be ashamed to practise it  man is imperfect yet in his literature he must express himself and his own views and preferences for to do anything else is to do a far more perilous thing than to risk being immoral  it is to be sure of being untrue  to ape a sentiment even a good one is to travesty a sentiment that will not be helpful  to conceal a sentiment if you are sure you hold it is to take a liberty with truth  there is probably no point of view possible to a sane man but contains some truth and in the true connection might be profitable to the race  i am not afraid of the truth if any one could tell it me but i am afraid of parts of it impertinently uttered  there is a time to dance and a time to mourn to be harsh as well as to be sentimental to be ascetic as well as to glorify the appetites and if a man were to combine all these extremes into his work each in its place and proportion that work would be the worlds masterpiece of morality as well as of art  partiality is immorality for any book is wrong that gives a misleading picture of the world and life  the trouble is that the weakling must be partial the work of one proving dank and depressing of another cheap and vulgar of a third epileptically sensual of a fourth sourly ascetic  in literature as in conduct you can never hope to do exactly right  all you can do is to make as sure as possible and for that there is but one rule  nothing should be done in a hurry that can be done slowly  it is no use to write a book and put it by for nine or even ninety years for in the writing you will have partly convinced yourself the delay must precede any beginning and if you meditate a work of art you should first long roll the subject under the tongue to make sure you like the flavour before you brew a volume that shall taste of it from end to end or if you propose to enter on the field of controversy you should first have thought upon the question under all conditions in health as well as in sickness in sorrow as well as in joy  it is this nearness of examination necessary for any true and kind writing that makes the practice of the art a prolonged and noble education for the writer  there is plenty to do plenty to say or to say over again in the meantime  any literary work which conveys faithful facts or pleasing impressions is a service to the public  it is even a service to be thankfully proud of having rendered  the slightest novels are a blessing to those in distress not chloroform itself a greater  our fine old seacaptains life was justified when carlyle soothed his mind with the kings own or newton forster  to please is to serve and so far from its being difficult to instruct while you amuse it is difficult to do the one thoroughly without the other  some part of the writer or his life will crop out in even a vapid book and to read a novel that was conceived with any force is to multiply experience and to exercise the sympathies  every article every piece of verse every essay every entre filet is destined to pass however swiftly through the minds of some portion of the public and to colour however transiently their thoughts  when any subject falls to be discussed some scribbler on a paper has the invaluable opportunity of beginning its discussion in a dignified and human spirit and if there were enough who did so in our public press neither the public nor the parliament would find it in their minds to drop to meaner thoughts the writer has the chance to stumble by the way on something pleasing something interesting something encouraging were it only to a single reader  he will be unfortunate indeed if he suit no one  he has the chance besides to stumble on something that a dull person shall be able to comprehend and for a dull person to have read anything and for that once comprehended it makes a marking epoch in his education  here then is work worth doing and worth trying to do well  and so if i were minded to welcome any great accession to our trade it should not be from any reason of a higher wage but because it was a trade which was useful in a very great and in a very high degree which every honest tradesman could make more serviceable to mankind in his single strength which was difficult to do well and possible to do better every year which called for scrupulous thought on the part of all who practised it and hence became a perpetual education to their nobler natures and which pay it as you please in the large majority of the best cases will still be underpaid  for surely at this time of day in the nineteenth century there is nothing that an honest man should fear more timorously than getting and spending more than he deserves    books which have influenced me 14    the editor 15 has somewhat insidiously laid a trap for his correspondents the question put appearing at first so innocent truly cutting so deep  it is not indeed until after some reconnaissance and review that the writer awakes to find himself engaged upon something in the nature of autobiography or perhaps worse upon a chapter in the life of that little beautiful brother whom we once all had and whom we have all lost and mourned the man we ought to have been the man we hoped to be  but when word has been passed even to an editor it should if possible be kept and if sometimes i am wise and say too little and sometimes weak and say too much the blame must lie at the door of the person who entrapped me  the most influential books and the truest in their influence are works of fiction  they do not pin the reader to a dogma which he must afterwards discover to be inexact they do not teach him a lesson which he must afterwards unlearn  they repeat they rearrange they clarify the lessons of life they disengage us from ourselves they constrain us to the acquaintance of others and they show us the web of experience not as we can see it for ourselves but with a singular changethat monstrous consuming ego of ours being for the nonce struck out  to be so they must be reasonably true to the human comedy and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction  but the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters  shakespeare has served me best  few living friends have had upon me an influence so strong for good as hamlet or rosalind  the last character already well beloved in the reading i had the good fortune to see i must think in an impressionable hour played by mrs scott siddons  nothing has ever more moved more delighted more refreshed me nor has the influence quite passed away  kents brief speech over the dying lear had a great effect upon my mind and was the burthen of my reflections for long so profoundly so touchingly generous did it appear in sense so overpowering in expression  perhaps my dearest and best friend outside of shakespeare is dartagnanthe elderly dartagnan of the vicomte de bragelonne  i know not a more human soul nor in his way a finer i shall be very sorry for the man who is so much of a pedant in morals that he cannot learn from the captain of musketeers  lastly i must name the pilgrims progress a book that breathes of every beautiful and valuable emotion  but of works of art little can be said their influence is profound and silent like the influence of nature they mould by contact we drink them up like water and are bettered yet know not how  it is in books more specifically didactic that we can follow out the effect and distinguish and weigh and compare  a book which has been very influential upon me fell early into my hands and so may stand first though i think its influence was only sensible later on and perhaps still keeps growing for it is a book not easily outlived  the essais of montaigne  that temperate and genial picture of life is a great gift to place in the hands of persons of today they will find in these smiling pages a magazine of heroism and wisdom all of an antique strain they will have their linen decencies and excited orthodoxies fluttered and will if they have any gift of reading perceive that these have not been fluttered without some excuse and ground of reason and again if they have any gift of reading they will end by seeing that this old gentleman was in a dozen ways a finer fellow and held in a dozen ways a nobler view of life than they or their contemporaries  the next book in order of time to influence me was the new testament and in particular the gospel according to st matthew i believe it would startle and move any one if they could make a certain effort of imagination and read it freshly like a book not droningly and dully like a portion of the bible  any one would then be able to see in it those truths which we are all courteously supposed to know and all modestly refrain from applying  but upon this subject it is perhaps better to be silent  i come next to whitmans leaves of grass a book of singular service a book which tumbled the world upside down for me blew into space a thousand cobwebs of genteel and ethical illusion and having thus shaken my tabernacle of lies set me back again upon a strong foundation of all the original and manly virtues  but it is once more only a book for those who have the gift of reading i will be very franki believe it is so with all good books except perhaps fiction  the average man lives and must live so wholly in convention that gunpowder charges of the truth are more apt to discompose than to invigorate his creed  either he cries out upon blasphemy and indecency and crouches the closer round that little idol of parttruths and partconveniences which is the contemporary deity or he is convinced by what is new forgets what is old and becomes truly blasphemous and indecent himself  new truth is only useful to supplement the old rough truth is only wanted to expand not to destroy our civil and often elegant conventions  he who cannot judge had better stick to fiction and the daily papers  there he will get little harm and in the first at least some good  close upon the back of my discovery of whitman i came under the influence of herbert spencer  no more persuasive rabbi exists and few better  how much of his vast structure will bear the touch of time how much is clay and how much brass it were too curious to inquire  but his words if dry are always manly and honest there dwells in his pages a spirit of highly abstract joy plucked naked like an algebraic symbol but still joyful and the reader will find there a caput mortuum of piety with little indeed of its loveliness but with most of its essentials and these two qualities make him a wholesome as his intellectual vigour makes him a bracing writer  i should be much of a hound if i lost my gratitude to herbert spencer  goethes life by lewes had a great importance for me when it first fell into my handsa strange instance of the partiality of mans good and mans evil  i know no one whom i less admire than goethe he seems a very epitome of the sins of genius breaking open the doors of private life and wantonly wounding friends in that crowning offence of werther and in his own character a mere penandink napoleon conscious of the rights and duties of superior talents as a spanish inquisitor was conscious of the rights and duties of his office  and yet in his fine devotion to his art in his honest and serviceable friendship for schiller what lessons are contained  biography usually so false to its office does here for once perform for us some of the work of fiction reminding us that is of the truly mingled tissue of mans nature and how huge faults and shining virtues cohabit and persevere in the same character  history serves us well to this effect but in the originals not in the pages of the popular epitomiser who is bound by the very nature of his task to make us feel the difference of epochs instead of the essential identity of man and even in the originals only to those who can recognise their own human virtues and defects in strange forms often inverted and under strange names often interchanged  martial is a poet of no good repute and it gives a man new thoughts to read his works dispassionately and find in this unseemly jesters serious passages the image of a kind wise and selfrespecting gentleman it is customary i suppose in reading martial to leave out these pleasant verses i never heard of them at least until i found them for myself and this partiality is one among a thousand things that help to build up our distorted and hysterical conception of the great roman empire  this brings us by a natural transition to a very noble bookthe meditations of marcus aurelius  the dispassionate gravity the noble forgetfulness of self the tenderness of others that are there expressed and were practised on so great a scale in the life of its writer make this book a book quite by itself  no one can read it and not be moved  yet it scarcely or rarely appeals to the feelingsthose very mobile those not very trusty parts of man its address lies further back  its lesson comes more deeply home when you have read you carry away with you a memory of the man himself it is as though you had touched a loyal hand looked into brave eyes and made a noble friend there is another bond on you thenceforward binding you to life and to the love of virtue  wordsworth should perhaps come next  every one has been influenced by wordsworth and it is hard to tell precisely how  a certain innocence a rugged austerity of joy a sight of the stars the silence that is in the lonely hills something of the cold thrill of dawn cling to his work and give it a particular address to what is best in us  i do not know that you learn a lesson you need notmill did notagree with any one of his beliefs and yet the spell is cast  such are the best teachers a dogma learned is only a new errorthe old one was perhaps as good but a spirit communicated is a perpetual possession  these best teachers climb beyond teaching to the plane of art it is themselves and what is best in themselves that they communicate  i should never forgive myself if i forgot the egoist  it is art if you like but it belongs purely to didactic art and from all the novels i have read and i have read thousands stands in a place by itself  here is a nathan for the modern david here is a book to send the blood into mens faces  satire the angry picture of human faults is not great art we can all be angry with our neighbour what we want is to be shown not his defects of which we are too conscious but his merits to which we are too blind and the egoist is a satire so much must be allowed but it is a satire of a singular quality which tells you nothing of that obvious mote which is engaged from first to last with that invisible beam  it is yourself that is hunted down these are your own faults that are dragged into the day and numbered with lingering relish with cruel cunning and precision  a young friend of mr merediths as i have the story came to him in an agony this is too bad of you he cried  willoughby is me  no my dear fellow said the author he is all of us  i have read the egoist five or six times myself and i mean to read it again for i am like the young friend of the anecdotei think willoughby an unmanly but a very serviceable exposure of myself  i suppose when i am done i shall find that i have forgotten much that was most influential as i see already i have forgotten thoreau and hazlitt whose paper on the spirit of obligations was a turningpoint in my life and penn whose little book of aphorisms had a brief but strong effect on me and mitfords tales of old japan wherein i learned for the first time the proper attitude of any rational man to his countrys lawsa secret found and kept in the asiatic islands  that i should commemorate all is more than i can hope or the editor could ask  it will be more to the point after having said so much upon improving books to say a word or two about the improvable reader  the gift of reading as i have called it is not very common nor very generally understood it consists first of all in a vast intellectual endowmenta free grace i find i must call itby which a man rises to understand that he is not punctually right nor those from whom he differs absolutely wrong  he may hold dogmas he may hold them passionately and he may know that others hold them but coldly or hold them differently or hold them not at all  well if he has the gift of reading these others will be full of meat for him they will see the other side of propositions and the other side of virtues  he need not change his dogma for that but he may change his reading of that dogma and he must supplement and correct his deductions from it  a human truth which is always very much a lie hides as much of life as it displays  it is men who hold another truth or as it seems to us perhaps a dangerous lie who can extend our restricted field of knowledge and rouse our drowsy consciences  something that seems quite new or that seems insolently false or very dangerous is the test of a reader  if he tries to see what it means what truth excuses it he has the gift and let him read  if he is merely hurt or offended or exclaims upon his authors folly he had better take to the daily papers he will never be a reader  and here with the aptest illustrative force after i have laid down my parttruth i must step in with its opposite  for after all we are vessels of a very limited content  not all men can read all books it is only in a chosen few that any man will find his appointed food and the fittest lessons are the most palatable and make themselves welcome to the mind  a writer learns this early and it is his chief support he goes on unafraid laying down the law and he is sure at heart that most of what he says is demonstrably false and much of a mingled strain and some hurtful and very little good for service but he is sure besides that when his words fall into the hands of any genuine reader they will be weighed and winnowed and only that which suits will be assimilated and when they fall into the hands of one who cannot intelligently read they come there quite silent and inarticulate falling upon deaf ears and his secret is kept as if he had not written    a note on realism 16    style is the invariable mark of any master and for the student who does not aspire so high as to be numbered with the giants it is still the one quality in which he may improve himself at will passion wisdom creative force the power of mystery or colour are allotted in the hour of birth and can be neither learned nor simulated  but the just and dexterous use of what qualities we have the proportion of one part to another and to the whole the elision of the useless the accentuation of the important and the preservation of a uniform character from end to endthese which taken together constitute technical perfection are to some degree within the reach of industry and intellectual courage  what to put in and what to leave out whether some particular fact be organically necessary or purely ornamental whether if it be purely ornamental it may not weaken or obscure the general design and finally whether if we decide to use it we should do so grossly and notably or in some conventional disguise  are questions of plastic style continually rearising  and the sphinx that patrols the highways of executive art has no more unanswerable riddle to propound  in literature from which i must draw my instances the great change of the past century has been effected by the admission of detail  it was inaugurated by the romantic scott and at length by the semiromantic balzac and his more or less wholly unromantic followers bound like a duty on the novelist  for some time it signified and expressed a more ample contemplation of the conditions of mans life but it has recently at least in france fallen into a merely technical and decorative stage which it is perhaps still too harsh to call survival  with a movement of alarm the wiser or more timid begin to fall a little back from these extremities they begin to aspire after a more naked narrative articulation after the succinct the dignified and the poetic and as a means to this after a general lightening of this baggage of detail  after scott we beheld the starveling story once in the hands of voltaire as abstract as a parable begin to be pampered upon facts  the introduction of these details developed a particular ability of hand and that ability childishly indulged has led to the works that now amaze us on a railway journey  a man of the unquestionable force of m zola spends himself on technical successes  to afford a popular flavour and attract the mob he adds a steady current of what i may be allowed to call the rancid  that is exciting to the moralist but what more particularly interests the artist is this tendency of the extreme of detail when followed as a principle to degenerate into mere feuxdejoie of literary tricking  the other day even m daudet was to be heard babbling of audible colours and visible sounds  this odd suicide of one branch of the realists may serve to remind us of the fact which underlies a very dusty conflict of the critics  all representative art which can be said to live is both realistic and ideal and the realism about which we quarrel is a matter purely of externals  it is no especial cultus of nature and veracity but a mere whim of veering fashion that has made us turn our back upon the larger more various and more romantic art of yore  a photographic exactitude in dialogue is now the exclusive fashion but even in the ablest hands it tells us no morei think it even tells us lessthan moliere wielding his artificial medium has told to us and to all time of alceste or orgon dorine or chrysale  the historical novel is forgotten  yet truth to the conditions of mans nature and the conditions of mans life the truth of literary art is free of the ages  it may be told us in a carpet comedy in a novel of adventure or a fairy tale  the scene may be pitched in london on the seacoast of bohemia or away on the mountains of beulah  and by an odd and luminous accident if there is any page of literature calculated to awake the envy of m zola it must be that troilus and cressida which shakespeare in a spasm of unmanly anger with the world grafted on the heroic story of the siege of troy  this question of realism let it then be clearly understood regards not in the least degree the fundamental truth but only the technical method of a work of art  be as ideal or as abstract as you please you will be none the less veracious but if you be weak you run the risk of being tedious and inexpressive and if you be very strong and honest you may chance upon a masterpiece  a work of art is first cloudily conceived in the mind during the period of gestation it stands more clearly forward from these swaddling mists puts on expressive lineaments and becomes at length that most faultless but also alas that incommunicable product of the human mind a perfected design  on the approach to execution all is changed  the artist must now step down don his working clothes and become the artisan  he now resolutely commits his airy conception his delicate ariel to the touch of matter he must decide almost in a breath the scale the style the spirit and the particularity of execution of his whole design  the engendering idea of some works is stylistic a technical preoccupation stands them instead of some robuster principle of life  and with these the execution is but play for the stylistic problem is resolved beforehand and all large originality of treatment wilfully foregone  such are the verses intricately designed which we have learnt to admire with a certain smiling admiration at the hands of mr lang and mr dobson such too are those canvases where dexterity or even breadth of plastic style takes the place of pictorial nobility of design  so it may be remarked it was easier to begin to write esmond than vanity fair since in the first the style was dictated by the nature of the plan and thackeray a man probably of some indolence of mind enjoyed and got good profit of this economy of effort  but the case is exceptional  usually in all works of art that have been conceived from within outwards and generously nourished from the authors mind the moment in which he begins to execute is one of extreme perplexity and strain  artists of indifferent energy and an imperfect devotion to their own ideal make this ungrateful effort once for all and having formed a style adhere to it through life  but those of a higher order cannot rest content with a process which as they continue to employ it must infallibly degenerate towards the academic and the cutanddried  every fresh work in which they embark is the signal for a fresh engagement of the whole forces of their mind and the changing views which accompany the growth of their experience are marked by still more sweeping alterations in the manner of their art  so that criticism loves to dwell upon and distinguish the varying periods of a raphael a shakespeare or a beethoven  it is then first of all at this initial and decisive moment when execution is begun and thenceforth only in a less degree that the ideal and the real do indeed like good and evil angels contend for the direction of the work  marble paint and language the pen the needle and the brush all have their grossnesses their ineffable impotences their hours if i may so express myself of insubordination  it is the work and it is a great part of the delight of any artist to contend with these unruly tools and now by brute energy now by witty expedient to drive and coax them to effect his will  given these means so laughably inadequate and given the interest the intensity and the multiplicity of the actual sensation whose effect he is to render with their aid the artist has one main and necessary resource which he must in every case and upon any theory employ  he must that is suppress much and omit more  he must omit what is tedious or irrelevant and suppress what is tedious and necessary  but such facts as in regard to the main design subserve a variety of purposes he will perforce and eagerly retain  and it is the mark of the very highest order of creative art to be woven exclusively of such there any fact that is registered is contrived a double or a treble debt to pay and is at once an ornament in its place and a pillar in the main design  nothing would find room in such a picture that did not serve at once to complete the composition to accentuate the scheme of colour to distinguish the planes of distance and to strike the note of the selected sentiment nothing would be allowed in such a story that did not at the same time expedite the progress of the fable build up the characters and strike home the moral or the philosophical design  but this is unattainable  as a rule so far from building the fabric of our works exclusively with these we are thrown into a rapture if we think we can muster a dozen or a score of them to be the plums of our confection  and hence in order that the canvas may be filled or the story proceed from point to point other details must be admitted  they must be admitted alas upon a doubtful title many without marriage robes  thus any work of art as it proceeds towards completion too ofteni had almost written alwaysloses in force and poignancy of main design  our little air is swamped and dwarfed among hardly relevant orchestration our little passionate story drowns in a deep sea of descriptive eloquence or slipshod talk  but again we are rather more tempted to admit those particulars which we know we can describe and hence those most of all which having been described very often have grown to be conventionally treated in the practice of our art  these we choose as the mason chooses the acanthus to adorn his capital because they come naturally to the accustomed hand  the old stock incidents and accessories tricks of workmanship and schemes of composition all being admirably good or they would long have been forgotten haunt and tempt our fancy offer us readymade but not perfectly appropriate solutions for any problem that arises and wean us from the study of nature and the uncompromising practice of art  to struggle to face nature to find fresh solutions and give expression to facts which have not yet been adequately or not yet elegantly expressed is to run a little upon the danger of extreme selflove  difficulty sets a high price upon achievement and the artist may easily fall into the error of the french naturalists and consider any fact as welcome to admission if it be the ground of brilliant handiwork or again into the error of the modern landscapepainter who is apt to think that difficulty overcome and science well displayed can take the place of what is after all the one excuse and breath of artcharm  a little further and he will regard charm in the light of an unworthy sacrifice to prettiness and the omission of a tedious passage as an infidelity to art  we have now the matter of this difference before us  the idealist his eye singly fixed upon the greater outlines loves rather to fill up the interval with detail of the conventional order briefly touched soberly suppressed in tone courting neglect  but the realist with a fine intemperance will not suffer the presence of anything so dead as a convention he shall have all fiery all hot pressed from nature all charactered and notable seizing the eye the style that befits either of these extremes once chosen brings with it its necessary disabilities and dangers  the immediate danger of the realist is to sacrifice the beauty and significance of the whole to local dexterity or in the insane pursuit of completion to immolate his readers under facts but he comes in the last resort and as his energy declines to discard all design abjure all choice and with scientific thoroughness steadily to communicate matter which is not worth learning  the danger of the idealist is of course to become merely null and lose all grip of fact particularity or passion  we talk of bad and good  everything indeed is good which is conceived with honesty and executed with communicative ardour  but though on neither side is dogmatism fitting and though in every case the artist must decide for himself and decide afresh and yet afresh for each succeeding work and new creation yet one thing may be generally said that we of the last quarter of the nineteenth century breathing as we do the intellectual atmosphere of our age are more apt to err upon the side of realism than to sin in quest of the ideal  upon that theory it may be well to watch and correct our own decisions always holding back the hand from the least appearance of irrelevant dexterity and resolutely fixed to begin no work that is not philosophical passionate dignified happily mirthful or at the last and least romantic in design    my first book  treasure island 17    it was far indeed from being my first book for i am not a novelist alone  but i am well aware that my paymaster the great public regards what else i have written with indifference if not aversion if it call upon me at all it calls on me in the familiar and indelible character and when i am asked to talk of my first book no question in the world but what is meant is my first novel  sooner or later somehow anyhow i was bound to write a novel  it seems vain to ask why  men are born with various manias  from my earliest childhood it was mine to make a plaything of imaginary series of events and as soon as i was able to write i became a good friend to the papermakers  reams upon reams must have gone to the making of rathillet the pentland rising 18 the kings pardon otherwise park whitehead edward daven a country dance and a vendetta in the west and it is consolatory to remember that these reams are now all ashes and have been received again into the soil  i have named but a few of my ill fated efforts only such indeed as came to a fair bulk ere they were desisted from and even so they cover a long vista of years rathillet was attempted before fifteen the vendetta at twenty nine and the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till i was thirtyone  by that time i had written little books and little essays and short stories and had got patted on the back and paid for themthough not enough to live upon  i had quite a reputation i was the successful man i passed my days in toil the futility of which would sometimes make my cheek to burnthat i should spend a mans energy upon this business and yet could not earn a livelihood  and still there shone ahead of me an unattained ideal  although i had attempted the thing with vigour not less than ten or twelve times i had not yet written a novel  allall my pretty oneshad gone for a little and then stopped inexorably like a schoolboys watch  i might be compared to a cricketer of many years standing who should never have made a run  anybody can write a short storya bad one i meanwho has industry and paper and time enough but not every one may hope to write even a bad novel  it is the length that kills  the accepted novelist may take his novel up and put it down spend days upon it in vain and write not any more than he makes haste to blot  not so the beginner  human nature has certain rights instinctthe instinct of selfpreservationforbids that any man cheered and supported by the consciousness of no previous victory should endure the miseries of unsuccessful literary toil beyond a period to be measured in weeks  there must be something for hope to feed upon  the beginner must have a slant of wind a lucky vein must be running he must be in one of those hours when the words come and the phrases balance of themselveseven to begin  and having begun what a dread looking forward is that until the book shall be accomplished  for so long a time the slant is to continue unchanged the vein to keep running for so long a time you must keep at command the same quality of style  for so long a time your puppets are to be always vital always consistent always vigorous  i remember i used to look in those days upon every threevolume novel with a sort of veneration as a featnot possibly of literaturebut at least of physical and moral endurance and the courage of ajax  in the fated year i came to live with my father and mother at kinnaird above pitlochry  then i walked on the red moors and by the side of the golden burn the rude pure air of our mountains inspirited if it did not inspire us and my wife and i projected a joint volume of logic stories for which she wrote the shadow on the bed and i turned out thrawn janet and a first draft of the merry men  i love my native air but it does not love me and the end of this delightful period was a cold a flyblister and a migration by strathairdle and glenshee to the castleton of braemar  there it blew a good deal and rained in a proportion my native air was more unkind than mans ingratitude and i must consent to pass a good deal of my time between four walls in a house lugubriously known as the late miss mcgregors cottage  and now admire the finger of predestination  there was a schoolboy in the late miss mcgregors cottage home from the holidays and much in want of something craggy to break his mind upon  he had no thought of literature it was the art of raphael that received his fleeting suffrages and with the aid of pen and ink and a shilling box of water colours he had soon turned one of the rooms into a picture gallery  my more immediate duty towards the gallery was to be showman but i would sometimes unbend a little join the artist so to speak at the easel and pass the afternoon with him in a generous emulation making coloured drawings  on one of these occasions i made the map of an island it was elaborately and i thought beautifully coloured the shape of it took my fancy beyond expression it contained harbours that pleased me like sonnets and with the unconsciousness of the predestined i ticketed my performance treasure island  i am told there are people who do not care for maps and find it hard to believe  the names the shapes of the woodlands the courses of the roads and rivers the prehistoric footsteps of man still distinctly traceable up hill and down dale the mills and the ruins the ponds and the ferries perhaps the standing stone or the druidic circle on the heath here is an inexhaustible fund of interest for any man with eyes to see or twopenceworth of imagination to understand with  no child but must remember laying his head in the grass staring into the infinitesimal forest and seeing it grow populous with fairy armies  somewhat in this way as i paused upon my map of treasure island the future character of the book began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods and their brown faces and bright weapons peeped out upon me from unexpected quarters as they passed to and fro fighting and hunting treasure on these few square inches of a flat projection  the next thing i knew i had some papers before me and was writing out a list of chapters  how often have i done so and the thing gone no further  but there seemed elements of success about this enterprise  it was to be a story for boys no need of psychology or fine writing and i had a boy at hand to be a touchstone  women were excluded  i was unable to handle a brig which the hispaniola should have been but i thought i could make shift to sail her as a schooner without public shame   and then i had an idea for john silver from which i promised myself funds of entertainment to take an admired friend of mine whom the reader very likely knows and admires as much as i do to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament to leave him with nothing but his strength his courage his quickness and his magnificent geniality and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw tarpaulin  such psychical surgery is i think a common way of making character perhaps it is indeed the only way  we can put in the quaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the wayside but do we know him  our friend with his infinite variety and flexibility we knowbut can we put him in  upon the first we must engraft secondary and imaginary qualities possibly all wrong from the second knife in hand we must cut away and deduct the needless arborescence of his nature but the trunk and the few branches that remain we may at least be fairly sure of  on a chill september morning by the cheek of a brisk fire and the rain drumming on the window i began the sea cook for that was the original title  i have begun and finished a number of other books but i cannot remember to have sat down to one of them with more complacency  it is not to be wondered at for stolen waters are proverbially sweet  i am now upon a painful chapter  no doubt the parrot once belonged to robinson crusoe  no doubt the skeleton is conveyed from poe  i think little of these they are trifles and details and no man can hope to have a monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds  the stockade i am told is from masterman ready  it may be i care not a jot  these useful writers had fulfilled the poets saying  departing they had left behind them footprints on the sands of time footprints which perhaps anotherand i was the other  it is my debt to washington irving that exercises my conscience and justly so for i believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther  i chanced to pick up the tales of a traveller some years ago with a view to an anthology of prose narrative and the book flew up and struck me  billy bones his chest the company in the parlour the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chaptersall were there all were the property of washington irving  but i had no guess of it then as i sat writing by the fireside in what seemed the springtides of a somewhat pedestrian inspiration nor yet day by day after lunch as i read aloud my mornings work to the family  it seemed to me original as sin it seemed to belong to me like my right eye  i had counted on one boy i found i had two in my audience  my father caught fire at once with all the romance and childishness of his original nature  his own stories that every night of his life he put himself to sleep with dealt perpetually with ships roadside inns robbers old sailors and commercial travellers before the era of steam  he never finished one of these romances the lucky man did not require to  but in treasure island he recognised something kindred to his own imagination it was his kind of picturesque and he not only heard with delight the daily chapter but set himself acting to collaborate  when the time came for billy boness chest to be ransacked he must have passed the better part of a day preparing on the back of a legal envelope an inventory of its contents which i exactly followed and the name of flints old shipthe walruswas given at his particular request  and now who should come dropping in ex machina but dr japp like the disguised prince who is to bring down the curtain upon peace and happiness in the last act for he carried in his pocket not a horn or a talisman but a publisherhad in fact been charged by my old friend mr henderson to unearth new writers for young folks even the ruthlessness of a united family recoiled before the extreme measure of inflicting on our guest the mutilated members of the sea cook at the same time we would by no means stop our readings and accordingly the tale was begun again at the beginning and solemnly redelivered for the benefit of dr japp from that moment on i have thought highly of his critical faculty for when he left us he carried away the manuscript in his portmanteau  here then was everything to keep me up sympathy help and now a positive engagement  i had chosen besides a very easy style compare it with the almost contemporary merry men one reader may prefer the one style one the othertis an affair of character perhaps of mood but no expert can fail to see that the one is much more difficult and the other much easier to maintain  it seems as though a fullgrown experienced man of letters might engage to turn out treasure island at so many pages a day and keep his pipe alight  but alas this was not my case  fifteen days i stuck to it and turned out fifteen chapters and then in the early paragraphs of the sixteenth ignominiously lost hold  my mouth was empty there was not one word of treasure island in my bosom and here were the proofs of the beginning already waiting me at the hand and spear  then i corrected them living for the most part alone walking on the heath at weybridge in dewy autumn mornings a good deal pleased with what i had done and more appalled than i can depict to you in words at what remained for me to do  i was thirtyone i was the head of a family i had lost my health i had never yet paid my way never yet made 200 pounds a year my father had quite recently bought back and cancelled a book that was judged a failure  was this to be another and last fiasco  i was indeed very close on despair but i shut my mouth hard and during the journey to davos where i was to pass the winter had the resolution to think of other things and bury myself in the novels of m de boisgobey  arrived at my destination down i sat one morning to the unfinished tale and behold it flowed from me like small talk and in a second tide of delighted industry and again at a rate of a chapter a day i finished treasure island  it had to be transcribed almost exactly my wife was ill the schoolboy remained alone of the faithful and john addington symonds to whom i timidly mentioned what i was engaged on looked on me askance he was at that time very eager i should write on the characters of theophrastus  so far out may be the judgments of the wisest men but symonds to be sure was scarce the confidant to go to for sympathy on a boys story  he was largeminded a full man if there was one but the very name of my enterprise would suggest to him only capitulations of sincerity and solecisms of style  well he was not far wrong  treasure islandit was mr henderson who deleted the first title the sea cookappeared duly in the story paper where it figured in the ignoble midst without woodcuts and attracted not the least attention  i did not care  i liked the tale myself for much the same reason as my father liked the beginning  it was my kind of picturesque  i was not a little proud of john silver also and to this day rather admire that smooth and formidable adventurer  what was infinitely more exhilarating i had passed a landmark i had finished a tale and written the end upon my manuscript as i had not done since the pentland rising when i was a boy of sixteen not yet at college  in truth it was so by a set of lucky accidents had not dr japp come on his visit had not the tale flowed from me with singular case it must have been laid aside like its predecessors and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire  purists may suggest it would have been better so  i am not of that mind  the tale seems to have given much pleasure and it brought or was the means of bringing fire and food and wine to a deserving family in which i took an interest  i need scarcely say i mean my own  but the adventures of treasure island are not yet quite at an end i had written it up to the map  the map was the chief part of my plot  for instance i had called an islet skeleton island not knowing what i meant seeking only for the immediate picturesque and it was to justify this name that i broke into the gallery of mr poe and stole flints pointer  and in the same way it was because i had made two harbours that the hispaniola was sent on her wanderings with israel hands  the time came when it was decided to republish and i sent in my manuscript and the map along with it to messrs cassell  the proofs came they were corrected but i heard nothing of the map  i wrote and asked was told it had never been received and sat aghast  it is one thing to draw a map at random set a scale in one corner of it at a venture and write up a story to the measurements  it is quite another to have to examine a whole book make an inventory of all the allusions contained in it and with a pair of compasses painfully design a map to suit the data  i did it and the map was drawn again in my fathers office with embellishments of blowing whales and sailing ships and my father himself brought into service a knack he had of various writing and elaborately forged the signature of captain flint and the sailing directions of billy bones  but somehow it was never treasure island to me  i have said the map was the most of the plot  i might almost say it was the whole  a few reminiscences of poe defoe and washington irving a copy of johnsons buccaneers the name of the dead mans chest from kingsleys at last some recollections of canoeing on the high seas and the map itself with its infinite eloquent suggestion made up the whole of my materials  it is perhaps not often that a map figures so largely in a tale yet it is always important  the author must know his countryside whether real or imaginary like his hand the distances the points of the compass the place of the suns rising the behaviour of the moon should all be beyond cavil  and how troublesome the moon is  i have come to grief over the moon in prince otto and so soon as that was pointed out to me adopted a precaution which i recommend to other meni never write now without an almanack  with an almanack and the map of the country and the plan of every house either actually plotted on paper or already and immediately apprehended in the mind a man may hope to avoid some of the grossest possible blunders  with the map before him he will scarce allow the sun to set in the east as it does in the antiquary  with the almanack at hand he will scarce allow two horsemen journeying on the most urgent affair to employ six days from three of the monday morning till late in the saturday night upon a journey of say ninety or a hundred miles and before the week is out and still on the same nags to cover fifty in one day as may be read at length in the inimitable novel of rob roy  and it is certainly well though far from necessary to avoid such croppers  but it is my contentionmy superstition if you like that who is faithful to his map and consults it and draws from it his inspiration daily and hourly gains positive support and not mere negative immunity from accident  the tale has a root there it grows in that soil it has a spine of its own behind the words  better if the country be real and he has walked every foot of it and knows every milestone  but even with imaginary places he will do well in the beginning to provide a map as he studies it relations will appear that he had not thought upon he will discover obvious though unsuspected shortcuts and footprints for his messengers and even when a map is not all the plot as it was in treasure island it will be found to be a mine of suggestion    the genesis of the master of ballantrae    i was walking one night in the verandah of a small house in which i lived outside the hamlet of saranac  it was winter the night was very dark the air extraordinary clear and cold and sweet with the purity of forests  from a good way below the river was to be heard contending with ice and boulders  a few lights appeared scattered unevenly among the darkness but so far away as not to lessen the sense of isolation  for the making of a story here were fine conditions  i was besides moved with the spirit of emulation for i had just finished my third or fourth perusal of the phantom ship  come said i to my engine let us make a tale a story of many years and countries of the sea and the land savagery and civilisation a story that shall have the same large features and may be treated in the same summary elliptic method as the book you have been reading and admiring  i was here brought up with a reflection exceedingly just in itself but which as the sequel shows i failed to profit by  i saw that marryat not less than homer milton and virgil profited by the choice of a familiar and legendary subject so that he prepared his readers on the very titlepage and this set me cudgelling my brains if by any chance i could hit upon some similar belief to be the centrepiece of my own meditated fiction  in the course of this vain search there cropped up in my memory a singular case of a buried and resuscitated fakir which i had been often told by an uncle of mine then lately dead inspectorgeneral john balfour  on such a fine frosty night with no wind and the thermometer below zero the brain works with much vivacity and the next moment i had seen the circumstance transplanted from india and the tropics to the adirondack wilderness and the stringent cold of the canadian border  here then almost before i had begun my story i had two countries two of the ends of the earth involved  and thus though the notion of the resuscitated man failed entirely on the score of general acceptation or even as i have since found acceptability it fitted at once with my design of a tale of many lands and this decided me to consider further of its possibilities  the man who should thus be buried was the first question  a good man whose return to life would be hailed by the reader and the other characters with gladness  this trenched upon the christian picture and was dismissed  if the idea then was to be of any use at all for me i had to create a kind of evil genius to his friends and family take him through many disappearances and make this final restoration from the pit of death in the icy american wilderness the last and the grimmest of the series  i need not tell my brothers of the craft that i was now in the most interesting moment of an authors life the hours that followed that night upon the balcony and the following nights and days whether walking abroad or lying wakeful in my bed were hours of unadulterated joy  my mother who was then living with me alone perhaps had less enjoyment for in the absence of my wife who is my usual helper in these times of parturition i must spur her up at all seasons to hear me relate and try to clarify my unformed fancies  and while i was groping for the fable and the character required behold i found them lying ready and nine years old in my memory pease porridge hot pease porridge cold pease porridge in the pot nine years old  was there ever a more complete justification of the rule of horace  here thinking of quite other things i had stumbled on the solution or perhaps i should rather say in stagewright phrase the curtain or final tableau of a story conceived long before on the moors between pitlochry and strathardle conceived in highland rain in the blend of the smell of heather and bogplants and with a mind full of the athole correspondence and the memories of the dumlicide justice  so long ago so far away it was that i had first evoked the faces and the mutual tragic situation of the men of durrisdeer  my story was now worldwide enough  scotland india and america being all obligatory scenes  but of these india was strange to me except in books i had never known any living indian save a parsee a member of my club in london equally civilised and to all seeing equally accidental with myself  it was plain thus far that i should have to get into india and out of it again upon a foot of fairy lightness and i believe this first suggested to me the idea of the chevalier burke for a narrator  it was at first intended that he should be scottish and i was then filled with fears that he might prove only the degraded shadow of my own alan breck  presently however it began to occur to me it would be like my master to curry favour with the princes irishmen and that an irish refugee would have a particular reason to find himself in india with his countryman the unfortunate lally  irish therefore i decided he should be and then all of a sudden i was aware of a tall shadow across my path the shadow of barry lyndon no man in lord foppingtons phrase of a nice morality could go very deep with my master  in the original idea of this story conceived in scotland this companion had been besides intended to be worse than the bad elder son with whom as it was then meant he was to visit scotland if i took an irishman and a very bad irishman in the midst of the eighteenth century how was i to evade barry lyndon  the wretch besieged me offering his services he gave me excellent references he proved that he was highly fitted for the work i had to do he or my own evil heart suggested it was easy to disguise his ancient livery wit a little lace and a few frogs and buttons so that thackeray himself should hardly recognise him  and then of a sudden there came to me memories of a young irishman with whom i was once intimate and had spent long nights walking and talking with upon a very desolate coast in a bleak autumn  i recalled him as a youth of an extraordinary moral simplicityalmost vacancy plastic to any influence the creature of his admirations  and putting such a youth in fancy into the career of a soldier of fortune it occurred to me that he would serve my turn as well as mr lyndon and in place of entering into competition with the master would afford a slight though a distinct relief  i know not if i have done him well though his moral dissertations always highly entertained me but i own i have been surprised to find that he reminded some critics of barry lyndon after all       preface to the master of ballantrae 19    although an old consistent exile the editor of the following pages revisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a native and there are few things more strange more painful or more salutary than such revisitations  outside in foreign spots he comes by surprise and awakens more attention than he had expected in his own city the relation is reversed and he stands amazed to be so little recollected  elsewhere he is refreshed to see attractive faces to remark possible friends there he scouts the long streets with a pang at heart for the faces and friends that are no more  elsewhere he is delighted with the presence of what is new there tormented by the absence of what is old elsewhere he is content to be his present self there he is smitten with an equal regret for what he once was and for what he once hoped to be  he was feeling all this dimly as he drove from the station on his last visit he was feeling it still as he alighted at the door of his friend mr johnstone thomson ws with whom he was to stay a hearty welcome a face not altogether changed a few words that sounded of old days a laugh provoked and shared a glimpse in passing of the snowy cloth and bright decanters and the piranesis on the diningroom wall brought him to his bedroom with a somewhat lightened cheer and when he and mr thomson sat down a few minutes later cheek by jowl and pledged the past in a preliminary bumper he was already almost consoled he had already almost forgiven himself his two unpardonable errors that he should ever have left his native city or ever returned to it  i have something quite in your way said mr thomson  i wished to do honour to your arrival because my dear fellow it is my own youth that comes back along with you in a very tattered and withered state to be sure butwellall thats left of it  a great deal better than nothing said the editor  but what is this which is quite in my way  i was coming to that said mr thomson  fate has put it in my power to honour your arrival with something really original by way of dessert  a mystery  a mystery i repeated  yes said his friend a mystery  it may prove to be nothing and it may prove to be a great deal  but in the meanwhile it is truly mysterious no eye having looked on it for near a hundred years it is highly genteel for it treats of a titled family and it ought to be melodramatic for according to the superscription it is concerned with death  i think i rarely heard a more obscure or a more promising annunciation the other remarked  but what is it  you remember my predecessors old peter mbrairs business  i remember him acutely he could not look at me without a pang of reprobation and he could not feel the pang without betraying it he was to me a man of a great historical interest but the interest was not returned  ah well we go beyond him said mr thomson  i daresay old peter knew as little about this as i do  you see i succeeded to a prodigious accumulation of old lawpapers and old tin boxes some of them of peters hoarding some of his fathers john first of the dynasty a great man in his day  among other collections were all the papers of the durrisdeers  the durrisdeers cried i  my dear fellow these may be of the greatest interest  one of them was out in the 45 one had some strange passages with the devilyou will find a note of it in laws memorials i think and there was an unexplained tragedy i know not what much later about a hundred years ago  more than a hundred years ago said mr thomson  in 1783  how do you know that  i mean some death  yes the lamentable deaths of my lord durrisdeer and his brother the master of ballantrae attainted in the troubles said mr thomson with something the tone of a man quoting  is that it  to say truth said i i have only seen some dim reference to the things in memoirs and heard some traditions dimmer still through my uncle whom i think you knew  my uncle lived when he was a boy in the neighbourhood of st brides he has often told me of the avenue closed up and grown over with grass the great gates never opened the last lord and his old maid sister who lived in the back parts of the house a quiet plain poor humdrum couple it would seembut pathetic too as the last of that stirring and brave houseand to the country folk faintly terrible from some deformed traditions  yes said mr thomson  henry graeme durie the last lord died in 1820 his sister the honourable miss katherine durie in 27 so much i know and by what i have been going over the last few days they were what you say decent quiet people and not rich to say truth it was a letter of my lords that put me on the search for the packet we are going to open this evening  some papers could not be found and he wrote to jack mbrair suggesting they might be among those sealed up by a mr mackellar  mbrair answered that the papers in question were all in mackellars own hand all as the writer understood of a purely narrative character and besides said he i am bound not to open them before the year 1889  you may fancy if these words struck me  i instituted a hunt through all the mbrair
