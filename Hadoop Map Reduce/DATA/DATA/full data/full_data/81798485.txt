springtime 1921  concealed art 1915  the test case 1915      death at the excelsior   i  the room was the typical bedroom of the typical boardinghouse furnished insofar as it could be said to be furnished at all with a severe simplicity it contained two beds a pine chest of drawers a strip of faded carpet and a wash basin but there was that on the floor which set this room apart from a thousand rooms of the same kind flat on his back with his hands tightly clenched and one leg twisted oddly under him and with his teeth gleaming through his grey beard in a horrible grin captain john gunner stared up at the ceiling with eyes that saw nothing  until a moment before he had had the little room all to himself but now two people were standing just inside the door looking down at him one was a large policeman who twisted his helmet nervously in his hands the other was a tall gaunt old woman in a rusty black dress who gazed with pale eyes at the dead man her face was quite expressionless  the woman was mrs pickett owner of the excelsior boardinghouse the policemans name was grogan he was a genial giant a terror to the riotous element of the waterfront but obviously ill at ease in the presence of death he drew in his breath wiped his forehead and whispered look at his eyes maam  mrs pickett had not spoken a word since she had brought the policeman into the room and she did not do so now constable grogan looked at her quickly he was afraid of mother pickett as was everybody else along the waterfront her silence her pale eyes and the quiet decisiveness of her personality cowed even the tough old salts who patronized the excelsior she was a formidable influence in that little community of sailormen  thats just how i found him said mrs pickett she did not speak loudly but her voice made the policeman start  he wiped his forehead again it might have been apoplexy he hazarded  mrs pickett said nothing there was a sound of footsteps outside and a young man entered carrying a black bag  good morning mrs pickett i was told thatgood lord the young doctor dropped to his knees beside the body and raised one of the arms after a moment he lowered it gently to the floor and shook his head in grim resignation  hes been dead for hours he announced when did you find him  twenty minutes back replied the old woman i guess he died last night he never would be called in the morning said he liked to sleep on well hes got his wish  what did he die of sir asked the policeman  its impossible to say without an examination the doctor answered it looks like a stroke but im pretty sure it isnt it might be a coronary attack but i happen to know his blood pressure was normal and his heart sound he called in to see me only a week ago and i examined him thoroughly but sometimes you can be deceived the inquest will tell us he eyed the body almost resentfully i cant understand it the man had no right to drop dead like this he was a tough old sailor who ought to have been good for another twenty years if you want my honest opinionthough i cant possibly be certain until after the inquesti should say he had been poisoned  how would he be poisoned asked mrs pickett quietly  thats more than i can tell you theres no glass about that he could have drunk it from he might have got it in capsule form but why should he have done it he was always a pretty cheerful sort of old man wasnt he  yes sir said the constable he had the name of being a joker in these parts kind of sarcastic they tell me though he never tried it on me  he must have died quite early last night said the doctor he turned to mrs pickett whats become of captain muller if he shares this room he ought to be able to tell us something about it  captain muller spent the night with some friends at portsmouth said mrs pickett he left right after supper and hasnt returned  the doctor stared thoughtfully about the room frowning  i dont like it i cant understand it if this had happened in india i should have said the man had died from some form of snakebite i was out there two years and ive seen a hundred cases of it the poor devils all looked just like this but the things ridiculous how could a man be bitten by a snake in a southampton waterfront boardinghouse was the door locked when you found him mrs pickett  mrs pickett nodded i opened it with my own key i had been calling to him and he didnt answer so i guessed something was wrong  the constable spoke you aint touched anything maam theyre always very particular about that if the doctors right and theres been anything up thats the first thing theyll ask  everythings just as i found it  whats that on the floor beside him the doctor asked  only his harmonica he liked to play it of an evening in his room ive had some complaints about it from some of the gentlemen but i never saw any harm so long as he didnt play it too late  seems as if he was playing it whenit happened constable grogan said that dont look much like suicide sir  i didnt say it was suicide  grogan whistled you dont think  im not thinking anythinguntil after the inquest all i say is that its queer  another aspect of the matter seemed to strike the policeman i guess this aint going to do the excelsior any good maam he said sympathetically  mrs pickett shrugged her shoulders  i suppose i had better go and notify the coroner said the doctor  he went out and after a momentary pause the policeman followed him constable grogan was not greatly troubled with nerves but he felt a decided desire to be somewhere where he could not see the dead mans staring eyes  mrs pickett remained where she was looking down at the still form on the floor her face was expressionless but inwardly she was tormented and alarmed it was the first time such a thing as this had happened at the excelsior and as constable grogan had hinted it was not likely to increase the attractiveness of the house in the eyes of possible boarders it was not the threatened pecuniary loss which was troubling her as far as money was concerned she could have lived comfortably on her savings for she was richer than most of her friends supposed it was the blot on the escutcheon of the excelsiorthe stain on its reputationwhich was tormenting her  the excelsior was her life starting many years before beyond the memory of the oldest boarder she had built up the model establishment the fame of which had been carried to every corner of the world men spoke of it as a place where you were fed well cleanly housed and where petty robbery was unknown  such was the chorus of praise that it is not likely that much harm could come to the excelsior from a single mysterious death but mother pickett was not consoling herself with such reflections  she looked at the dead man with pale grim eyes out in the hallway the doctors voice further increased her despair he was talking to the police on the telephone and she could distinctly hear his every word   ii  the offices of mr paul snyders detective agency in new oxford street had grown in the course of a dozen years from a single room to an impressive suite bright with polished wood clicking typewriters and other evidences of success where once mr snyder had sat and waited for clients and attended to them himself he now sat in his private office and directed eight assistants  he had just accepted a casea case that might be nothing at all or something exceedingly big it was on the latter possibility that he had gambled the fee offered was judged by his present standards of prosperity small but the bizarre facts coupled with something in the personality of the client had won him over he briskly touched the bell and requested that mr oakes should be sent in to him  elliot oakes was a young man who both amused and interested mr snyder for though he had only recently joined the staff he made no secret of his intention of revolutionizing the methods of the agency mr snyder himself in common with most of his assistants relied for results on hard work and plenty of common sense he had never been a detective of the showy type results had justified his methods but he was perfectly aware that young mr oakes looked on him as a dull old man who had been miraculously favored by luck  mr snyder had selected oakes for the case in hand principally because it was one where inexperience could do no harm and where the brilliant guesswork which oakes preferred to call his inductive reasoning might achieve an unexpected success  another motive actuated mr snyder in his choice he had a strong suspicion that the conduct of this case was going to have the beneficial result of lowering oakes selfesteem if failure achieved this end mr snyder felt that failure though it would not help the agency would not be an unmixed ill  the door opened and oakes entered tensely he did everything tensely partly from a natural nervous energy and partly as a pose he was a lean young man with dark eyes and a thinlipped mouth and he looked quite as much like a typical detective as mr snyder looked like a comfortable and prosperous stock broker  sit down oakes said mr snyder ive got a job for you  oakes sank into a chair like a crouching leopard and placed the tips of his fingers together he nodded curtly it was part of his pose to be keen and silent  i want you to go to this addressmr snyder handed him an envelopeand look around the address on that envelope is of a sailors boardinghouse down in southampton you know the sort of placeretired sea captains and so on live there all most respectable in all its history nothing more sensational has ever happened than a case of suspected cheating at halfpenny nap well a man had died there  murdered oakes asked  i dont know thats for you to find out the coroner left it open death by misadventure was the verdict and i dont blame him i dont see how it could have been murder the door was locked on the inside so nobody could have got in  the window  the window was open granted but the room is on the second floor anyway you may dismiss the window i remember the old lady saying there was a bar across it and that nobody could have squeezed through  oakes eyes glistened he was interested what was the cause of death he asked  mr snyder coughed snake bite he said  oakes careful calm deserted him he uttered a cry of astonishment why thats incredible  its the literal truth the medical examination proved that the fellow had been killed by snake poisoncobra to be exact which is found principally in india  cobra  just so in a southampton boardinghouse in a room with a locked door this man was stung by a cobra to add a little mystification to the limpid simplicity of the affair when the door was opened there was no sign of any cobra it couldnt have got out through the door because the door was locked it couldnt have got out of the window because the window was too high up and snakes cant jump and it couldnt have gotten up the chimney because there was no chimney so there you have it  he looked at oakes with a certain quiet satisfaction it had come to his ears that oakes had been heard to complain of the infantile nature and unworthiness of the last two cases to which he had been assigned he had even said that he hoped some day to be given a problem which should be beyond the reasoning powers of a child of six it seemed to mr snyder that oakes was about to get his wish  i should like further details said oakes a little breathlessly  you had better apply to mrs pickett who owns the boardinghouse mr snyder said it was she who put the case in my hands she is convinced that it is murder but if we exclude ghosts i dont see how any third party could have taken a hand in the thing at all however she wanted a man from this agency and was prepared to pay for him so i promised her i would send one it is not our policy to turn business away  he smiled wryly in pursuance of that policy i want you to go and put up at mrs picketts boarding house and do your best to enhance the reputation of our agency i would suggest that you pose as a ships chandler or something of that sort you will have to be something maritime or theyll be suspicious of you and if your visit produces no other results it will at least enable you to make the acquaintance of a very remarkable woman i commend mrs pickett to your notice by the way she says she will help you in your investigations  oakes laughed shortly the idea amused him  its a mistake to scoff at amateur assistance my boy said mr snyder in the benevolently paternal manner which had made a score of criminals refuse to believe him a detective until the moment when the handcuffs snapped on their wrists crime investigation isnt an exact science success or failure depends in a large measure on applied common sense and the possession of a great deal of special information mrs pickett knows certain things which neither you nor i know and its just possible that she may have some stray piece of information which will provide the key to the entire mystery  oakes laughed again it is very kind of mrs pickett he said but i prefer to trust to my own methods oakes rose his face purposeful id better be starting at once he said ill send you reports from time to time  good the more detailed the better said mr snyder genially i hope your visit to the excelsior will be pleasant and cultivate mrs pickett shes worth while  the door closed and mr snyder lighted a fresh cigar dashed young fool he murmured as he turned his mind to other matters   iii  a day later mr snyder sat in his office reading a typewritten report it appeared to be of a humorous nature for as he read chuckles escaped him finishing the last sheet he threw his head back and laughed heartily the manuscript had not been intended by its author for a humorous effort what mr snyder had been reading was the first of elliott oakes reports from the excelsior it read as follows      i am sorry to be unable to report any real progress i have     formed several theories which i will put forward later but at     present i cannot say that i am hopeful      directly i arrived here i sought out mrs pickett explained     who i was and requested her to furnish me with any further     information which might be of service to me she is a strange     silent woman who impressed me as having very little     intelligence your suggestion that i should avail myself of     her assistance seems more curious than ever now that i have     seen her      the whole affair seems to me at the moment of writing quite     inexplicable assuming that this captain gunner was murdered     there appears to have been no motive for the crime whatsoever     i have made careful inquiries about him and find that he was     a man of fiftyfive had spent nearly forty years of his life     at sea the last dozen in command of his own ship was of a     somewhat overbearing disposition though with a fund of rough     humour had travelled all over the world and had been an inmate     of the excelsior for about ten months he had a small annuity     and no other money at all which disposes of money as the motive     for the crime      in my character of james burton a retired ships chandler i have     mixed with the other boarders and have heard all they have to say     about the affair i gather that the deceased was by no means     popular he appears to have had a bitter tongue and i have not     met one man who seems to regret his death on the other hand i     have heard nothing which would suggest that he had any active and     violent enemies he was simply the unpopular boarderthere is     always one in every boardinghousebut nothing more      i have seen a good deal of the man who shared his roomanother     sea captain named muller he is a big silent person and it is     not easy to get him to talk as regards the death of captain gunner     he can tell me nothing it seems that on the night of the tragedy     he was away at portsmouth with some friends all i have got from     him is some information as to captain gunners habits which leads     nowhere the dead man seldom drank except at night when he would     take some whisky his head was not strong and a little of the     spirit was enough to make him semiintoxicated when he would be     hilarious and often insulting i gather that muller found him a     difficult roommate but he is one of those placid persons who can     put up with anything he and gunner were in the habit of playing     draughts together every night in their room and gunner had a     harmonica which he played frequently apparently he was playing     it very soon before he died which is significant as seeming to     dispose of the idea of suicide      as i say i have one or two theories but they are in a very     nebulous state the most plausible is that on one of his visits     to indiai have ascertained that he made several voyages     therecaptain gunner may in some way have fallen foul of     the natives the fact that he certainly died of the poison of an     indian snake supports this theory i am making inquiries as to     the movements of several indian sailors who were here in     their ships at the time of the tragedy      i have another theory does mrs pickett know more about     this affair than she appears to i may be wrong in my estimate     of her mental qualities her apparent stupidity may be     cunning but here again the absence of motive brings me up     against a dead wall i must confess that at present i do not see     my way clearly however i will write again shortly  mr snyder derived the utmost enjoyment from the report he liked the substance of it and above all he was tickled by the bitter tone of frustration which characterized it oakes was baffled and his knowledge of oakes told him that the sensation of being baffled was gall and wormwood to that highspirited young man whatever might be the result of this investigation it would teach him the virtue of patience  he wrote his assistant a short note      dear oakes      your report received you certainly seem to have got the hard     case which i hear you were pining for dont build too much     on plausible motives in a case of this sort fauntleroy the     london murderer killed a woman for no other reason than that     she had thick ankles many years ago i myself was on a case     where a man murdered an intimate friend because of a dispute     about a bet my experience is that five murderers out of ten     act on the whim of the moment without anything which properly     speaking you could call a motive at all      yours very cordially     paul snyder      p s i dont think much of your pickett theory however youre     in charge i wish you luck   iv  young mr oakes was not enjoying himself for the first time in his life the selfconfidence which characterized all his actions seemed to be failing him the change had taken place almost overnight the fact that the case had the appearance of presenting the unusual had merely stimulated him at first but then doubts had crept in and the problem had begun to appear insoluble  true he had only just taken it up but something told him that for all the progress he was likely to make he might just as well have been working on it steadily for a month he was completely baffled and every moment which he spent in the excelsior boardinghouse made it clearer to him that that infernal old woman with the pale eyes thought him an incompetent fool it was that more than anything which made him acutely conscious of his lack of success his nerves were being sorely troubled by the quiet scorn of mrs picketts gaze he began to think that perhaps he had been a shade too selfconfident and abrupt in the short interview which he had had with her on his arrival  as might have been expected his first act after his brief interview with mrs pickett was to examine the room where the tragedy had taken place the body was gone but otherwise nothing had been moved  oakes belonged to the magnifyingglass school of detection the first thing he did on entering the room was to make a careful examination of the floor the walls the furniture and the windowsill he would have hotly denied the assertion that he did this because it looked well but he would have been hard put to it to advance any other reason  if he discovered anything his discoveries were entirely negative and served only to deepen the mystery of the case as mr snyder had said there was no chimney and nobody could have entered through the locked door  there remained the window it was small and apprehensiveness perhaps of the possibility of burglars had caused the proprietress to make it doubly secure with an iron bar no human being could have squeezed his way through it  it was late that night that he wrote and dispatched to headquarters the report which had amused mr snyder   v  two days later mr snyder sat at his desk staring with wide unbelieving eyes at a telegram he had just received it read as follows       have solved gunner mystery returning oakes  mr snyder narrowed his eyes and rang the bell send mr oakes to me directly he arrives he said  he was pained to find that his chief emotion was one of bitter annoyance the swift solution of such an apparently insoluble problem would reflect the highest credit on the agency and there were picturesque circumstances connected with the case which would make it popular with the newspapers and lead to its being given a great deal of publicity  yet in spite of all this mr snyder was annoyed he realized now how large a part the desire to reduce oakes selfesteem had played with him he further realized looking at the thing honestly that he had been firmly convinced that the young man would not come within a mile of a reasonable solution of the mystery he had desired only that his failure would prove a valuable educational experience for him for he believed that failure at this particular point in his career would make oakes a more valuable asset to the agency but now here oakes was within a ridiculously short space of time returning to the fold not humble and defeated but triumphant mr snyder looked forward with apprehension to the young mans probable demeanor under the intoxicating influence of victory  his apprehensions were well grounded he had barely finished the third of the series of cigars which like milestones marked the progress of his afternoon when the door opened and young oakes entered mr snyder could not repress a faint moan at the sight of him one glance was enough to tell him that his worst fears were realised  i got your telegram said mr snyder  oakes nodded it surprised you eh he asked  mr snyder resented the patronizing tone of the question but he had resigned himself to be patronized and keep his anger in check  yes he replied i must say it did surprise me i didnt gather from your report that you had even found a clue was it the indian theory that turned the trick  oakes laughed tolerantly oh i never really believed that preposterous theory for one moment i just put it in to round out my report i hadnt begun to think about the case thennot really think  mr snyder nearly exploding with wrath extended his cigarcase light up and tell me all about it he said controlling his anger  well i wont say i havent earned this said oakes puffing away he let the ash of his cigar fall delicately to the flooranother action which seemed significant to his employer as a rule his assistants unless particularly pleased with themselves used the ashtray  my first act on arriving oakes said was to have a talk with mrs pickett a very dull old woman  curious she struck me as rather intelligent  not on your life she gave me no assistance whatever i then examined the room where the death had taken place it was exactly as you described it there was no chimney the door had been locked on the inside and the one window was very high up at first sight it looked extremely unpromising then i had a chat with some of the other boarders they had nothing of any importance to contribute most of them simply gibbered i then gave up trying to get help from the outside and resolved to rely on my own intelligence  he smiled triumphantly it is a theory of mine mr snyder which i have found valuable that in nine cases out of ten remarkable things dont happen  i dont quite follow you there mr snyder interrupted  i will put it another way if you like what i mean is that the simplest explanation is nearly always the right one consider this case it seemed impossible that there should have been any reasonable explanation of the mans death most men would have worn themselves out guessing at wild theories if i had started to do that i should have been guessing now as it ishere i am i trusted to my belief that nothing remarkable ever happens and i won out  mr snyder sighed softly oakes was entitled to a certain amount of gloating but there could be no doubt that his way of telling a story was downright infuriating  i believe in the logical sequence of events i refuse to accept effects unless they are preceded by causes in other words with all due respect to your possibly contrary opinions mr snyder i simply decline to believe in a murder unless there was a motive for it the first thing i set myself to ascertain waswhat was the motive for the murder of captain gunner and after thinking it over and making every possible inquiry i decided that there was no motive therefore there was no murder  mr snyders mouth opened and he obviously was about to protest but he appeared to think better of it and oakes proceeded i then tested the suicide theory what motive was there for suicide there was no motive therefore there was no suicide  this time mr snyder spoke you havent been spending the last few days in the wrong house by any chance have you you will be telling me next that there wasnt any dead man  oakes smiled not at all captain john gunner was dead all right as the medical evidence proved he died of the bite of a cobra it was a small cobra which came from java  mr snyder stared at him how do you know  i do know beyond any possibility of doubt  did you see the snake  oakes shook his head  then how in heavens name  i have enough evidence to make a jury convict mr snake without leaving the box  then suppose you tell me this how did your cobra from java get out of the room  by the window replied oakes impassively  how can you possibly explain that you say yourself that the window was high up  nevertheless it got out by the window the logical sequence of events is proof enough that it was in the room it killed captain gunner there and left traces of its presence outside therefore as the window was the only exit it must have escaped by that route it may have climbed or it may have jumped but somehow it got out of that window  what do you meanit left traces of its presence outside  it killed a dog in the backyard behind the house oakes said the window of captain gunners room projects out over it it is full of boxes and litter and there are a few stunted shrubs scattered about in fact there is enough cover to hide any small object like the body of a dog thats why it was not discovered at first the maid at the excelsior came on it the morning after i sent you my report while she was emptying a box of ashes in the yard it was just an ordinary stray dog without collar or license the analyst examined the body and found that the dog had died of the bite of a cobra  but you didnt find the snake  no we cleaned out that yard till you could have eaten your breakfast there but the snake had gone it must have escaped through the door of the yard which was standing ajar that was a couple of days ago and there has been no further tragedy in all likelihood it is dead the nights are pretty cold now and it would probably have died of exposure  but i just dont understand how a cobra got to southampton said the amazed mr snyder  cant you guess it i told you it came from java  how did you know it did  captain muller told me not directly but i pieced it together from what he said it seems that an old shipmate of captain gunners was living in java they corresponded and occasionally this man would send the captain a present as a mark of his esteem the last present he sent was a crate of bananas unfortunately the snake must have got in unnoticed thats why i told you the cobra was a small one well thats my case against mr snake and short of catching him with the goods i dont see how i could have made out a stronger one dont you agree  it went against the grain for mr snyder to acknowledge defeat but he was a fairminded man and he was forced to admit that oakes did certainly seem to have solved the impossible  i congratulate you my boy he said as heartily as he could to be completely frank when you started out i didnt think you could do it by the way i suppose mrs pickett was pleased  if she was she didnt show it im pretty well convinced she hasnt enough sense to be pleased at anything however she has invited me to dinner with her tonight i imagine shell be as boring as usual but she made such a point of it i had to accept   vi  for some time after oakes had gone mr snyder sat smoking and thinking in embittered meditation suddenly there was brought the card of mrs pickett who would be grateful if he could spare her a few moments mr snyder was glad to see mrs pickett he was a student of character and she had interested him at their first meeting there was something about her which had seemed to him unique and he welcomed this second chance of studying her at close range  she came in and sat down stiffly balancing herself on the extreme edge of the chair in which a short while before young oakes had lounged so luxuriously  how are you mrs pickett said mr snyder genially im very glad that you could find time to pay me a visit well so it wasnt murder after all  sir  ive just been talking to mr oakes whom you met as james burton said the detective he has told me all about it  he told me all about it said mrs pickett dryly  mr snyder looked at her inquiringly her manner seemed more suggestive than her words  a conceited headstrong young fool said mrs pickett  it was no new picture of his assistant that she had drawn mr snyder had often drawn it himself but at the present juncture it surprised him oakes in his hour of triumph surely did not deserve this sweeping condemnation  did not mr oakes solution of the mystery satisfy you mrs pickett  no  it struck me as logical and convincing mr snyder said  you may call it all the fancy names you please mr snyder but mr oakes solution was not the right one  have you an alternative to offer  mrs pickett tightened her lips  if you have i should like to hear it  you willat the proper time  what makes you so certain that mr oakes is wrong  he starts out with an impossible explanation and rests his whole case on it there couldnt have been a snake in that room because it couldnt have gotten out the window was too high  but surely the evidence of the dead dog  mrs pickett looked at him as if he had disappointed her i had always heard you spoken of as a man with common sense mr snyder  i have always tried to use common sense  then why are you trying now to make yourself believe that something happened which could not possibly have happened just because it fits in with something which isnt easy to explain  you mean that there is another explanation of the dead dog mr snyder asked  not another what mr oakes takes for granted is not an explanation but there is a common sense explanation and if he had not been so headstrong and conceited he might have found it  you speak as if you had found it chided mr snyder  i have mrs pickett leaned forward as she spoke and stared at him defiantly  mr snyder started you have  yes  what is it  you will know before tomorrow in the meantime try and think it out for yourself a successful and prosperous detective agency like yours mr snyder ought to do something in return for a fee  there was something in her manner so reminiscent of the school teacher reprimanding a recalcitrant pupil that mr snyders sense of humor came to his rescue we do our best mrs pickett he said but you mustnt forget that we are only human and cannot guarantee results  mrs pickett did not pursue the subject instead she proceeded to astonish mr snyder by asking him to swear out a warrant for the arrest of a man known to them both on a charge of murder  mr snyders breath was not often taken away in his own office as a rule he received his clients communications calmly strange as they often were but at her words he gasped the thought crossed his mind that mrs pickett might well be mentally unbalanced the details of the case were fresh in his memory and he distinctly recollected that the person she mentioned had been away from the boarding house on the night of captain gunners death and could he imagined produce witnesses to prove it  mrs pickett was regarding him with an unfaltering stare to all outward appearances she was the opposite of unbalanced  but you cant swear out a warrant without evidence he told her  i have evidence she replied firmly  precisely what kind of evidence he demanded  if i told you now you would think that i was out of my mind  but mrs pickett do you realize what you are asking me to do i cannot make this agency responsible for the arbitrary arrest of a man on the strength of a single individuals suspicions it might ruin me at the least it would make me a laughing stock  mr snyder you may use your own judgment whether or not to make the arrest on that warrant you will listen to what i have to say and you will see for yourself how the crime was committed if after that you feel that you cannot make the arrest i will accept your decision i know who killed captain gunner she said i knew it from the beginning it was like a vision but i had no proof now things have come to light and everything is clear  against his judgment mr snyder was impressed this woman had the magnetism which makes for persuasiveness  itit sounds incredible even as he spoke he remembered that it had long been a professional maxim of his that nothing was incredible and he weakened still further  mr snyder i ask you to swear out that warrant  the detective gave in very well he said  mrs pickett rose if you will come and dine at my house tonight i think i can prove to you that it will be needed will you come  ill come promised mr snyder   vii  when mr snyder arrived at the excelsior and shortly after he was shown into the little private sitting room where he found oakes the third guest of the evening unexpectedly arrived  mr snyder looked curiously at the newcomer captain muller had a peculiar fascination for him it was not mr snyders habit to trust overmuch to appearances but he could not help admitting that there was something about this mans aspect which brought mrs picketts charges out of the realm of the fantastic into that of the possible there was something oddan unnatural aspect of gloomabout the man he bore himself like one carrying a heavy burden his eyes were dull his face haggard the next moment the detective was reproaching himself with allowing his imagination to run away with his calmer judgment  the door opened and mrs pickett came in she made no apology for her lateness  to mr snyder one of the most remarkable points about the dinner was the peculiar metamorphosis of mrs pickett from the brooding silent woman he had known to the gracious and considerate hostess  oakes appeared also to be overcome with surprise so much so that he was unable to keep his astonishment to himself he had come prepared to endure a dull evening absorbed in grim silence and he found himself instead opposite a bottle of champagne of a brand and year which commanded his utmost respect what was even more incredible his hostess had transformed herself into a pleasant old lady whose only aim seemed to be to make him feel at home  beside each of the guests plates was a neat paper parcel oakes picked his up and stared at it in wonderment why this is more than a party souvenir mrs pickett he said its the kind of mechanical marvel ive always wanted to have on my desk  im glad you like it mr oakes mrs pickett said smiling you must not think of me simply as a tired old woman whom age has completely defeated i am an ambitious hostess when i give these little parties i like to make them a success i want each of you to remember this dinner  im sure i will  mrs pickett smiled again i think you all will you mr snyder she paused and you captain muller  to mr snyder there was so much meaning in her voice as she said this that he was amazed that it conveyed no warning to muller captain muller however was already drinking heavily he looked up when addressed and uttered a sound which might have been taken for an expression of polite acquiescence then he filled his glass again  mr snyders parcel revealed a watchcharm fashioned in the shape of a tiny candideye camera that said mrs pickett is a compliment to your profession she leaned toward the captain mr snyder is a detective captain muller  he looked up it seemed to mr snyder that a look of fear lit up his heavy eyes for an instant it came and went if indeed it came at all so swiftly that he could not be certain  so said captain muller he spoke quite evenly with just the amount of interest which such an announcement would naturally produce  now for yours captain said oakes i guess its something special its twice the size of mine anyway  it may have been something in the old womans expression as she watched captain muller slowly tearing the paper that sent a thrill of excitement through mr snyder something seemed to warn him of the approach of a psychological moment he bent forward eagerly  there was a strangled gasp a thump and onto the table from the captains hands there fell a little harmonica there was no mistaking the look on mullers face now his cheeks were like wax and his eyes so dull till then blazed with a panic and horror which he could not repress the glasses on the table rocked as he clutched at the cloth  mrs pickett spoke why captain muller has it upset you i thought that as his best friend the man who shared his room you would value a memento of captain gunner how fond you must have been of him for the sight of his harmonica to be such a shock  the captain did not speak he was staring fascinated at the thing on the table mrs pickett turned to mr snyder her eyes as they met his held him entranced  mr snyder as a detective you will be interested in a curious and very tragic affair which happened in this house a few days ago one of my boarders captain gunner was found dead in his room it was the room which he shared with captain muller i am very proud of the reputation of my house mr snyder and it was a blow to me that this should have happened i applied to an agency for a detective and they sent me a stupid boy with nothing to recommend him except his belief in himself he said that captain gunner had died by accident killed by a snake which had come out of a crate of bananas i knew better i knew that captain gunner had been murdered are you listening captain muller this will interest you as you were such a friend of his  the captain did not answer he was staring straight before him as if he saw something invisible in eyes forever closed in death  yesterday we found the body of a dog it had been killed as captain gunner had been by the poison of a snake the boy from the agency said that this was conclusive he said that the snake had escaped from the room after killing captain gunner and had in turn killed the dog i knew that to be impossible for if there had been a snake in that room it could not have made its escape  her eyes flashed and became remorselessly accusing it was not a snake that killed captain gunner it was a cat captain gunner had a friend who hated him one day in opening a crate of bananas this friend found a snake he killed it and extracted the poison he knew captain gunners habits he knew that he played a harmonica this man also had a cat he knew that cats hated the sound of a harmonica he had often seen this particular cat fly at captain gunner and scratch him when he played he took the cat and covered its claws with the poison and then he left it in the room with captain gunner he knew what would happen  oakes and mr snyder were on their feet captain muller had not moved he sat there his fingers gripping the cloth mrs pickett rose and went to a closet she unlocked the door kitty she called kitty kitty  a black cat ran swiftly out into the room with a clatter and a crash of crockery and a ringing of glass the table heaved rocked and overturned as muller staggered to his feet he threw up his hands as if to ward something off a choking cry came from his lips gott gott  mrs picketts voice rang through the room cold and biting captain muller you murdered captain gunner  the captain shuddered then mechanically he replied gott yes i killed him  you heard mr snyder said mrs pickett he has confessed before witnesses take him away  muller allowed himself to be moved toward the door his arm in mr snyders grip felt limp mrs pickett stopped and took something from the debris on the floor she rose holding the harmonica  you are forgetting your souvenir captain muller she said     misunderstood   the profession of mr james spider buffin was pocketpicking his hobby was revenge james had no objection to letting the sun go down on his wrath indeed it was after dark that he corrected his numerous enemies most satisfactorily it was on a dark night while he was settling a small score against one kelly a mere acquaintance that he first fell foul of constable keating whose beat took him through the regions which james most frequented  james having laid for mr kelly met him in a murky sidestreet down clerkenwell way and attended to his needs with a sandbag  it was here that constable keating first came prominently into his life just as james with the satisfying feeling that his duty had been done was preparing to depart officer keating who had been a distant spectator of the affair charged up and seized him  it was intolerable that he should interfere in a purely private fallingout between one gentleman and another but there was nothing to be done the policeman weighed close upon fourteen stone and could have eaten mr buffin the latter inwardly seething went quietly and in due season was stowed away at the governments expense for the space of sixty days  physically there is no doubt that his detention did him good the regular hours and the substitution of bread and water for his wonted diet improved his health thirty per cent it was mentally that he suffered his was one of those justasgood cheapsubstitute minds incapable of harbouring more than one idea at a time and during those sixty days of quiet seclusion it was filled with an evergrowing resentment against officer keating every day as he moved about his appointed tasks he brooded on his wrongs every night was to him but the end of another day that kept him from settling down to the serious business of revenge to be haled to prison for correcting a private enemy with a sandbagthat was what stung in the privacy of his cell he dwelt unceasingly on the necessity for revenge the thing began to take on to him the aspect almost of a holy mission a sort of crusade                                        the days slipped by bringing winter to clerkenwell and with it mr buffin he returned to his old haunts one friday night thin but in excellent condition one of the first acquaintances he met was officer keating the policeman who had a good memory for faces recognised him and stopped  so youre out young feller he said genially when not in the active discharge of his professional duties the policeman was a kindly man he bore mr buffin no grudge  um said mr buffin  feeling fine eh  um  goin round to see some of the chaps and pass them the time of day i shouldnt wonder  um  well you keep clear of that lot down in frith street young feller theyre no good and if you get mixed up with them first thing you know youll be in trouble again and you want to keep out of that now  um  if you never get into trouble said the policeman sententiously youll never have to get out of it  um said mr buffin if he had a fault as a conversationalist it was a certain tendency to monotony a certain lack of sparkle and variety in his smalltalk  constable keating with a dignified but friendly wave of the hand as one should say you have our leave to depart went on his way while mr buffin raging shuffled off in the opposite direction thinking as hard as his limited mental equipment would allow him  his thoughts which were many and confused finally composed themselves into some order he arrived at a definite conclusion which was that if the great settlement was to be carried through successfully it must be done when the policeman was off duty till then he had pictured himself catching officer keating in an unguarded moment on his beat this he now saw was out of the question on his beat the policeman had no unguarded moments there was a quiet alertness in his poise a dangersignal in itself  there was only one thing for mr buffin to do greatly as it would go against the grain he must foregather with the man win his confidence put himself in a position where he would be able to find out what he did with himself when off duty  the policeman offered no obstacle to the move a supreme selfconfidence was his leading characteristic few london policemen are diffident and mr keating was no exception it never occurred to him that there could be an ulterior motive behind mr buffins advances he regarded mr buffin much as one regards a dog which one has had to chastise one does not expect the dog to lie in wait and bite officer keating did not expect mr buffin to lie in wait and bite  so every day as he strolled on his beat there sidled up to him the meagre form of spider buffin every day there greeted him the spiders goodmorning mr keating till the sight of officer keating walking solidly along the pavement with spider buffin shuffling along at his side listening with rapt interest to his views on life and his hints on deportment became a familiar spectacle in clerkenwell                                        mr buffin played his part well in fact too well it was on the seventh day that sidling along in the direction of his favourite place of refreshment he found himself tapped on the shoulder at the same moment an arm linking itself in his brought him gently to a halt beside him were standing two of the most eminent of the great frith street gang otto the sausage and rabbit butler it was the finger of the rabbit that had tapped his shoulder the arm tucked in his was the arm of otto the sausage  hi spider said mr butler sid wants to see you a minute  the spiders legs felt boneless there was nothing in the words to alarm a man but his practised ear had seemed to detect a certain unpleasant dryness in the speakers tone sid marks the allpowerful leader of the frith street gang was a youth whose company the spider had always avoided with some care  the great sid seated in state at a neighbouring hostelry fixed his visitor with a cold and questioning eye mr buffin looked nervous and interrogative mr marks spoke  your pal keating pinched porky binns this mornin said sid  the spiders heart turned to water  you and that slop observed sid dreamily have been bloomin thick these days  mr buffin did not affect to misunderstand sid marks was looking at him in that nasty way otto the sausage was looking at him in that nasty way rabbit butler was looking at him in that nasty way this was an occasion where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at to be misunderstood in the circles in which mr buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure  he began to explain with feverish eagerness  strike me sid he stammered it aint like that its all right blimey you dont fink im a nark  mr marks chewed a straw in silence  im layin for him sid babbled mr buffin thats true strike me if it aint im just tryin to find out where he goes when hes off duty he pinched me so im layin for him  mr marks perpended rabbit butler respectfully gave it as his opinion that it would be well to put mr buffin through it there was nothing like being on the safe side by putting mr buffin through it argued rabbit butler they would stand to win either way if he had smitched to officer keating about porky binns he would deserve it if he had notwell it would prevent him doing so on some future occasion play for safety was mr butlers advice seconded by otto the sausage mr buffin pale to the lips thought he had never met two more unpleasant persons  the great sid having chewed his straw for a while in silence delivered judgment the prisoner should have the benefit of the doubt this time his story however unplausible might possibly be true officer keating undoubtedly had pinched him that was in his favour  you can hop it this time he said but if you ever do start smitchin spider yer knows whatll happen  mr buffin withdrew quaking  matters had now come to a head unless he very speedily gave proof of his pure and noble intentions life would become extremely unsafe for him he must act at once the thought of what would happen should another of the frith streeters be pinched before he mr buffin could prove himself innocent of the crime of friendliness with officer keating turned him cold  fate played into his hands on the very next morning mr keating all unsuspecting asked him to go to his home with a message for his wife  tell her said mr keating a newspaper gent has given me seats for the play tonight and ill be home at a quarter to seven  mr buffin felt as cromwell must have felt at dunbar when the scots left their stronghold on the hills and came down to the open plain  the winter had set in with some severity that year and mr buffins toes as he stood in the shadows close to the entrance of the villa where officer keating lived when off duty were soon thoroughly frozen he did not dare to stamp his feet for at any moment now the victim might arrive and when the victim weighs fourteen stone against the high priests eight and a half it behooves the latter to be circumspect if the sacrifice is to be anything like a success so mr buffin waited and froze in silence it was a painful process and he added it to the black score which already stood against officer keating never had his thirst for revenge been more tormenting it is doubtful if a strictly logical and impartial judge would have held mr keating to blame for the fact that sid marks suspicions and all that those suspicions entailed had fallen upon mr buffin but the spider did so he felt fiercely resentful against the policeman for placing him in such an unpleasant and dangerous position as his thoughts ran on the matter he twisted his fingers tighter round his stick  as he did so there came from down the road the brisk tramp of feet and a cheerful whistling of the wearing of the green it is a lugubrious song as a rule but as rendered by officer keating returning home with theatre tickets it had all the joyousness of a marchtune  every muscle in mr buffins body stiffened he gripped his stick and waited the road was deserted in another moment  and then from nowhere dark indistinct forms darted out like rats the whistling stopped in the middle of a bar a deepchested oath rang out and then a confused medley of sound the rasping of feet a growling almost canine a sharp yelp gasps and over all the vast voice of officer keating threatening slaughter  for a moment mr buffin stood incapable of motion the thing had been so sudden so unexpected and then as he realised what was happening there swept over him in a wave a sense of intolerable injustice it is not easy to describe his emotions but they resembled most nearly those of an inventor whose patent has been infringed or an author whose idea has been stolen for weeksand weeks that had seemed like yearshe had marked down officer keating for his prey for weeks he had tortured a mind all unused to thinking into providing him with schemes for accomplishing his end he had outraged his nature by being civil to a policeman he had risked his life by incurring the suspicions of sid marks he had bought a stick and he had waited in the cold till his face was blue and his feet blocks of ice and now  now  after all this  a crowd of irresponsible strangers with no rights in the man whatsoever probably if the truth were known filled with mere ignoble desire for his small change had dared to rush in and jump his claim before his very eyes  with one passionate cry mr buffin forgetting his frozen feet lifted his stick and galloped down the road to protect his property  thats the stuff said a voice pour some more into him jerry  mr buffin opened his eyes a familiar taste was in his mouth somebody of liberal ideas seemed to be pouring whisky down his throat could this be heaven he raised his head and a sharp pain shot through it and with the pain came recollection he remembered now dimly as if it had all happened in another life the mad rush down the road the momentary pause in the conflict and then its noisy renewal on a more impressive scale he remembered striking out left and right with his stick he remembered the cries of the wounded the pain of his frozen feet and finally the crash of something hard and heavy on his head  he sat up and found himself the centre of a little crowd there was officer keating dishevelled but intact three other policemen one of whom was kneeling by his side with a small bottle in his hand and in the grip of the two were standing two youths  one was otto the sausage the other was rabbit butler  the kneeling policeman was proffering the bottle once more mr buffin snatched at it he felt that it was just what at that moment he needed most                                        he did what he could the magistrate asked for his evidence he said he had none he said he thought there must be some mistake with a twisted smile in the direction of the prisoners he said that he did not remember having seen either of them at the combat he didnt believe they were there at all he didnt believe they were capable of such a thing if there was one man who was less likely to assault a policeman than otto the sausage it was rabbit butler the bench reminded him that both these innocents had actually been discovered in officer keatings grasp mr buffin smiled a harassed smile and wiped a drop of perspiration from his brow  officer keating was enthusiastic he described the affair from start to finish but for mr buffin he would have been killed but for mr buffin there would have been no prisoners in court that day the world was full of men with more or less golden hearts but there was only one mr buffin might he shake hands with mr buffin  the magistrate ruled that he might more he would shake hands with him himself summoning mr buffin behind his desk he proceeded to do so if there were more men like mr buffin london would be a better place it was the occasional discovery in our midst of ethereal natures like that of mr buffin which made one so confident for the future of the race  the paragon shuffled out it was bright and sunny in the street but in mr buffins heart there was no sunlight he was not a quick thinker but he had come quite swiftly to the conclusion that london was no longer the place for him sid marks had been in court chewing a straw and listening with grave attention to the evidence and for one moment mr buffin had happened to catch his eye no medical testimony as to the unhealthiness of london could have moved him more  once round the corner he ran it hurt his head to run but there were things behind him that could hurt his head more than running                                        at the entrance to the tube he stopped to leave the locality he must have money he felt in his pockets slowly one by one he pulled forth his little valuables his knife  his revolver  the magistrates gold watch  he inspected them sadly they must all go  he went into a pawnbrokers shop at the corner of the street a few moments later with money in his pockets he dived into the tube     the best sauce   eve hendrie sat up in bed for two hours she had been trying to get to sleep but without success never in her life had she felt more wakeful  there were two reasons for this her mind was disturbed and she was very hungry neither sensation was novel to her since first she had become paid companion to mrs rastallretford there had hardly been a moment when she had not been hungry some time before mrs rastallretfords doctor had recommended to that lady a spartan diet and in this eve as companion had unwillingly to share it was not pleasant for either of them but at least mrs rastallretford had the knowledge that she had earned it by years of honest selfindulgence eve had not that consolation  meagre fare moreover had the effect of accentuating mrs rastallretfords always rather pronounced irritability she was a massive lady with a prominent forehead some halfdozen chins and a manner towards those in her employment which would have been resented in a second mate by the crew of a western ocean tramp even at her best she was no ray of sunshine about the house and since the beginning of the selfdenying ordinance she had been at her worst  but it was not depression induced by her employer that was disturbing eve that was a permanent evil what was agitating her so extremely tonight was the unexpected arrival of peter rayner  it was eves practice to tell herself several times a day that she had no sentiment for peter rayner but dislike she did not attempt to defend her attitude logically but nevertheless she clung to it and tonight when he entered the drawingroom she had endeavoured to convey by her manner that it was only with the greatest difficulty that she remembered him at all and that having accomplished that feat she now intended to forget him again immediately and he had grinned a cheerful affectionate grin and beamed on her without a break till bedtime  before coming as companion to mrs rastallretford eve had been governess to hildebrand aged six the son of a mrs elphinstone it had been on the whole a comfortable situation she had not liked mrs elphinstone but hildebrand had been docile and altogether life was quite smooth and pleasant until mrs elphinstones brother came for a visit peter rayner was that brother  there is a type of man who makes love with the secrecy and sheepish reserve of a cowboy shooting up a wild west saloon to this class peter belonged he fell in love with eve at sight and if at the end of the first day there was anyone in the house who was not aware of it it was only hildebrand aged six and even hildebrand must have had his suspicions  mrs elphinstone was among the first to become aware of it for two days frostily silent and gimletlike as to the eye she observed peters hurricane wooing from afar then she acted peter she sent to london pacifying him with an invitation to return to the house in the following week this done she proceeded to eliminate eve in the course of the parting interview she expressed herself perhaps a little less guardedly than was either just or considerate and eve flushed and at war with the whole race of rayners departed that afternoon to seek a situation elsewhere she had found it at the house of mrs rastallretford  and now this evening as she sat in the drawingroom playing the piano to her employer in had walked the latters son a tall nervous young man perpetually clearing his throat and fiddling with a pair of goldrimmed glasses with the announcement that he had brought his friend mr rayner to spend a few days in the old home  eve could still see the look on peters face as having shaken hands with his hostess he turned to her it was the look of the cowboy who his weary ride over sees through the dusk the friendly gleam of the saloon windows and with a happy sigh reaches for his revolver there could be no two meanings to that look it said as clearly as if he had shouted it that this was no accidental meeting that he had tracked her down and proposed to resume matters at the point where they had left off  eve was indignant it was abominable that he should pursue her in this way she sat thinking how abominable it was for five minutes and then it suddenly struck her that she was hungrier than ever she had forgotten her material troubles for the moment it seemed to her now that she was quite faint with hunger  a cuckoo clock outside the door struck one and as it did so it came to eve that on the sideboard in the diningroom there were biscuits  a moment later she was creeping softly down the stairs                                        it was dark and ghostly on the stairs the house was full of noises she was glad when she reached the diningroom it would be pleasant to switch on the light she pushed open the door and uttered a cry the light was already switched on and at the table his back to her was a man  there was no time for flight he must have heard the door open in another moment he would turn and spring  she spoke tremulously  dontdont move im pointing a pistol at you  the man did not move  foolish child he said indulgently suppose it went off  she uttered an exclamation of surprise  you what are you doing here mr rayner  she moved into the room and her relief changed swiftly into indignation on the table were half a chicken a loaf some cold potatoes and a bottle of beer  im eating thank goodness said peter helping himself to a cold potato i had begun to think i never should again  eating  eating i know a man of sensibility and refinement ought to shrink from raiding his hostesss larder in the small hours but hungers death to the finer feelings its the solar plexus punch which puts ones better self down and out for the count of ten i am a large and healthy young man and believe me i need this little snack i need it badly may i cut you a slice of chicken  she could hardly bear to look at it but pride gave her strength  no she snapped  youre sure poor little thing i know youre half starved  eve stamped  how dare you speak to me like that mr rayner  he drank bottled beer thoughtfully  what made you come down i suppose you heard a noise and thought it was burglars he said  yes said eve thankfully accepting the idea at all costs she must conceal the biscuit motive  that was very plucky of you wont you sit down  no im going back to bed  not just yet ive several things to talk to you about sit down thats right now cover up your poor little pink ankles or youll be catching  she started up  mr rayner  sit down  she looked at him defiantly then wondering at herself for doing it sat down  now said peter what do you mean by it what do you mean by dashing off from my sisters house without leaving a word for me as to where you were going you knew i loved you  good night mr rayner  sit down youve given me a great deal of trouble do you know it cost me a sovereign in tips to find out your address i couldnt get it out of my sister and i had to apply to the butler ive a good mind to knock it off your first weeks pinmoney  i shall not stay here listening  you knew perfectly well i wanted to marry you but you fly off without a word and bury yourself in this benighted place with a gorgon who nags and bullies you  a nice way to speak of your hostess said eve scornfully  a very soothing way i dont think i ever took such a dislike to a woman at first sight before and when she started to bullyrag you it was all i could dobut it wont last long now you must come away at once well be married after christmas and in the meantime you can go and live with my sister  eve listened speechlessly she had so much to say that the difficulty of selection rendered her dumb  when can you start i mean do you have to give a months notice or anything  eve got up with a short laugh  good night mr rayner she said you have been very amusing but i am getting tired  im glad its all settled said peter good night  eve stopped she could not go tamely away without saying a single one of the things that crowded in her mind  do you imagine she said that i intend to marry you do you suppose for one moment  rather said peter you shall have a splendid time from now on to make up for all youve gone through im going to be awfully good to you eve you shant ever have any more worries poor old thing he looked at her affectionately i wonder why it is that large men always fall in love with little women there are you a fragile fairylike ethereal wisp of a little creature and here am i  a great big greedy pig burst out eve who thinks about nothing but eating and drinking  i wasnt going to have put it quite like that said peter thoughtfully  i hate a greedy man said eve between her teeth  i have a healthy appetite protested peter nothing more it runs in the family at the time of the civil war the rayner of the period who was king charless righthand man would frequently eat despatches to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy he was noted for it  eve reached the door and turned  i despise you she said  good night said peter tenderly tomorrow morning well go for a walk  his prediction proved absolutely correct he was smoking a cigarette after breakfast when eve came to him her face was pink and mutinous but there was a gleam in her eye  are you ready to come out mr rayner she said mrs rastallretford says im to take you to see the view from the golf links  youll like that said peter  i shall not like it snapped eve but mrs rastallretford is paying me a salary to do what she tells me and i have to earn it  conversation during the walk consisted mainly of a monologue on the part of peter it was a crisp and exhilarating morning and he appeared to be feeling a universal benevolence towards all created things he even softened slightly on the subject of mrs rastallretford and advanced the theory that her peculiar manner might be due to her having been illtreated as a child  eve listened in silence it was not till they were nearing home on their return journey that she spoke  mr rayner she said  yes said peter  i was talking to mrs rastallretford after breakfast said eve and i told her something about you  my conscience is clear  oh nothing bad some people would say it was very much to your credit she looked away across the fields i told her you were a vegetarian she added carelessly  there was a long silence then peter spoke three words straight from the heart  you little devil  eve turned and looked at him her eyes sparkling wickedly  you see she said now perhaps you will go  without you said peter stoutly never  in london you will be able to eat all dayanything you like you will be able to creep about your club gnawing cold chicken all night but if you stay here  you have got a wrong idea of the london clubmans life said peter if i crept about my club gnawing cold chicken i should have the committee after me no i shall stay here and look after you after all what is food  ill tell you what yours will be if you like or would you rather wait and let it be a surprise well for lunch you will have some boiled potatoes and cabbage and a sweeta sort of light soufflé thing and for dinner  yes but one moment said peter if im a vegetarian how did you account for my taking all the chicken i could get at dinner last night and looking as if i wanted more  oh that was your considerateness you didnt want to give trouble even if you had to sacrifice your principles but its all right now you are going to have your vegetables  peter drew a deep breaththe breath of the man who braces himself up and thanks whatever gods there be for his unconquerable soul  i dont care he said a book of verses underneath the bough a jug of wine and thou  oh and i forgot interrupted eve i told her you were a teetotaller as well  there was another silence longer than the first  the best train said eve at last is the tenfifty  he looked at her inquiringly  the best train  for london  what makes you think that i am interested in trains to london  eve bit her lip  mr rayner she said after a pause do you remember at lunch one day at mrs elphinstones refusing parsnips you said that so far as you were concerned parsnips were first by a mile and that prussic acid and strychnine also ran  well said peter  oh nothing said eve only i made a stupid mistake i told the cook you were devoted to parsnips im sorry  peter looked at her gravely im putting up with a lot for your sake he said  you neednt why dont you go away  and leave you chained to the rock andromeda not for perseus ive only been here one night but ive seen enough to know that ive got to take you away from this place honestly its killing you i was watching you last night youre scared if that infernal old woman starts to open her mouth shes crushing the life out of you im going to stay on here till you say youll marry me or till they throw me out  there are parsnips for dinner tonight said eve softly  i shall get to like them they are an acquired taste i expect perhaps i am too perhaps i am the human parsnip and you will have to learn to love me  you are the human burr said eve shortly i shouldnt have thought it possible for a man to behave as you are doing                                        in spite of herself there were moments during the next few days when eve felt twinges of remorse it was only by telling herself that he had no right to have followed her to this house and that he was at perfect liberty to leave whenever he wished that she could harden her heart again and even this reflection was not entirely satisfactory for it made her feel how fond he must be of her to endure these evils for her sake  and there was no doubt about there being evils it was a dreary house in which to spend winter days there were no books that one could possibly read the nearest railway station was five miles away there was not even a dog to talk to generally it rained though eve saw little of peter except at meals and in the drawingroom after dinnerfor mrs rastallretford spent most of the day in her own sittingroom and required eve to be at her sideshe could picture his sufferings and try as she would she could not keep herself from softening a little her pride was weakening constant attendance on her employer was beginning to have a bad effect on her nerves association in a subordinate capacity with mrs rastallretford did not encourage a proud and spirited outlook on life  her imagination had not exaggerated peters sufferings many people consider that dante has spoken the last word on the postmortem housing of the criminal classes peter after the first week of his visit could have given him a few new ideas                                      it is unpleasant to be half starved it is unpleasant to be cooped up in a countryhouse in winter with nothing to do it is unpleasant to have to sit at meals and listen to the only girl you have ever really loved being bullyragged by an old lady with six chins and all these unpleasantnesses were occurring to peter simultaneously it is highly creditable to him that the last should completely have outweighed the others  he was generally alone mr rastallretford who would have been better than nothing as a companion was a man who enjoyed solitude he was a confirmed vanisher he would be present at one moment the next he would have glided silently away and even on the rare occasions when he decided not to vanish he seldom did much more than clear his throat nervously and juggle with his pincenez  peter in his boyhood had been thrilled once by a narrative of a man who got stuck in the sargasso sea it seemed to him now that the monotony of the sargasso sea had been greatly exaggerated  nemesis was certainly giving peter his due he had wormed his way into the rastallretford homecircle by grossly deceitful means the moment he heard that eve had gone to live with mrs rastallretford and had ascertained that the rastallretford with whom he had been at cambridge and whom he still met occasionally at his club when he did not see him first was this ladys son he had set himself to court young mr rastallretford he had cornered him at the club and begun to talk about the dear old varsity days ignoring the embarrassment of the latter whose only clear recollection of the dear old varsity days as linking peter and himself was of a certain bumpsupper night when sundry of the festive led and inspired by peter had completely wrecked his rooms and shaved off half a growing moustache he conveyed to young mr rastallretford the impression that in the dear old varsity days they had shared each others joys and sorrows and generally had made damon and pythias look like a pair of crosstalk knockabouts at one of the rowdier musichalls not to invite so old a friend to stay at his home if he ever happened to be down that way would he hinted be grossly churlish mr rastallretford impressed issued the invitation and now peter was being punished for his deceit nemesis may not be an alfred shrubb but give her time and she gets there                                        it was towards the middle of the second week of his visit that eve coming into the drawingroom before dinner found peter standing in front of the fire they had not been alone together for several days  well said he  eve went to the fire and warmed her hands  well she said dispiritedly  she was feeling nervous and ill mrs rastallretford had been in one of her more truculent moods all day and for the first time eve had the sensation of being thoroughly beaten she dreaded the long hours to bedtime the thought that there might be bridge after dinner made her feel physically ill she felt she could not struggle through a bridge night  on the occasions when she was in one of her dangerous moods mrs rastallretford sometimes chose rest as a cure sometimes relaxation rest meant that she retired to her room immediately after dinner and expended her venom on her maid relaxation meant bridge and bridge seemed to bring out all her worst points they played the game for counters at her house and there had been occasions in eves experience when the loss of a hundred or so of these useful little adjuncts to fun in the home had lashed her almost into a frenzy she was one of those bridge players who keep up a running quarrel with fate during the game and when she was not abusing fate she was generally reproaching her partner eve was always her partner and tonight she devoutly hoped that her employer would elect to rest she always played badly with mrs rastallretford through sheer nervousness once she had revoked and there had been a terrible moment and much subsequent recrimination  peter looked at her curiously  youre pale tonight he said  i have a headache  hm how is our hostess fair or stormy  as i was passing her door i heard her bullying her maid so i suppose stormy  that means a bad time for you he said sympathetically  i suppose so if we play bridge but she may go to bed directly after dinner  she tried to keep her voice level but he detected the break  eve he said quickly wont you let me take you away from here youve no business in this sort of game youre not tough enough youve got to be loved and made a fuss of and  she laughed shakily  perhaps you can give me the address of some lady who wants a companion to love and make a fuss of  i can give you the address of a man  she rested an arm on the mantelpiece and stood looking into the blaze without replying  before he could speak again there was a step outside the door and mrs rastallretford rustled into the room  eve had not misread the stormsignals her employers mood was still as it had been earlier in the day dinner passed in almost complete silence mrs rastallretford sat brooding dumbly her eye was cold and menacing and peter working his way through his vegetables shuddered for eve he had understood her allusion to bridge having been privileged several times during his stay to see his hostess play that game and he hoped that there would be no bridge tonight  and this was unselfish of him for bridge meant sandwiches punctually at nine oclock on bridge nights the butler would deposit on a sidetable a plate of chicken sandwiches and in deference to peters vegetarian views a smaller plate of cheese sandwiches at the close of play mrs rastallretford would take one sandwich from each plate drink a thimbleful of weak whisky and water and retire  peter could always do with a sandwich or two these days but he was prepared to abandon them joyfully if his hostess would waive bridge for this particular evening  it was not to be in the drawingroom mrs rastallretford came out of her trance and called imperiously for the cards peter when he saw his hand after the first deal had a presentiment that if all his hands were to be as good as this the evening was going to be a trying one on the other occasions when they had played he had found it an extremely difficult task even with moderate cards to bring it about that his hostess should always win the odd rubber for he was an excellent player and like most good players had an artistic conscience which made it painful to him to play a deliberately bad game even from the best motives if all his hands were going to be as strong as this first one he saw that there was disaster ahead he could not help winning  mrs rastallretford who had dealt the first hand made a most improper diamond declaration her son unfilially doubled and eve having chicanea tragedy which her partner evidently seemed to consider could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary common sensepeter and his partner despite peters best efforts won the game handsomely  the son of the house dealt the next hand eve sorted her cards listlessly she was feeling curiously tired her brain seemed dulled  this hand as the first had done went all in favour of the two men mr rastallretford won five tricks in succession and judging from the glitter in his mild eye was evidently going to win as many more as he possibly could mrs rastallretford glowered silently there was electricity in the air  the son of the house led a club eve played a card mechanically  have you no clubs miss hendrie  eve started and looked at her hand  no she said  mrs rastallretford grunted suspiciously  not long ago in westport connecticut usa a young man named harold sperry a telephone worker was boring a hole in the wall of a house with a view to passing a wire through it he whistled joyously as he worked he did not know that he had selected for purposes of perforation the exact spot where there lay nestling in the brickwork a large leaden waterpipe the first intimation he had of that fact was when a jet of water suddenly knocked him fifteen feet into a rosebush  as harold felt then so did eve now when examining her hand once more to make certain that she had no clubs she discovered the ace of that ilk peeping coyly out from behind the seven of spades  her face turned quite white it is never pleasant to revoke at bridge but to eve just then it seemed a disaster beyond words she looked across at her partner her imagination pictured the scene there would be ere long unless  it happens every now and then that the human brain shows in a crisis an unwonted flash of speed eves did at this juncture to her in her trouble there came a sudden idea  she looked round the table mr rastallretford having taken the last trick had gathered it up in the introspective manner of one planning big coups and was brooding tensely with knit brows his mother was frowning over her cards she was unobserved  she seized the opportunity she rose from her seat moved quickly to the sidetable and turning her back slipped the fatal card dexterously into the interior of a cheese sandwich  mrs rastallretford absorbed did not notice for an instant then she gave tongue  what are you doing miss hendrie  eve was breathing quickly  ii thought that mr rayner might like a sandwich  she was at his elbow with the plate it trembled in her hand  a sandwich kindly do not be so officious miss hendrie the ideain the middle of a hand her voice died away in a resentful mumble  peter started he had been allowing his thoughts to wander he looked from the sandwich to eve and then at the sandwich again he was puzzled this had the aspect of being an olivebranchcould it be could she be meaning or was it a subtle insult who could say at any rate it was a sandwich and he seized it without prejudice  i hope at least you have had the sense to remember that mr rayner is a vegetarian miss hendrie said mrs rastallretford that is not a chicken sandwich  no said eve it is not a chicken sandwich  peter beamed gratefully he raised the olivebranch and bit into it with the energy of a starving man and as he did so he caught eves eye  miss hendrie cried mrs rastallretford  eve started violently  miss hendrie will you be good enough to play the king of clubs to beat i cant think whats the matter with you tonight  im very sorry said eve and put down the nine of spades  mrs rastallretford glared  this is absurd she cried you must have the ace of clubs if you have not got it who has look through your hand again is it there  no  then where can it be  where can it be echoed peter taking another bite  whywhy said eve crimson iihave only five cards i ought to have six  five said mrs rastallretford nonsense count again have you dropped it on the floor  mr rastallretford stooped and looked under the table  it is not on the floor he said i suppose it must have been missing from the pack before i dealt  mrs rastallretford threw down her cards and rose ponderously it offended her vaguely that there seemed to be nobody to blame i shall go to bed she said                                        peter stood before the fire and surveyed eve as she sat on the sofa they were alone in the room mr rastallretford having drifted silently away in the wake of his mother suddenly eve began to laugh helplessly  he shook his head at her  this is considerably sharper than a serpents tooth he said you should be fawning gratefully upon me not laughing do you suppose king charles laughed at my ancestor when he ate the despatches however for the first time since i have been in this house i feel as if i had had a square meal  eve became suddenly serious the smile left her face  mr rayner please dont think im ungrateful i couldnt help laughing but i cant tell you how grateful i am you dont know what it would have been like if she had found out that i had revoked i did it once before and she kept on about it for days and days it was awful she shivered i think you must be right and my nerves are going  he nodded  so are youtomorrow by the first train i wonder how soon we can get married do you know anything about special licenses  she looked at him curiously  youre very obstinate she said  firm he corrected firm could you pack tonight do you think and be ready for that tenfifty tomorrow morning  she began to trace an intricate pattern on the floor with the point of her shoe  i cant imagine why you are fond of me she said ive been very horrid to you  nonsense youve been all thats sweet and womanly  and i want to tell you why she went on youryour sister  ah i thought as much  sheshe saw that you seemed to be getting fond of me and she  she would  said some rather horrid things thathurt said eve in a low voice  peter crossed over to where she sat and took her hand  dont you worry about her he said shes not a bad sort really but about once every six months she needs a brotherly talkingto or she gets above herself one is about due during the next few days  he stroke her hand  fasting he said thoughtfully clears and stimulates the brain i fancy i shall be able to think out some rather special things to say to her this time     jeeves and the chump cyril   you know the longer i live the more clearly i see that half the trouble in this bally world is caused by the lighthearted and thoughtless way in which chappies dash off letters of introduction and hand them to other chappies to deliver to chappies of the third part its one of those things that make you wish you were living in the stone age what i mean to say is if a fellow in those days wanted to give anyone a letter of introduction he had to spend a month or so carving it on a largesized boulder and the chances were that the other chappie got so sick of lugging the thing round in the hot sun that he dropped it after the first mile but nowadays its so easy to write letters of introduction that everybody does it without a second thought with the result that some perfectly harmless cove like myself gets in the soup  mark you all the above is what you might call the result of my riper experience i dont mind admitting that in the first flush of the thing so to speak when jeeves told methis would be about three weeks after id landed in americathat a blighter called cyril bassingtonbassington had arrived and i found that he had brought a letter of introduction to me from aunt agatha  where was i oh yes  i dont mind admitting i was saying that just at first i was rather bucked you see after the painful events which had resulted in my leaving england i hadnt expected to get any sort of letter from aunt agatha which would pass the censor so to speak and it was a pleasant surprise to open this one and find it almost civil chilly perhaps in parts but on the whole quite tolerably polite i looked on the thing as a hopeful sign sort of olivebranch you know or do i mean orange blossom what im getting at is that the fact that aunt agatha was writing to me without calling me names seemed more or less like a step in the direction of peace  and i was all for peace and that right speedily im not saying a word against new york mind you i liked the place and was having quite a ripe time there but the fact remains that a fellow whos been used to london all his life does get a trifle homesick on a foreign strand and i wanted to pop back to the cosy old flat in berkeley streetwhich could only be done when aunt agatha had simmered down and got over the glossop episode i know that london is a biggish city but believe me it isnt half big enough for any fellow to live in with aunt agatha when shes after him with the old hatchet and so im bound to say i looked on this chump bassingtonbassington when he arrived more or less as a dove of peace and was all for him  he would seem from contemporary accounts to have blown in one morning at sevenfortyfive that being the ghastly sort of hour they shoot you off the liner in new york he was given the respectful raspberry by jeeves and told to try again about three hours later when there would be a sporting chance of my having sprung from my bed with a glad cry to welcome another day and all that sort of thing which was rather decent of jeeves by the way for it so happened that there was a slight estrangement a touch of coldness a bit of a row in other words between us at the moment because of some rather priceless purple socks which i was wearing against his wishes and a lesser man might easily have snatched at the chance of getting back at me a bit by loosing cyril into my bedchamber at a moment when i couldnt have stood a twominutes conversation with my dearest pal for until i have had my early cup of tea and have brooded on life for a bit absolutely undisturbed im not much of a lad for the merry chitchat  so jeeves very sportingly shot cyril out into the crisp morning air and didnt let me know of his existence till he brought his card in with the bohea  and what might all this be jeeves i said giving the thing the glassy gaze  the gentleman has arrived from england i understand sir he called to see you earlier in the day  good lord jeeves you dont mean to say the day starts earlier than this  he desired me to say he would return later sir  ive never heard of him have you ever heard of him jeeves  i am familiar with the name bassingtonbassington sir there are three branches of the bassingtonbassington familythe shropshire bassingtonbassingtons the hampshire bassingtonbassingtons and the kent bassingtonbassingtons  england seems pretty well stocked up with bassingtonbassingtons  tolerably so sir  no chance of a sudden shortage i mean what  presumably not sir  and what sort of a specimen is this one  i could not say sir on such short acquaintance  will you give me a sporting two to one jeeves judging from what you have seen of him that this chappie is not a blighter or an excrescence  no sir i should not care to venture such liberal odds  i knew it well the only thing that remains to be discovered is what kind of a blighter he is  time will tell sir the gentleman brought a letter for you sir  oh he did did he i said and grasped the communication and then i recognised the handwriting i say jeeves this is from my aunt agatha  indeed sir  dont dismiss it in that light way dont you see what this means she says she wants me to look after this excrescence while hes in new york by jove jeeves if i only fawn on him a bit so that he sends back a favourable report to headquarters i may yet be able to get back to england in time for goodwood now is certainly the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party jeeves we must rally round and cosset this cove in no uncertain manner  yes sir  he isnt going to stay in new york long i said taking another look at the letter hes headed for washington going to give the nibs there the onceover apparently before taking a whirl at the diplomatic service i should say that we can win this lads esteem and affection with a lunch and a couple of dinners what  i fancy that should be entirely adequate sir  this is the jolliest thing thats happened since we left england it looks to me as if the sun were breaking through the clouds  very possibly sir  he started to put out my things and there was an awkward sort of silence  not those socks jeeves i said gulping a bit but having a dash at the careless offhand tone give me the purple ones  i beg your pardon sir  those jolly purple ones  very good sir  he lugged them out of the drawer as if he were a vegetarian fishing a caterpillar out of the salad you could see he was feeling deeply deuced painful and all that this sort of thing but a chappie has got to assert himself every now and then absolutely                                       i was looking for cyril to show up again any time after breakfast but he didnt appear so towards one oclock i trickled out to the lambs club where i had an appointment to feed the wooster face with a cove of the name of caffyn id got pally with since my arrivalgeorge caffyn a fellow who wrote plays and what not id made a lot of friends during my stay in new york the city being crammed with bonhomous lads who one and all extended a welcoming hand to the stranger in their midst  caffyn was a bit late but bobbed up finally saying that he had been kept at a rehearsal of his new musical comedy ask dad and we started in we had just reached the coffee when the waiter came up and said that jeeves wanted to see me  jeeves was in the waitingroom he gave the socks one pained look as i came in then averted his eyes  mr bassingtonbassington has just telephoned sir  oh  yes sir  where is he  in prison sir  i reeled against the wallpaper a nice thing to happen to aunt agathas nominee on his first morning under my wing i did not think  in prison  yes sir he said on the telephone that he had been arrested and would be glad if you could step round and bail him out  arrested what for  he did not favour me with his confidence in that respect sir  this is a bit thick jeeves  precisely sir  i collected old george who very decently volunteered to stagger along with me and we hopped into a taxi we sat around at the policestation for a bit on a wooden bench in a sort of anteroom and presently a policeman appeared leading in cyril  halloa halloa halloa i said what  my experience is that a fellow never really looks his best just after hes come out of a cell when i was up at oxford i used to have a regular job bailing out a pal of mine who never failed to get pinched every boatrace night and he always looked like something that had been dug up by the roots cyril was in pretty much the same sort of shape he had a black eye and a torn collar and altogether was nothing to write home aboutespecially if one was writing to aunt agatha he was a thin tall chappie with a lot of light hair and paleblue goggly eyes which made him look like one of the rarer kinds of fish  i got your message i said  oh are you bertie wooster  absolutely and this is my pal george caffyn writes plays and what not dont you know  we all shook hands and the policeman having retrieved a piece of chewinggum from the underside of a chair where he had parked it against a rainy day went off into a corner and began to contemplate the infinite  this is a rotten country said cyril  oh i dont know you know dont you know i said  we do our best said george  old george is an american i explained writes plays dont you know and what not  of course i didnt invent the country said george that was columbus but i shall be delighted to consider any improvements you may suggest and lay them before the proper authorities  well why dont the policemen in new york dress properly  george took a look at the chewing officer across the room  i dont see anything missing he said  i mean to say why dont they wear helmets like they do in london why do they look like postmen it isnt fair on a fellow makes it dashed confusing i was simply standing on the pavement looking at things when a fellow who looked like a postman prodded me in the ribs with a club i didnt see why i should have postmen prodding me why the dickens should a fellow come three thousand miles to be prodded by postmen  the point is well taken said george what did you do  i gave him a shove you know ive got a frightfully hasty temper you know all the bassingtonbassingtons have got frightfully hasty tempers dont you know and then he biffed me in the eye and lugged me off to this beastly place  ill fix it old son i said and i hauled out the bankroll and went off to open negotiations leaving cyril to talk to george i dont mind admitting that i was a bit perturbed there were furrows in the old brow and i had a kind of foreboding feeling as long as this chump stayed in new york i was responsible for him and he didnt give me the impression of being the species of cove a reasonable chappie would care to be responsible for for more than about three minutes  i mused with a considerable amount of tensity over cyril that night when i had got home and jeeves had brought me the final whisky i couldnt help feeling that this visit of his to america was going to be one of those times that try mens souls and what not i hauled out aunt agathas letter of introduction and reread it and there was no getting away from the fact that she undoubtedly appeared to be somewhat wrapped up in this blighter and to consider it my mission in life to shield him from harm while on the premises i was deuced thankful that he had taken such a liking for george caffyn old george being a steady sort of cove after i had got him out of his dungeoncell he and old george had gone off together as chummy as brothers to watch the afternoon rehearsal of ask dad there was some talk i gathered of their dining together i felt pretty easy in my mind while george had his eye on him  i had got about as far as this in my meditations when jeeves came in with a telegram at least it wasnt a telegram it was a cablefrom aunt agathaand this is what it said     has cyril bassingtonbassington called yet on no account introduce    him into theatrical circles vitally important letter follows  i read it a couple of times  this is rummy jeeves  yes sir  very rummy and dashed disturbing  will there be anything further tonight sir  of course if he was going to be as bally unsympathetic as that there was nothing to be done my idea had been to show him the cable and ask his advice but if he was letting those purple socks rankle to that extent the good old noblesse oblige of the woosters couldnt lower itself to the extent of pleading with the man absolutely not so i gave it a miss  nothing more thanks  good night sir  good night  he floated away and i sat down to think the thing over i had been directing the best efforts of the old bean to the problem for a matter of half an hour when there was a ring at the bell i went to the door and there was cyril looking pretty festive  ill come in for a bit if i may he said got something rather priceless to tell you  he curveted past me into the sittingroom and when i got there after shutting the front door i found him reading aunt agathas cable and giggling in a rummy sort of manner oughtnt to have looked at this i suppose caught sight of my name and read it without thinking i say wooster old friend of my youth this is rather funny do you mind if i have a drink thanks awfully and all that sort of rot yes its rather funny considering what i came to tell you jolly old caffyn has given me a small part in that musical comedy of his ask dad only a bit you know but quite tolerably ripe im feeling frightfully braced dont you know  he drank his drink and went on he didnt seem to notice that i wasnt jumping about the room yapping with joy  you know ive always wanted to go on the stage you know he said but my jolly old guvnor wouldnt stick it at any price put the old waukeesi down with a bang and turned bright purple whenever the subject was mentioned thats the real reason why i came over here if you want to know i knew there wasnt a chance of my being able to work this stage wheeze in london without somebody getting on to it and tipping off the guvnor so i rather brainily sprang the scheme of popping over to washington to broaden my mind theres nobody to interfere on this side you see so i can go right ahead  i tried to reason with the poor chump  but your guvnor will have to know some time  thatll be all right i shall be the jolly old star by then and he wont have a leg to stand on  it seems to me hell have one leg to stand on while he kicks me with the other  why where do you come in what have you got to do with it  i introduced you to george caffyn  so you did old top so you did id quite forgotten i ought to have thanked you before well so long theres an early rehearsal of ask dad tomorrow morning and i must be toddling rummy the thing should be called ask dad when thats just what im not going to do see what i mean what what well pippip  toodleoo i said sadly and the blighter scudded off i dived for the phone and called up george caffyn  i say george whats all this about cyril bassingtonbassington  what about him  he tells me youve given him a part in your show  oh yes just a few lines  but ive just had fiftyseven cables from home telling me on no account to let him go on the stage  im sorry but cyril is just the type i need for that part hes simply got to be himself  its pretty tough on me george old man my aunt agatha sent this blighter over with a letter of introduction to me and she will hold me responsible  shell cut you out of her will  it isnt a question of money butof course youve never met my aunt agatha so its rather hard to explain but shes a sort of human vampirebat and shell make things most fearfully unpleasant for me when i go back to england shes the kind of woman who comes and rags you before breakfast dont you know  well dont go back to england then stick here and become president  but george old top  good night  but i say george old man  you didnt get my last remark it was good night you idle rich may not need any sleep but ive got to be bright and fresh in the morning god bless you  i felt as if i hadnt a friend in the world i was so jolly well worked up that i went and banged on jeevess door it wasnt a thing id have cared to do as a rule but it seemed to me that now was the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party so to speak and that it was up to jeeves to rally round the young master even if it broke up his beautysleep  jeeves emerged in a brown dressinggown  sir  deuced sorry to wake you up jeeves and what not but all sorts of dashed disturbing things have been happening  i was not asleep it is my practice on retiring to read a few pages of some instructive book  thats good what i mean to say is if youve just finished exercising the old bean its probably in midseason form for tackling problems jeeves mr bassingtonbassington is going on the stage  indeed sir  ah the thing doesnt hit you you dont get it properly heres the point all his family are most fearfully dead against his going on the stage theres going to be no end of trouble if he isnt headed off and whats worse my aunt agatha will blame me you see  i see sir  well cant you think of some way of stopping him  not i confess at the moment sir  well have a stab at it  i will give the matter my best consideration sir will there be anything further tonight  i hope not ive had all i can stand already  very good sir  he popped off                                        the part which old george had written for the chump cyril took up about two pages of typescript but it might have been hamlet the way that poor misguided pinhead worked himself to the bone over it i suppose if i heard him his lines once i did it a dozen times in the first couple of days he seemed to think that my only feeling about the whole affair was one of enthusiastic admiration and that he could rely on my support and sympathy what with trying to imagine how aunt agatha was going to take this thing and being woken up out of the dreamless in the small hours every other night to give my opinion of some new bit of business which cyril had invented i became more or less the good old shadow and all the time jeeves remained still pretty cold and distant about the purple socks its this sort of thing that ages a chappie dont you know and makes his youthful joiedevivre go a bit groggy at the knees  in the middle of it aunt agathas letter arrived it took her about six pages to do justice to cyrils fathers feelings in regard to his going on the stage and about six more to give me a kind of sketch of what she would say think and do if i didnt keep him clear of injurious influences while he was in america the letter came by the afternoon mail and left me with a pretty firm conviction that it wasnt a thing i ought to keep to myself i didnt even wait to ring the bell i whizzed for the kitchen bleating for jeeves and butted into the middle of a regular teaparty of sorts seated at the table were a depressedlooking cove who might have been a valet or something and a boy in a norfolk suit the valetchappie was drinking a whisky and soda and the boy was being tolerably rough with some jam and cake  oh i say jeeves i said sorry to interrupt the feast of reason and flow of soul and so forth but  at this juncture the small boys eye hit me like a bullet and stopped me in my tracks it was one of those cold clammy accusing sort of eyesthe kind that makes you reach up to see if your tie is straight and he looked at me as if i were some sort of unnecessary product which cuthbert the cat had brought in after a ramble among the local ashcans he was a stoutish infant with a lot of freckles and a good deal of jam on his face  hallo hallo hallo i said what there didnt seem much else to say  the stripling stared at me in a nasty sort of way through the jam he may have loved me at first sight but the impression he gave me was that he didnt think a lot of me and wasnt betting much that i would improve a great deal on acquaintance i had a kind of feeling that i was about as popular with him as a cold welsh rabbit  whats your name he asked  my name oh wooster dont you know and what not  my pops richer than you are  that seemed to be all about me the child having said his say started in on the jam again i turned to jeeves  i say jeeves can you spare a moment i want to show you something  very good sir we toddled into the sittingroom  who is your little friend sidney the sunbeam jeeves  the young gentleman sir  its a loose way of describing him but i know what you mean  i trust i was not taking a liberty in entertaining him sir  not a bit if thats your idea of a large afternoon go ahead  i happened to meet the young gentleman taking a walk with his fathers valet sir whom i used to know somewhat intimately in london and i ventured to invite them both to join me here  well never mind about him jeeves read this letter  he gave it the upanddown  very disturbing sir was all he could find to say  what are we going to do about it  time may provide a solution sir  on the other hand it maynt what  extremely true sir  wed got as far as this when there was a ring at the door jeeves shimmered off and cyril blew in full of good cheer and blitheringness  i say wooster old thing he said i want your advice you know this jolly old part of mine how ought i to dress it what i mean is the first act scene is laid in an hotel of sorts at about three in the afternoon what ought i to wear do you think  i wasnt feeling fit for a discussion of gents suitings  youd better consult jeeves i said  a hot and by no means unripe idea where is he  gone back to the kitchen i suppose  ill smite the good old bell shall i yes no  righto  jeeves poured silently in  oh i say jeeves began cyril i just wanted to have a syllable or two with you its this wayhallo whos this  i then perceived that the stout stripling had trickled into the room after jeeves he was standing near the door looking at cyril as if his worst fears had been realised there was a bit of a silence the child remained there drinking cyril in for about half a minute then he gave his verdict  fishface  eh what said cyril  the child who had evidently been taught at his mothers knee to speak the truth made his meaning a trifle clearer  youve a face like a fish  he spoke as if cyril was more to be pitied than censured which i am bound to say i thought rather decent and broadminded of him i dont mind admitting that whenever i looked at cyrils face i always had a feeling that he couldnt have got that way without its being mostly his own fault i found myself warming to this child absolutely dont you know i liked his conversation  it seemed to take cyril a moment or two really to grasp the thing and then you could hear the blood of the bassingtonbassingtons begin to sizzle  well im dashed he said im dashed if im not  i wouldnt have a face like that proceeded the child with a good deal of earnestness not if you gave me a million dollars he thought for a moment then corrected himself two million dollars he added  just what occurred then i couldnt exactly say but the next few minutes were a bit exciting i take it that cyril must have made a dive for the infant anyway the air seemed pretty well congested with arms and legs and things something bumped into the wooster waistcoat just around the third button and i collapsed on to the settee and rather lost interest in things for the moment when i had unscrambled myself i found that jeeves and the child had retired and cyril was standing in the middle of the room snorting a bit  whos that frightful little brute wooster  i dont know i never saw him before today  i gave him a couple of tolerably juicy buffets before he legged it i say wooster that kid said a dashed odd thing he yelled out something about jeeves promising him a dollar if he called meerwhat he said  it sounded pretty unlikely to me  what would jeeves do that for  it struck me as rummy too  where would be the sense of it  thats what i cant see  i mean to say its nothing to jeeves what sort of a face you have  no said cyril he spoke a little coldly i fancied i dont know why well ill be popping toodleoo  pippip  it must have been about a week after this rummy little episode that george caffyn called me up and asked me if i would care to go and see a runthrough of his show ask dad it seemed was to open out of town in schenectady on the following monday and this was to be a sort of preliminary dressrehearsal a preliminary dressrehearsal old george explained was the same as a regular dressrehearsal inasmuch as it was apt to look like nothing on earth and last into the small hours but more exciting because they wouldnt be timing the piece and consequently all the blighters who on these occasions let their angry passions rise would have plenty of scope for interruptions with the result that a pleasant time would be had by all  the thing was billed to start at eight oclock so i rolled up at tenfifteen so as not to have too long to wait before they began the dressparade was still going on george was on the stage talking to a cove in shirtsleeves and an absolutely round chappie with big spectacles and a practically hairless dome i had seen george with the latter merchant once or twice at the club and i knew that he was blumenfield the manager i waved to george and slid into a seat at the back of the house so as to be out of the way when the fighting started presently george hopped down off the stage and came and joined me and fairly soon after that the curtain went down the chappie at the piano whacked out a wellmeant bar or two and the curtain went up again  i cant quite recall what the plot of ask dad was about but i do know that it seemed able to jog along all right without much help from cyril i was rather puzzled at first what i mean is through brooding on cyril and hearing him in his part and listening to his views on what ought and what ought not to be done i suppose i had got a sort of impression rooted in the old bean that he was pretty well the backbone of the show and that the rest of the company didnt do much except go on and fill in when he happened to be off the stage i sat there for nearly half an hour waiting for him to make his entrance until i suddenly discovered he had been on from the start he was in fact the rummylooking plugugly who was now leaning against a potted palm a couple of feet from the op side trying to appear intelligent while the heroine sang a song about love being like something which for the moment has slipped my memory after the second refrain he began to dance in company with a dozen other equally weird birds a painful spectacle for one who could see a vision of aunt agatha reaching for the hatchet and old bassingtonbassington senior putting on his strongest pair of hobnailed boots absolutely  the dance had just finished and cyril and his pals had shuffled off into the wings when a voice spoke from the darkness on my right  pop  old blumenfield clapped his hands and the hero who had just been about to get the next line off his diaphragm cheesed it i peered into the shadows who should it be but jeevess little playmate with the freckles he was now strolling down the aisle with his hands in his pockets as if the place belonged to him an air of respectful attention seemed to pervade the building  pop said the stripling that numbers no good old blumenfield beamed over his shoulder  dont you like it darling  it gives me a pain  youre dead right  you want something zippy there something with a bit of jazz to it  quite right my boy ill make a note of it all right go on  i turned to george who was muttering to himself in rather an overwrought way  i say george old man who the dickens is that kid  old george groaned a bit hollowly as if things were a trifle thick  i didnt know he had crawled in its blumenfields son now were going to have a hades of a time  does he always run things like this  always  but why does old blumenfield listen to him  nobody seems to know it may be pure fatherly love or he may regard him as a mascot my own idea is that he thinks the kid has exactly the amount of intelligence of the average member of the audience and that what makes a hit with him will please the general public while conversely what he doesnt like will be too rotten for anyone the kid is a pest a wart and a pot of poison and should be strangled  the rehearsal went on the hero got off his line there was a slight outburst of frightfulness between the stagemanager and a voice named bill that came from somewhere near the roof the subject under discussion being where the devil bills ambers were at that particular juncture then things went on again until the moment arrived for cyrils big scene  i was still a trifle hazy about the plot but i had got on to the fact that cyril was some sort of an english peer who had come over to america doubtless for the best reasons so far he had only had two lines to say one was oh i say and the other was yes by jove but i seemed to recollect from hearing him read his part that pretty soon he was due rather to spread himself i sat back in my chair and waited for him to bob up  he bobbed up about five minutes later things had got a bit stormy by that time the voice and the stagedirector had had another of their lovefeaststhis time something to do with why bills blues werent on the job or something and almost as soon as that was over there was a bit of unpleasantness because a flowerpot fell off a windowledge and nearly brained the hero the atmosphere was consequently more or less hotted up when cyril who had been hanging about at the back of the stage breezed down centre and toed the mark for his most substantial chunk of entertainment the heroine had been saying somethingi forget whatand all the chorus with cyril at their head had begun to surge round her in the restless sort of way those chappies always do when theres a number coming along  cyrils first line was oh i say you know you mustnt say that really and it seemed to me he passed it over the larynx with a goodish deal of vim and jenesaisquoi but by jove before the heroine had time for the comeback our little friend with the freckles had risen to lodge a protest  pop  yes darling  that ones no good  which one darling  the one with a face like a fish  but they all have faces like fish darling  the child seemed to see the justice of this objection he became more definite  the ugly one  which ugly one that one said old blumenfield pointing to cyril  yep hes rotten  i thought so myself  hes a pill  youre dead right my boy ive noticed it for some time  cyril had been gaping a bit while these few remarks were in progress he now shot down to the footlights even from where i was sitting i could see that these harsh words had hit the old bassingtonbassington family pride a frightful wallop he started to get pink in the ears and then in the nose and then in the cheeks till in about a quarter of a minute he looked pretty much like an explosion in a tomato cannery on a sunset evening  what the deuce do you mean  what the deuce do you mean shouted old blumenfield dont yell at me across the footlights  ive a dashed good mind to come down and spank that little brute  what  a dashed good mind  old blumenfield swelled like a pumpedup tyre he got rounder than ever  see here misteri dont know your darn name  my names bassingtonbassington and the jolly old bassingtonbassingtonsi mean the bassingtonbassingtons arent accustomed  old blumenfield told him in a few brief words pretty much what he thought of the bassingtonbassingtons and what they werent accustomed to the whole strength of the company rallied round to enjoy his remarks you could see them jutting out from the wings and protruding from behind trees  you got to work good for my pop said the stout child waggling his head reprovingly at cyril  i dont want any bally cheek from you said cyril gurgling a bit  whats that barked old blumenfield do you understand that this boy is my son  yes i do said cyril and you both have my sympathy  youre fired bellowed old blumenfield swelling a good bit more get out of my theatre                                        about halfpast ten next morning just after i had finished lubricating the good old interior with a soothing cup of oolong jeeves filtered into my bedroom and said that cyril was waiting to see me in the sittingroom  how does he look jeeves  sir  what does mr bassingtonbassington look like  it is hardly my place sir to criticise the facial peculiarities of your friends  i dont mean that i mean does he appear peeved and what not  not noticeably sir his manner is tranquil  thats rum  sir  nothing show him in will you  im bound to say i had expected to see cyril showing a few more traces of last nights battle i was looking for a bit of the overwrought soul and the quivering ganglions if you know what i mean he seemed pretty ordinary and quite fairly cheerful  hallo wooster old thing  cheero  i just looked in to say goodbye  goodbye  yes im off to washington in an hour he sat down on the bed you know wooster old top he went on ive been thinking it all over and really it doesnt seem quite fair to the jolly old guvnor my going on the stage and so forth what do you think  i see what you mean  i mean to say he sent me over here to broaden my jolly old mind and words to that effect dont you know and i cant help thinking it would be a bit of a jar for the old boy if i gave him the bird and went on the stage instead i dont know if you understand me but what i mean to say is its a sort of question of conscience  can you leave the show without upsetting everything  oh thats all right ive explained everything to old blumenfield and he quite sees my position of course hes sorry to lose mesaid he didnt see how he could fill my place and all that sort of thingbut after all even if it does land him in a bit of a hole i think im right in resigning my part dont you  oh absolutely  i thought youd agree with me well i ought to be shifting awfully glad to have seen something of you and all that sort of rot pippip  toodleoo  he sallied forth having told all those bally lies with the clear blue popeyed gaze of a young child i rang for jeeves you know ever since last night i had been exercising the old bean to some extent and a good deal of light had dawned upon me  jeeves  sir  did you put that piefaced infant up to ballyragging mr bassingtonbassington  sir  oh you know what i mean did you tell him to get mr bassingtonbassington sacked from the ask dad company  i would not take such a liberty sir he started to put out my clothes it is possible that young master blumenfield may have gathered from casual remarks of mine that i did not consider the stage altogether a suitable sphere for mr bassingtonbassington  i say jeeves you know youre a bit of a marvel  i endeavour to give satisfaction sir  and im frightfully obliged if you know what i mean aunt agatha would have had sixteen or seventeen fits if you hadnt headed him off  i fancy there might have been some little friction and unpleasantness sir i am laying out the blue suit with the thin red stripe sir i fancy the effect will be pleasing                                        its a rummy thing but i had finished breakfast and gone out and got as far as the lift before i remembered what it was that i had meant to do to reward jeeves for his really sporting behaviour in this matter of the chump cyril it cut me to the heart to do it but i had decided to give him his way and let those purple socks pass out of my life after all there are times when a cove must make sacrifices i was just going to nip back and break the glad news to him when the lift came up so i thought i would leave it till i got home  the coloured chappie in charge of the lift looked at me as i hopped in with a good deal of quiet devotion and what not  i wish to thank yo suh he said for yo kindness  eh what  misto jeeves done give me them purple socks as you told him thank yo very much suh  i looked down the blighter was a blaze of mauve from the anklebone southward i dont know when ive seen anything so dressy  oh ah not at all righto glad you like them i said  well i mean to say what absolutely     jeeves in the springtime   morning jeeves i said  good morning sir said jeeves  he put the good old cup of tea softly on the table by my bed and i took a refreshing sip just right as usual not too hot not too sweet not too weak not too strong not too much milk and not a drop spilled in the saucer a most amazing cove jeeves so dashed competent in every respect ive said it before and ill say it again i mean to say take just one small instance every other valet ive ever had used to barge into my room in the morning while i was still asleep causing much misery but jeeves seems to know when im awake by a sort of telepathy he always floats in with the cup exactly two minutes after i come to life makes a deuce of a lot of difference to a fellows day  hows the weather jeeves  exceptionally clement sir  anything in the papers  some slight friction threatening in the balkans sir otherwise nothing  i say jeeves a man i met at the club last night told me to put my shirt on privateer for the two oclock race this afternoon how about it  i should not advocate it sir the stable is not sanguine  that was enough for me jeeves knows how i couldnt say but he knows there was a time when i would laugh lightly and go ahead and lose my little all against his advice but not now  talking of shirts i said have those mauve ones i ordered arrived yet  yes sir i sent them back  sent them back  yes sir they would not have become you  well i must say id thought fairly highly of those shirtings but i bowed to superior knowledge weak i dont know most fellows no doubt are all for having their valets confine their activities to creasing trousers and what not without trying to run the home but its different with jeeves right from the first day he came to me i have looked on him as a sort of guide philosopher and friend  mr little rang up on the telephone a few moments ago sir i informed him that you were not yet awake  did he leave a message  no sir he mentioned that he had a matter of importance to discuss with you but confided no details  oh well i expect i shall be seeing him at the club  no doubt sir  i wasnt what you might call in a fever of impatience bingo little is a chap i was at school with and we see a lot of each other still hes the nephew of old mortimer little who retired from business recently with a goodish pile youve probably heard of littles linimentit limbers up the legs bingo biffs about london on a pretty comfortable allowance given him by his uncle and leads on the whole a fairly unclouded life it wasnt likely that anything which he described as a matter of importance would turn out to be really so frightfully important i took it that he had discovered some new brand of cigarette which he wanted me to try or something like that and didnt spoil my breakfast by worrying  after breakfast i lit a cigarette and went to the open window to inspect the day it certainly was one of the best and brightest  jeeves i said  sir said jeeves he had been clearing away the breakfast things but at the sound of the young masters voice cheesed it courteously  you were absolutely right about the weather it is a juicy morning  decidedly sir  spring and all that  yes sir  in the spring jeeves a livelier iris gleams upon the burnished dove  so i have been informed sir  right ho then bring me my whangee my yellowest shoes and the old green homburg im going into the park to do pastoral dances  i dont know if you know that sort of feeling you get on these days round about the end of april and the beginning of may when the skys a light blue with cottonwool clouds and theres a bit of a breeze blowing from the west kind of uplifted feeling romantic if you know what i mean im not much of a ladies man but on this particular morning it seemed to me that what i really wanted was some charming girl to buzz up and ask me to save her from assassins or something so that it was a bit of an anticlimax when i merely ran into young bingo little looking perfectly foul in a crimson satin tie decorated with horseshoes  hallo bertie said bingo  my god man i gargled the cravat the gents neckwear why for what reason  oh the tie he blushed ieri was given it  he seemed embarrassed so i dropped the subject we toddled along a bit and sat down on a couple of chairs by the serpentine  jeeves tells me you want to talk to me about something i said  eh said bingo with a start oh yes yes yes  i waited for him to unleash the topic of the day but he didnt seem to want to get going conversation languished he stared straight ahead of him in a glassy sort of manner  i say bertie he said after a pause of about an hour and a quarter  hallo  do you like the name mabel  no  no  no  you dont think theres a kind of music in the word like the wind rustling gently through the treetops  no  he seemed disappointed for a moment then cheered up  of course you wouldnt you always were a fatheaded worm without any soul werent you  just as you say who is she tell me all  for i realised now that poor old bingo was going through it once again ever since i have known himand we were at school togetherhe has been perpetually falling in love with someone generally in the spring which seems to act on him like magic at school he had the finest collection of actresses photographs of anyone of his time and at oxford his romantic nature was a byword  youd better come along and meet her at lunch he said looking at his watch  a ripe suggestion i said where are you meeting her at the ritz  near the ritz  he was geographically accurate about fifty yards east of the ritz there is one of those blighted teaandbun shops you see dotted about all over london and into this if youll believe me young bingo dived like a homing rabbit and before i had time to say a word we were wedged in at a table on the brink of a silent pool of coffee left there by an early luncher  im bound to say i couldnt quite follow the development of the scenario bingo while not absolutely rolling in the stuff has always had a fair amount of the ready apart from what he got from his uncle i knew that he had finished up the jumping season well on the right side of the ledger why then was he lunching the girl at this godforsaken eatery it couldnt be because he was hard up  just then the waitress arrived rather a pretty girl  arent we going to wait i started to say to bingo thinking it somewhat thick that in addition to asking a girl to lunch with him in a place like this he should fling himself on the foodstuffs before she turned up when i caught sight of his face and stopped  the man was goggling his entire map was suffused with a rich blush he looked like the souls awakening done in pink  hallo mabel he said with a sort of gulp  hallo said the girl  mabel said bingo this is bertie wooster a pal of mine  pleased to meet you she said nice morning  fine i said  you see im wearing the tie said bingo  it suits you beautiful said the girl  personally if anyone had told me that a tie like that suited me i should have risen and struck them on the mazzard regardless of their age and sex but poor old bingo simply got all flustered with gratification and smirked in the most gruesome manner  well whats it going to be today asked the girl introducing the business touch into the conversation  bingo studied the menu devoutly  ill have a cup of cocoa cold veal and ham pie slice of fruit cake and a macaroon same for you bertie  i gazed at the man revolted that he could have been a pal of mine all these years and think me capable of insulting the old turn with this sort of stuff cut me to the quick  or how about a bit of hot steakpudding with a sparkling limado to wash it down said bingo  you know the way love can change a fellow is really frightful to contemplate this chappie before me who spoke in that absolutely careless way of macaroons and limado was the man i had seen in happier days telling the headwaiter at claridges exactly how he wanted the chef to prepare the sole frite au gourmet aux champignons and saying he would jolly well sling it back if it wasnt just right ghastly ghastly  a roll and butter and a small coffee seemed the only things on the list that hadnt been specially prepared by the nastierminded members of the borgia family for people they had a particular grudge against so i chose them and mabel hopped it  well said bingo rapturously  i took it that he wanted my opinion of the female poisoner who had just left us  very nice i said  he seemed dissatisfied  you dont think shes the most wonderful girl you ever saw he said wistfully  oh absolutely i said to appease the blighter where did you meet her  at a subscription dance at camberwell  what on earth were you doing at a subscription dance at camberwell  your man jeeves asked me if i would buy a couple of tickets it was in aid of some charity or other  jeeves i didnt know he went in for that sort of thing  well i suppose he has to relax a bit every now and then anyway he was there swinging a dashed efficient shoe i hadnt meant to go at first but i turned up for a lark oh bertie think what i might have missed  what might you have missed i asked the old lemon being slightly clouded  mabel you chump if i hadnt gone i shouldnt have met mabel  oh ah  at this point bingo fell into a species of trance and only came out of it to wrap himself round the pie and macaroon  bertie he said i want your advice  carry on  at least not your advice because that wouldnt be much good to anybody i mean youre a pretty consummate old ass arent you not that i want to hurt your feelings of course  no no i see that  what i wish you would do is to put the whole thing to that fellow jeeves of yours and see what he suggests youve often told me that he has helped other pals of yours out of messes from what you tell me hes by way of being the brains of the family  hes never let me down yet  then put my case to him  what case  my problem  what problem  why you poor fish my uncle of course what do you think my uncles going to say to all this if i sprang it on him cold hed tie himself in knots on the hearthrug  one of these emotional johnnies eh  somehow or other his mind has got to be prepared to receive the news but how  ah  thats a lot of help that ah you see im pretty well dependent on the old boy if he cut off my allowance i should be very much in the soup so you put the whole binge to jeeves and see if he cant scare up a happy ending somehow tell him my future is in his hands and that if the wedding bells ring out he can rely on me even unto half my kingdom well call it ten quid jeeves would exert himself with ten quid on the horizon what  undoubtedly i said  i wasnt in the least surprised at bingo wanting to lug jeeves into his private affairs like this it was the first thing i would have thought of doing myself if i had been in any hole of any description as i have frequently had occasion to observe he is a bird of the ripest intellect full of bright ideas if anybody could fix things for poor old bingo he could  i stated the case to him that night after dinner  jeeves  sir  are you busy just now  no sir  i mean not doing anything in particular  no sir it is my practice at this hour to read some improving book but if you desire my services this can easily be postponed or indeed abandoned altogether  well i want your advice its about mr little  young mr little sir or the elder mr little his uncle who lives in pounceby gardens  jeeves seemed to know everything most amazing thing id been pally with bingo practically all my life and yet i didnt remember ever having heard that his uncle lived anywhere in particular  how did you know he lived in pounceby gardens i said  i am on terms of some intimacy with the elder mr littles cook sir in fact there is an understanding  im bound to say that this gave me a bit of a start somehow id never thought of jeeves going in for that sort of thing  do you mean youre engaged  it may be said to amount to that sir  well well  she is a remarkably excellent cook sir said jeeves as though he felt called on to give some explanation what was it you wished to ask me about mr little  i sprang the details on him  and thats how the matter stands jeeves i said i think we ought to rally round a trifle and help poor old bingo put the thing through tell me about old mr little what sort of a chap is he  a somewhat curious character sir since retiring from business he has become a great recluse and now devotes himself almost entirely to the pleasures of the table  greedy hog you mean  i would not perhaps take the liberty of describing him in precisely those terms sir he is what is usually called a gourmet very particular about what he eats and for that reason sets a high value on miss watsons services  the cook  yes sir  well it looks to me as though our best plan would be to shoot young bingo in on him after dinner one night melting mood i mean to say and all that  the difficulty is sir that at the moment mr little is on a diet owing to an attack of gout  things begin to look wobbly  no sir i fancy that the elder mr littles misfortune may be turned to the younger mr littles advantage i was speaking only the other day to mr littles valet and he was telling me that it has become his principal duty to read to mr little in the evenings if i were in your place sir i should send young mr little to read to his uncle  nephews devotion you mean old man touched by kindly action what  partly that sir but i would rely more on young mr littles choice of literature  thats no good jolly old bingo has a kind face but when it comes to literature he stops at the sporting times  that difficulty may be overcome i would be happy to select books for mr little to read perhaps i might explain my idea further  i cant say i quite grasp it yet  the method which i advocate is what i believe the advertisers call direct suggestion sir consisting as it does of driving an idea home by constant repetition you may have had experience of the system  you mean they keep on telling you that some soap or other is the best and after a bit you come under the influence and charge round the corner and buy a cake  exactly sir the same method was the basis of all the most valuable propaganda during the recent war i see no reason why it should not be adopted to bring about the desired result with regard to the subjects views on class distinctions if young mr little were to read day after day to his uncle a series of narratives in which marriage with young persons of an inferior social status was held up as both feasible and admirable i fancy it would prepare the elder mr littles mind for the reception of the information that his nephew wishes to marry a waitress in a teashop  are there any books of that sort nowadays the only ones i ever see mentioned in the papers are about married couples who find life grey and cant stick each other at any price  yes sir there are a great many neglected by the reviewers but widely read you have never encountered all for love by rosie m banks  no  nor a red red summer rose by the same author  no  i have an aunt sir who owns an almost complete set of rosie m banks i could easily borrow as many volumes as young mr little might require they make very light attractive reading  well its worth trying  i should certainly recommend the scheme sir  all right then toddle round to your aunts tomorrow and grab a couple of the fruitiest we can but have a dash at it  precisely sir                                        bingo reported three days later that rosie m banks was the goods and beyond a question the stuff to give the troops old little had jibbed somewhat at first at the proposed change of literary diet he not being much of a lad for fiction and having stuck hitherto exclusively to the heavier monthly reviews but bingo had got chapter one of all for love past his guard before he knew what was happening and after that there was nothing to it since then they had finished a red red summer rose madcap myrtle and only a factory girl and were halfway through the courtship of lord strathmorlick  bingo told me all this in a husky voice over an egg beaten up in sherry the only blot on the thing from his point of view was that it wasnt doing a bit of good to the old vocal cords which were beginning to show signs of cracking under the strain he had been looking his symptoms up in a medical dictionary and he thought he had got clergymans throat but against this you had to set the fact that he was making an undoubted hit in the right quarter and also that after the evenings reading he always stayed on to dinner and from what he told me the dinners turned out by old littles cook had to be tasted to be believed there were tears in the old blighters eyes as he got on the subject of the clear soup i suppose to a fellow who for weeks had been tackling macaroons and limado it must have been like heaven  old little wasnt able to give any practical assistance at these banquets but bingo said that he came to the table and had his whack of arrowroot and sniffed the dishes and told stories of entrées he had had in the past and sketched out scenarios of what he was going to do to the bill of fare in the future when the doctor put him in shape so i suppose he enjoyed himself too in a way anyhow things seemed to be buzzing along quite satisfactorily and bingo said he had got an idea which he thought was going to clinch the thing he wouldnt tell me what it was but he said it was a pippin  we make progress jeeves i said  that is very satisfactory sir  mr little tells me that when he came to the big scene in only a factory girl his uncle gulped like a stricken bullpup  indeed sir  where lord claude takes the girl in his arms you know and says  i am familiar with the passage sir it is distinctly moving it was a great favourite of my aunts  i think were on the right track  it would seem so sir  in fact this looks like being another of your successes ive always said and i always shall say that for sheer brain jeeves you stand alone all the other great thinkers of the age are simply in the crowd watching you go by  thank you very much sir i endeavour to give satisfaction  about a week after this bingo blew in with the news that his uncles gout had ceased to trouble him and that on the morrow he would be back at the old stand working away with knife and fork as before  and by the way said bingo he wants you to lunch with him tomorrow  me why me he doesnt know i exist  oh yes he does ive told him about you  what have you told him  oh various things anyhow he wants to meet you and take my tip laddieyou go i should think lunch tomorrow would be something special  i dont know why it was but even then it struck me that there was something dashed oddalmost sinister if you know what i meanabout young bingos manner the old egg had the air of one who has something up his sleeve  there is more in this than meets the eye i said why should your uncle ask a fellow to lunch whom hes never seen  my dear old fathead havent i just said that ive been telling him all about youthat youre my best palat school together and all that sort of thing  but even thenand another thing why are you so dashed keen on my going  bingo hesitated for a moment  well i told you id got an idea this is it i want you to spring the news on him i havent the nerve myself  what im hanged if i do  and you call yourself a pal of mine  yes i know but there are limits  bertie said bingo reproachfully i saved your life once  when  didnt i it must have been some other fellow then well anyway we were boys together and all that you cant let me down  oh all right i said but when you say you havent nerve enough for any dashed thing in the world you misjudge yourself a fellow who  cheerio said young bingo onethirty tomorrow dont be late                                        im bound to say that the more i contemplated the binge the less i liked it it was all very well for bingo to say that i was slated for a magnificent lunch but what good is the best possible lunch to a fellow if he is slung out into the street on his ear during the soup course however the word of a wooster is his bond and all that sort of rot so at onethirty next day i tottered up the steps of no 16 pounceby gardens and punched the bell and half a minute later i was up in the drawingroom shaking hands with the fattest man i have ever seen in my life  the motto of the little family was evidently variety young bingo is long and thin and hasnt had a superfluous ounce on him since we first met but the uncle restored the average and a bit over the hand which grasped mine wrapped it round and enfolded it till i began to wonder if id ever get it out without excavating machinery  mr wooster i am gratifiedi am proudi am honoured  it seemed to me that young bingo must have boosted me to some purpose  oh ah i said  he stepped back a bit still hanging on to the good right hand  you are very young to have accomplished so much  i couldnt follow the train of thought the family especially my aunt agatha who has savaged me incessantly from childhood up have always rather made a point of the fact that mine is a wasted life and that since i won the prize at my first school for the best collection of wild flowers made during the summer holidays i havent done a dam thing to land me on the nations scroll of fame i was wondering if he couldnt have got me mixed up with someone else when the telephonebell rang outside in the hall and the maid came in to say that i was wanted i buzzed down and found it was young bingo  hallo said young bingo so youve got there good man i knew i could rely on you i say old crumpet did my uncle seem pleased to see you  absolutely all over me i cant make it out  oh thats all right i just rang up to explain the fact is old man i know you wont mind but i told him that you were the author of those books ive been reading to him  what  yes i said that rosie m banks was your penname and you didnt want it generally known because you were a modest retiring sort of chap hell listen to you now absolutely hang on your words a brightish idea what i doubt if jeeves in person could have thought up a better one than that well pitch it strong old lad and keep steadily before you the fact that i must have my allowance raised i cant possibly marry on what ive got now if this film is to end with the slow fadeout on the embrace at least double is indicated well thats that cheerio  and he rang off at that moment the gong sounded and the genial host came tumbling downstairs like the delivery of a ton of coals                                        i always look back to that lunch with a sort of aching regret it was the lunch of a lifetime and i wasnt in a fit state to appreciate it subconsciously if you know what i mean i could see it was pretty special but i had got the wind up to such a frightful extent over the ghastly situation in which young bingo had landed me that its deeper meaning never really penetrated most of the time i might have been eating sawdust for all the good it did me  old little struck the literary note right from the start  my nephew has probably told you that i have been making a close study of your books of late he began  yes he did mention it howerhow did you like the bally things  he gazed reverently at me  mr wooster i am not ashamed to say that the tears came into my eyes as i listened to them it amazes me that a man as young as you can have been able to plumb human nature so surely to its depths to play with so unerring a hand on the quivering heartstrings of your reader to write novels so true so human so moving so vital  oh its just a knack i said  the good old persp was bedewing my forehead by this time in a pretty lavish manner i dont know when ive been so rattled  do you find the room a trifle warm  oh no no rather not just right  then its the pepper if my cook has a faultwhich i am not prepared to admitit is that she is inclined to stress the pepper a trifle in her made dishes by the way do you like her cooking  i was so relieved that we had got off the subject of my literary output that i shouted approval in a ringing baritone  i am delighted to hear it mr wooster i may be prejudiced but to my mind that woman is a genius  absolutely i said  she has been with me seven years and in all that time i have not known her guilty of a single lapse from the highest standard except once in the winter of 1917 when a purist might have condemned a certain mayonnaise of hers as lacking in creaminess but one must make allowances there had been several airraids about that time and no doubt the poor woman was shaken but nothing is perfect in this world mr wooster and i have had my cross to bear for seven years i have lived in constant apprehension lest some evillydisposed person might lure her from my employment to my certain knowledge she has received offers lucrative offers to accept service elsewhere you may judge of my dismay mr wooster when only this morning the bolt fell she gave notice  good lord  your consternation does credit if i may say so to the heart of the author of a red red summer rose but i am thankful to say the worst has not happened the matter has been adjusted jane is not leaving me  good egg  good egg indeedthough the expression is not familiar to me i do not remember having come across it in your books and speaking of your books may i say that what has impressed me about them even more than the moving poignancy of the actual narrative is your philosophy of life if there were more men like you mr wooster london would be a better place  this was dead opposite to my aunt agathas philosophy of life she having always rather given me to understand that it is the presence in it of chappies like me that makes london more or less of a plague spot but i let it go  let me tell you mr wooster that i appreciate your splendid defiance of the outworn fetishes of a purblind social system i appreciate it you are big enough to see that rank is but the guinea stamp and that in the magnificent words of lord bletchmore in only a factory girl be her origin neer so humble a good woman is the equal of the finest lady on earth  i sat up  i say do you think that  i do mr wooster i am ashamed to say that there was a time when i was like other men a slave to the idiotic convention which we call class distinction but since i read your books  i might have known it jeeves had done it again  you think its all right for a chappie in what you might call a certain social position to marry a girl of what you might describe as the lower classes  most assuredly i do mr wooster  i took a deep breath and slipped him the good news  young bingoyour nephew you knowwants to marry a waitress i said  i honour him for it said old little  you dont object  on the contrary  i took another deep breath and shifted to the sordid side of the business  i hope you wont think im butting in dont you know i said buterwell how about it  i fear i do not quite follow you  well i mean to say his allowance and all that the money youre good enough to give him he was rather hoping that you might see your way to jerking up the total a bit  old little shook his head regretfully  i fear that can hardly be managed you see a man in my position is compelled to save every penny i will gladly continue my nephews existing allowance but beyond that i cannot go it would not be fair to my wife  what but youre not married  not yet but i propose to enter upon that holy state almost immediately the lady who for years has cooked so well for me honoured me by accepting my hand this very morning a cold gleam of triumph came into his eye now let em try to get her away from me he muttered defiantly                                        young mr little has been trying frequently during the afternoon to reach you on the telephone sir said jeeves that night when i got home  ill bet he has i said i had sent poor old bingo an outline of the situation by messengerboy shortly after lunch  he seemed a trifle agitated  i dont wonder jeeves i said so brace up and bite the bullet im afraid ive bad news for you  that scheme of yoursreading those books to old mr little and all thathas blown out a fuse  they did not soften him  they did thats the whole bally trouble jeeves im sorry to say that fiancée of yoursmiss watson you knowthe cook you knowwell the long and the short of it is that shes chosen riches instead of honest worth if you know what i mean  sir  shes handed you the mitten and gone and got engaged to old mr little  indeed sir  you dont seem much upset  that fact is sir i had anticipated some such outcome  i stared at him then what on earth did you suggest the scheme for  to tell you the truth sir i was not wholly averse from a severance of my relations with miss watson in fact i greatly desired it i respect miss watson exceedingly but i have seen for a long time that we were not suited now the other young person with whom i have an understanding  great scott jeeves there isnt another  yes sir  how long has this been going on  for some weeks sir i was greatly attracted by her when i first met her at a subscription dance at camberwell  my sainted aunt not  jeeves inclined his head gravely  yes sir by an odd coincidence it is the same young person that young mr littlei have placed the cigarettes on the small table good night sir     concealed art   if a fellow has lots of money and lots of time and lots of curiosity about other fellows business it is astonishing dont you know what a lot of strange affairs he can get mixed up in now i have money and curiosity and all the time there is my names pepperreggie pepper my uncle was the collieryowner chappie and he left me the dickens of a pile and ever since the lawyer slipped the stuff into my hand whispering its yours life seems to have been one thing after another  for instance the dashed rummy case of dear old archie i first ran into old archie when he was studying in paris and when he came back to london he looked me up and we celebrated he always liked me because i didnt mind listening to his theories of art for archie you must know was an artist not an ordinary artist either but one of those fellows you read about who are several years ahead of the times and paint the sort of thing that people will be educated up to by about 1999 or thereabouts  well one day as i was sitting in the club watching the traffic coming up one way and going down the other and thinking nothing in particular in blew the old boy he was looking rather worried  reggie i want your advice  you shall have it i said state your point old top  its like thisim engaged to be married  my dear old scout a million con  yes i know thanks very much and all that but listen  whats the trouble dont you like her  a kind of rapt expression came over his face  like her why shes the only  he gibbered for a spell when he had calmed down i said well then whats your trouble  reggie he said do you think a man is bound to tell his wife all about his past life  oh well i said of course i suppose shes prepared to find that a man hasersowed his wild oats dont you know and all that sort of thing and  he seemed quite irritated  dont be a chump its nothing like that listen when i came back to london and started to try and make a living by painting i found that people simply wouldnt buy the sort of work i did at any price do you know reggie ive been at it three years now and i havent sold a single picture  i whooped in a sort of amazed way but i should have been far more startled if hed told me he had sold a picture ive seen his pictures and they are like nothing on earth so far as i can make out what he says they arent supposed to be theres one in particular called the coming of summer which i sometimes dream about when ive been hitting it up a shade too vigorously its all dots and splashes with a great eye staring out of the middle of the mess it looks as if summer just as it was on the way had stubbed its toe on a bomb he tells me its his masterpiece and that he will never do anything like it again i should like to have that in writing  well artists eat just the same as other people he went on and personally i like mine often and well cooked besides which my sojourn in paris gave me a rather nice taste in light wines the consequence was that i came to the conclusion after i had been back a few months that something had to be done reggie do you by any remote chance read a paper called funny slices  every week  he gazed at me with a kind of wistful admiration  i envy you reggie fancy being able to make a statement like that openly and without fear then i take it you know the doughnut family  i should say i did  his voice sank almost to a whisper and he looked over his shoulder nervously  reggie i do them  you what  i do themdraw thempaint them i am the creator of the doughnut family  i stared at him absolutely astounded i was simply dumb it was the biggest surprise of my life why dash it the doughnut family was the best thing in its line in london there is pa doughnut ma doughnut aunt bella cousin joe and mabel the daughter and they have all sorts of slapstick adventures pa ma and aunt bella are pure gargoyles cousin joe is a little more nearly semihuman and mabel is a perfect darling i had often wondered who did them for they were unsigned and i had often thought what a deuced brainy fellow the chap must be and all the time it was old archie i stammered as i tried to congratulate him  he winced  dont gargle reggie theres a good fellow he said my nerves are all on edge well as i say i do the doughnuts it was that or starvation i got the idea one night when i had a toothache and next day i took some specimens round to an editor he rolled in his chair and told me to start in and go on till further notice since then i have done them without a break well theres the position i must go on drawing these infernal things or i shall be penniless the question is am i to tell her  tell her of course you must tell her  ah but you dont know her reggie have you ever heard of eunice nugent  not to my knowledge  as she doesnt sprint up and down the joyway at the hippodrome i didnt suppose you would  i thought this rather uncalledfor seeing that as a matter of fact i scarcely know a dozen of the hippodrome chorus but i made allowances for his state of mind  shes a poetess he went on and her work has appeared in lots of good magazines my idea is that she would be utterly horrified if she knew and could never be quite the same to me again but i want you to meet her and judge for yourself its just possible that i am taking too morbid a view of the matter and i want an unprejudiced outside opinion come and lunch with us at the piccadilly tomorrow will you                                        he was absolutely right one glance at miss nugent told me that the poor old boy had got the correct idea i hardly know how to describe the impression she made on me on the way to the pic archie had told me that what first attracted him to her was the fact that she was so utterly unlike mabel doughnut but that had not prepared me for what she really was she was kind of intense if you know what i meankind of spiritual she was perfectly pleasant and drew me out about golf and all that sort of thing but all the time i felt that she considered me an earthy worm whose loftier soulessence had been carelessly left out of his composition at birth she made me wish that i had never seen a musical comedy or danced on a supper table on new years eve and if that was the impression she made on me you can understand why poor old archie jibbed at the idea of bringing her funny slices and pointing at the doughnuts and saying mei did it the notion was absolutely out of the question the shot wasnt on the board i told archie so directly we were alone  old top i said you must keep it dark  im afraid so but i hate the thought of deceiving her  you must get used to that now youre going to be a married man i said  the trouble is how am i going to account for the fact that i can do myself pretty well  why tell her you have private means of course whats your money invested in  practically all of it in b and o p rails it is a devilish good thing a pal of mine put me onto it  tell her that you have a pile of money in b and o p then shell take it for granted its a legacy a spiritual girl like miss nugent isnt likely to inquire further  reggie i believe youre right it cuts both ways that spiritual gag ill do it                                        they were married quietly i held the towel for archie and a spectacled girl with a mouth like a rattrap who was something to do with the womans movement saw fair play for eunice and then they went off to scotland for their honeymoon i wondered how the doughnuts were going to get on in old archies absence but it seemed that he had buckled down to it and turned out three months supply in advance he told me that long practice had enabled him to doughnut almost without conscious effort when he came back to london he would give an hour a week to them and do them on his head pretty soft it seemed to me that the marriage was going to be a success  one gets out of touch with people when they marry i am not much on the socialcall game and for nearly six months i dont suppose i saw archie more than twice or three times when i did he appeared sound in wind and limb and reported that married life was all to the velvet and that he regarded bachelors like myself as so many excrescences on the social system he compared me if i remember rightly to a wart and advocated drastic treatment  it was perhaps seven months after he had told eunice that he endowed her with all his worldly goodsshe not suspecting what the parcel containedthat he came to me unexpectedly one afternoon with a face so long and sicklooking that my finger was on the button and i was ordering brandy and soda before he had time to speak  reggie he said an awful thing has happened have you seen the paper today  yes why  did you read the stock exchange news did you see that some lunatic has been jumping around with a club and hammering the stuffing out of b and o p this afternoon they are worth practically nothing  by jove and all your money was in it what rotten luck then i spotted the silver lining but after all it doesnt matter so very much what i mean is bang go your little savings and all that sort of thing but after all youre making quite a good income so why worry  i might have known you would miss the point he said cant you understand the situation this morning at breakfast eunice got hold of the paper first archie she said didnt you tell me all your money was in b and o p yes i said why then were ruined now do you see if i had had time to think i could have said that i had another chunk in something else but i had committed myself i have either got to tell her about those infernal doughnuts or else conceal the fact that i had money coming in  great scot what on earth are you going to do  i cant think we can struggle along in a sort of way for it appears that she has small private means of her own the idea at present is that we shall live on them were selling the car and trying to get out of the rest of our lease up at the flat and then were going to look about for a cheaper place probably down chelsea way so as to be near my studio what was that stuff ive been drinking ring for another of the same theres a good fellow in fact i think you had better keep your finger permanently on the bell i shall want all theyve got                                        the spectacle of a fellow human being up to his neck in the consommé is painful of course but theres certainly what the advertisements at the top of magazine stories call a tense human interest about it and im bound to say that i saw as much as possible of poor old archie from now on his sad case fascinated me it was rather thrilling to see him wrestling with new zealand muttonhash and draught beer down at his chelsea flat with all the suppressed anguish of a man who has let himself get accustomed to delicate food and vintage wines and think that a word from him could send him whizzing back to the old life again whenever he wished but at what a cost as they say in the novels that was the catch he might hate this new order of things but his lips were sealed  i personally came in for a good deal of quiet esteem for the way in which i stuck to him in his adversity i dont think eunice had thought much of me before but now she seemed to feel that i had formed a corner in golden hearts i took advantage of this to try and pave the way for a confession on poor old archies part  i wonder archie old top i said one evening after we had dined on muttonhash and were sitting round trying to forget it i wonder you dont try another line in painting ive heard that some of these fellows who draw for the comic papers  mrs archie nipped me in the bud  how can you suggest such a thing mr pepper a man with archies genius i know the public is not educated up to his work but it is only a question of time archie suffers like all pioneers from being ahead of his generation but thank heaven he need not sully his genius by stooping  no no i said sorry i only suggested it  after that i gave more time than ever to trying to think of a solution sometimes i would lie awake at night and my manner towards wilberforce my man became so distrait that it almost caused a rift he asked me one morning which suit i would wear that day and by jove i said oh any of them i dont mind there was a most frightful silence and i woke up to find him looking at me with such a dashed wounded expression in his eyes that i had to tip him a couple of quid to bring him round again  well you cant go on straining your brain like that forever without something breaking loose and one night just after i had gone to bed i got it yes by gad absolutely got it and i was so excited that i hopped out from under the blankets there and then and rang up old archie on the phone  archie old scout i said can the misses hear what im saying well then dont say anything to give the show away keep on saying yes halloa so that you can tell her it was someone on the wrong wire ive got it my boy all youve got to do to solve the whole problem is to tell her youve sold one of your pictures make the price as big as you like come and lunch with me tomorrow at the club and well settle the details  there was a pause and then archies voice said halloa halloa it might have been a bit disappointing only there was a tremble in it which made me understand how happy i had made the old boy i went back to bed and slept like a king                                        next day we lunched together and fixed the thing up i have never seen anyone so supremely braced we examined the scheme from every angle and there wasnt a flaw in it the only difficulty was to hit on a plausible purchaser archie suggested me but i couldnt see it i said it would sound fishy eventually i had a brain wave and suggested j bellingwood brackett the american millionaire he lives in london and you see his name in the papers everyday as having bought some painting or statue or something so why shouldnt he buy archies coming of summer and archie said exactlywhy shouldnt he and if he had had any sense in his fat head he would have done it long ago dash him which shows you that dear old archie was bracing up for ive heard him use much the same language in happier days about a referee  he went off crammed to the eyebrows with good food and happiness to tell mrs archie that all was well and that the old home was saved and that canterbury mutton might now be definitely considered as off the bill of fare  he told me on the phone that night that he had made the price two thousand pounds because he needed the money and what was two thousand to a man who had been fleecing the widow and the orphan for forty odd years without a break i thought the price was a bit high but i agreed that j bellingwood could afford it and happiness you might say reigned supreme  i dont know when ive had such a nasty jar as i got when wilberforce brought me the paper in bed and i languidly opened it and this jumped out and bit at me             bellingwood brackett discovers                  english genius                           pays stupendous price for young artists picture                              hitherto unknown futurist received £2000  underneath there was a column some of it about archie the rest about the picture and scattered over the page were two photographs of old archie looking more like pa doughnut than anything human and a smudged reproduction of the coming of summer and believe me frightful as the original of that weird exhibit looked the reproduction had it licked to a whisper it was one of the ghastliest things i have ever seen  well after the first shock i recovered a bit after all it was fame for dear old archie as soon as i had had lunch i went down to the flat to congratulate him  he was sitting there with mrs archie he was looking a bit dazed but she was simmering with joy she welcomed me as the faithful friend  isnt it perfectly splendid mr pepper to think that archies genius has at last been recognized how quiet he kept it i had no idea that mr brackett was even interested in his work i wonder how he heard of it  oh these things get about i said you cant keep a good man down  think of two thousand pounds for one pictureand the first he has ever sold  what beats me i said is how the papers got hold of it  oh i sent it to the papers said mrs archie in an offhand way  i wonder who did the writing up i said  they would do that in the office wouldnt they said mrs archie  i suppose they would i said they are wonders at that sort of thing  i couldnt help wishing that archie would enter into the spirit of the thing a little more and perk up instead of sitting there looking like a codfish the thing seemed to have stunned the poor chappie  after this archie i said all you have to do is to sit in your studio while the police see that the waiting line of millionaires doesnt straggle over the pavement theyll fight  whats that said archie starting as if someone had dug a redhot needle into his calf  it was only a ring at the bell followed by a voice asking if mr ferguson was at home  probably an interviewer said mrs archie i suppose we shall get no peace for a long time to come  the door opened and the cook came in with a card renshaw liggett said mrs archie i dont know him do you archie it must be an interviewer ask him to come in julia  and in he came  my knowledge of chappies in general after a fairly wide experience is that some chappies seem to kind of convey an atmosphere of unpleasantness the moment you come into contact with them renshaw liggett gave me this feeling directly he came in and when he fixed me with a sinister glance and said mr ferguson i felt inclined to say not guilty i backed a step or two and jerked my head towards archie and renshaw turned the searchlight off me and switched it onto him  you are mr archibald ferguson the artist  archie nodded pallidly and renshaw nodded as much as to say that you couldnt deceive him he produced a sheet of paper it was the middle page of the mail  you authorized the publication of this  archie nodded again  i represent mr brackett the publication of this most impudent fiction has caused mr brackett extreme annoyance and as it might also lead to other and more serious consequences i must insist that a full denial be published without a moments delay  what do you mean cried mrs archie are you mad  she had been standing listening to the conversation in a sort of trance now she jumped into the fight with a vim that turned renshaws attention to her in a second  no madam i am not mad nor despite the interested assertions of certain parties whom i need not specify by name is mr brackett it may be news to you mrs ferguson that an action is even now pending in new york whereby certain parties are attempting to show that my client mr brackett is non compos and should be legally restrained from exercising control over his property their case is extremely weak for even if we admit their contention that our client did on the eighteenth of june last attempt to walk up fifth avenue in his pyjamas we shall be able to show that his action was the result of an election bet but as the parties to whom i have alluded will undoubtedly snatch at every straw in their efforts to prove that mr brackett is mentally infirm the prejudicial effect of this publication cannot be overestimated unless mr brackett can clear himself of the stigma of having given two thousand pounds for this extraordinary production of an absolutely unknown artist the strength of his case must be seriously shaken i may add that my clients lavish patronage of art is already one of the main planks in the platform of the parties already referred to they adduce his extremely generous expenditure in this direction as evidence that he is incapable of a proper handling of his money i need scarcely point out with what sinister pleasure therefore they must have contemplatedthis  and he looked at the coming of summer as if it were a black beetle  i must say much as i disliked the blighter i couldnt help feeling that he had right on his side it hadnt occurred to me in quite that light before but considering it calmly now i could see that a man who would disgorge two thousand of the best for archies futurist masterpiece might very well step straight into the nut factory and no questions asked  mrs archie came right back at him as game as you please  i am sorry for mr bracketts domestic troubles but my husband can prove without difficulty that he did buy the picture cant you dear  archie extremely white about the gills looked at the ceiling and at the floor and at me and renshaw liggett  no he said finally i cant because he didnt  exactly said renshaw and i must ask you to publish that statement in tomorrows papers without fail he rose and made for the door my client has no objection to young artists advertising themselves realizing that this is an age of strenuous competition but he firmly refuses to permit them to do it at his expense good afternoon  and he legged it leaving behind him one of the most chunky silences i have ever been mixed up in for the life of me i couldnt see who was to make the next remark i was jolly certain that it wasnt going to be me  eventually mrs archie opened the proceedings  what does it mean  archie turned to me with a sort of frozen calm  reggie would you mind stepping into the kitchen and asking julia for this weeks funny slices i know she has it  he was right she unearthed it from a cupboard i trotted back with it to the sitting room archie took the paper from me and held it out to his wife doughnuts uppermost  look he said  she looked  i do them i have done them every week for three years no dont speak yet listen this is where all my money came from all the money i lost when b and o p rails went smash and this is where the money came from to buy the coming of summer it wasnt brackett who bought it it was myself  mrs archie was devouring the doughnuts with wideopen eyes i caught a glimpse of them myself and only just managed not to laugh for it was the set of pictures where pa doughnut tries to fix the electric light one of the very finest things dear old archie had ever done  i dont understand she said  i draw these things i have sold my soul  archie  he winced but stuck to it bravely  yes i knew how you would feel about it and that was why i didnt dare to tell you and why we fixed up this story about old brackett i couldnt bear to live on you any longer and to see you roughing it here when we might be having all the money we wanted  suddenly like a boiler exploding she began to laugh  theyre the funniest things i ever saw in my life she gurgled mr pepper do look hes trying to cut the electric wire with the scissors and everything blazes up and youve been hiding this from me all that time  archie goggled dumbly she dived at a table and picked up a magazine pointing to one of the advertisement pages  read she cried read it aloud  and in a shaking voice archie read     you think you are perfectly well dont you you wake up in the    morning and spring out of bed and say to yourself that you have    never been better in your life youre wrong unless you are    avoiding coffee as you would avoid the man who always tells you    the smart things his little boy said yesterday and drinking                          safety first molassine    for breakfast you cannot be                              perfectly well     it is a physical impossibility coffee contains an appreciable    quantity of the deadly drug caffeine and therefore  i wrote that she said and i wrote the advertisement of the spiller baby food on page ninetyfour and the one about the preeminent breakfast sausage on page eightysix oh archie dear the torments i have been through fearing that you would some day find me out and despise me i couldnt help it i had no private means and i didnt make enough out of my poetry to keep me in hats i learned to write advertisements four years ago at a correspondence school and ive been doing them ever since and now i dont mind your knowing now that you have told me this perfectly splendid news archie  she rushed into his arms like someone charging in for a bowl of soup at a railway station buffet and i drifted out it seemed to me that this was a scene in which i was not on i sidled to the door and slid forth they didnt notice me my experience is that nobody ever doesmuch     the test case   wellmeaning chappies at the club sometimes amble up to me and tap me on the wishbone and say reggie old topmy names reggie pepperyou ought to get married old man well what i mean to say is its all very well and i see their point and all that sort of thing but it takes two to make a marriage and to date i havent met a girl who didnt seem to think the contract was too big to be taken on  looking back it seems to me that i came nearer to getting over the homeplate with ann selby than with most of the others in fact but for circumstances over which i had no dashed control i am inclined to think that we should have brought it off im bound to say that now that what the poet chappie calls the first fine frenzy has been on the ice for awhile and i am able to consider the thing calmly i am deuced glad we didnt she was one of those strongminded girls and i hate to think of what she would have done to me  at the time though i was frightfully in love and for quite a while after she definitely gave me the mitten i lost my stroke at golf so completely that a child could have given me a stroke a hole and got away with it i was all broken up and i contend to this day that i was dashed badly treated  let me give you what they call the data  one day i was lunching with ann and was just proposing to her as usual when instead of simply refusing me as she generally did she fixed me with a thoughtful eye and kind of opened her heart  do you know reggie i am in doubt  give me the benefit of it i said which i maintain was pretty good on the spur of the moment but didnt get a hand she simply ignored it and went on  sometimes she said you seem to me entirely vapid and brainless at other times you say or do things which suggest that there are possibilities in you that properly stimulated and encouraged you might overcome the handicap of large private means and do something worthwhile i wonder if that is simply my imagination she watched me very closely as she spoke  rather not youve absolutely summed me up with you beside me stimulating and all that sort of rot dont you know i should show a flash of speed which would astonish you  i wish i could be certain  take a chance on it  she shook her head  i must be certain marriage is such a gamble i have just been staying with my sister hilda and her husband  dear old harold bodkin i know him well in fact ive a standing invitation to go down there and stay as long as i like harold is one of my best pals harold is a corker good old harold is  i would rather you didnt eulogize him reggie i am extremely angry with harold he is making hilda perfectly miserable  what on earth do you mean harold wouldnt dream of hurting a fly hes one of those dreamy sentimental chumps who  it is precisely his sentimentality which is at the bottom of the whole trouble you know of course that hilda is not his first wife  thats right his first wife died about five years ago  he still cherishes her memory  very sporting of him  is it if you were a girl how would you like to be married to a man who was always making you bear in mind that you were only number two in his affections a man whose idea of a pleasant conversation was a string of anecdotes illustrating what a dear woman his first wife was a man who expected you to upset all your plans if they clashed with some anniversary connected with his other marriage  that does sound pretty rotten does harold do all that  thats only a small part of what he does why if you will believe me every evening at seven oclock he goes and shuts himself up in a little room at the top of the house and meditates  what on earth does he do that for  apparently his first wife died at seven in the evening there is a portrait of her in the room i believe he lays flowers in front of it and hilda is expected to greet him on his return with a happy smile  why doesnt she kick  i have been trying to persuade her to but she wont she just pretends she doesnt mind she has a nervous sensitive temperament and the thing is slowly crushing her dont talk to me of harold  considering that she had started him as a topic i thought this pretty unjust i didnt want to talk of harold i wanted to talk about myself  well what has all this got to do with your not wanting to marry me i said  nothing except that it is an illustration of the risks a woman runs when she marries a man of a certain type  great scott you surely dont class me with harold  yes in a way you are very much alike you have both always had large private means and have never had the wholesome discipline of work  but dash it harold on your showing is an absolute nut why should you think that i would be anything like that  theres always the risk  a hot idea came to me  look here ann i said suppose i pull off some stunt which only a deuced brainy chappie could get away with would you marry me then  certainly what do you propose to do  do what do i propose to do well er to be absolutely frank at the moment i dont quite know  you never will know reggie youre one of the idle rich and your brain if you ever had one has atrophied  well that seemed to me to put the lid on it i didnt mind a hearttoheart talk but this was mere abuse i changed the subject  what would you like after that fish i said coldly  you know how it is when you get an idea for awhile it sort of simmers inside you and then suddenly it sizzles up like a rocket and there you are right up against it thats what happened now i went away from that luncheon vaguely determined to pull off some stunt which would prove that i was right there with the gray matter but without any clear notion of what i was going to do side by side with this in my mind was the case of dear old harold when i wasnt brooding on the stunt i was brooding on harold i was fond of the good old lad and i hated the idea of his slowly wrecking the home purely by being a chump and all of a sudden the two things clicked together like a couple of chemicals and there i was with a corking plan for killing two birds with one stoneputting one across that would startle and impress ann and at the same time healing the breach between harold and hilda  my idea was that in a case like this its no good trying opposition what you want is to work it so that the chappie quits of his own accord you want to egg him on to overdoing the thing till he gets so that he says to himself enough never again that was what was going to happen to harold  when youre going to do a thing theres nothing like making a quick start i wrote to harold straight away proposing myself for a visit and harold wrote back telling me to come right along  harold and hilda lived alone in a large house i believe they did a good deal of entertaining at times but on this occasion i was the only guest the only other person of note in the place was ponsonby the butler  of course if harold had been an ordinary sort of chappie what i had come to do would have been a pretty big order i dont mind many things but i do hesitate to dig into my hosts intimate private affairs but harold was such a simpleminded johnnie so grateful for a little sympathy and advice that my job wasnt so very difficult  it wasnt as if he minded talking about amelia which was his first wifes name the difficulty was to get him to talk of anything else i began to understand what ann meant by saying it was tough on hilda  im bound to say the old boy was clay in my hands people call me a chump but harold was a superchump and i did what i liked with him the second morning of my visit after breakfast he grabbed me by the arm  this way reggie im just going to show old reggie amelias portrait dear  there was a little room all by itself on the top floor he explained to me that it had been his studio at one time harold used to do a bit of painting in an amateur way  there he said pointing at the portrait i did that myself reggie it was away being cleaned when you were here last its like dear amelia isnt it  i suppose it was in a way at any rate you could recognize the likeness when you were told who it was supposed to be  he sat down in front of it and gave it the thoughtful onceover  do you know reggie old top sometimes when i sit here i feel as if amelia were back again  it would be a bit awkward for you if she was  how do you mean  well old lad you happen to be married to someone else  a look of childlike enthusiasm came over his face  reggie i want to tell you how splendid hilda is lots of other women might object to my still cherishing amelias memory but hilda has been so nice about it from the beginning she understands so thoroughly  i hadnt much breath left after that but i used what i had to say she doesnt object  not a bit said harold it makes everything so pleasant  when i had recovered a bit i said what do you mean by everything  well he said for instance i come up here every evening at seven anderthink for a few minutes  a few minutes  what do you mean  well a few minutes isnt long  but i always have my cocktail at a quarter past  you could postpone it  and ponsonby likes us to start dinner at seventhirty  what on earth has ponsonby to do with it  well he likes to get off by nine you know i think he goes off and plays bowls at the madhouse you see reggie old man we have to study ponsonby a little hes always on the verge of giving noticein fact it was only by coaxing him on one or two occasions that we got him to stay onand hes such a treasure that i dont know what we should do if we lost him but if you think that i ought to stay longer  certainly i do you ought to do a thing like this properly or not at all  he sighed  its a frightful risk but in future well dine at eight  it seemed to me that there was a suspicion of a cloud on ponsonbys shining morning face when the news was broken to him that for the future he couldnt unleash himself on the local bowling talent as early as usual but he made no kick and the new order of things began  my next offensive movement i attribute to a flash of absolute genius i was glancing through a photograph album in the drawingroom before lunch when i came upon a face which i vaguely remembered it was one of those wide flabby faces with bulging eyes and something about it struck me as familiar i consulted harold who came in at that moment  that said harold thats percy he gave a slight shudder amelias brother you know an awful fellow i havent seen him for years  then i placed percy i had met him once or twice in the old days and i had a brainwave percy was everything that poor old harold disliked most he was hearty at breakfast a confirmed backslapper and a man who prodded you in the chest when he spoke to you  you havent seen him for years i said in a shocked voice  thank heaven said harold devoutly  i put down the photograph album and looked at him in a deuced serious way then its high time you asked him to come here  harold blanched reggie old man you dont know what you are saying you cant remember percy i wish you wouldnt say these things even in fun  im not saying it in fun of course its none of my business but you have paid me the compliment of confiding in me about amelia and i feel justified in speaking all i can say is that if you cherish her memory as you say you do you show it in a very strange way how you can square your neglect of percy with your alleged devotion to amelias memory beats me it seems to me that you have no choice you must either drop the whole thing and admit that your love for her is dead or else you must stop this infernal treatment of her favorite brother you cant have it both ways  he looked at me like a hunted stag but reggie old man percy he asks riddles at breakfast  i dont care  hilda cant stand him  it doesnt matter you must invite him its not a case of what you like or dont like its your duty  he struggled with his feelings for a bit very well he said in a crushed sort of voice  at dinner that night he said to hilda im going to ask amelias brother down to spend a few days it is so long since we have seen him  hilda didnt answer at once she looked at him in rather a curious sort of way i thought very well dear she said  i was deuced sorry for the poor girl but i felt like a surgeon she would be glad later on for i was convinced that in a very short while poor old harold must crack under the strain especially after i had put across the coup which i was meditating for the very next evening  it was quite simple simple that is to say in its working but a devilish brainy thing for a chappie to have thought out if ann had really meant what she had said at lunch that day and was prepared to stick to her bargain and marry me as soon as i showed a burst of intelligence she was mine  what it came to was that if dear old harold enjoyed meditating in front of amelias portrait he was jolly well going to have all the meditating he wanted and a bit over for my simple scheme was to lurk outside till he had gone into the little room on the top floor and then with the aid of one of those jolly little wedges which you use to keep windows from rattling see to it that the old boy remained there till they sent out search parties  there wasnt a flaw in my reasoning when harold didnt roll in at the sound of the dinner gong hilda would take it for granted that he was doing an extra bit of meditating that night and her pride would stop her sending out a hurry call for him as for harold when he found that all was not well with the door he would probably yell with considerable vim but it was odds against anyone hearing him as for me you might think that i was going to suffer owing to the probable postponement of dinner not so but far otherwise for on the night i had selected for the coup i was dining out at the neighboring inn with my old college chum freddie meadowes it is true that freddie wasnt going to be within fifty miles of the place on that particular night but they werent to know that  did i describe the peculiar isolation of that room on the top floor where the portrait was i dont think i did it was as a matter of fact the only room in those parts for in the days when he did his amateur painting old harold was strong on the artistic seclusion business and hated noise and his studio was the only room in use on that floor  in short to sum up the thing was a cinch  punctually at ten minutes to seven i was in readiness on the scene there was a recess with a curtain in front of it a few yards from the door and there i waited fondling my little wedge for harold to walk up and allow the proceedings to start it was almost pitchdark and that made the time of waiting seem longer presentlyi seemed to have been there longer than ten minutesi heard steps approaching they came past where i stood and went on into the room the door closed and i hopped out and sprinted up to it and the next moment i had the good old wedge under the woodas neat a job as you could imagine and then i strolled downstairs and toddled off to the inn  i didnt hurry over my dinner partly because the browsing and sluicing at the inn was really astonishingly good for a roadhouse and partly because i wanted to give harold plenty of time for meditation i suppose it must have been a couple of hours or more when i finally turned in at the front door somebody was playing the piano in the drawing room it could only be hilda who was playing and i had doubts as to whether she wanted company just thenmine at any rate  eventually i decided to risk it for i wanted to hear the latest about dear old harold so in i went and it wasnt hilda at all it was ann selby  hello i said i didnt know you were coming down here it seemed so odd dont you know as it hadnt been more than ten days or so since her last visit  good evening reggie she said  whats been happening i asked  how do you know anything has been happening  i guessed it  well youre quite right as it happens reggie a good deal has been happening she went to the door and looked out listening then she shut it and came back hilda has revolted  revolted  yes put her foot downmade a standrefused to go on meekly putting up with harolds insane behavior  i dont understand  she gave me a look of pity you always were so dense reggie i will tell you the whole thing from the beginning you remember what i spoke to you about one day when we were lunching together well i dont suppose you have noticed iti know what you arebut things have been getting steadily worse for one thing harold insisted on lengthening his visits to the top room and naturally ponsonby complained hilda tells me that she had to plead with him to induce him to stay on then the climax came i dont know if you recollect amelias brother percy you must have met him when she was alivea perfectly unspeakable person with a loud voice and overpowering manners suddenly out of a blue sky harold announced his intention of inviting him to stay it was the last straw this afternoon i received a telegram from poor hilda saying that she was leaving harold and coming to stay with me and a few hours later the poor child arrived at my apartment  you mustnt suppose that i stood listening silently to this speech every time she seemed to be going to stop for breath i tried to horn in and tell her all these things which had been happening were not mere flukes as she seemed to think but parts of a deuced carefully planned scheme of my own every time id try to interrupt ann would wave me down and carry on without so much as a semicolon  but at this point i did manage a word in i know i know i know i did it all it was i who suggested to harold that he should lengthen the meditations and insisted on his inviting percy to stay  i had hardly got the words out when i saw that they were not making the hit i had anticipated she looked at me with an expression of absolute scorn dont you know  well really reggie she said at last i never have had a very high opinion of your intelligence as you know but this is a revelation to me what motive you can have had unless you did it in a spirit of pure mischief she stopped and there was a glare of undiluted repulsion in her eyes reggie i cant believe it of all the things i loathe most a practical joker is the worst do you mean to tell me you did all this as a practical joke  great scott no it was like this  i paused for a bare second to collect my thoughts so as to put the thing clearly to her i might have known what would happen she dashed right in and collared the conversation  well never mind as it happens there is no harm done quite the reverse in fact hilda left a note for harold telling him what she had done and where she had gone and why she had gone and harold found it the result was that after hilda had been with me for some time in he came in a panic and absolutely grovelled before the dear child it seems incredible but he had apparently had no notion that his absurd behavior had met with anything but approval from hilda he went on as if he were mad he was beside himself he clutched his hair and stamped about the room and then he jumped at the telephone and called this house and got ponsonby and told him to go straight to the little room on the top floor and take amelias portrait down i thought that a little unnecessary myself but he was in such a whirl of remorse that it was useless to try and get him to be rational so hilda was consoled and he calmed down and we all came down here in the automobile so you see  at this moment the door opened and in came harold  i sayhello reggie old mani say its a funny thing but we cant find ponsonby anywhere  there are moments in a chappies life dont you know when reason so to speak totters as it were on its bally throne this was one of them the situation seemed somehow to have got out of my grip i suppose strictly speaking i ought at this juncture to have cleared my throat and said in an audible tone harold old top i know where ponsonby is but somehow i couldnt something seemed to keep the words back i just stood there and said nothing  nobody seems to have seen anything of him said harold i wonder where he can have got to  hilda came in looking so happy i hardly recognized her i remember feeling how strange it was that anybody could be happy just then  i know she said of course doesnt he always go off to the inn and play bowls at this time  why of course said harold so he does  and he asked ann to play something on the piano and pretty soon we had settled down to a regular jolly musical evening ann must have played a matter of two or three thousand tunes when harold got up  by the way he said i suppose he did what i told him about the picture before he went out lets go and see  oh harold what does it matter asked hilda  dont be silly harold said ann  i would have said the same thing only i couldnt say anything  harold wasnt to be stopped he led the way out of the room and upstairs and we all trailed after him we had just reached the top floor when hilda stopped and said hark  it was a voice  hi it said hi  harold legged it to the door of the studio ponsonby  from within came the voice again and i have never heard anything to touch the combined pathos dignity and indignation it managed to condense into two words  yes sir  what on earth are you doing in there  i came here sir in accordance with your instructions on the telephone and  harold rattled the door the darned things stuck  yes sir  how on earth did that happen  i could not say sir  how can the door have stuck like this said ann  somebodyi suppose it was me though the voice didnt sound familiar spoke perhaps theres a wedge under it said this chappie  a wedge what do you mean  one of those little wedges you use to keep windows from rattling dont you know  but why youre absolutely right reggie old man there is  he yanked it out and flung the door open and out came ponsonby looking like lady macbeth  i wish to give notice sir he said and i should esteem it a favor if i might go to the pantry and procure some food as i am extremely hungry  and he passed from our midst with hilda after him saying but ponsonby be reasonable ponsonby  ann selby turned on me with a swish reggie she said did you shut ponsonby in there  well yes as a matter of fact i did  but why asked harold  well to be absolutely frank old top i thought it was you  you thought it was me but whywhat did you want to lock me in for  i hesitated it was a delicate business telling him the idea and while i was hesitating ann jumped in  i can tell you why harold it was because reggie belongs to that subspecies of humanity known as practical jokers this sort of thing is his idea of humor  humor losing us a priceless butler said harold if thats your idea of  hilda came back pale and anxious harold dear do come and help me reason with ponsonby he is in the pantry gnawing a cold chicken and he only stops to say i give notice  yes said ann go both of you i wish to speak to reggie alone  thats how i came to lose ann at intervals during her remarks i tried to put my side of the case but it was no good she wouldnt listen and presently something seemed to tell me that now was the time to go to my room and pack half an hour later i slid silently into the night  wasnt it shakespeare or somebody who said that the road to hellor words to that effectwas paved with good intentions if it was shakespeare it just goes to prove what they are always saying about himthat he knew a bit take it from one who knows the old boy was absolutely right
