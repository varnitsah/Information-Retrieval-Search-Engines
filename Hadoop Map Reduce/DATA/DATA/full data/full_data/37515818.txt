37515818	collected essays volume v  science and christian tradition  by thomas h huxley  new york d appleton and company 1902     preface   for close upon forty years i have been writing with one purpose from time to time i have fought for that which seemed to me the truth perhaps still more against that which i have thought error and in this way i have reached indeed overstepped the threshold of old age there every earnest man has to listen to the voice within give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward  that i have been an unjust steward my conscience does not bear witness at times blundering at times negligent heaven knows but on the whole i have done that which i felt able and called upon to do and i have done it without looking to the right or to the left seeking no mans favor fearing no mans disfavor  but what is it that i have been doing in the end ones conceptions should form a whole though only parts may have found utterance as occasion arose now do these exhibit harmony and mutual connexion in ones zeal much of the old gets broken to pieces but has one made ready something new fit to be set in the place of the old  that they merely destroy without reconstructing is the especial charge with which those who work in this direction are constantly reproached in a certain sense i do not defend myself against the charge but i deny that any reproach is deserved  i have never proposed to myself to begin outward construction because i do not believe that the time has come for it our present business is with inward preparation especially the preparation of those who have ceased to be content with the old and find no satisfaction in half measures i have wished and i still wish to disturb no mans peace of mind no mans beliefs but only to point out to those in whom they are already shattered the direction in which in my conviction firmer ground lies1  so wrote one of the protagonists of the new reformationand a wellabused man if ever there was onea score of years since in the remarkable book in which he discusses the negative and the positive results of the rigorous application of scientific method to the investigation of the higher problems of human life  recent experience leads me to imagine that there may be a good many countrymen of my own even at this time to whom it may be profitable to read mark and inwardly digest the weighty words of the author of that leben jesu which half a century ago stirred the religious world so seriously that it has never settled down again quite on the old foundations indeed some think it never will i have a personal interest in the carrying out of the recommendation i venture to make it may enable many worthy persons in whose estimation i should really be glad to stand higher than i do to become aware of the possibility that my motives in writing the essays contained in this and the preceding volume were not exactly those that they ascribe to me  i too have reached the term at which the still small voice more audible than any other to the dulled ear of age makes its demand and i have found that it is of no sort of use to try to cook the accounts rendered nevertheless i distinctly decline to admit some of the items charged more particularly that of having gone out of my way to attack the bible and i as steadfastly deny that hatred of christianity is a feeling with which i have any acquaintance there are very few things which i find it permissible to hate and though it may be that some of the organisations which arrogate to themselves the christian name have richly earned a place in the category of hateful things that ought to have nothing to do with ones estimation of the religion which they have perverted and disfigured out of all likeness to the original  the simple fact is that as i have already more than once hinted my story is that of the wolf and the lamb over again i have never gone out of my way to attack the bible or anything else it was the dominant ecclesiasticism of my early days which as i believe without any warrant from the bible itself thrust the book in my way  i had set out on a journey with no other purpose than that of exploring a certain province of natural knowledge i strayed no hairs breadth from the course which it was my right and my duty to pursue and yet i found that whatever route i took before long i came to a tall and formidablelooking fence confident as i might be in the existence of an ancient and indefeasible right of way before me stood the thorny barrier with its comminatory noticeboardno thoroughfare by order moses there seemed no way over nor did the prospect of creeping round as i saw some do attract me true there was no longer any cause to fear the spring guns and mantraps set by former lords of the manor but one is apt to get very dirty going on allfours the only alternatives were either to give up my journeywhich i was not minded to door to break the fence down and go through it  now i was and am by nature a lawabiding person ready and willing to submit to all legitimate authority but i also had and have a rooted conviction that reasonable assurance of the legitimacy should precede the submission so i made it my business to look up the manorial titledeeds the pretensions of the ecclesiastical moses to exercise a control over the operations of the reasoning faculty in the search after truth thirty centuries after his age might be justifiable but assuredly the credentials produced in justification of claims so large required careful scrutiny  singular discoveries rewarded my industry the ecclesiastical moses proved to be a mere traditional mask behind which no doubt lay the features of the historical mosesjust as many a mediæval fresco has been hidden by the whitewash of georgian churchwardens and as the æsthetic rector too often scrapes away the defacement only to find blurred particoloured patches in which the original design is no longer to be traced so when the successive layers of jewish and christian traditional pigment laid on at intervals for near three thousand years had been removed by even the tenderest critical operations there was not much to be discerned of the leader of the exodus  only one point became perfectly clear to me namely that moses is not responsible for ninetenths of the pentateuch certainly not for the legends which had been made the bugbears of science in fact the fence turned out to be a mere heap of dry sticks and brushwood and one might walk through it with impunity the which i did but i was still young when i thus ventured to assert my liberty and young people are apt to be filled with a kind of sæva indignatio when they discover the wide discrepancies between things as they seem and things as they are it hurts their vanity to feel that they have prepared themselves for a mighty struggle to climb over or break their way through a rampart which turns out on close approach to be a mere heap of ruins venerable indeed and archæologically interesting but of no other moment and some fragment of the superfluous energy accumulated is apt to find vent in strong language  such i suppose was my case when i wrote some passages which occur in an essay reprinted among darwiniana2 but when not long ago the voice put it to me whether i had better not expunge or modify these passages whether really they were not a little too strong i had to reply with all deference that while from a merely literary point of view i might admit them to be rather crude i must stand by the substance of these items of my expenditure i further ventured to express the conviction that scientific criticism of the old testament since 1860 has justified every word of the estimate of the authority of the ecclesiastical moses written at that time and carried away by the heat of selfjustification i even ventured to add that the desperate attempt now set afoot to force biblical and postbiblical mythology into elementary instruction renders it useful and necessary to go on making a considerable outlay in the same direction not yet has the cosmogony of the semibarbarous hebrew ceased to be the incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the orthodox not yet has the zeal of the bibliolater ceased from troubling not yet are the weaker sort even of the instructed at rest from their fruitless toil to harmonise impossibilities and to force the generous new wine of science into the old bottles of judaism  but i am aware that the head and front of my offending lies not now where it formerly lay thirty years ago criticism of moses was held by most respectable people to be deadly sin now it has sunk to the rank of a mere peccadillo at least if it stops short of the history of abraham destroy the foundation of most forms of dogmatic christianity contained in the second chapter of genesis if you will the new ecclesiasticism undertakes to underpin the superstructure and make it at any rate to the eye as firm as ever but let him be anathema who applies exactly the same canons of criticism to the opening chapters of matthew or of luke schoolchildren may be told that the world was by no means made in six days and that implicit belief in the story of noahs ark is permissible only as a matter of business to their toymakers but they are to hold for the certainest of truths to be doubted only at peril of their salvation that their galilean fellowchild jesus nineteen centuries ago had no human father                                       well we will pass the item of 1860 said the voice but why all this more recent coil about the gadarene swine and the like do you pretend that these poor animals got in your way years and years after the mosaic fences were down at any rate so far as you are concerned  got in my way why my good voice they were driven in my way i had happened to make a statement than which so far as i have ever been able to see nothing can be more modest or inoffensive to wit that i am convinced of my own utter ignorance about a great number of things respecting which the great majority of my neighbours not only those of adult years but children repeating their catechisms affirm themselves to possess full information i ask any candid and impartial judge is that attacking anybody or anything  yet if i had made the most wanton and arrogant onslaught on the honest convictions of other people i could not have been more hardly dealt with the pentecostal charism i believe exhausted itself amongst the earliest disciples yet any one who has had to attend as i have done to copious objurgations strewn with such appellations as infidel and coward must be a hardened sceptic indeed if he doubts the existence of a gift of tongues in the churches of our time unless indeed it should occur to him that some of these outpourings may have taken place after the third hour of the day i am far from thinking that it is worth while to give much attention to these inevitable incidents of all controversies in which one party has acquired the mental peculiarities which are generated by the habit of much talking with immunity from criticism but as a rule they are the sauce of dishes of misrepresentations and inaccuracies which it may be a duty nay even an innocent pleasure to expose in the particular case of which i am thinking i felt as strauss says able and called upon to undertake the business and it is no responsibility of mine if i found the gospels with their miraculous stories of which the gadarene is a typical example blocking my way as heretofore the pentateuch had done  i was challenged to question the authority for the theory of the spiritual world and the practical consequences deducible from human relations to it contained in these documents  in my judgment the actuality of this spiritual worldthe value of the evidence for its objective existence and its influence upon the course of thingsare matters which lie as much within the province of science as any other question about the existence and powers of the varied forms of living and conscious activity  it really is my strong conviction that a man has no more right to say he believes this world is haunted by swarms of evil spirits without being able to produce satisfactory evidence of the fact than he has a right to say without adducing adequate proof that the circumpolar antarctic ice swarms with seaserpents i should not like to assert positively that it does not i imagine that no cautious biologist would say as much but while quite open to conviction he might properly decline to waste time upon the consideration of talk no better accredited than forecastle yarns about such monsters of the deep and if the interests of ordinary veracity dictate this course in relation to a matter of so little consequence as this what must be our obligations in respect of the treatment of a question which is fundamental alike for science and for ethics for not only does our general theory of the universe and of the nature of the order which pervades it hang upon the answer but the rules of practical life must be deeply affected by it  the belief in a demonic world is inculcated throughout the gospels and the rest of the books of the new testament it pervades the whole patristic literature it colours the theory and the practice of every christian church down to modern times indeed i doubt if even now there is any church which officially departs from such a fundamental doctrine of primitive christianity as the existence in addition to the cosmos with which natural knowledge is conversant of a world of spirits that is to say of intelligent agents not subject to the physical or mental limitations of humanity but nevertheless competent to interfere to an undefined extent with the ordinary course of both physical and mental phenomena  more especially is this conception fundamental for the authors of the gospels without the belief that the present world and particularly that part of it which is constituted by human society has been given over since the fall to the influence of wicked and malignant spiritual beings governed and directed by a supreme devilthe moral antithesis and enemy of the supreme godtheir theory of salvation by the messiah falls to pieces to this end was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil3  the halfhearted religiosity of latterday christianity may choose to ignore the fact but it remains none the less true that he who refuses to accept the demonology of the gospels rejects the revelation of a spiritual world made in them as much as if he denied the existence of such a person as jesus of nazareth and deserves as much as any one can do to be earmarked infidel by our gentle shepherds                                       now that which i thought it desirable to make perfectly clear on my own account and for the sake of those who find their capacity of belief in the gospel theory of the universe failing them is the fact that in my judgment the demonology of primitive christianity is totally devoid of foundation and that no man who is guided by the rules of investigation which are found to lead to the discovery of truth in other matters not merely of science but in the everyday affairs of life will arrive at any other conclusion to those who profess to be otherwise guided i have nothing to say but to beg them to go their own way and leave me to mine  i think it may be as well to repeat what i have said over and over again elsewhere that a priori notions about the possibility or the impossibility of the existence of a world of spirits such as that presupposed by genuine christianity have no influence on my mind the question for me is purely one of evidence is the evidence adequate to bear out the theory or is it not in my judgment it is not only inadequate but quite absurdly insufficient and on that ground i should feel compelled to reject the theory even if there were no positive grounds for adopting a totally different conception of the cosmos  for most people the question of the evidence of the existence of a demonic world in the long run resolves itself into that of the trustworthiness of the gospels first as to the objective truth of that which they narrate on this topic second as to the accuracy of the interpretation which their authors put upon these objective facts for example with respect to the gadarene miracle it is one question whether at a certain time and place a raving madman became sane and a herd of swine rushed into the lake of tiberias and quite another whether the cause of these occurrences was the transmigration of certain devils from the man into the pigs and again it is one question whether jesus made a long oration on a certain occasion mentioned in the first gospel altogether another whether more or fewer of the propositions contained in the sermon on the mount were uttered on that occasion one may give an affirmative answer to one of each of these pairs of questions and a negative to the other one may affirm all or deny all  in considering the historical value of any four documents proof when they were written and who wrote them is no doubt highly important for if proof exists that a b c and d wrote them and that they were intelligent persons writing independently and without prejudice about facts within their own knowledgetheir statements must needs be worthy of the most attentive consideration4 but even ecclesiastical tradition does not assert that either mark or luke wrote from his own knowledgeindeed luke expressly asserts he did not i cannot discover that any competent authority now maintains that the apostle matthew wrote the gospel which passes under his name and whether the apostle john had or had not anything to do with the fourth gospel and if he had what his share amounted to are as everybody who has attended to these matters knows questions still hotly disputed and with regard to which the extant evidence can hardly carry an impartial judge beyond the admission of a possibility this way or that  thus nothing but a balancing of very dubious probabilities is to be attained by approaching the question from this side it is otherwise if we make the documents tell their own story if we study them as we study fossils to discover internal evidence of when they arose and how they have come to be that really fruitful line of inquiry has led to the statement and the discussion of what is known as the synoptic problem  in the essays viixi which deal with the consequences of the application of the agnostic principle to christian evidences contained in this volume there are several references to the results of the attempts which have been made during the last hundred years to solve this problem and though it has been clearly stated and discussed in works accessible to and intelligible by every english reader5 it may be well that i should here set forth a very brief exposition of the matters of fact out of which the problem has arisen and of some consequences which as i conceive must be admitted if the facts are accepted  these undisputed and apparently indisputable data may be thus stated  i the three books of which an ancient but very questionable ecclesiastical tradition asserts matthew mark and luke to be the authors agree not only in presenting the same general view or synopsis of the nature and the order of the events narrated but to a remarkable extent the very words which they employ coincide  ii nevertheless there are many equally marked and some irreconcilable differences between them narratives verbally identical in some portions diverge more or less in others the order in which they occur in one or in two gospels may be changed in another in matthew and in luke events of great importance make their appearance where the story of mark seems to leave no place for them and at the beginning and the end of the two former gospels there is a great amount of matter of which there is no trace in mark  iii obvious and highly important differences in style and substance separate the three synoptics taken together from the fourth gospel connected by ecclesiastical tradition with the name of the apostle john in its philosophical proemium in the conspicuous absence of exorcistic miracles in the selfassertive theosophy of the long and diffuse monologues which are so utterly unlike the brief and pregnant utterances of jesus recorded in the synoptics in the assertion that the crucifixion took place before the passover which involves the denial by implication of the truth of the synoptic storyto mention only a few particularsthe johannine gospel presents a wide divergence from the other three  iv if the mutual resemblances and differences of the synoptic gospels are closely considered a curious result comes out namely that each may be analyzed into four components the first of these consists of passages to a greater or less extent verbally identical which occur in all three gospels if this triple tradition is separated from the rest it will be found to comprise  a a narrative of a somewhat broken and anecdotic aspect which covers the period from the appearance of john the baptist to the discovery of the emptiness of the tomb on the first day of the week some sixandthirty hours after the crucifixion  b an apocalyptic address  c parables and brief discourses or rather centos of religious and ethical exhortations and injunctions  the second and the third set of components of each gospel present equally close resemblances to passages which are found in only one of the other gospels therefore it may be said that for them the tradition is double the fourth component is peculiar to each gospel it is a single tradition and has no representative in the others  to put the facts in another way each gospel is composed of a threefold tradition two twofold traditions and one peculiar tradition if the gospels were the work of totally independent writers it would follow that there are three witnesses for the statements in the first tradition two for each of those in the second and only one for those in the third  v if the reader will now take up that extremely instructive little book abbott and rushbrookes common tradition he will easily satisfy himself that mark has the remarkable structure just described almost the whole of this gospel consists of the first component namely the threefold tradition but in chap i 2328 he will discover an exorcistic story not to be found in matthew but repeated often word for word in luke this therefore belongs to one of the twofold traditions in chap viii 110 on the other hand there is a detailed account of the miracle of feeding the four thousand which is closely repeated in matthew xv 3239 but is not to be found in luke this is an example of the other twofold tradition possible in mark finally the story of the blind man of bethsaida mark viii 2226 is peculiar to mark  vi suppose that a standing for the threefold tradition or the matter common to all three gospels we call the matter common to mark and matthew onlyb that common to mark and luke onlyc that common to matthew and luke onlyd while the peculiar components of mark matthew and luke are severally indicated by e f g then the structure of the gospels may be represented thus    components of mark  a  b  c  e             matthew  a  b  d  f                luke  a  c  d  g  vii the analysis of the synoptic documents need be carried no further than this point in order to suggest one extremely important and apparently unavoidable conclusion and that is that their authors were neither three independent witnesses of the things narrated nor for the parts of the narrative about which all agree that is to say the threefold tradition did they employ independent sources of information it is simply incredible that each of three independent witnesses of any series of occurrences should tell a story so similar not only in arrangement and in small details but in words to that of each of the others  hence it follows either that the synoptic writers have mediately or immediately copied one from the other or that the three have drawn from a common source that is to say from one arrangement of similar traditions whether oral or written though that arrangement may have been extant in three or more somewhat different versions  viii the suppositions a that mark had matthew and luke before him and b that either of the two latter was acquainted with the work of the other would seem to involve some singular consequences  a the second gospel is saturated with the lowest supernaturalism jesus is exhibited as a wonderworker and exorcist of the first rank the earliest public recognition of the messiahship of jesus comes from an unclean spirit he himself is made to testify to the occurrence of the miraculous feeding twice over  the purpose with which mark sets out is to show forth jesus as the son of god and it is suggested if not distinctly stated that he acquired this character at his baptism by john the absence of any reference to the miraculous events of the infancy detailed by matthew and luke or to the appearances after the discovery of the emptiness of the tomb is unintelligible if mark knew anything about them or believed in the miraculous conception the second gospel is no summary mark can find room for the detailed story irrelevant to his main purpose of the beheading of john the baptist and his miraculous narrations are crowded with minute particulars is it to be imagined that with the supposed apostolic authority of matthew before him he could leave out the miraculous conception of jesus and the ascension further ecclesiastical tradition would have us believe that mark wrote down his recollections of what peter taught did peter then omit to mention these matters did the fact testified by the oldest authority extant that the first appearance of the risen jesus was to himself seem not worth mentioning did he really fail to speak of the great position in the church solemnly assigned to him by jesus the alternative would seem to be the impeachment either of marks memory or of his judgment but marks memory is so good that he can recollect how on the occasion of the stilling of the waves jesus was asleep on the cushion he remembers that the woman with the issue had spent all she had on her physicians that there was not room even about the door on a certain occasion at capernaum and it is surely hard to believe that mark should have failed to recollect occurrences of infinitely greater moment or that he should have deliberately left them out as things not worthy of mention  b the supposition that matthew was acquainted with luke or luke with matthew has equally grave implications if that be so the one who used the other could have had but a poor opinion of his predecessors historical veracity if as most experts agree luke is later than matthew it is clear that he does not credit matthews account of the infancy does not believe the sermon on the mount as given by matthew was preached does not believe in the two feeding miracles to which jesus himself is made to refer wholly discredits matthews account of the events after the crucifixion and thinks it not worth while to notice matthews grave admission that some doubted  ix none of these troublesome consequences pursue the hypothesis that the threefold tradition in one or more greek versions was extant before either of the canonical synoptic gospels and that it furnished the fundamental framework of their several narratives where and when the threefold narrative arose there is no positive evidence though it is obviously probable that the traditions it embodies and perhaps many others took their rise in palestine and spread thence to asia minor greece egypt and italy in the track of the early missionaries nor is it less likely that they formed part of the didaskalia of the primitive nazarene and christian communities6  x the interest which attaches to mark arises from the fact that it seems to present this early probably earliest greek gospel narrative with least addition or modification if as appears likely from some internal evidences it was compiled for the use of the christian sodalities in rome and that it was accepted by them as an adequate account of the life and work of jesus it is evidence of the most valuable kind respecting their beliefs and the limits of dogma as conceived by them  in such case a good roman christian of that epoch might know nothing of the doctrine of the incarnation as taught by matthew and luke still less of the logos doctrine of john neither need he have believed anything more than the simple fact of the resurrection it was open to him to believe it either corporeal or spiritual he would never have heard of the power of the keys bestowed upon peter nor have had brought to his mind so much as a suggestion of trinitarian doctrine he might be a rigidly monotheistic judæochristian and consider himself bound by the law he might be a gentile pauline convert neither knowing of nor caring for such restrictions in neither case would he find in mark any serious stumblingblock in fact persons of all the categories admitted to salvation by justin in the middle of the second century7 could accept mark from beginning to end it may well be that in this wide adaptability backed by the authority of the metropolitan church there lies the reason for the fact of the preservation of mark notwithstanding its limited and dogmatically colourless character as compared with the gospels of luke and matthew  xi mark as we have seen contains a relatively small body of ethical and religious instruction and only a few parables were these all that existed in the primitive threefold tradition were none others current in the roman communities at the time mark wrote supposing he wrote in rome or on the other hand was there extant as early as the time at which mark composed his greek edition of the primitive evangel one or more collections of parables and teachings such as those which form the bulk of the twofold tradition common exclusively to matthew and luke and are also found in their single traditions many have assumed this or these collections to be identical with or at any rate based upon the logia of which ecclesiastical tradition says that they were written in aramaic by matthew and that everybody translated them as he could  here is the old difficulty again if such materials were known to mark what imaginable reason could he have for not using them surely displacement of the long episode of john the baptisteven perhaps of the story of the gadarene swineby portions of the sermon on the mount or by one or two of the beautiful parables in the twofold and single traditions would have been great improvements and might have been effected even though mark was as much pressed for space as some have imagined but there is no ground for that imagination mark has actually found room for four or five parables why should he not have given the best if he had known of them admitting he was the mere pedissequus et breviator of matthew that even augustine supposed him to be what could induce him to omit the lords prayer  whether more or less of the materials of the twofold tradition d and of the peculiar traditions f and g were or were not current in some of the communities as early as or perhaps earlier than the triple tradition it is not necessary for me to discuss nor to consider those solutions of the synoptic problem which assume that it existed earlier and was already combined with more or less narrative those who are working out the final solution of the synoptic problem are taking into account more than hitherto the possibility that the widely separated christian communities of palestine asia minor egypt and italy especially after the jewish war of ad 6670 may have found themselves in possession of very different traditional materials many circumstances tend to the conclusion that in asia minor even the narrative part of the threefold tradition had a formidable rival and that around this second narrative teaching traditions of a totally different order from those in the synoptics grouped themselves and under the influence of converts imbued more or less with the philosophical speculations of the time eventually took shape in the fourth gospel and its associated literature  xii but it is unnecessary and it would be out of place for me to attempt to do more than indicate the existence of these complex and difficult questions my purpose has been to make it clear that the synoptic problem must force itself upon every one who studies the gospels with attention that the broad facts of the case and some of the consequences deducible from these facts are just as plain to the simple english reader as they are to the profoundest scholar  one of these consequences is that the threefold tradition presents us with a narrative believed to be historically true in all its particulars by the major part if not the whole of the christian communities that narrative is penetrated from beginning to end by the demonological beliefs of which the gadarene story is a specimen and if the fourth gospel indicates the existence of another and in some respects irreconcilably divergent narrative in which the demonology retires into the background it is none the less there  therefore the demonology is an integral and inseparable component of primitive christianity the farther back the origin of the gospels is dated the stronger does the certainty of this conclusion grow and the more difficult it becomes to suppose that jesus himself may not have shared the superstitious beliefs of his disciples  it further follows that those who accept devils possession and exorcism as essential elements of their conception of the spiritual world may consistently consider the testimony of the gospels to be unimpeachable in respect of the information they give us respecting other matters which appertain to that world  those who reject the gospel demonology on the other hand would seem to be as completely barred as i feel myself to be from professing to take the accuracy of that information for granted if the threefold tradition is wrong about one fundamental topic it may be wrong about another while the authority of the single traditions often mutually contradictory as they are becomes a vanishing quantity  it really is unreasonable to ask any rejector of the demonology to say more with respect to those other matters than that the statements regarding them may be true or may be false and that the ultimate decision if it is to be favourable must depend on the production of testimony of a very different character from that of the writers of the four gospels until such evidence is brought forward that refusal of assent with willingness to reopen the question on cause shown which is what i mean by agnosticism is for me the only course open                                       a verdict of not proven is undoubtedly unsatisfactory and essentially provisional so far forth as the subject of the trial is capable of being dealt with by due process of reason  those who are of opinion that the historical realities at the root of christianity lie beyond the jurisdiction of science need not be considered those who are convinced that the evidence is and must always remain insufficient to support any definite conclusion are justified in ignoring the subject they must be content to put up with that reproach of being mere destroyers of which strauss speaks they may say that there are so many problems which are and must remain insoluble that the burden of the mystery of all this unintelligible world is not appreciably affected by one more or less  for myself i must confess that the problem of the origin of such very remarkable historical phenomena as the doctrines and the social organization which in their broad features certainly existed and were in a state of rapid development within a hundred years of the crucifixion of jesus and which have steadily prevailed against all rivals among the most intelligent and civilized nations in the world ever since is and always has been profoundly interesting and considering how recent the really scientific study of that problem and how great the progress made during the last half century in supplying the conditions for a positive solution of the problem i cannot doubt that the attainment of such a solution is a mere question of time  i am well aware that it has lain far beyond my powers to take any share in this great undertaking all that i can hope is to have done somewhat towards the preparation of those who have ceased to be contented with the old and find no satisfaction in half measures perhaps also something towards the lessening of that great proportion of my countrymen whose eminent characteristic it is that they find full satisfaction in half measures  thh hodeslea eastbourne december 4th 1893  footnotes        1 df strauss der alte und der neue glaube           1872 pp 9 10        2 collected

   i prologue  controverted questions 1892  le plus grand service quon puisse rendre à la science est dy faire place nette avant dy rien construirecuvier   most of the essays comprised in the present volume have been written during the last six or seven years without premeditated purpose or intentional connection in reply to attacks upon doctrines which i hold to be well founded or in refutation of allegations respecting matters lying within the province of natural knowledge which i believe to be erroneous and they bear the mark of their origin in the controversial tone which pervades them  of polemical writing as of other kinds of warfare i think it may be said that it is often useful sometimes necessary and always more or less of an evil it is useful when it attracts attention to topics which might otherwise be neglected and when as does sometimes happen those who come to see a contest remain to think it is necessary when the interests of truth and of justice are at stake it is an evil in so far as controversy always tends to degenerate into quarrelling to swerve from the great issue of what is right and what is wrong to the very small question of who is right and who is wrong i venture to hope that the useful and the necessary were more conspicuous than the evil attributes of literary militancy when these papers were first published but i have had some hesitation about reprinting them if i may judge by my own taste few literary dishes are less appetising than cold controversy moreover there is an air of unfairness about the presentation of only one side of a discussion and a flavour of unkindness in the reproduction of winged words which however appropriate at the time of their utterance would find a still more appropriate place in oblivion yet since i could hardly ask those who have honoured me by their polemical attentions to confer lustre on this collection by permitting me to present their lucubrations along with my own and since it would be a manifest wrong to them to deprive their by no means rare vivacities of language of such justification as they may derive from similar freedoms on my part i came to the conclusion that my best course was to leave the essays just as they were written8 assuring my honourable adversaries that any heat of which signs may remain was generated in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy by the force of their own blows and has long since been dissipated into space  but however the polemical coincomitants of these discussions may be regardedor better disregardedthere is no doubt either about the importance of the topics of which they treat or as to the public interest in the controverted questions with which they deal or rather the controverted question for disconnected as these pieces may perhaps appear to be they are in fact concerned only with different aspects of a single problem with which thinking men have been occupied ever since they began seriously to consider the wonderful frame of things in which their lives are set and to seek for trustworthy guidance among its intricacies  experience speedily taught them that the shifting scenes of the worlds stage have a permanent background that there is order amidst the seeming confusion and that many events take place according to unchanging rules to this region of familiar steadiness and customary regularity they gave the name of nature but at the same time their infantile and untutored reason little more as yet than the playfellow of the imagination led them to believe that this tangible commonplace orderly world of nature was surrounded and interpenetrated by another intangible and mysterious world no more bound by fixed rules than as they fancied were the thoughts and passions which coursed through their minds and seemed to exercise an intermittent and capricious rule over their bodies they attributed to the entities with which they peopled this dim and dreadful region an unlimited amount of that power of modifying the course of events of which they themselves possessed a small share and thus came to regard them as not merely beyond but above nature  hence arose the conception of a supernature antithetic to naturethe primitive dualism of a natural world fixed in fate and a supernatural left to the free play of volitionwhich has pervaded all later speculation and for thousands of years has exercised a profound influence on practice for it is obvious that on this theory of the universe the successful conduct of life must demand careful attention to both worlds and if either is to be neglected it may be safer that it should be nature in any given contingency it must doubtless be desirable to know what may be expected to happen in the ordinary course of things but it must be quite as necessary to have some inkling of the line likely to be taken by supernatural agencies able and possibly willing to suspend or reverse that course indeed logically developed the dualistic theory must needs end in almost exclusive attention to supernature and in trust that its overruling strength will be exerted in favour of those who stand well with its denizens on the other hand the lessons of the great schoolmaster experience have hardly seemed to accord with this conclusion they have taught with considerable emphasis that it does not answer to neglect nature and that on the whole the more attention paid to her dictates the better men fare  thus the theoretical antithesis brought about a practical antagonism from the earliest times of which we have any knowledge naturalism and supernaturalism have consciously or unconsciously competed and struggled with one another and the varying fortunes of the contest are written in the records of the course of civilisation from those of egypt and babylonia six thousand years ago down to those of our own time and people  these records inform us that so far as men have paid attention to nature they have been rewarded for their pains they have developed the arts which have furnished the conditions of civilised existence and the sciences which have been a progressive revelation of reality and have afforded the best discipline of the mind in the methods of discovering truth they have accumulated a vast body of universally accepted knowledge and the conceptions of man and of society of morals and of law based upon that knowledge are every day more and more either openly or tacitly acknowledged to be the foundations of right action  history also tells us that the field of the supernatural has rewarded its cultivators with a harvest perhaps not less luxuriant but of a different character it has produced an almost infinite diversity of religions these if we set aside the ethical concomitants upon which natural knowledge also has a claim are composed of information about supernature they tell us of the attributes of supernatural beings of their relations with nature and of the operations by which their interference with the ordinary course of events can be secured or averted it does not appear however that supernaturalists have attained to any agreement about these matters or that history indicates a widening of the influence of supernaturalism on practice with the onward flow of time on the contrary the various religions are to a great extent mutually exclusive and their adherents delight in charging each other not merely with error but with criminality deserving and ensuing punishment of infinite severity in singular contrast with natural knowledge again the acquaintance of mankind with the supernatural appears the more extensive and the more exact and the influence of supernatural doctrines upon conduct the greater the further back we go in time and the lower the stage of civilisation submitted to investigation historically indeed there would seem to be an inverse relation between supernatural and natural knowledge as the latter has widened gained in precision and in trustworthiness so has the former shrunk grown vague and questionable as the one has more and more filled the sphere of action so has the other retreated into the region of meditation or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal recognition  whether this difference of the fortunes of naturalism and of supernaturalism is an indication of the progress or of the regress of humanity of a fall from or an advance towards the higher life is a matter of opinion the point to which i wish to direct attention is that the difference exists and is making itself felt men are growing to be seriously alive to the fact that the historical evolution of humanity which is generally and i venture to think not unreasonably regarded as progress has been and is being accompanied by a coordinate elimination of the supernatural from its originally large occupation of mens thoughts the questionhow far is this process to gois in my apprehension the controverted question of our time                                       controversy on this matterprolonged bitter and fought out with the weapons of the flesh as well as with those of the spiritis no new thing to englishmen we have been more or less occupied with it these five hundred years and during that time we have made attempts to establish a modus vivendi between the antagonists some of which have had a worldwide influence though unfortunately none have proved universally and permanently satisfactory  in the fourteenth century the controverted question among us was whether certain portions of the supernaturalism of mediæval christianity were wellfounded john wicliff proposed a solution of the problem which in the course of the following two hundred years acquired wide popularity and vast historical importance lollards hussites lutherans calvinists zwinglians socinians and anabaptists whatever their disagreements concurred in the proposal to reduce the supernaturalism of christianity within the limits sanctioned by the scriptures none of the chiefs of protestantism called in question either the supernatural origin and infallible authority of the bible or the exactitude of the account of the supernatural world given in its pages in fact they could not afford to entertain any doubt about these points since the infallible bible was the fulcrum of the lever with which they were endeavouring to upset the chair of st peter the freedom of private judgment which they proclaimed meant no more in practice than permission to themselves to make free with the public judgment of the roman church in respect of the canon and of the meaning to be attached to the words of the canonical books private judgmentthat is to say reasonwas theoretically at any rate at liberty to decide what books were and what were not to take the rank of scripture and to determine the sense of any passage in such books but this sense once ascertained to the mind of the sectary was to be taken for pure truthfor the very word of god the controversial efficiency of the principle of biblical infallibility lay in the fact that the conservative adversaries of the reformers were not in a position to contravene it without entangling themselves in serious difficulties while since both papists and protestants agreed in taking efficient measures to stop the mouths of any more radical critics these did not count  the impotence of their adversaries however did not remove the inherent weakness of the position of the protestants the dogma of the infallibility of the bible is no more selfevident than is that of the infallibility of the pope if the former is held by faith then the latter may be if the latter is to be accepted or rejected by private judgment why not the former even if the bible could be proved anywhere to assert its own infallibility the value of that selfassertion to those who dispute the point is not obvious on the other hand if the infallibility of the bible was rested on that of a primitive church the admission that the church was formerly infallible was awkward in the extreme for those who denied its present infallibility moreover no sooner was the protestant principle applied to practice than it became evident that even an infallible text when manipulated by private judgment will impartially countenance contradictory deductions and furnish forth creeds and confessions as diverse as the quality and the information of the intellects which exercise and the prejudices and passions which sway such judgments every sect confident in the derivative infallibility of its wiredrawing of infallible materials was ready to supply its contingent of martyrs and to enable history once more to illustrate the truth that steadfastness under persecution says much for the sincerity and still more for the tenacity of the believer but very little for the objective truth of that which he believes no martyrs have sealed their faith with their blood more steadfastly than the anabaptists  last but not least the protestant principle contained within itself the germs of the destruction of the finality which the lutheran calvinistic and other protestant churches fondly imagined they had reached since their creeds were professedly based on the canonical scriptures it followed that in the long run whoso settled the canon defined the creed if the private judgment of luther might legitimately conclude that the epistle of james was contemptible while the epistles of paul contained the very essence of christianity it must be permissible for some other private judgment on as good or as bad grounds to reverse these conclusions the critical process which excluded the apocrypha could not be barred at any rate by people who rejected the authority of the church from extending its operations to daniel the canticles and ecclesiastes nor having got so far was it easy to allege any good ground for staying the further progress of criticism in fact the logical development of protestantism could not fail to lay the authority of the scriptures at the feet of reason and in the hands of latitudinarian and rationalistic theologians the despotism of the bible was rapidly converted into an extremely limited monarchy treated with as much respect as ever the sphere of its practical authority was minimised and its decrees were valid only so far as they were countersigned by common sense the responsible minister  the champions of protestantism are much given to glorify the reformation of the sixteenth century as the emancipation of reason but it may be doubted if their contention has any solid ground while there is a good deal of evidence to show that aspirations after intellectual freedom had nothing whatever to do with the movement dante who struck the papacy as hard blows as wicliff wicliff himself and luther himself when they began their work were far enough from any intention of meddling with even the most irrational of the dogmas of mediæval supernaturalism from wicliff to socinus or even to münzer rothmann and john of leyden i fail to find a trace of any desire to set reason free the most that can be discovered is a proposal to change masters from being the slave of the papacy the intellect was to become the serf of the bible or to speak more accurately of somebodys interpretation of the bible which rapidly shifting its attitude from the humility of a private judgment to the arrogant cæsaropapistry of a stateenforced creed had no more hesitation about forcibly extinguishing opponent private judgments and judges than had the oldfashioned pontiffpapistry  it was the iniquities and not the irrationalities of the papal system that lay at the bottom of the revolt of the laity which was essentially an attempt to shake off the intolerable burden of certain practical deductions from a supernaturalism in which everybody in principle acquiesced what was the gain to intellectual freedom of abolishing transubstantiation image worship indulgences ecclesiastical infallibility if consubstantiation realunreal presence mystifications the bibliolatry the innerlight pretensions and the demonology which are fruits of the same supernaturalistic tree remained in enjoyment of the spiritual and temporal support of a new infallibility one does not free a prisoner by merely scraping away the rust from his shackles  it will be asked perhaps was not the reformation one of the products of that great outbreak of manysided free mental activity included under the general head of the renascence melanchthon ulrich von hutten beza were they not all humanists was not the archhumanist erasmus fautorinchief of the reformation until he got frightened and basely deserted it  from the language of protestant historians it would seem that they often forget that reformation and protestantism are by no means convertible terms there were plenty of sincere and indeed zealous reformers before during and after the birth and growth of protestantism who would have nothing to do with it assuredly the rejuvenescence of science and of art the widening of the field of nature by geographical and astronomical discovery the revelation of the noble ideals of antique literature by the revival of classical learning the stir of thought throughout all classes of society by the printers work loosened traditional bonds and weakened the hold of mediæval supernaturalism in the interests of liberal culture and of national welfare the humanists were eager to lend a hand to anything which tended to the discomfiture of their sworn enemies the monks and they willingly supported every movement in the direction of weakening ecclesiastical interference with civil life but the bond of a common enemy was the only real tie between the humanist and the protestant their alliance was bound to be of short duration and sooner or later to be replaced by internecine warfare the goal of the humanists whether they were aware of it or not was the attainment of the complete intellectual freedom of the antique philosopher than which nothing could be more abhorrent to a luther a calvin a beza or a zwingli  the key to the comprehension of the conduct of erasmus seems to me to lie in the clear apprehension of this fact that he was a man of many weaknesses may be true in fact he was quite aware of them and professed himself no hero but he never deserted that reformatory movement which he originally contemplated and it was impossible he should have deserted the specifically protestant reformation in which he never took part he was essentially a theological whig to whom radicalism was as hateful as it is to all whigs or to borrow a still more appropriate comparison from modern times a broad churchman who refused to enlist with either the high church or the low church zealots and paid the penalty of being called coward timeserver and traitor by both yet really there is a good deal in his pathetic remonstrance that he does not see why he is bound to become a martyr for that in which he does not believe and a fair consideration of the circumstances and the consequences of the protestant reformation seems to me to go a long way towards justifying the course he adopted  few men had better means of being acquainted with the condition of europe none could be more competent to gauge the intellectual shallowness and selfcontradiction of the protestant criticism of catholic doctrine and to estimate at its proper value the fond imagination that the waters let out by the renascence would come to rest amidst the blind alleys of the new ecclesiasticism the bastard whilom poor student and monk become the familiar of bishops and princes at home in all grades of society could not fail to be aware of the gravity of the social position of the dangers imminent from the profligacy and indifference of the ruling classes no less than from the anarchical tendencies of the people who groaned under their oppression the wanderer who had lived in germany in france in england in italy and who counted many of the best and most influential men in each country among his friends was not likely to estimate wrongly the enormous forces which were still at the command of the papacy bad as the churchmen might be the statesmen were worse and a person of far more sanguine temperament than erasmus might have seen no hope for the future except in gradually freeing the ubiquitous organisation of the church from the corruptions which alone as he imagined prevented it from being as beneficent as it was powerful the broad tolerance of the scholar and man of the world might well be revolted by the ruffianism however genial of one great light of protestantism and the narrow fanaticism however learned and logical of others and to a cautious thinker by whom whatever his shortcomings the ethical ideal of the christian evangel was sincerely prized it really was a fair question whether it was worth while to bring about a political and social deluge the end of which no mortal could foresee for the purpose of setting up lutheran zwinglian and other peterkins in the place of the actual claimant to the reversion of the spiritual wealth of the galilean fisherman  let us suppose that at the beginning of the lutheran and zwinglian movement a vision of its immediate consequences had been granted to erasmus imagine that to the spectre of the fierce outbreak of anabaptist communism which opened the apocalypse had succeeded in shadowy procession the reign of terror and of spoliation in england with the judicial murders of his friends more and fisher the bitter tyranny of evangelistic clericalism in geneva and in scotland the long agony of religious wars persecutions and massacres which devastated france and reduced germany almost to savagery finishing with the spectacle of lutheranism in its native country sunk into mere dead erastian formalism before it was a century old while jesuitry triumphed over protestantism in threefourths of europe bringing in its train a recrudescence of all the corruptions erasmus and his friends sought to abolish might not he have quite honestly thought this a somewhat too heavy price to pay for protestantism more especially since no one was in a better position than himself to know how little the dogmatic foundation of the new confessions was able to bear the light which the inevitable progress of humanistic criticism would throw upon them as the wiser of his contemporaries saw erasmus was at heart neither protestant nor papist but an independent christian and as the wiser of his modern biographers have discerned he was the precursor not of sixteenth century reform but of eighteenth century enlightenment a sort of broadchurch voltaire who held by his independent christianity as stoutly as voltaire by his deism  in fact the stream of the renascence which bore erasmus along left protestantism stranded amidst the mudbanks of its articles and creeds while its true course became visible to all men two centuries later by this time those in whom the movement of the renascence was incarnate became aware what spirit they were of and they attacked supernaturalism in its biblical stronghold defended by protestants and romanists with equal zeal in the eyes of the patriarch ultramontanism jansenism and calvinism were merely three persons of the one infâme which it was the object of his life to crush if he hated one more than another it was probably the last while dholbach and the extreme left of the freethinking host were disposed to show no more mercy to deism and pantheism  the sceptical insurrection of the eighteenth century made a terrific noise and frightened not a few worthy people out of their wits but cool judges might have foreseen at the outset that the efforts of the later rebels were no more likely than those of the earlier to furnish permanent restingplaces for the spirit of scientific inquiry however worthy of admiration may be the acuteness the common sense the wit the broad humanity which abound in the writings of the best of the freethinkers there is rarely much to be said for their work as an example of the adequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation i do not think any impartial judge will assert that from this point of view they are much better than their adversaries it must be admitted that they share to the full the fatal weakness of a priori philosophising no less than the moral frivolity common to their age while a singular want of appreciation of history as the record of the moral and social evolution of the human race permitted them to resort to preposterous theories of imposture in order to account for the religious phenomena which are natural products of that evolution  for the most part the romanist and protestant adversaries of the freethinkers met them with arguments no better than their own and with vituperation so far inferior that it lacked the wit but one great christian apologist fairly captured the guns of the freethinking array and turned their batteries upon themselves speculative infidelity of the eighteenth century type was mortally wounded by the analogy while the progress of the historical and psychological sciences brought to light the important part played by the mythopoeic faculty and by demonstrating the extreme readiness of men to impose upon themselves rendered the calling in of sacerdotal cooperation in most cases a superfluity  again as in the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries social and political influences came into play the freethinking philosophes who objected to rousseaus sentimental religiosity almost as much as they did to linfâme were credited with the responsibility for all the evil deeds of rousseaus jacobin disciples with about as much justification as wicliff was held responsible for the peasants revolt or luther for the bauernkrieg in england though our ancien régime was not altogether lovely the social edifice was never in such a bad way as in france it was still capable of being repaired and our forefathers very wisely preferred to wait until that operation could be safely performed rather than pull it all down about their ears in order to build a philosophically planned house on brandnew speculative foundations under these circumstances it is not wonderful that in this country practical men preferred the gospel of wesley and whitfield to that of jean jacques while enough of the old leaven of puritanism remained to ensure the favour and support of a large number of religious men to a revival of evangelical supernaturalism thus by degrees the freethinking or the indifference prevalent among us in the first half of the eighteenth century was replaced by a strong supernaturalistic reaction which submerged the work of the freethinkers and even seemed for a time to have arrested the naturalistic movement of which that work was an imperfect indication yet like lollardry four centuries earlier freethought merely took to running underground safe sooner or later to return to the surface                                       my memory unfortunately carries me back to the fourth decade of the nineteenth century when the evangelical flood had a little abated and the tops of certain mountains were soon to appear chiefly in the neighbourhood of oxford but when nevertheless bibliolatry was rampant when church and chapel alike proclaimed as the oracles of god the crude assumptions of the worst informed and in natural sequence the most presumptuously bigoted of all theological schools  in accordance with promises made on my behalf but certainly without my authorisation i was very early taken to hear sermons in the vulgar tongue and vulgar enough often was the tongue in which some preacher ignorant alike of literature of history of science and even of theology outside that patronised by his own narrow school poured forth from the safe entrenchment of the pulpit invectives against those who deviated from his notion of orthodoxy from dark allusions to sceptics and infidels i became aware of the existence of people who trusted in carnal reason who audaciously doubted that the world was made in six natural days or that the deluge was universal perhaps even went so far as to question the literal accuracy of the story of eves temptation or of balaams ass and from the horror of the tones in which they were mentioned i should have been justified in drawing the conclusion that these rash men belonged to the criminal classes at the same time those who were more directly responsible for providing me with the knowledge essential to the right guidance of life and who sincerely desired to do so imagined they were discharging that most sacred duty by impressing upon my childish mind the necessity on pain of reprobation in this world and damnation in the next of accepting in the strict and literal sense every statement contained in the protestant bible i was told to believe and i did believe that doubt about any of them was a sin not less reprehensible than a moral delict i suppose that out of a thousand of my contemporaries nine hundred at least had their minds systematically warped and poisoned in the name of the god of truth by like discipline i am sure that even a score of years later those who ventured to question the exact historical accuracy of any part of the old testament and a fortiori of the gospels had to expect a pitiless shower of verbal missiles to say nothing of the other disagreeable consequences which visit those who in any way run counter to that chaos of prejudices called public opinion  my recollections of this time have recently been revived by the perusal of a remarkable document9 signed by as many as thirtyeight out of the twenty odd thousand clergymen of the established church it does not appear that the signataries are officially accredited spokesmen of the ecclesiastical corporation to which they belong but i feel bound to take their word for it that they are stewards of the lord who have received the holy ghost and therefore to accept this memorial as evidence that though the evangelicism of my early days may be deposed from its place of power though so many of the colleagues of the thirtyeight even repudiate the title of protestants yet the green bay tree of bibliolatry flourishes as it did sixty years ago and as in those good old times whoso refuses to offer incense to the idol is held to be guilty of a dishonour to god imperilling his salvation  it is to the credit of the perspicacity of the memorialists that they discern the real nature of the controverted question of the age they are awake to the unquestionable fact that if scripture has been discovered not to be worthy of unquestioning belief faith in the supernatural itself is so far undermined and i may congratulate myself upon such weighty confirmation of an opinion in which i have had the fortune to anticipate them but whether it is more to the credit of the courage than to the intelligence of the thirtyeight that they should go on to proclaim that the canonical scriptures of the old and new testaments declare incontrovertibly the actual historical truth in all records both of past events and of the delivery of predictions to be thereafter fulfilled must be left to the coming generation to decide  the interest which attaches to this singular document will i think be based by most thinking men not upon what it is but upon that of which it is a sign it is an open secret that the memorial is put forth as a counterblast to a manifestation of opinion of a contrary character on the part of certain members of the same ecclesiastical body who therefore have as i suppose an equal right to declare themselves stewards of the lord and recipients of the holy ghost in fact the stream of tendency towards naturalism the course of which i have briefly traced has of late years flowed so strongly that even the churches have begun i dare not say to drift but at any rate to swing at their moorings within the pale of the anglican establishment i venture to doubt whether at this moment there are as many thoroughgoing defenders of plenary inspiration as there were timid questioners of that doctrine half a century ago commentaries sanctioned by the highest authority give up the actual historical truth of the cosmogonical and diluvial narratives university professors of deservedly high repute accept the critical decision that the hexateuch is a compilation in which the share of moses either as author or as editor is not quite so clearly demonstrable as it might be highly placed divines tell us that the preabrahamic scripture narratives may be ignored that the book of daniel may be regarded as a patriotic romance of the second century bc that the words of the writer of the fourth gospel are not always to be distinguished from those which he puts into the mouth of jesus conservative but conscientious revisers decide that whole passages some of dogmatic and some of ethical importance are interpolations an uneasy sense of the weakness of the dogma of biblical infallibility seems to be at the bottom of a prevailing tendency once more to substitute the authority of the church for that of the bible in my old age it has happened to me to be taken to task for regarding christianity as a religion of a book as gravely as in my youth i should have been reprehended for doubting that proposition it is a no less interesting symptom that the state church seems more and more anxious to repudiate all complicity with the principles of the protestant reformation and to call itself anglocatholic inspiration deprived of its old intelligible sense is watered down into a mystification the scriptures are indeed inspired but they contain a wholly undefined and indefinable human element and this unfortunate intruder is converted into a sort of biblical whipping boy whatsoever scientific investigation historical or physical proves to be erroneous the human element bears the blame while the divine inspiration of such statements as by their nature are out of reach of proof or disproof is still asserted with all the vigour inspired by conscious safety from attack though the proposal to treat the bible like any other book which caused so much scandal forty years ago may not yet be generally accepted and though bishop colensos criticisms may still lie formally under ecclesiastical ban yet the church has not wholly turned a deaf ear to the voice of the scientific tempter and many a coy divine while crying i will neer consent has consented to the proposals of that scientific criticism which the memorialists renounce and denounce  a humble layman to whom it would seem the height of presumption to assume even the unconsidered dignity of a steward of science may well find this conflict of apparently equal ecclesiastical authorities perplexingsuggestive indeed of the wisdom of postponing attention to either until the question of precedence between them is settled and this course will probably appear the more advisable the more closely the fundamental position of the memorialists is examined  no opinion of the fact or form of divine revelation founded on literary criticism and i suppose i may add historical or physical criticism of the scriptures themselves can be admitted to interfere with the traditionary testimony of the church when that has been once ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity10  grant that it is the traditionary testimony of the church which guarantees the canonicity of each and all of the books of the old and new testaments grant also that canonicity means infallibility yet according to the thirtyeight this traditionary testimony has to be ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity but ascertainment and verification are purely intellectual processes which must be conducted according to the strict rules of scientific investigation or be selfconvicted of worthlessness moreover before we can set about the appeal to antiquity the exact sense of that usefully vague term must be defined by similar means antiquity may include any number of centuries great or small and whether antiquity is to comprise the council of trent or to stop a little beyond that of nicæa or to come to an end in the time of irenænus or in that of justin martyr are knotty questions which can be decided if at all only by those critical methods which the signataries treat so cavalierly and yet the decision of these questions is fundamental for as the limits of the canonical scriptures vary so may the dogmas deduced from them require modification christianity is one thing if the fourth gospel the epistle to the hebrews the pastoral epistles and the apocalypse are canonical and by the hypothesis infallibly true and another thing if they are not as i have already said whoso defines the canon defines the creed  now it is quite certain with respect to some of these books such as the apocalypse and the epistle to the hebrews that the eastern and the western church differed in opinion for centuries and yet neither the one branch nor the other can have considered its judgment infallible since they eventually agreed to a transaction by which each gave up its objection to the book patronised by the other moreover the fathers argue in a more or less rational manner about the canonicity of this or that book and are by no means above producing evidence internal and external in favour of the opinions they advocate in fact imperfect as their conceptions of scientific method may be they not unfrequently used it to the best of their ability thus it would appear that though science like nature may be driven out with a fork ecclesiastical or other yet she surely comes back again the appeal to antiquity is in fact an appeal to science first to define what antiquity is secondly to determine what antiquity so defined says about canonicity thirdly to prove that canonicity means infallibility and when science largely in the shape of the abhorred criticism has answered this appeal and has shown that antiquity used her own methods however clumsily and imperfectly she naturally turns round upon the appellants and demands that they should show cause why in these days science should not resume the work the ancients did so imperfectly and carry it out efficiently  but no such cause can be shown if antiquity permitted eusebius origen tertullian irenæus to argue for the reception of this book into the canon and the rejection of that upon rational grounds antiquity admitted the whole principle of modern criticism if irenæus produces ridiculous reasons for limiting the gospels to four it was open to any one else to produce good reasons if he had them for cutting them down to three or increasing them to five if the eastern branch of the church had a right to reject the apocalypse and accept the epistle to the hebrews and the western an equal right to accept the apocalypse and reject the epistle down to the fourth century any other branch would have an equal right on cause shown to reject both or as the catholic church afterwards actually did to accept both  thus i cannot but think that the thirtyeight are hoist with their own petard their appeal to antiquity turns out to be nothing but a roundabout way of appealing to the tribunal the jurisdiction of which they affect to deny having rested the world of christian supernaturalism on the elephant of biblical infallibility and furnished the elephant with standing ground on the tortoise of antiquity they like their famous hindoo analogue have been content to look no further and have thereby been spared the horror of discovering that the tortoise rests on a grievously fragile construction to a great extent the work of that very intellectual operation which they anathematise and repudiate  moreover there is another point to be considered it is of course true that a christian church whether the christian church or not depends on the connotation of the definite article existed before the christian scriptures and that the infallibility of these depends upon the infallibility of the judgment of the persons who selected the books of which they are composed out of the mass of literature current among the early christians the logical acumen of augustine showed him that the authority of the gospel he preached must rest on that of the church to which he belonged11 but it is no less true that the hebrew and the septuagint versions of most if not all of the old testament books existed before the birth of jesus of nazareth and that their divine authority is presupposed by and therefore can hardly depend upon the religious body constituted by his disciples as everybody knows the very conception of a christ is purely jewish the validity of the argument from the messianic prophecies vanishes unless their infallible authority is granted and as a matter of fact whether we turn to the gospels the epistles or the writings of the early apologists the jewish scriptures are recognised as the highest court of appeal of the christian  the proposal to cite christian antiquity as a witness to the infallibility of the old testament when its own claims to authority vanish if certain propositions contained in the old testament are erroneous hardly satisfies the requirements of lay logic it is as if a claimant to be sole legatee under another kind of testament should offer his assertion as sufficient evidence of the validity of the will and even were not such a circular or rather rotatory argument that the infallibility of the bible is testified by the infallible church whose infallibility is testified by the infallible bible too absurd for serious consideration it remains permissible to ask where and when the church during the period of its infallibility as limited by anglican dogmatic necessities has officially decreed the actual historical truth of all records in the old testament was augustine heretical when he denied the actual historical truth of the record of the creation father suarez standing on later roman tradition may have a right to declare that he was but it does not lie in the mouth of those who limit their appeal to that early antiquity in which augustine played so great a part to say so                                       among the watchers of the course of the world of thought some view with delight and some with horror the recrudescence of supernaturalism which manifests itself among us in shapes ranged along the whole flight of steps which in this case separates the sublime from the ridiculousfrom neocatholicism and innerlight mysticism at the top to unclean things not worthy of mention in the same breath at the bottom in my poor opinion the importance of these manifestations is often greatly overestimated the extant forms of supernaturalism have deep roots in human nature and will undoubtedly die hard but in these latter days they have to cope with an enemy whose full strength is only just beginning to be put out and whose forces gathering strength year by year are hemming them round on every side this enemy is science in the acceptation of systematized natural knowledge which during the last two centuries has extended those methods of investigation the worth of which is confirmed by daily appeal to nature to every region in which the supernatural has hitherto been recognised  when scientific historical criticism reduced the annals of heroic greece and of regal rome to the level of fables when the unity of authorship of the iliad was successfully assailed by scientific literary criticism when scientific physical criticism after exploding the geocentric theory of the universe and reducing the solar system itself to one of millions of groups of like cosmic specks circling at unimaginable distances from one another through infinite space showed the supernaturalistic theories of the duration of the earth and of life upon it to be as inadequate as those of its relative dimensions and importance had been it needed no prophetic gift to see that sooner or later the jewish and the early christian records would be treated in the same manner that the authorship of the hexateuch and of the gospels would be as severely tested and that the evidence in favour of the veracity of many of the statements found in the scriptures would have to be strong indeed if they were to be opposed to the conclusions of physical science in point of fact so far as i can discover no one competent to judge of the evidential strength of these conclusions ventures now to say that the biblical accounts of the creation and of the deluge are true in the natural sense of the words of the narratives the most modern reconcilers venture upon is to affirm that some quite different sense may he put upon the words and that this nonnatural sense may with a little trouble be manipulated into some sort of noncontradiction of scientific truth  my purpose in the essay xvi which treats of the narrative of the deluge was to prove by physical criticism that no such event as that described ever took place to exhibit the untrustworthy character of the narrative demonstrated by literary criticism and finally to account for its origin by producing a form of those ancient legends of pagan chaldæa from which the biblical compilation is manifestly derived i have yet to learn that the main propositions of this essay can be seriously challenged  in the essays ii iii on the narrative of the creation i have endeavoured to controvert the assertion that modern science supports either the interpretation put upon it by mr gladstone or any interpretation which is compatible with the general sense of the narrative quite apart from particular details the first chapter of genesis teaches the supernatural creation of the present forms of life modern science teaches that they have come about by evolution the first chapter of genesis teaches the successive originfirstly of all the plants secondly of all the aquatic and aerial animals thirdly of all the terrestrial animals which now existduring distinct intervals of time modern science teaches that throughout all the duration of an immensely long past so far as we have any adequate knowledge of it that is as far back as the silurian epoch plants aquatic aerial and terrestrial animals have coexisted that the earliest known are unlike those which at present exist and that the modern species have come into existence as the last terms of a series the members of which have appeared one after another thus far from confirming the account in genesis the results of modern science so far as they go are in principle as in detail hopelessly discordant with it  yet if the pretensions to infallibility set up not by the ancient hebrew writings themselves but by the ecclesiastical champions and friends from whom they may well pray to be delivered thus shatter themselves against the rock of natural knowledge in respect of the two most important of all events the origin of things and the palingenesis of terrestrial life what historical credit dare any serious thinker attach to the narratives of the fabrication of eve of the fall of the commerce between the bene elohim and the daughters of men which lie between the creational and the diluvial legends and if these are to lose all historical worth what becomes of the infallibility of those who according to the later scriptures have accepted them argued from them and staked farreaching dogmatic conclusions upon their historical accuracy  it is the merest ostrich policy for contemporary ecclesiasticism to try to hide its hexateuchal headin the hope that the inseparable connection of its body with preabrahamic legends may be overlooked the question will still be asked if the first nine chapters of the pentateuch are unhistorical how is the historical accuracy of the remainder to be guaranteed what more intrinsic claim has the story of the exodus than that of the deluge to belief if god did not walk in the garden of eden how can we be assured that he spoke from sinai                                       in some other of the following essays ix x xi xii xiv xv i have endeavoured to show that sober and wellfounded physical and literary criticism plays no less havoc with the doctrine that the canonical scriptures of the new testament declare incontrovertibly the actual historical truth in all records we are told that the gospels contain a true revelation of the spiritual worlda proposition which in one sense of the word spiritual i should not think it necessary to dispute but when it is taken to signify that everything we are told about the world of spirits in these books is infallibly true that we are bound to accept the demonology which constitutes an inseparable part of their teaching and to profess belief in a supernaturalism as gross as that of any primitive peopleit is at any rate permissible to ask why science may be unable to define the limits of possibility but it cannot escape from the moral obligation to weigh the evidence in favour of any alleged wonderful occurrence and i have endeavoured to show that the evidence for the gadarene miracle is altogether worthless we have simply three partially discrepant versions of a story about the primitive form the origin and the authority for which we know absolutely nothing but the evidence in favour of the gadarene miracle is as good as that for any other  elsewhere i have pointed out that it is utterly beside the mark to declaim against these conclusions on the ground of their asserted tendency to deprive mankind of the consolations of the christian faith and to destroy the foundations of morality still less to brand them with the questionbegging vituperative appellation of infidelity the point is not whether they are wicked but whether from the point of view of scientific method they are irrefragably true if they are they will be accepted in time whether they are wicked or not wicked nature so far as we have been able to attain to any insight into her ways recks little about consolation and makes for righteousness by very roundabout paths and at any rate whatever may be possible for other people it is becoming less and less possible for the man who puts his faith in scientific methods of ascertaining truth and is accustomed to have that faith justified by daily experience to be consciously false to his principle in any matter but the number of such men driven into the use of scientific methods of inquiry and taught to trust them by their education their daily professional and business needs is increasing and will continually increase the phraseology of supernaturalism may remain on mens lips but in practice they are naturalists the magistrate who listens with devout attention to the precept thou shalt not suffer a witch to live on sunday on monday dismisses as intrinsically absurd a charge of bewitching a cow brought against some old woman the superintendent of a lunatic asylum who substituted exorcism for rational modes of treatment would have but a short tenure of office even parish clerks doubt the utility of prayers for rain so long as the wind is in the east and an outbreak of pestilence sends men not to the churches but to the drains in spite of prayers for the success of our arms and te deums for victory our real faith is in big battalions and keeping our powder dry in knowledge of the science of warfare in energy courage and discipline in these as in all other practical affairs we act on the aphorism laborare est orare we admit that intelligent work is the only acceptable worship and that whether there be a supernature or not our business is with nature                                       it is important to note that the principle of the scientific naturalism of the latter half of the nineteenth century in which the intellectual movement of the renascence has culminated and which was first clearly formulated by descartes leads not to the denial of the existence of any supernature12 but simply to the denial of the validity of the evidence adduced in favour of this or of that extant form of supernaturalism  looking at the matter from the most rigidly scientific point of view the assumption that amidst the myriads of worlds scattered through endless space there can be no intelligence as much greater than mans as his is greater than a blackbeetles no being endowed with powers of influencing the course of nature as much greater than his as his is greater than a snails seems to me not merely baseless but impertinent without stepping beyond the analogy of that which is known it is easy to people the cosmos with entities in ascending scale until we reach something practically indistinguishable from omnipotence omnipresence and omniscience if our intelligence can in some matters surely reproduce the past of thousands of years ago and anticipate the future thousands of years hence it is clearly within the limits of possibility that some greater intellect even of the same order may be able to mirror the whole past and the whole future if the universe is penetrated by a medium of such a nature that a magnetic needle on the earth answers to a commotion in the sun an omnipresent agent is also conceivable if our insignificant knowledge gives us some influence over events practical omniscience may confer indefinably greater power finally if evidence that a thing may be were equivalent to proof that it is analogy might justify the construction of a naturalistic theology and demonology not less wonderful than the current supernatural just as it might justify the peopling of mars or of jupiter with living forms to which terrestrial biology offers no parallel until human life is longer and the duties of the present press less heavily i do not think that wise men will occupy themselves with jovian or martian natural history and they will probably agree to a verdict of not proven in respect of naturalistic theology taking refuge in that agnostic confession which appears to me to be the only position for people who object to say that they know what they are quite aware they do not know as to the interests of morality i am disposed to think that if mankind could be got to act up to this last principle in every relation of life a reformation would be effected such as the world has not yet seen an approximation to the millennium such as no supernaturalistic religion has ever yet succeeded or seems likely ever to succeed in effecting                                       i have hitherto dwelt upon scientific naturalism chiefly in its critical and destructive aspect but the present incarnation of the spirit of the renascence differs from its predecessor in the eighteenth century in that it builds up as well as pulls down  that of which it has laid the foundation of which it is already raising the superstructure is the doctrine of evolution but so many strange misconceptions are current about this doctrineit is attacked on such false grounds by its enemies and made to cover so much that is disputable by some of its friends that i think it well to define as clearly as i can what i do not and what i do understand by the doctrine  i have nothing to say to any philosophy of evolution attempts to construct such a philosophy may be as useful nay even as admirable as was the attempt of descartes to get at a theory of the universe by the same a priori road but in my judgment they are as premature nor for this purpose have i to do with any theory of the origin of species much as i value that which is known as the darwinian theory that the doctrine of natural selection presupposes evolution is quite true but it is not true that evolution necessarily implies natural selection in fact evolution might conceivably have taken place without the development of groups possessing the characters of species  for me the doctrine of evolution is no speculation but a generalisation of certain facts which may be observed by any one who will take the necessary trouble these facts are those which are classed by biologists under the heads of embryology and of palæontology embryology proves that every higher form of individual life becomes what it is by a process of gradual differentiation from an extremely low form palæontology proves in some cases and renders probable in all that the oldest types of a group are the lowest and that they have been followed by a gradual succession of more and more differentiated forms it is simply a fact that evolution of the individual animal and plant is taking place as a natural process in millions and millions of cases every day it is a fact that the species which have succeeded one another in the past do in many cases present just those morphological relations which they must possess if they had proceeded one from the other by an analogous process of evolution  the alternative presented therefore is either the forms of one and the same typesay eg that of the horse tribe13arose successively but independently of one another at intervals during myriads of years or the later forms are modified descendants of the earlier and the latter supposition is so vastly more probable than the former that rational men will adopt it unless satisfactory evidence to the contrary can be produced the objection sometimes put forward that no one yet professes to have seen one species pass into another comes oddly from those who believe that mankind are all descended from adam has any one then yet seen the production of negroes from a white stock or vice versâ moreover is it absolutely necessary to have watched every step of the progress of a planet to be justified in concluding that it really does go round the sun if so astronomy is in a bad way  i do not for a moment presume to suggest that some one far better acquainted than i am with astronomy and physics or that a master of the new chemistry with its extraordinary revelations or that a student of the development of human society of language and of religions may not find a sufficient foundation for the doctrine of evolution in these several regions on the contrary i rejoice to see that scientific investigation in all directions is tending to the same result and it may well be that it is only my long occupation with biological matters that leads me to feel safer among them than anywhere else be that as it may i take my stand on the facts of embryology and of palæontology and i hold that our present knowledge of these facts is sufficiently thorough and extensive to justify the assertion that all future philosophical and theological speculations will have to accommodate themselves to some such common body of established truths as the following  1 plants and animals have existed on our planet for many hundred thousand probably millions of years during this time their forms or species have undergone a succession of changes which eventually gave rise to the species which constitute the present living population of the earth there is no evidence nor any reason to suspect that this secular process of evolution is other than a part of the ordinary course of nature there is no more ground for imagining the occurrence of supernatural intervention at any moment in the development of species in the past than there is for supposing such intervention to take place at any moment in the development of an individual animal or plant at the present day  2 at present every individual animal or plant commences its existence as an organism of extremely simple anatomical structure and it acquires all the complexity it ultimately possesses by gradual differentiation into parts of various structure and function when a series of specific forms of the same type extending over a long period of past time is examined the relation between the earlier and the later forms is analogous to that between earlier and later stages of individual development therefore it is a probable conclusion that if we could follow living beings back to their earlier states we should find them to present forms similar to those of the individual germ or what comes to the same thing of those lowest known organisms which stand upon the boundary line between plants and animals at present our knowledge of the ancient living world stops very far short of this point  3 it is generally agreed and there is certainly no evidence to the contrary that all plants are devoid of consciousness that they neither feel desire nor think it is conceivable that the evolution of the primordial living substance should have taken place only along the plant line in that case the result might have been a wealth of vegetable life as great perhaps as varied as at present though certainly widely different from the present flora in the evolution of which animals have played so great a part but the living world thus constituted would be simply an admirable piece of unconscious machinery the working out of which lay potentially in its primitive composition pleasure and pain would have no place in it it would be a veritable garden of eden without any tree of the knowledge of good and evil the question of the moral government of such a world could no more be asked than we could reasonably seek for a moral purpose in a kaleidoscope  4 how far down the scale of animal life the phenomena of consciousness are manifested it is impossible to say no one doubts their presence in his fellowmen and unless any strict cartesians are left no one doubts that mammals and birds are to be reckoned creatures that have feelings analogous to our smell taste sight hearing touch pleasure and pain for my own part i should be disposed to extend this analogical judgment a good deal further on the other hand if the lowest forms of plants are to be denied consciousness i do not see on what ground it is to be ascribed to the lowest animals i find it hard to believe that an infusory animalcule a foraminifer or a freshwater polype is capable of feeling and in spite of shakspere i have doubts about the great sensitiveness of the poor beetle that we tread upon the question is equally perplexing when we turn to the stages of development of the individual granted a fowl feels that the chick just hatched feels that the chick when it chirps within the egg may possibly feel what is to be said of it on the fifth day when the bird is there but with all its tissues nascent still more on the first day when it is nothing but a flat cellular disk i certainly cannot bring myself to believe that this disk feels yet if it does not there must be some time in the three weeks between the first day and the day of hatching when as a concomitant or a consequence of the attainment by the brain of the chick of a certain stage of structural evolution consciousness makes its appearance i have frequently expressed my incapacity to understand the nature of the relation between consciousness and a certain anatomical tissue which is thus established by observation but the fact remains that so far as observation and experiment go they teach us that the psychical phenomena are dependent on the physical  in like manner if fishes insects scorpions and such animals as the pearly nautilus possess feeling then undoubtedly consciousness was present in the world as far back as the silurian epoch but if the earliest animals were similar to our rhizopods and monads there must have been some time between the much earlier epoch in which they constituted the whole animal population and the silurian in which feeling dawned in consequence of the organism having reached the stage of evolution on which it depends  5 consciousness has various forms which may be manifested independently of one another the feelings of light and colour of sound of touch though so often associated with those of pleasure and pain are by nature as entirely independent of them as is thinking an animal devoid of the feelings of pleasure and of pain may nevertheless exhibit all the effects of sensation and purposive action therefore it would be a justifiable hypothesis that long after organic evolution had attained to consciousness pleasure and pain were still absent such a world would be without either happiness or misery no act could be punished and none could be rewarded and it could have no moral purpose  6 suppose for arguments sake that all mammals and birds are subjects of pleasure and pain then we may be certain that these forms of consciousness were in existence at the beginning of the mesozoic epoch from that time forth pleasure has been distributed without reference to merit and pain inflicted without reference to demerit throughout all but a mere fraction of the higher animals moreover the amount and the severity of the pain no less than the variety and acuteness of the pleasure have increased with every advance in the scale of evolution as suffering came into the world not in consequence of a fall but of a rise in the scale of being so every further rise has brought more suffering as the evidence stands it would appear that the sort of brain which characterizes the highest mammals and which so far as we know is the indispensable condition of the highest sensibility did not come into existence before the tertiary epoch the primordial anthropoid was probably in this respect on much the same footing as his pithecoid kin like them he stood upon his natural rights gratified all his desires to the best of his ability and was as incapable of either right or wrong doing as they it would be as absurd as in their case to regard his pleasures any more than theirs as moral rewards and his pains any more than theirs as moral punishments  7 from the remotest ages of which we have any cognizance death has been the natural and apparently the necessary concomitant of life in our hypothetical world 3 inhabited by nothing but plants death must have very early resulted from the struggle for existence many of the crowd must have jostled one another out of the conditions on which life depends the occurrence of death as far back as we have any fossil record of life however needs not to be proved by such arguments for if there had been no death there would have been no fossil remains such as the great majority of those we met with not only was there death in the world as far as the record of life takes us but ever since mammals and birds have been preyed upon by carnivorous animals there has been painful death inflicted by mechanisms specially adapted for inflicting it  8 those who are acquainted with the closeness of the structural relations between the human organisation and that of the mammals which come nearest to him on the one hand and with the palæontological history of such animals as horses and dogs on the other will not be disposed to question the origin of man from forms which stand in the same sort of relation to homo sapiens as hipparion does to equus i think it a conclusion fully justified by analogy that sooner or later we shall discover the remains of our less specialised primatic ancestors in the strata which have yielded the less specialised equine and canine quadrupeds at present fossil remains of men do not take us hack further than the later part of the quaternary epoch and as was to be expected they do not differ more from existing men than quaternary horses differ from existing horses still earlier we find traces of man in implements such as are used by the ruder savages at the present day later the remains of the palæolithic and neolithic conditions take us gradually from the savage state to the civilizations of egypt and of mycenæ though the true chronological order of the remains actually discovered may be uncertain  9 much has yet to be learned but at present natural knowledge affords no support to the notion that men have fallen from a higher to a lower state on the contrary everything points to a slow natural evolution which favoured by the surrounding conditions in such localities as the valleys of the yangtsekang the euphrates and the nile reached a relatively high pitch five or six thousand years ago while in many other regions the savage condition has persisted down to our day in all this vast lapse of time there is not a trace of the occurrence of any general destruction of the human race not the smallest indication that man has been treated on any other principles than the rest of the animal world  10 the results of the process of evolution in the case of man and in that of his more nearly allied contemporaries have been marvellously different yet it is easy to see that small primitive differences of a certain order must in the long run bring about a wide divergence of the human stock from the others it is a reasonable supposition that in the earliest human organisms an improved brain a voice more capable of modulation and articulation limbs which lent themselves better to gesture a more perfect hand capable among other things of imitating form in plastic or other material were combined with the curiosity the mimetic tendency the strong family affection of the next lower group and that they were accompanied by exceptional length of life and a prolonged minority the last two peculiarities are obviously calculated to strengthen the family organisation and to give great weight to its educative influences the potentiality of language as the vocal symbol of thought lay in the faculty of modulating and articulating the voice the potentiality of writing as the visual symbol of thought lay in the hand that could draw and in the mimetic tendency which as we know was gratified by drawing as far back as the days of quaternary man with speech as the record in tradition of the experience of more than one generation with writing as the record of that of any number of generations the experience of the race tested and corrected generation after generation could be stored up and made the starting point for fresh progress having these perfectly natural factors of the evolutionary process in man before us it seems unnecessary to go further afield in search of others  11 that the doctrine of evolution implies a former state of innocence of mankind is quite true but as i have remarked it is the innocence of the ape and of the tiger whose acts however they may run counter to the principles of morality it would be absurd to blame the lust of the one and the ferocity of the other are as much provided for in their organisation are as clear evidences of design as any other features that can be named  observation and experiment upon the phenomena of society soon taught men that in order to obtain the advantages of social existence certain rules must be observed morality commenced with society society is possible only upon the condition that the members of it shall surrender more or less of their individual freedom of action in primitive societies individual selfishness is a centrifugal force of such intensity that it is constantly bringing the social organisation to the verge of destruction hence the prominence of the positive rules of obedience to the elders of standing by the family or the tribe in all emergencies of fulfilling the religious rites nonobservance of which is conceived to damage it with the supernatural powers belief in whose existence is one of the earliest products of human thought and of the negative rules which restrain each from meddling with the life or property of another  12 the highest conceivable form of human society is that in which the desire to do what is best for the whole dominates and limits the action of every member of that society the more complex the social organisation the greater the number of acts from which each man must abstain if he desires to do that which is best for all thus the progressive evolution of society means increasing restriction of individual freedom in certain directions  with the advance of civilisation and the growth of cities and of nations by the coalescence of families and of tribes the rules which constitute the common foundation of morality and of law became more numerous and complicated and the temptations to break or evade many of them stronger in the absence of a clear apprehension of the natural sanctions of these rules a supernatural sanction was assumed and imagination supplied the motives which reason was supposed to be incompetent to furnish religion at first independent of morality gradually took morality under its protection and the supernaturalists have ever since tried to persuade mankind that the existence of ethics is bound up with that of supernaturalism  i am not of that opinion but whether it is correct or otherwise it is very clear to me that as beelzebub is not to be cast out by the aid of beelzebub so morality is not to be established by immorality it is we are told the special peculiarity of the devil that he was a liar from the beginning if we set out in life with pretending to know that which we do not know with professing to accept for proof evidence which we are well aware is inadequate with wilfully shutting our eyes and our ears to facts which militate against this or that comfortable hypothesis we are assuredly doing our best to deserve the same character                                       i have not the presumption to imagine that in spite of all my efforts errors may not have crept into these propositions but i am tolerably confident that time will prove them to be substantially correct and if they are so i confess i do not see how any extant supernaturalistic system can also claim exactness that they are irreconcilable with the biblical cosmogony anthropology and theodicy is obvious but they are no less inconsistent with the sentimental deism of the vicaire savoyard and his numerous modern progeny it is as impossible to my mind to suppose that the evolutionary process was set going with full foreknowledge of the result and yet with what we should understand by a purely benevolent intention as it is to imagine that the intention was purely malevolent and the prevalence of dualistic theories from the earliest times to the present daywhether in the shape of the doctrine of the inherently evil nature of matter of an ahriman of a hard and cruel demiurge of a diabolical prince of this world show how widely this difficulty has been felt  many seem to think that when it is admitted that the ancient literature contained in our bibles has no more claim to infallibility than any other ancient literature when it is proved that the israelites and their christian successors accepted a great many supernaturalistic theories and legends which have no better foundation than those of heathenism nothing remains to be done but to throw the bible aside as so much waste paper  i have always opposed this opinion it appears to me that if there is anybody more objectionable than the orthodox bibliolater it is the heterodox philistine who can discover in a literature which in some respects has no superior nothing but a subject for scoffing and an occasion for the display of his conceited ignorance of the debt he owes to former generations  twentytwo years ago i pleaded for the use of the bible as an instrument of popular education and i venture to repeat what i then said  consider the great historical fact that for three centuries this book has been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in english history that it has become the national epic of britain and is as familiar to gentle and simple from john o groats house to lands end as dante and tasso once were to the italians that it is written in the noblest and purest english and abounds in exquisite beauties of mere literary form and finally that it forbids the veriest hind who never left his village to be ignorant of the existence of other countries and other civilisations and of a great past stretching back to the furthest limits of the oldest nations in the world by the study of what other book could children be so much humanised and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills like themselves but a momentary space in the interval between the eternities and earns the blessings or the curses of all time according to its effort to do good and hate evil even as they also are earning their payment for their work14  at the same time i laid stress upon the necessity of placing such instruction in lay hands in the hope and belief that it would thus gradually accommodate itself to the coming changes of opinion that the theology and the legend would drop more and more out of sight while the perennially interesting historical literary and ethical contents would come more and more into view  i may add yet another claim of the bible to the respect and the attention of a democratic age throughout the history of the western world the scriptures jewish and christian have been the great instigators of revolt against the worst forms of clerical and political despotism the bible has been the magna charta of the poor and of the oppressed down to modern times no state has had a constitution in which the interests of the people are so largely taken into account in which the duties so much more than the privileges of rulers are insisted upon as that drawn up for israel in deuteronomy and in leviticus nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of the state in the long run depends on the uprightness of the citizen so strongly laid down assuredly the bible talks no trash about the rights of man but it insists on the equality of duties on the liberty to bring about that righteousness which is somewhat different from struggling for rights on the fraternity of taking thought for ones neighbour as for ones self  so far as such equality liberty and fraternity are included under the democratic principles which assume the same names the bible is the most democratic book in the world as such it began through the heretical sects to undermine the clericopolitical despotism of the middle ages almost as soon as it was formed in the eleventh century pope and king had as much as they could do to put down the albigenses and the waldenses in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the lollards and the hussites gave them still more trouble in the fourteenth and fifteenth from the sixteenth century onward the protestant sects have favoured political freedom in proportion to the degree in which they have refused to acknowledge any ultimate authority save that of the bible  but the enormous influence which has thus been exerted by the jewish and christian scriptures has had no necessary connection with cosmogonies demonologies and miraculous interferences their strength lies in their appeals not to the reason but to the ethical sense i do not say that even the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement but i do believe that the human race is not yet possibly may never be in a position to dispense with it  footnotes       8

and pseudoscientific realism  1887   next to undue precipitation in anticipating the results of pending investigations the intellectual sin which is commonest and most hurtful to those who devote themselves to the increase of knowledge is the omission to profit by the experience of their predecessors recorded in the history of science and philosophy it is true that at the present day there is more excuse than at any former time for such neglect no small labour is needed to raise ones self to the level of the acquisitions already made and able men who have achieved thus much know that if they devote themselves body and soul to the increase of their store and avoid looking back with as much care as if the injunction laid on lot and his family were binding upon them such devotion is sure to be richly repaid by the joys of the discoverer and the solace of fame if not by rewards of a less elevated character  so following the advice of francis bacon we refuse inter mortuos quærere vivum we leave the past to bury its dead and ignore our intellectual ancestry nor are we content with that we follow the evil example set us not only by bacon but by almost all the men of the renaissance in pouring scorn upon the work of our immediate spiritual forefathers the schoolmen of the middle ages it is accepted as a truth which is indisputable that for seven or eight centuries a long succession of able mensome of them of transcendent acuteness and encyclopædic knowledgedevoted laborious lives to the grave discussion of mere frivolities and the arduous pursuit of intellectual willothewisps to say nothing of a little modesty a little impartial pondering over personal experience might suggest a doubt as to the adequacy of this short and easy method of dealing with a large chapter of the history of the human mind even an acquaintance with popular literature which had extended so far as to include that part of the contributions of sam slick which contains his weighty aphorism that there is a great deal of human nature in all mankind might raise a doubt whether after all the men of that epoch who take them all round were endowed with wisdom and folly in much the same proportion as ourselves were likely to display nothing better than the qualities of energetic idiots when they devoted their faculties to the elucidation of problems which were to them and indeed are to us the most serious which life has to offer speaking for myself the longer i live the more i am disposed to think that there is much less either of pure folly or of pure wickedness in the world than is commonly supposed it may be doubted if any sane man ever said to himself evil be thou my good and i have never yet had the good fortune to meet with a perfect fool when i have brought to the inquiry the patience and longsuffering which become a scientific investigator the most promising specimens have turned out to have a good deal to say for themselves from their own point of view and sometimes calm reflection has taught the humiliating lesson that their point of view was not so different from my own as i had fondly imagined comprehension is more than halfway to sympathy here as elsewhere  if we turn our attention to scholastic philosophy in the frame of mind suggested by these prefatory remarks it assumes a very different character from that which it bears in general estimation no doubt it is surrounded by a dense thicket of thorny logomachies and obscured by the dustclouds of a barbarous and perplexing terminology but suppose that undeterred by much grime and by many scratches the explorer has toiled through this jungle he comes to an open country which is amazingly like his dear native land the hills which he has to climb the ravines he has to avoid look very much the same there is the same infinite space above and the same abyss of the unknown below the means of travelling are the same and the goal is the same  that goal for the schoolmen as for us is the settlement of the question how far the universe is the manifestation of a rational order in other words how far logical deduction from indisputable premisses will account for what which has happened and does happen that was the object of scholasticism and so far as i am aware the object of modern science may be expressed in the same terms in pursuit of this end modern science takes into account all the phenomena of the universe which are brought to our knowledge by observation or by experiment it admits that there are two worlds to be considered the one physical and the other psychical and that though there is a most intimate relation and interconnection between the two the bridge from one to the other has yet to be found that their phenomena run not in one series but along two parallel lines  to the schoolmen the duality of the universe appeared under a different aspect how this came about will not be intelligible unless we clearly apprehend the fact that they did really believe in dogmatic christianity as it was formulated by the roman church they did not give a mere dull assent to anything the church told them on sundays and ignore her teachings for the rest of the week but they lived and moved and had their being in that supersensible theological world which was created or rather grew up during the first four centuries of our reckoning and which occupied their thoughts far more than the sensible world in which their earthly lot was cast  for the most part we learn history from the colourless compendiums or partisan briefs of mere scholars who have too little acquaintance with practical life and too little insight into speculative problems to understand that about which they write in historical science as in all sciences which have to do with concrete phenomena laboratory practice is indispensable and the laboratory practice of historical science is afforded on the one hand by active social and political life and on the other by the study of those tendencies and operations of the mind which embody themselves in philosophical and theological systems thucydides and tacitus and to come nearer our own time hume and grote were men of affairs and had acquired by direct contact with social and political history in the making the secret of understanding how such history is made our notions of the intellectual history of the middle ages are unfortunately too often derived from writers who have never seriously grappled with philosophical and theological problems and hence that strange myth of a millennium of moonshine to which i have adverted  however no very profound study of the works of contemporary writers who without devoting themselves specially to theology or philosophy were learned and enlightenedsuch men for example as eginhard or danteis necessary to convince ones self that for them the world of the theologian was an everpresent and awful reality from the centre of that world the divine trinity surrounded by a hierarchy of angels and saints contemplated and governed the insignificant sensible world in which the inferior spirits of men burdened with the debasement of their material embodiment and continually solicited to their perdition by a no less numerous and almost as powerful hierarchy of devils were constantly struggling on the edge of the pit of everlasting damnation15  the men of the middle ages believed that through the scriptures the traditions of the fathers and the authority of the church they were in possession of far more and more trustworthy information with respect to the nature and order of things in the theological world than they had in regard to the nature and order of things in the sensible world and if the two sources of information came into conflict so much the worse for the sensible world which after all was more or less under the dominion of satan let us suppose that a telescope powerful enough to show us what is going on in the nebula of the sword of orion should reveal a world in which stones fell upwards parallel lines met and the fourth dimension of space was quite obvious men of science would have only two alternatives before them either the terrestrial and the nebular facts must be brought into harmony by such feats of subtle sophistry as the human mind is always capable of performing when driven into a corner or science must throw down its arms in despair and commit suicide either by the admission that the universe is after all irrational inasmuch as that which is truth in one corner of it is absurdity in another or by a declaration of incompetency  in the middle ages the labours of those great men who endeavoured to reconcile the system of thought which started from the data of pure reason with that which started from the data of roman theology produced the system of thought which is known as scholastic philosophy the alternative of surrender and suicide is exemplified by avicenna and his followers when they declared that that which is true in theology may be false in philosophy and vice versâ and by sanchez in his famous defence of the thesis quod nil scitur  to those who deny the validity of one of the primary assumptions of the disputantswho decline on the ground of the utter insufficiency of the evidence to put faith in the reality of that other world the geography and the inhabitants of which are so confidently described in the socalled16 christianity of catholicismthe long and bitter contest which engaged the best intellects for so many centuries may seem a terrible illustration of the wasteful way in which the struggle for existence is carried on in the world of thought no less than in that of matter but there is a more cheerful mode of looking at the history of scholasticism it ground and sharpened the dialectic implements of our race as perhaps nothing but discussions in the result of which men thought their eternal no less than their temporal interests were at stake could have done when a logical blunder may ensure combustion not only in the next world but in this the construction of syllogisms acquires a peculiar interest moreover the schools kept the thinking faculty alive and active when the disturbed state of civil life the mephitic atmosphere engendered by the dominant ecclesiasticism and the almost total neglect of natural knowledge might well have stifled it and finally it should be remembered that scholasticism really did thresh out pretty effectually certain problems which have presented themselves to mankind ever since they began to think and which i suppose will present themselves so long as they continue to think consider for example the controversy of the realists and the nominalists which was carried on with varying fortunes and under various names from the time of scotus erigena to the end of the scholastic period has it now a merely antiquarian interest has nominalism in any of its modifications so completely won the day that realism may be regarded as dead and buried without hope of resurrection many people seem to think so but it appears to me that without taking catholic philosophy into consideration one has not to look about far to find evidence that realism is still to the fore and indeed extremely lively17                                       the other day i happened to meet with a report of a sermon recently preached in st pauls cathedral from internal evidence i am inclined to think that the report is substantially correct but as i have not the slightest intention of finding fault with the eminent theologian and eloquent preacher to whom the discourse is attributed for employment of scientific language in a manner for which he could find only too many scientific precedents the accuracy of the report in detail is not to the purpose i may safely take it as the embodiment of views which are thought to be quite in accordance with science by many excellent instructed and intelligent people       the preacher further contended that it was yet more      difficult to realise that our earthly home would become the      scene of a vast physical catastrophe imagination recoils      from the idea that the course of naturethe phrase helps to      disguise the truthso unvarying and regular the ordered      sequence of movement and life should suddenly cease      imagination looks more reasonable when it assumes the air of      scientific reason physical law it says will prevent the      occurrence of catastrophes only anticipated by an apostle in      an unscientific age might not there however be a      suspension of a lower law by the intervention of a higher      thus every time we lifted our arms we defied the laws of      gravitation and in railways and steamboats powerful laws      were held in check by others the flood and the destruction      of sodom and gomorrah were brought about by the operation of      existing laws and may it not be that in his illimitable      universe there are more important laws than those which      surround our puny lifemoral and not merely physical      forces is it inconceivable that the day will come when      these royal and ultimate laws shall wreck the natural order      of things which seems so stable and so fair earthquakes      were not things of remote antiquity as an island off italy      the eastern archipelago greece and chicago bore      witness in presence of a great earthquake men feel how      powerless they are and their very knowledge adds to their      weakness the end of human probation the final dissolution      of organised society and the destruction of mans home on      the surface of the globe were none of them violently      contrary to our present experience but only the extension      of present facts the presentiment of death was common      there were felt to be many things which threatened the      existence of society and as our globe was a ball of fire      at any moment the pentup forces which surge and boil      beneath our feet might be poured out pall mall gazette      december 6 1886  the preacher appears to entertain the notion that the occurrence of a catastrophe18 involves a breach of the present order of naturethat it is an event incompatible with the physical laws which at present obtain he seems to be of opinion that scientific reason lends its authority to the imaginative supposition that physical law will prevent the occurrence of the catastrophes anticipated by an unscientific apostle  scientific reason like homer sometimes nods but i am not aware that it has ever dreamed dreams of this sort the fundamental axiom of scientific thought is that there is not never has been and never will be any disorder in nature the admission of the occurrence of any event which was not the logical consequence of the immediately antecedent events according to these definite ascertained or unascertained rules which we call the laws of nature would be an act of selfdestruction on the part of science  catastrophe is a relative conception for ourselves it means an event which brings about very terrible consequences to man or impresses his mind by its magnitude relatively to him but events which are quite in the natural order of things to us may be frightful catastrophes to other sentient beings surely no interruption of the order of nature is involved if in the course of descending through an alpine pinewood i jump upon an anthill and in a moment wreck a whole city and destroy a hundred thousand of its inhabitants to the ants the catastrophe is worse than the earthquake of lisbon to me it is the natural and necessary consequence of the laws of matter in motion a redistribution of energy has taken place which is perfectly in accordance with natural order however unpleasant its effects may be to the ants  imagination inspired by scientific reason and not merely assuming the airs thereof as it unfortunately too often does in the pulpit so far from having any right to repudiate catastrophes and deny the possibility of the cessation of motion and life easily finds justification for the exactly contrary course kant in his famous theory of the heavens declares the end of the world and its reduction to a formless condition to be a necessary consequence of the causes to which it owes its origin and continuance and as to catastrophes of prodigious magnitude and frequent occurrence they were the favourite asylum ignorantiæ of geologists not a quarter of a century ago if modern geology is becoming more and more disinclined to call in catastrophes to its aid it is not because of any a priori difficulty in reconciling the occurrence of such events with the universality of order but because the a posteriori evidence of the occurrence of events of this character in past times has more or less completely broken down  it is to say the least highly probable that this earth is a mass of extremely hot matter invested by a cooled crust through which the hot interior still continues to cool though with extreme slowness it is no less probable that the faults and dislocations the foldings and fractures everywhere visible in the stratified crust its large and slow movements through miles of elevation and depression and its small and rapid movements which give rise to the innumerable perceived and unperceived earthquakes which are constantly occurring are due to the shrinkage of the crust on its cooling and contracting nucleus  without going beyond the range of fair scientific analogy conditions are easily conceivable which should render the loss of heat far more rapid than it is at present and such an occurrence would be just as much in accordance with ascertained laws of nature as the more rapid cooling of a redhot bar when it is thrust into cold water than when it remains in the air but much more rapid cooling might entail a shifting and rearrangement of the parts of the crust of the earth on a scale of unprecedented magnitude and bring about catastrophes to which the earthquake of lisbon is but a trifle it is conceivable that man and his works and all the higher forms of animal life should be utterly destroyed that mountain regions should he converted into ocean depths and the floor of oceans raised into mountains and the earth become a scene of horror which even the lurid fancy of the writer of the apocalypse would fail to portray and yet to the eye of science there would he no more disorder here than in the sabbatical peace of a summer sea not a link in the chain of natural causes and effects would he broken nowhere would there be the slightest indication of the suspension of a lower law by a higher if a sober scientific thinker is inclined to put little faith in the wild vaticinations of universal ruin which in a less saintly person than the seer of patmos might seem to be dictated by the fury of a revengeful fanatic rather than by the spirit of the teacher who bid men love their enemies it is not on the ground that they contradict scientific principles but because the evidence of their scientific value does not fulfil the conditions on which weight is attached to evidence the imagination which supposes that it does simply does not assume the air of scientific reason  i repeat that if imagination is used within the limits laid down by science disorder is unimaginable if a being endowed with perfect intellectual and æsthetic faculties but devoid of the capacity for suffering pain either physical or moral were to devote his utmost powers to the investigation of nature the universe would seem to him to be a sort of kaleidoscope in which at every successive moment of time a new arrangement of parts of exquisite beauty and symmetry would present itself and each of them would show itself to be the logical consequence of the preceding arrangement under the conditions which we call the laws of nature such a spectator might well be filled with that amor intellectualis dei the beatific vision of the vita contemplativa which some of the greatest thinkers of all ages aristotle aquinas spinoza have regarded as the only conceivable eternal felicity and the vision of illimitable suffering as if sensitive beings were unregarded animalcules which had got between the bits of glass of the kaleidoscope which mars the prospect to us poor mortals in no wise alters the fact that order is lord of all and disorder only a name for that part of the order which gives us pain  the other fallacious employment of the names of scientific conceptions which pervades the preachers utterance brings me back to the proper topic of the present essay it is the use of the word law as if it denoted a thingas if a law of nature as science understands it were a being endowed with certain powers in virtue of which the phenomena expressed by that law are brought about the preacher asks might not there be a suspension of a lower law by the intervention of a higher he tells us that every time we lift our arms we defy the law of gravitation he asks whether some day certain royal and ultimate laws may not come and wreck those laws which are at present it would appear acting as natures police it is evident from these expressions that laws in the mind of the preacher are entities having an objective existence in a graduated hierarchy and it would appear that the royal laws are by no means to be regarded as constitutional royalties at any moment they may like eastern despots descend in wrath among the middleclass and plebeian laws which have hitherto done the drudgery of the worlds work and to use phraseology not unknown in our seats of learningmake hay of their belongings or perhaps a still more familiar analogy has suggested this singular theory and it is thought that high laws may suspend low laws as a bishop may suspend a curate  far be it from me to controvert these views if any one likes to hold them all i wish to remark is that such a conception of the nature of laws has nothing to do with modern science it is scholastic realismrealism as intense and unmitigated as that of scotus erigena a thousand years ago the essence of such realism is that it maintains the objective existence of universals or as we call them nowadays general propositions it affirms for example that man is a real thing apart from individual men having its existence not in the sensible but in the intelligible world and clothing itself with the accidents of sense to make the jack and tom and harry whom we know strange as such a notion may appear to modern scientific thought it really pervades ordinary language there are few people who would at once hesitate to admit that colour for example exists apart from the mind which conceives the idea of colour they hold it to be something which resides in the coloured object and so far they are as much realists as if they had sat at platos feet reflection on the facts of the case must i imagine convince every one that colour isnot a mere name which was the extreme nominalist positionbut a name for that group of states of feeling which we call blue red yellow and so on and which we believe to be caused by luminiferous vibrations which have not the slightest resemblance to colour while these again are set afoot by states of the body to which we ascribe colour but which are equally devoid of likeness to colour  in the same way a law of nature in the scientific sense is the product of a mental operation upon the facts of nature which come under our observation and has no more existence outside the mind than colour has the law of gravitation is a statement of the manner in which experience shows that bodies which are free to move do in fact move towards one another but the other facts of observation that bodies are not always moving in this fashion and sometimes move in a contrary direction are implied in the words free to move if it is a law of nature that bodies tend to move towards one another in a certain way it is another and no less true law of nature that if bodies are not free to move as they tend to do either in consequence of an obstacle or of a contrary impulse from some other source of energy than that to which we give the name of gravitation they either stop still or go another way  scientifically speaking it is the acme of absurdity to talk of a man defying the law of gravitation when he lifts his arm the general store of energy in the universe working through terrestrial matter is doubtless tending to bring the mans arm down but the particular fraction of that energy which is working through certain of his nervous and muscular organs is tending to drive it up and more energy being expended on the arm in the upward than in the downward direction the arm goes up accordingly but the law of gravitation is no more defied in this case than when a grocer throws so much sugar into the empty pan of his scales that the one which contains the weight kicks the beam  the tenacity of the wonderful fallacy that the laws of nature are agents instead of being as they really are a mere record of experience upon which we base our interpretations of that which does happen and our anticipation of that which will happen is an interesting psychological fact and would be unintelligible if the tendency of the human mind towards realism were less strong  even at the present day and in the writings of men who would at once repudiate scholastic realism in any form law is often inadvertently employed in the sense of cause just as in common life a man will say that he is compelled by the law to do so and so when in point of fact all he means is that the law orders him to do it and tells him what will happen if he does not do it we commonly hear of bodies falling to the ground by reason of the law of gravitation whereas that law is simply the record of the fact that according to all experience they have so fallen when free to move and of the grounds of a reasonable expectation that they will so fall if it should be worth anybodys while to seek for examples of such misuse of language on my own part i am not at all sure he might not succeed though i have usually been on my guard against such looseness of expression if i am guilty i do penance beforehand and only hope that i may thereby deter others from committing the like fault and i venture on this personal observation by way of showing that i have no wish to bear hardly on the preacher for falling into an error for which he might find good precedents but it is one of those errors which in the case of a person engaged in scientific pursuits do little harm because it is corrected as soon as its consequences become obvious while those who know physical science only by name are as has been seen easily led to build a mighty fabric of unrealities on this fundamental fallacy in fact the habitual use of the word law in the sense of an active thing is almost a mark of pseudoscience it characterises the writings of those who have appropriated the forms of science without knowing anything of its substance  there are two classes of these people those who are ready to believe in any miracle so long as it is guaranteed by ecclesiastical authority and those who are ready to believe in any miracle so long as it has some different guarantee the believers in what are ordinarily called miraclesthose who accept the miraculous narratives which they are taught to think are essential elements of religious doctrineare in the one category the spiritrappers tableturners and all the other devotees of the occult sciences of our day are in the other and if they disagree in most things they agree in this namely that they ascribe to science a dictum that is not scientific and that they endeavour to upset the dictum thus foisted on science by a realistic argument which is equally unscientific  it is asserted for example that on a particular occasion water was turned into wine and on the other hand it is asserted that a man or a woman levitated to the ceiling floated about there and finally sailed out by the window and it is assumed that the pardonable scepticism with which most scientific men receive these statements is due to the fact that they feel themselves justified in denying the possibility of any such metamorphosis of water or of any such levitation because such events are contrary to the laws of nature so the question of the preacher is triumphantly put how do you know that there are not higher laws of nature than your chemical and physical laws and that these higher laws may not intervene and wreck the latter  the plain answer to this question is why should anybody be called upon to say how he knows that which he does not know you are assuming that laws are agentsefficient causes of that which happensand that one law can interfere with another to us that assumption is as nonsensical as if you were to talk of a proposition of euclid being the cause of the diagram which illustrates it or of the integral calculus interfering with the rule of three your question really implies that we pretend to complete knowledge not only of all past and present phenomena but of all that are possible in the future and we leave all that sort of thing to the adepts of esoteric buddhism our pretensions are infinitely more modest we have succeeded in finding out the rules of action of a little bit of the universe we call these rules laws of nature not because anybody knows whether they bind nature or not but because we find it is obligatory on us to take them into account both as actors under nature and as interpreters of nature we have any quantity of genuine miracles of our own and if you will furnish us with as good evidence of your miracles as we have of ours we shall be quite happy to accept them and to amend our expression of the laws of nature in accordance with the new facts  as to the particular cases adduced we are so perfectly fairminded as to be willing to help your case as far as we can you are quite mistaken in supposing that anybody who is acquainted with the possibilities of physical science will undertake categorically to deny that water may be turned into wine many very competent judges are already inclined to think that the bodies which we have hitherto called elementary are really composite arrangements of the particles of a uniform primitive matter supposing that view to be correct there would be no more theoretical difficulty about turning water into alcohol ethereal and colouring matters than there is at this present moment any practical difficulty in working other such miracles as when we turn sugar into alcohol carbonic acid glycerine and succinic acid or transmute gasrefuse into perfumes rarer than musk and dyes richer than tyrian purple if the socalled elements oxygen and hydrogen which compose water are aggregates of the same ultimate particles or physical units as those which enter into the structure of the socalled element carbon it is obvious that alcohol and other substances composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen may be produced by a rearrangement of some of the units of oxygen and hydrogen into the element carbon and their synthesis with the rest of the oxygen and hydrogen  theoretically therefore we can have no sort of objection to your miracle and our reply to the levitators is just the same why should not your friend levitate fish are said to rise and sink in the water by altering the volume of an internal airreceptacle and there may be many ways science as yet knows nothing of by which we who live at the bottom of an ocean of air may do the same thing dialectic gas and wind appear to be by no means wanting among you and why should not long practice in pneumatic philosophy have resulted in the internal generation of something a thousand times rarer than hydrogen by which in accordance with the most ordinary natural laws you would not only rise to the ceiling and float there in quasiangelic posture but perhaps as one of your feminine adepts is said to have done flit swifter than train or telegram to stillvexed bermoothes and twit ariel if he happens to be there for a sluggard we have not the presumption to deny the possibility of anything you affirm only as our brethren are particular about evidence do give us as much to go upon as may save us from being roared down by their inextinguishable laughter  enough of the realism which clings about laws there are plenty of other exemplifications of its vitality in modern science but i will cite only one of them  this is the conception of vital force which comes straight from the philosophy of aristotle it is a fundamental proposition of that philosophy that a natural object is composed of two constituentsthe one its matter conceived as inert or even to a certain extent opposed to orderly and purposive motion the other its form conceived as a quasispiritual something containing or conditioning the actual activities of the body and the potentiality of its possible activities  i am disposed to think that the prominence of this conception in aristotles theory of things arose from the circumstance that he was to begin with and throughout his life devoted to biological studies in fact it is a notion which must force itself upon the mind of any one who studies biological phenomena without reference to general physics as they now stand everybody who observes the obvious phenomena of the development of a seed into a tree or of an egg into an animal will note that a relatively formless mass of matter gradually grows takes a definite shape and structure and finally begins to perform actions which contribute towards a certain end namely the maintenance of the individual in the first place and of the species in the second starting from the axiom that every event has a cause we have here the causa finalis manifested in the last set of phenomena the causa materialis and formalis in the first while the existence of a causa efficiens within the seed or egg and its product is a corollary from the phenomena of growth and metamorphosis which proceed in unbroken succession and make up the life of the animal or plant  thus at starting the egg or seed is matter having a form like all other material bodies but this form has the peculiarity in contradistinction to lower substantial forms that it is a power which constantly works towards an end by means of living organisation  so far as i know leibnitz is the only philosopher at the same time a man of science in the modern sense of the first rank who has noted that the modern conception of force as a sort of atmosphere enveloping the particles of bodies and having potential or actual activity is simply a new name for the aristotelian form19 in modern biology up till within quite recent times the aristotelian conception held undisputed sway living matter was endowed with vital force and that accounted for everything whosoever was not satisfied with that explanation was treated to that very plain argumentconfound you eternallywherewith lord peter overcomes the doubts of his brothers in the tale of a tub materialist was the mildest term applied to himfortunate if he escaped pelting with infidel and atheist there may be scientific rip van winkles about who still hold by vital force but among those biologists who have not been asleep for the last quarter of a century vital force no longer figures in the vocabulary of science it is a patent survival of realism the generalisation from experience that all living bodies exhibit certain activities of a definite character is made the basis of the notion that every living body contains an entity vital force which is assumed to be the cause of those activities  it is remarkable in looking back to notice to what an extent this and other survivals of scholastic realism arrested or at any rate impeded the application of sound scientific principles to the investigation of biological phenomena when i was beginning to think about these matters the scientific world was occasionally agitated by discussions respecting the nature of the species and genera of naturalists of a different order from the disputes of a later time i think most were agreed that a species was something which existed objectively somehow or other and had been created by a divine fiat as to the objective reality of genera there was a good deal of difference of opinion on the other hand there were a few who could see no objective reality in anything but individuals and looked upon both species and genera as hypostatised universals as for myself i seem to have unconsciously emulated william of occam inasmuch as almost the first public discourse i ever ventured upon dealt with animal individuality and its tendency was to fight the nominalist battle even in that quarter  realism appeared in still stranger forms at the time to which i refer the community of plan which is observable in each great group of animals was hypostatised into a platonic idea with the appropriate name of archetype and we were told as a disciple of philojudæus might have told us that this realistic figment was the archetypal light by which nature has been guided amidst the wreck of worlds so again another naturalist who had no less earned a welldeserved reputation by his contributions to positive knowledge put forward a theory of the production of living things which as nearly as the increase of knowledge allowed was a reproduction of the doctrine inculcated by the jewish cabbala  annexing the archetype notion and carrying it to its full logical consequence the author of this theory conceived that the species of animals and plants were so many incarnations of the thoughts of godmaterial representations of divine ideasduring the particular period of the worlds history at which they existed but under the influence of the embryological and palæontological discoveries of modern times which had already lent some scientific support to the revived ancient theories of cosmical evolution or emanation the ingenious author of this speculation while denying and repudiating the ordinary theory of evolution by successive modification of individuals maintained and endeavoured to prove the occurrence of a progressive modification in the divine ideas of successive epochs  on the foundation of a supposed elevation of organisation in the whole living population of any epoch as compared with that of its predecessor and a supposed complete difference in species between the populations of any two epochs neither of which suppositions has stood the test of further inquiry the author of this speculation based his conclusion that the creator had so to speak improved upon his thoughts as time went on and that as each such amended scheme of creation came up the embodiment of the earlier divine thoughts was swept away by a universal catastrophe and an incarnation of the improved ideas took its place only after the last such wreck thus brought about did the embodiment of a divine thought in the shape of the first man make its appearance as the ne plus ultra of the cosmogonical process  i imagine that louis agassiz the genial backwoodsman of the science of my young days who did more to open out new tracks in the scientific forest than most men would have been much surprised to learn that he was preaching the doctrine of the cabbala pure and simple according to this modification of neoplatonism by contact with hebrew speculation the divine essence is unknowablewithout form or attribute but the interval between it and the world of sense is filled by intelligible entities which are nothing but the familiar hypostatised abstractions of the realists these have emanated like immense waves of light from the divine centre and as ten consecutive zones of sephiroth form the universe the farther away from the centre the more the primitive light wanes until the periphery ends in those mere negations darkness and evil which are the essence of matter on this the divine agency transmitted through the sephiroth operates after the fashion of the aristotelian forms and at first produces the lowest of a series of worlds after a

term realism has acquired a signification wholly           different from that which attached to it in the middle ages           we commonly use it as the contrary of idealism the idealist           holds that the phenomenal world has only a subjective           existence the realist that it has an objective existence i           am not aware that any mediæval philosopher was an idealist           in the sense in which we apply the term to berkeley in           fact the cardinal defect of their speculations lies in           their oversight of the considerations which lead to           idealism if many of them regarded the material world as a           negation it was an active negation not zero but a minus           quantity       18 at any rate a catastrophe greater than the flood           which as i observe with interest is as calmly assumed by           the preacher to be an historical event as if science had           never had a word to say on that subject       19 les

contribution to the last number of this review20 the duke of argyll has favoured me with a lecture on the proprieties of controversy to which i should be disposed to listen with more docility if his graces precepts appeared to me to be based upon rational principles or if his example were more exemplary  with respect to the latter point the duke has thought fit to entitle his article professor huxley on canon liddon and thus forces into prominence an element of personality which those who read the paper which is the object of the dukes animadversions will observe i have endeavoured most carefully to avoid my criticisms dealt with a report of a sermon published in a newspaper and thereby addressed to all the world whether that sermon was preached by a or b was not a matter of the smallest consequence and i went out of my way to absolve the learned divine to whom the discourse was attributed from the responsibility for statements which for anything i knew to the contrary might contain imperfect or inaccurate representations of his views the assertion that i had the wish or was beset by any temptation to attack canon liddon is simply contrary to fact  but suppose that if instead of sedulously avoiding even the appearance of such attack i had thought fit to take a different course suppose that after satisfying myself that the eminent clergyman whose name is paraded by the duke of argyll had really uttered the words attributed to him from the pulpit of st pauls what right would any one have to find fault with my action on grounds either of justice expediency or good taste  establishment has its duties as well as its rights the clergy of a state church enjoy many advantages over those of unprivileged and unendowed religious persuasions but they lie under a correlative responsibility to the state and to every member of the body politic i am not aware that any sacredness attaches to sermons if preachers stray beyond the doctrinal limits set by lay lawyers the privy council will see to it and if they think fit to use their pulpits for the promulgation of literary or historical or scientific errors it is not only the right but the duty of the humblest layman who may happen to be better informed to correct the evil effects of such perversion of the opportunities which the state affords them and such misuse of the authority which its support lends them whatever else it may claim to be in its relations with the state the established church is a branch of the civil service and for those who repudiate the ecclesiastical authority of the clergy they are merely civil servants as much responsible to the english people for the proper performance of their duties as any others  the duke of argyll tells us that the work and calling of the clergy prevent them from pursuing disputation as others can i wonder if his grace ever reads the socalled religious newspapers it is not an occupation which i should commend to any one who wishes to employ his time profitably but a very short devotion to this exercise will suffice to convince him that the pursuit of disputation carried to a degree of acrimony and vehemence unsurpassed in lay controversies seems to be found quite compatible with the work and calling of a remarkably large number of the clergy  finally it appears to me that nothing can be in worse taste than the assumption that a body of english gentlemen can by any possibility desire that immunity from criticism which the duke of argyll claims for them nothing would be more personally offensive to me than the supposition that i shirked criticism just or unjust of any lecture i ever gave i should be utterly ashamed of myself if when i stood up as an instructor of others i had not taken every pains to assure myself of the truth of that which i was about to say and i should feel myself bound to be even more careful with a popular assembly who would take me more or less on trust than with an audience of competent and critical experts  i decline to assume that the standard of morality in these matters is lower among the clergy than it is among scientific men i refuse to think that the priest who stands up before a congregation as the minister and interpreter of the divinity is less careful in his utterances less ready to meet adverse comment than the layman who comes before his audience as the minister and interpreter of nature yet what should we think of the man of science who when his ignorance or his carelessness was exposed whined about the want of delicacy of his critics or pleaded his work and calling as a reason for being let alone  no man nor any body of men is good enough or wise enough to dispense with the tonic of criticism nothing has done more harm to the clergy than the practice too common among laymen of regarding them when in the pulpit as a sort of chartered libertines whose divagations are not to be taken seriously and i am well assured that the distinguished divine to whom the sermon is attributed is the last person who would desire to avail himself of the dishonouring protection which has been superfluously thrown over him  so much for the lecture on propriety but the duke of argyll to whom the hortatory style seems to come naturally does me the honour to make my sayings the subjects of a series of other admonitions some on philosophical some on geological some on biological topics i can but rejoice that the dukes authority in these matters is not always employed to show that i am ignorant of them on the contrary i meet with an amount of agreement even of approbation for which i proffer such gratitude as may be due even if that gratitude is sometimes almost overshadowed by surprise  i am unfeignedly astonished to find that the duke of argyll who professes to intervene on behalf of the preacher does really like another balaam bless me altogether in respect of the main issue  i denied the justice of the preachers ascription to men of science of the doctrine that miracles are incredible because they are violations of natural law and the duke of argyll says that he believes my denial to be wellfounded the preacher was answering an objection which has now been generally abandoned either the preacher knew this or he did not know it it seems to me as a mere lay teacher to be a pity that the great dome of st pauls should have been made to echo if so be that such stentorian effects were really produced a statement which admitting the first alternative was unfair and admitting the second was ignorant21  having thus sacrified one half of the preachers arguments the duke of argyll proceeds to make equally short work with the other half it appears that he fully accepts my position that the occurrence of those events which the preacher speaks of as catastrophes is no evidence of disorder inasmuch as such catastrophes may be necessary occasional consequences of uniform changes whence i conclude his grace agrees with me that the talk about royal laws wrecking ordinary laws may be eloquent metaphor but is also nonsense  and now comes a further surprise after having given these superfluous stabs to the slain body of the preachers argument my good ally remarks with magnificent calmness so far then the preacher and the professor are at one let them smoke the calumet by all means smoke would be the most appropriate symbol of this wonderful attempt to cover a retreat after all the duke has come to bury the preacher not to praise him only he makes the funeral obsequies look as much like a triumphal procession as possible  so far as the questions between the preacher and myself are concerned then i may feel happy the authority of the duke of argyll is ranged on my side but the duke has raised a number of other questions with respect to which i fear i shall have to dispense with his supportnay even be compelled to differ from him as much or more than i have done about his graces new rendering of the benefit of clergy  in discussing catastrophes the duke indulges in statements partly scientific partly anecdotic which appear to me to be somewhat misleading we are told to begin with that sir charles lyells doctrine respecting the proper mode of interpreting the facts of geology which is commonly called uniformitarianism does not hold its head quite so high as it once did that is great news indeed but is it true all i can say is that i am aware of nothing that has happened of late that can in any way justify it and my opinion is that the body of lyells doctrine as laid down in that great work the principles of geology whatever may have happened to its head is a chief and permanent constituent of the foundations of geological science  but this question cannot he advantageously discussed unless we take some pains to discriminate between the essential part of the uniformitarian doctrine and its accessories and it does not appear that the duke of argyll has carried his studies of geological philosophy so far as this point for he defines uniformitarianism to be the assumption of the extreme slowness and perfect continuity of all geological changes  what perfect continuity may mean in this definition i am by no means sure but i can only imagine that it signifies the absence of any break in the course of natural order during the millions of years the lapse of which is recorded by geological phenomena  is the duke of argyll prepared to say that any geologist of authority at the present day believes that there is the slightest evidence of the occurrence of supernatural intervention during the long ages of which the monuments are preserved to us in the crust of the earth and if he is not in what sense has this part of the uniformitarian doctrine as he defines it lowered its pretensions to represent scientific truth  as to the extreme slowness of all geological changes it is simply a popular error to regard that as in any wise a fundamental and necessary dogma of uniformitarianism it is extremely astonishing to me that any one who has carefully studied lyells great work can have so completely failed to appreciate its purport which yet is writ large on the very titlepage the principles of geology being an attempt to explain the former changes of the earths surface by reference to causes now in operation the essence of lyells doctrine is here written so that those who run may read and it has nothing to do with the quickness or slowness of the past changes of the earths surface except in so far as existing analogous changes may go on slowly and therefore create a presumption in favour of the slowness of past changes  with that epigrammatic force which characterises his style buffon wrote nearly a hundred and fifty years ago in his famous théorie de la terre pour juger de ce qui est arrivé et même de ce qui arrivera nous navons quà examiner ce qui arrive the key of the past as of the future is to be sought in the present and only when known causes of change have been shown to be insufficient have we any right to have recourse to unknown causes geology is as much a historical science as archæology and i apprehend that all sound historical investigation rests upon this axiom it underlay all huttons work and animated lyell and scope in their successful efforts to revolutionise the geology of half a century ago  there is no antagonism whatever and there never was between the belief in the views which had their chief and unwearied advocate in lyell and the belief in the occurrence of catastrophes the first edition of lyells principles published in 1830 lies before me and a large part of the first volume is occupied by an account of volcanic seismic and diluvial catastrophes which have occurred within the historical period moreover the author over and over again expressly draws the attention of his readers to the consistency of catastrophes with his doctrine       notwithstanding therefore that we have not witnessed      within the last three thousand years the devastation by      deluge of a large continent yet as we may predict the      future occurrence of such catastrophes we are authorized to      regard them as part of the present order of nature and they      may be introduced into geological speculations respecting      the past provided that we do not imagine them to have been      more frequent or general than we expect them to be in time      to come vol i p 89  again       if we regard each of the causes separately which we know to      be at present the most instrumental in remodelling the state      of the surface we shall find that we must expect each to      be in action for thousands of years without producing any      extensive alterations in the habitable surface and then to      give rise during a very brief period to important      revolutions vol ii p 16122  lyell quarrelled with the catastrophists then by no means because they assumed that catastrophes occur and have occurred but because they had got into the habit of calling on their god catastrophe to help them when they ought to have been putting their shoulders to the wheel of observation of the present course of nature in order to help themselves out of their difficulties and geological science has become what it is chiefly because geologists have gradually accepted lyells doctrine and followed his precepts  so far as i know anything about the matter there is nothing that can be called proof that the causes of geological phenomena operated more intensely or more rapidly at any time between the older tertiary and the oldest palæozoic epochs than they have done between the older tertiary epoch and the present day and if that is so uniformitarianism even as limited by lyell23 has no call to lower its crest but if the facts were otherwise the position lyell took up remains impregnable he did not say that the geological operations of nature were never more rapid or more vast than they are now what he did maintain is the very different proposition that there is no good evidence of anything of the kind and that proposition has not yet been shown to be incorrect  i owe more than i can tell to the careful study of the principles of geology in my young days and long before the year 1856 my mind was familiar with the truth that the doctrine of uniformity is not incompatible with great and sudden changes which as i have shown is taught totidem verbis in that work even had it been possible for me to shut my eyes to the sense of what i had read in the principles whewells philosophy of the inductive sciences published in 1840 a work with which i was also tolerably familiar must have opened them for the always acute if not always profound author in arguing against lyells uniformitarianism expressly points out that it does not in any way contravene the occurrence of catastrophes       with regard to such occurrences earthquakes deluges      etc terrible as they appear at the time they may not      much affect the average rate of change there may be a      cycle though an irregular one of rapid and slow change      and if such cycles go on succeeding each other we may still      call the order of nature uniform notwithstanding the      periods of violence which it involves24  the reader who has followed me through this brief chapter of the history of geological philosophy will probably find the following passage in the paper of the duke of argyll to be not a little remarkable       many years ago when i had the honor of being president of      the british association25 i ventured to point out in the      presence and in the hearing of that most distinguished man      sir c lyell that the doctrine of uniformity was not      incompatible with great and sudden changes since cycles of      these and other cycles of comparative rest might well be      constituent parts of that uniformity which he asserted      lyell did not object to this extended interpretation of his      own doctrine and indeed expressed to me his entire      concurrence  i should think he did for as i have shown there was nothing in it that lyell himself had not said sixandtwenty years before and enforced three years before and it is almost verbally identical with the view of uniformitarianism taken by whewell sixteen years before in a work with which one would think that any one who undertakes to discuss the philosophy of science should be familiar  thirty years have elapsed since the beginner of 1856 persuaded himself that he enlightened the foremost geologist of his time and one of the most acute and farseeing men of science of any time as to the scope of the doctrines which the veteran philosopher had grown gray in promulgating and the duke of argylls acquaintance with the literature of geology has not even now become sufficiently profound to dissipate that pleasant delusion  if the duke of argylls guidance in that branch of physical science with which alone he has given evidence of any practical acquaintance is thus unsafe i may breathe more freely in setting my opinion against the authoritative deliverances of his grace about matters which lie outside the province of geology  and here the dukes paper offers me such a wealth of opportunities that choice becomes embarrassing i must bear in mind the good old adage non multa sed multum tempting as it would be to follow the duke through his labyrinthine misunderstandings of the ordinary terminology of philosophy and to comment on the curious unintelligibility which hangs about his frequent outpourings of fervid language limits of space oblige me to restrict myself to those points the discussion of which may help to enlighten the public in respect of matters of more importance than the competence of my mentor for the task which he has undertaken  i am not sure when the employment of the word law in the sense in which we speak of laws of nature commenced but examples of it may be found in the works of bacon descartes and spinoza bacon employs law as the equivalent of form and i am inclined to think that he may be responsible for a good deal of the confusion that has subsequently arisen but i am not aware that the term is used by other authorities in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in any other sense than that of rule or definite order of the coexistence of things or succession of events in nature descartes speaks of règles que je nomme les lois de la nature leibnitz says loi ou règle générale as if he considered the terms interchangeable  the duke of argyll however affirms that the law of gravitation as put forth by newton was something more than the statement of an observed order he admits that keplers three laws were an observed order of facts and nothing more as to the law of gravitation it contains an element which keplers laws did not contain even an element of causation the recognition of which belongs to a higher category of intellectual conceptions than that which is concerned in the mere observation and record of separate and apparently unconnected facts there is hardly a line in these paragraphs which appears to me to be indisputable but to confine myself to the matter in hand i cannot conceive that any one who had taken ordinary pains to acquaint himself with the real nature of either keplers or newtons work could have written them that the labours of kepler of all men in the world should be called mere observation and record is truly wonderful and any one who will look into the principia or the optics or the letters to bentley will see even if he has no more special knowledge of the topics discussed than i have that newton over and over again insisted that he had nothing to do with gravitation as a physical cause and that when he used the terms attraction force and the like he employed them as he says mathematicè and not physicè       how these attractions of gravity magnetism and      electricity may be performed i do not here consider what      i call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some      other means unknown to me i use that word here to signify      only in a general way any force by which bodies tend towards      one another whatever be the cause26  according to my reading of the best authorities upon the history of science newton discovered neither gravitation nor the law of gravitation nor did he pretend to offer more than a conjecture as to the causation of gravitation moreover his assertion that the notion of a body acting where it is not is one that no competent thinker could entertain is antagonistic to the whole current conception of attractive and repulsive forces and therefore of the attractive force of gravitation what then was that labour of unsurpassed magnitude and excellence and of immortal influence which newton did perform in the first place newton defined the laws rules or observed order of the phenomena of motion which come under our daily observation with greater precision than had been before attained and by following out with marvellous power and subtlety the mathematical consequences of these rules he almost created the modern science of pure mechanics in the second place applying exactly the same method to the explication of the facts of astronomy as that which was applied a century and a half later to the facts of geology by lyell he set himself to solve the following problem assuming that all bodies free to move tend to approach one another as the earth and the bodies on it do assuming that the strength of that tendency is directly as the mass and inversely as the squares of the distances assuming that the laws of motion determined for terrestrial bodies hold good throughout the universe assuming that the planets and their satellites were created and placed at their observed mean distances and that each received a certain impulse from the creator will the form of the orbits the varying rates of motion of the planets and the ratio between those rates and their distances from the sun which must follow by mathematical reasoning from these premisses agree with the order of facts determined by kepler and others or not  newton employing mathematical methods which are the admiration of adepts but which no one but himself appears to have been able to use with ease not only answered this question in the affirmative but stayed not his constructive genius before it had founded modern physical astronomy  the historians of mechanical and of astronomical science appear to be agreed that he was the first person who clearly and distinctly put forth the hypothesis that the phenomena comprehended under the general name of gravity follow the same order throughout the universe and that all material bodies exhibit these phenomena so that in this sense the idea of universal gravitation may doubtless be properly ascribed to him  newton proved that the laws of kepler were particular consequences of the laws of motion and the law of gravitationin other words the reason of the first lay in the two latter but to talk of the law of gravitation alone as the reason of keplers laws and still more as standing in any causal relation to keplers laws is simply a misuse of language it would really be interesting if the duke of argyll would explain how he proposes to set about showing that the elliptical form of the orbits of the planets the constant area described by the radius vector and the proportionality of the squares of the periodic times to the cubes of the distances from the sun are either caused by the force of gravitation or deducible from the law of gravitation i conceive that it would be about as apposite to say that the various compounds of nitrogen with oxygen are caused by chemical attraction and deducible from the atomic theory                                       newton assuredly lent no shadow of support to the modern pseudoscientific philosophy which confounds laws with causes i have not taken the trouble to trace out this commonest of fallacies to its first beginning but i was familiar with it in full bloom more than thirty years ago in a work which had a great vogue in its daythe vestiges of the natural history of creationof which the first edition was published in 1844  it is full of apt and forcible illustrations of pseudoscientific realism consider for example this gem serene when a boy who has climbed a tree loses his hold of the branch the law of gravitation unrelentingly pulls him to the ground and then he is hurt whereby the almighty is quite relieved from any responsibility for the accident here is the law of gravitation acting as a cause in a way quite in accordance with the duke of argylls conception of it in fact in the mind of the author of the vestiges laws are existences intermediate between the creator and his works like the ideas of the platonisers or the logos of the alexandrians27 i may cite a passage which is quite in the vein of philo       we have seen powerful evidences that the construction of      this globe and its associates and inferentially that of      all the other globes in space was the result not of any      immediate or personal exertion on the part of the deity but      of natural laws which are the expression of his will what      is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also      a result of natural laws which are in like manner an      expression of his will p 154 1st edition  and creation operating by law is constantly cited as relieving the creator from trouble about insignificant details  i am perplexed to picture to myself the state of mind which accepts these verbal juggleries it is intelligible that the creator should operate according to such rules as he might think fit to lay down for himself and therefore according to law but that would leave the operation of his will just as much a direct personal act as it would be under any other circumstances i can also understand that as in leibnitzs caricature of newtons views the creator might have made the cosmical machine and after setting it going have left it to itself till it needed repair but then by the supposition his personal responsibility would have been involved in all that it did just as much as a dynamiter is responsible for what happens when he has set his machine going and left it to explode  the only hypothesis which gives a sort of mad consistency to the vestigiarians views is the supposition that laws are a kind of angels or demiurgoi who being supplied with the great architects plan were permitted to settle the details among themselves accepting this doctrine the conception of royal laws and plebeian laws and of those more than homeric contests in which the big laws wreck the little ones becomes quite intelligible and in fact the honour of the paternity of those remarkable ideas which come into full flower in the preachers discourse must so far as my imperfect knowledge goes be attributed to the author of the vestiges  but the author of the vestiges is not the only writer who is responsible for the current pseudoscientific mystifications which hang about the term law when i wrote my paper about scientific and pseudoscientific realism i had not read a work by the duke of argyll the reign of law which i believe has enjoyed possibly still enjoys a widespread popularity but the vivacity of the dukes attack led me to think it possible that criticisms directed elsewhere might have come home to him and in fact i find that the second chapter of the work in question which is entitled law its definitions is from my point of view a sort of summa of pseudoscientific philosophy it will be worth while to examine it in some detail  in the first place it is to be noted that the author of the reign of law admits that law in many cases means nothing more than the statement of the order in which facts occur or as he says an observed order of facts p 66 but his appreciation of the value of accuracy of expression does not hinder him from adding almost in the same breath in this sense the laws of nature are simply those facts of nature which recur according to rule p 66 thus laws which were rightly said to be the statement of an order of facts in one paragraph are declared to be the facts themselves in the next  we are next told that though it may be customary and permissible to use law in the sense of a statement of the order of facts this is a low use of the word and indeed two pages farther on the writer flatly contradicting himself altogether denies its admissibility       an observed order of facts to be entitled to the rank of a      law must be an order so constant and uniform as to indicate      necessity and necessity can only arise out of the action      of some compelling force p 68  this is undoubtedly one of the most singular propositions that i have ever met with in a professedly scientific work and its rarity is embellished by another direct selfcontradiction which it implies for on the preceding page 67 when the duke of argyll is speaking of the laws of kepler which he admits to be laws and which are types of that which men of science understand by laws he says that they are simply and purely an order of facts moreover he adds a very large proportion of the laws of every science are laws of this kind and in this sense  if according to the duke of argylls admission law is understood in this sense thus widely and constantly by scientific authorities where is the justification for his unqualified assertion that such statements of the observed order of facts are not entitled to the rank of laws  but let us examine the consequences of the really interesting proposition i have just quoted i presume that it is a law of nature that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points this law affirms the constant association of a certain fact of form with a certain fact of dimension whether the notion of necessity which attaches to it has an a priori or an a posteriori origin is a question not relevant to the present discussion but i would beg to be informed if it is necessary where is the compelling force out of which the necessity arises and further if it is not necessary whether it loses the character of a law of nature  i take it to be the law of nature based on unexceptionable evidence that the mass of matter remains unchanged whatever chemical or other modifications it may undergo this law is one of the foundations of chemistry but it is by no means necessary it is quite possible to imagine that the mass of matter should vary according to circumstances as we know its weight does moreover the determination of the force which makes mass constant if there is any intelligibility in that form of words would not so far as i can see confer any more validity on the law than it has now  there is a law of nature so well vouched by experience that all mankind from pure logicians in search of examples to parish sextons in search of fees confide in it this is the law that all men are mortal it is simply a statement of the observed order of facts that all men sooner or later die i am not acquainted with any law of nature which is more constant and uniform than this but will any one tell me that death is necessary certainly there is no à priori necessity in the case for various men have been imagined to be immortal and i should be glad to be informed of any necessity that can be deduced from biological considerations it is quite conceivable as has recently been pointed out that some of the lowest forms of life may be immortal after a fashion however this may be i would further ask supposing all men are mortal to be a real law of nature where and what is that to which with any propriety the title of compelling force of the law can be given  on page 69 the duke of argyll asserts that the law of gravitation is a law in the sense not merely of a rule but of a cause but this revival of the teaching of the vestiges has already been examined and disposed of and when the duke of argyll states that the observed order which kepler had discovered was simply a necessary consequence of the force of gravitation i need not recapitulate the evidence which proves such a statement to be wholly fallacious but it may be useful to say once more that at this present moment nobody knows anything about the existence of a force of gravitation apart from the fact that newton declared the ordinary notion of such force to be inconceivable that various attempts have been made to account for the order of facts we call gravitation without recourse to the notion of attractive force that if such a force exists it is utterly incompetent to account for keplers laws without taking into the reckoning a great number of other considerations and finally that all we know about the force of gravitation or any other socalled force is that it is a name for the hypothetical cause of an observed order of facts  thus when the duke of argyll says force ascertained according to some measure of its operationthis is indeed one of the definitions but only one of a scientific law p 71 i reply that it is a definition which must be repudiated by every one who possesses an adequate acquaintance with either the facts or the philosophy of science and be relegated to the limbo of pseudoscientific fallacies if the human mind has never entertained this notion of force nay if it substituted bare invariable succession for the ordinary notion of causation the idea of law as the expression of a constantlyobserved order which generates a corresponding intensity of expectation in our minds would have exactly the same value and play its part in real science exactly as it does now  it is needless to extend further the present excursus on the origin and history of modern pseudoscience under such high patronage as it has enjoyed it has grown and flourished until nowadays it is becoming somewhat rampant it has its weekly ephemerides in which every new pseudoscientific maresnest is hailed and belauded with the unconscious unfairness of ignorance and an army of reconcilers enlisted in its service whose business seems to be to mix the black of dogma and the white of science into the neutral tint of what they call liberal theology  i remember that not long after the publication of the vestiges a shrewd and sarcastic countryman of the author defined it as cauld kail made het again a cynic might find amusement in the reflection that at the present time the principles and the methods of the muchvilified vestigiarian are being made het again and are not only echoed by the dome of st pauls but thundered from the castle of inverary but my turn of mind is not cynical and i can but regret the waste of time and energy bestowed on the endeavour to deal with the most difficult problems of science by those who have neither undergone the discipline nor possess the information which are indispensable to the successful issue of such an enterprise  i have already had occasion to remark that the duke of argylls views of the conduct of controversy are different from mine and this muchtobe lamented discrepancy becomes yet more accentuated when the duke reaches biological topics anything that was good enough for sir charles lyell in his department of study is certainly good enough for me in mine and i by no means demur to being pedagogically instructed about a variety of matters with which it has been the business of my life to try to acquaint myself but the duke of argyll is not content with favouring me with his opinions about my own business he also answers for mine and at that point really the worm must turn i am told that no one knows better than professor huxley a variety of things which i really do not know and i am said to be a disciple of that positive philosophy which i have over and over again publicly repudiated in language which is certainly not lacking in intelligibility whatever may be its other defects  i am told that i have been amusing myself with a metaphysical exercitation or logomachy may i remark incidentally that these are not quite convertible terms when to the best of my belief i have been trying to expose a process of mystification based upon the use of scientific language by writers who exhibit no sign of scientific training of accurate scientific knowledge or of clear ideas respecting the philosophy of science which is doing very serious harm to the public naturally enough they take the lions skin of scientific phraseology for evidence that the voice which issues from beneath it is the voice of science and i desire to relieve them from the consequences of their error  the duke of argyll asks apparently with sorrow that it should be his duty to subject me to reproof       what shall we say of a philosophy which confounds the      organic with the inorganic and refusing to take note of a      difference so profound assumes to explain under one common      abstraction the movements due to gravitation and the      movements due to the mind of man  to which i may fitly reply by another question what shall we say to a controversialist who attributes to the subject of his attack opinions which are notoriously not his and expresses himself in such a manner that it is obvious he is unacquainted with even the rudiments of that knowledge which is necessary to the discussion into which he has rushed  what line of my writing can the duke of argyll produce which confounds the organic with the inorganic  as to the latter half of the paragraph i have to confess a doubt whether it has any definite meaning but i imagine that the duke is alluding to my assertion that the law of gravitation is nowise suspended or defied when a man lifts his arm but that under such circumstances part of the store of energy in the universe operates on the arm at a mechanical advantage as against the operation of another part i was simple enough to think that no one who had as much knowledge of physiology as is to be found in an elementary primer or who had ever heard of the greatest physical generalisation of modern timesthe doctrine of the conservation of energywould dream of doubting my statement and i was further simple enough to think that no one who lacked these qualifications would feel tempted to charge me with error it appears that my simplicity is greater than my powers of imagination  the duke of argyll may not be aware of the fact but it is nevertheless true that when a mans arm is raised in sequence to that state of consciousness we call a volition the volition is not the immediate cause of the elevation of the arm on the contrary that operation is effected by a certain change of form technically known as contraction in sundry masses of flesh technically known as muscles which are fixed to the bones of the shoulder in such a manner that if these muscles contract they must raise the arm now each of these muscles is a machine comparable in a certain sense to one of the donkeyengines of a steamship but more complete inasmuch as the source of its ability to change its form or contract lies within itself every time that by contracting the muscle does work such as that involved in raising the arm more or less of the material which it contains is used up just as more or less of the fuel of a steamengine is used up when it does work and i do not think there is a doubt in the mind of any competent physicist or physiologist that the work done in lifting the weight of the arm is the mechanical equivalent of a certain proportion of the energy set free by the molecular changes which take place in the muscle it is further a tolerably wellbased belief that this and all other forms of energy are mutually convertible and therefore that they all come under that general law or statement of the order of facts called the conservation of energy and as that certainly is an abstraction so the view which the duke of argyll thinks so extremely absurd is really one of the commonplaces of physiology but this review is hardly an appropriate place for giving instruction in the elements of that science and i content myself with recommending the duke of argyll to devote some study to book ii chap v section 4 of my friend dr fosters excellent textbook of physiology 1st edition 1877 p 321 which begins thus       broadly speaking the animal body is a machine for      converting potential into actual energy the potential      energy is supplied by the food this the metabolism of the      body converts into the actual energy of heat and mechanical      labour  there is no more difficult problem in the world than that of the relation of the state of consciousness termed volition to the mechanical work which frequently follows upon it but no one can even comprehend the nature of the problem who has not carefully studied the long series of modes of motion which without a break connect the energy which does that work with the general store of energy the ultimate form of the problem is this have we any reason to believe that a feeling or state of consciousness is capable of directly affecting the motion of even the smallest conceivable molecule of matter is such a thing even conceivable if we answer these questions in the negative it follows that volition may be a sign but cannot be a cause of bodily motion if we answer them in the affirmative then states of consciousness become undistinguishable from material things for it is the essential nature of matter to be the vehicle or substratum of mechanical energy  there is nothing new in all this i have merely put into modern language the issue raised by descartes more than two centuries ago the philosophies of the occasionalists of spinoza of malebranche of modern idealism and modern materialism have all grown out of the controversies which cartesianism evoked of all this the pseudoscience of the present time appears to be unconscious otherwise it would hardly content itself with making het again the pseudoscience of the past  in the course of these observations i have already had occasion to express my appreciation of the copious and perfervid eloquence which enriches the duke of argylls pages i am almost ashamed that a constitutional insensibility to the sirenian charms of rhetoric has permitted me in wandering through these flowery meads to be attracted almost exclusively to the bare places of fallacy and the stony grounds of deficient information which are disguised though not concealed by these floral decorations but in his concluding sentences the duke soars into a tyrtæan strain which roused even my dull soul       it was high time indeed that some revolt should be raised      against that reign of terror which had come to be      established in the scientific world under the abuse of a      great name professor huxley has not joined this revolt      openly for as yet indeed it is only beginning to raise      its head but more than onceand very latelyhe has      uttered a warning voice against the shallow dogmatism that      has provoked it the time is coming when that revolt will be      carried further higher interpretations will be established      unless i am much mistaken they are already coming in sight      p 339  i have been living very much out of the world for the last two or three years and when i read this denunciatory outburst as of one filled with the spirit of prophecy i said to myself mercy upon us what has happened can it be that x and y it would be wrong to mention the names of the vigorous young friends which occurred to me are playing danton and robespierre and that a guillotine is erected in the courtyard of burlington house for the benefit of all antidarwinian fellows of the royal society where are the secret conspirators against this tyranny whom i am supposed to favour and yet not have the courage to join openly and to think of my poor oppressed friend mr herbert spencer compelled to speak with bated breath p 338 certainly for the first time in my thirtyodd years acquaintance with him my alarm and horror at the supposition that while i had been fiddling or at any rate physicking my beloved rome had been burning in this fashion may be imagined  i am sure the duke of argyll will be glad to hear that the anxiety he created was of extremely short duration it is my privilege to have access to the best sources of information and nobody in the scientific world can tell me anything about either the reign of terror or the revolt in fact the scientific world laughs most indecorously at the notion of the existence of either and some are so lost to the sense of the scientific dignity that they descend to the use of transatlantic slang and call it a bogus scare as to my friend mr herbert spencer i have every reason to know that in the factors of organic evolution he has said exactly what was in his mind without any particular deference to the opinions of the person whom he is pleased to regard as his most dangerous critic and devils advocategeneral and still less of any one else  i do not know whether the duke of argyll pictures himself as the tallien of this imaginary revolt against a no less imaginary reign of terror but if so i most respectfully but firmly decline to join his forces it is only a few weeks since i happened to read over again the first article which i ever wrote now twentyseven years ago on the origin of species and i found nothing that i wished to modify in the opinions that are there expressed though the subsequent vast accumulation of evidence in favour of mr darwins views would give me much to add as is the case with all new doctrines so with that of evolution the enthusiasm of advocates has sometimes tended to degenerate into fanaticism and mere speculation has at times threatened to shoot beyond its legitimate bounds i have occasionally thought it wise to warn the more adventurous spirits among us against these dangers in sufficiently plain language and i have sometimes jestingly said that i expected if i lived long enough to be looked on as a reactionary by some of my more ardent friends but nothing short of midsummer madness can account for the fiction that i am waiting till it is safe to join openly a revolt hatched by some person or persons unknown against an intellectual movement with which i am in the most entire and hearty sympathy it is a great many years since at the outset of my career i had to think seriously what life had to offer that was worth having i came to the conclusion that the chief good for me was freedom to learn think and say what i pleased when i pleased i have acted on that conviction and have availed myself of the rara temporum felicitas ubi sentire quæ velis et quæ sentias dicere licet which is now enjoyable to the best of my ability and though strongly and perhaps wisely warned that i should probably come to grief i am entirely satisfied with the results of the line of action i have adopted  my career is at an end i have      warmed both hands before the fire of life  and nothing is left me before i depart but to help or at any rate to abstain from hindering the younger generation of men of science in doing better service to the cause we have at heart than i have been able to render  and yet forsooth i am supposed to be waiting for the signal of revolt which some fiery spirits among these young men are to raise before i dare express my real opinions concerning questions about which we older men had to fight in the teeth of fierce public opposition and obloquyof something which might almost justify even the grandiloquent epithet of a reign of terrorbefore our excellent successors had left school  it would appear that the spirit of pseudoscience has impregnated even the imagination of the duke of argyll the scientific imagination always restrains itself within the limits of probability  footnotes       20 nineteenth century march 1887       21 the duke of argyll speaks of the recent date of the           demonstration of the fallacy of the doctrine in           question recent is a relative term but i may           mention that the question is fully discussed in my book           on hume which if i may believe my publishers has           been read by a good many people since it appeared in           1879 moreover i observe from a note at page 89 of           the reign of law a work to which i shall have           occasion to advert by and by that the duke of argyll           draws attention to the circumstance that so long ago           as 1866 the views which i hold on this subject were           well known the duke in fact writing about this time           says after quoting a phrase of mine the question of           miracles seems now to be admitted on all hands to be           simply a question of evidence in science we think           that a teacher who ignores views which have been           discussed coram populo for twenty years is hardly up           to the mark       22 see also vol i p 460 in the ninth edition 1853           published twentythree years after the first lyell           deprives even the most careless reader of any excuse           for misunderstanding him so in regard to subterranean           movements the theory of the perpetual uniformity of           the force which they exert on the earthcrust is quite           consistent with the admission of their alternate           development and suspension for indefinite periods           within limited geographical areas p 187       23 a great many years ago presidential address to the           geological society 1869 i ventured to indicate that           which seemed to me to be the weak point not in the           fundamental principles of uniformitarianism but in           uniformitarianism as taught by lyell it lay to my           mind in the refusal by hutton and in a less degree by           lyell to look beyond the limits of the time recorded           by the stratified rocks i said this attempt to           limit at a particular point the progress of inductive           and deductive reasoning from the things which are to           the things which werethis faithlessness to its own           logic seems to me to have cost uniformitarianism the           place as the permanent form of geological speculation           which it might otherwise have held lay sermons p           260 the context shows that uniformitarianism here           means that doctrine as limited in application by           hutton and lyell and that what i mean by           evolutionism is consistent and thoroughgoing           uniformitarianism       24 philosophy of the inductive sciences vol i p 670           new edition 1847       25 at glasgow in 1856       26 optics query 31       27 the author recognises this in his explanations     iv an episcopal trilogy  1887   if there is any truth in the old adage that a burnt child dreads the fire i ought to be very loath to touch a sermon while the memory of what befell me on a recent occasion possibly not yet forgotten by the readers of the nineteenth century is uneffaced but i suppose that even the distinguished censor of that unheardof audacity to which not even the newspaper report of a sermon is sacred can hardly regard a man of science as either indelicate or presumptuous if he ventures to offer some comments upon three discourses specially addressed to the great assemblage of men of science which recently gathered at manchester by three bishops of the state church on my return to england not long ago i found a pamphlet28 containing a version which i presume to be authorised of these sermons among the huge mass of letters and papers which had accumulated during two months absence and i have read them not only with attentive interest but with a feeling of satisfaction which is quite new to me as a result of hearing or reading sermons these excellent discourses in fact appear to me to signalise a new departure in the course adopted by theology towards science and to indicate the possibility of bringing about an honourable modus vivendi between the two how far the three bishops speak as accredited representatives of the church is a question to be considered by and by most assuredly i am not authorised to represent any one but myself but i suppose that there must be a good many people in the church of the bishops way of thinking and i have reason to believe that in the ranks of science there are a good many persons who more or less share my views and it is to these sensible people on both sides as the bishops and i must needs think those who agree with us that my present observations are addressed they will probably be astonished to learn how insignificant in principle their differences are  it is impossible to read the discourses of the three prelates without being impressed by the knowledge which they display and by the spirit of equity i might say of generosity towards science which pervades them there is no trace of that tacit or open assumption that the rejection of theological dogmas on scientific grounds is due to moral perversity which is the ordinary note of ecclesiastical homilies on this subject and which makes them look so supremely silly to men whose lives have been spent in wrestling with these questions there is no attempt to hide away real stumblingblocks under rhetorical stucco no resort to the tu quoque device of setting scientific blunders against theological errors no suggestion that an honest man may keep contradictory beliefs in separate pockets of his brain no question that the method of scientific investigation is valid whatever the results to which it may lead and that the search after truth and truth only ennobles the searcher and leaves no doubt that his life at any rate is worth living the bishop of carlisle declares himself pledged to the belief that the advancement of science the progress of human knowledge is in itself a worthy aim of the greatest effort of the greatest minds  how often was it my fate a quarter of a century ago to see the whole artillery of the pulpit brought to bear upon the doctrine of evolution and its supporters any one unaccustomed to the amenities of ecclesiastical controversy would have thought we were too wicked to be permitted to live but let us hear the bishop of bedford after a perfectly frank statement of the doctrine of evolution and some of its obvious consequences that learned prelate pleads with all earnestness against       a hasty denunciation of what may be proved to have at      least some elements of truth in it a contemptuous rejection      of theories which we may some day learn to accept as      freely and with as little sense of inconsistency with gods      word as we now accept the theory of the earths motion round      the sun or the long duration of the geological epochs p      28  i do not see that the most convinced evolutionist could ask any one whether cleric or layman to say more than this in fact i do not think that any one has a right to say more with respect to any question about which two opinions can he held than that his mind is perfectly open to the force of evidence  there is another portion of the bishop of bedfords sermon which i think will be warmly appreciated by all honest and clearheaded men he repudiates the views of those who say that theology and science       occupy wholly different spheres and need in no way      intermeddle with each other they revolve as it were in      different planes and so never meet thus we may pursue      scientific studies with the utmost freedom and at the same      time may pay the most reverent regard to theology having      no fears of collision because allowing no points of contact      p 29  surely every unsophisticated mind will heartily concur with the bishops remark upon this convenient refuge for the descendants of mr facingbothways i have never been able to understand this position though i have often seen it assumed nor can any demurrer be sustained when the bishop proceeds to point out that there are and must be various points of contact between theological and natural science and therefore that it is foolish to ignore or deny the existence of as many dangers of collision  finally the bishop of manchester freely admits the force of the objections which have been raised on scientific grounds to prayer and attempts to turn them by arguing that the proper objects of prayer are not physical but spiritual he tells us that natural accidents and moral misfortunes are not to be taken for moral judgments of god he admits the propriety of the application of scientific methods to the investigation of the origin and growth of religions and he is as ready to recognise the process of evolution there as in the physical world mark the following striking passage       and how utterly all the common objections to divine      revelation vanish away when they are set in the light of      this theory of a spiritual progression are we reminded that      there prevailed in those earlier days views of the nature      of god and man of human life and divine providence which      we now find to be untenable that we answer is precisely      what the theory of development presupposes if early views      of religion and morality had not been imperfect where had      been the development if symbolical visions and mythical      creations had found no place in the early oriental      expression of divine truth where had been the development      the sufficient answer to ninetynine out of a hundred of the      ordinary objections to the bible as the record of a divine      education of our race is asked in that one      worddevelopment and to what are we indebted for that      potent word which as with the wand of a magician has at      the same moment so completely transformed our knowledge and      dispelled our difficulties to modern science resolutely      pursuing its search for truth in spite of popular obloquy      andalas that one should have to say itin spite too      often of theological denunciation p 53  apart from its general importance i read this remarkable statement with the more pleasure since however imperfectly i may have endeavoured to illustrate the evolution of theology in a paper published in the nineteenth century last year29 it seems to me that in principle at any rate i may hereafter claim high theological sanction for the views there set forth  if theologians are henceforward prepared to recognise the authority of secular science in the manner and to the extent indicated in the manchester trilogy if the distinguished prelates who offer these terms are really plenipotentiaries then so far as i may presume to speak on such a matter there will be no difficulty about concluding a perpetual treaty of peace and indeed of alliance between the high contracting powers whose history has hitherto been little more than a record of continual warfare but if the great chancellors maxim do ut des is to form the basis of negotiation i am afraid that secular science will be ruined for it seems to me that theology under the generous impulse of a sudden conversion has given all that she hath and indeed on one point has surrendered more than can reasonably be asked  i suppose i must be prepared to face the reproach which attaches to those who criticise a gift if i venture to observe that i do not think that the bishop of manchester need have been so much alarmed as he evidently has been by the objections which have often been raised to prayer on the ground that a belief in the efficacy of prayer is inconsistent with a belief in the constancy of the order of nature  the bishop appears to admit that there is an antagonism between the regular economy of nature and the regular economy of prayer p 39 and that prayers for the interruption of gods natural order are of doubtful validity p 42 it appears to me that the bishops difficulty simply adds another example to those which i have several times insisted upon in the pages of this review and elsewhere of the mischief which has been done and is being done by a mistaken apprehension of the real meaning of natural order and law of nature  may i therefore be permitted to repeat once more that the statements denoted by these terms have no greater value or cogency than such as may attach to generalisations from experience of the past and to expectations for the future based upon that experience nobody can presume to say what the order of nature must be all that the widest experience even if it extended over all past time and through all space that events had happened in a certain way could justify would be a proportionally strong expectation that events will go on happening and the demand for a proportional strength of evidence in favour of any assertion that they had happened otherwise  it is this weighty consideration the truth of which every one who is capable of logical thought must surely admit which knocks the bottom out of all à priori objections either to ordinary miracles or to the efficacy of prayer in so far as the latter implies the miraculous intervention of a higher power no one is entitled to say à priori that any given socalled miraculous event is impossible and no one is entitled to say à priori that prayer for some change in the ordinary course of nature cannot possibly avail  the supposition that there is any inconsistency between the acceptance of the constancy of natural order and a belief in the efficacy of prayer is the more unaccountable as it is obviously contradicted by analogies furnished by everyday experience the belief in the efficacy of prayer depends upon the assumption that there is somebody somewhere who is strong enough to deal with the earth and its contents as men deal with the things and events which they are strong enough to modify or control and who is capable of being moved by appeals such as men make to one another this belief does not even involve theism for our earth is an insignificant particle of the solar system while the solar system is hardly worth speaking of in relation to the all and for anything that can be proved to the contrary there may be beings endowed with full powers over our system yet practically as insignificant as ourselves in relation to the universe if any one pleases therefore to give unrestrained liberty to his fancy he may plead analogy in favour of the dream that there may be somewhere a finite being or beings who can play with the solar system as a child plays with a toy and that such being may be willing to do anything which he is properly supplicated to do for we are not justified in saying that it is impossible for beings having the nature of men only vastly more powerful to exist and if they do exist they may act as and when we ask them to do so just as our brother men act as a matter of fact the great mass of the human race has believed and still believes in such beings under the various names of fairies gnomes angels and demons certainly i do not lack faith in the constancy of natural order but i am not less convinced that if i were to ask the bishop of manchester to do me a kindness which lay within his power he would do it and i am unable to see that his action on my request involves any violation of the order of nature on the contrary as i have not the honour to know the bishop personally my action would be based upon my faith in that law of nature or generalisation from experience which tells me that as a rule men who occupy the bishops position are kindly and courteous how is the case altered if my request is preferred to some imaginary superior being or to the most high being who by the supposition is able to arrest disease or make the sun stand still in the heavens just as easily as i can stop my watch or make it indicate any hour that pleases me  i repeat that it is not upon any à priori considerations that objections either to the supposed efficacy of prayer in modifying the course of events or to the supposed occurrence of miracles can be scientifically based the real objection and to my mind the fatal objection to both these suppositions is the inadequacy of the evidence to prove any given case of such occurrences which has been adduced it is a canon of common sense to say nothing of science that the more improbable a supposed occurrence the more cogent ought to be the evidence in its favour i have looked somewhat carefully into the subject and i am unable to find in the records of any miraculous event evidence which even approximates to the fulfilment of this requirement  but in the case of prayer the bishop points out a most just and necessary distinction between its effect on the course of nature outside ourselves and its effect within the region of the supplicators mind  it is a law of nature verifiable by everyday experience that our already formed convictions our strong desires our intent occupation with particular ideas modify our mental operations to a most marvellous extent and produce enduring changes in the direction and in the intensity of our intellectual and moral activities men can intoxicate themselves with ideas as effectually as with alcohol or with bang and produce by dint of intense thinking mental conditions hardly distinguishable from monomania demoniac possession is mythical but the faculty of being possessed more or less completely by an idea is probably the fundamental condition of what is called genius whether it show itself in the saint the artist or the man of science one calls it faith another calls it inspiration a third calls it insight but the intending of the mind to borrow newtons wellknown phrase the concentration of all the rays of intellectual energy on some one point until it glows and colours the whole cast of thought with its peculiar light is common to all  i take it that the bishop of manchester has psychological science with him when he insists upon the subjective efficacy of prayer in faith and on the seemingly miraculous effects which such intending of the mind upon religious and moral ideals may have upon character and happiness scientific faith at present takes it no further than the prayer which ajax offered but that petition is continually granted  whatever points of detail may yet remain open for discussion however i repeat the opinion i have already expressed that the manchester sermons concede all that science has an indisputable right or any pressing need to ask and that not grudgingly but generously and if the three bishops of 1887 carry the church with them i think they will have as good title to the permanent gratitude of posterity as the famous seven who went to the tower in defence of the church two hundred years ago  will their brethren follow their just and prudent guidance i have no such acquaintance with the currents of ecclesiastical opinion as would justify me in even hazarding a guess on such a difficult topic but some recent omens are hardly favourable there seems to be an impression abroadi do not desire to give any countenance to itthat i am fond of reading sermons from time to time unknown correspondentssome apparently animated by the charitable desire to promote my conversion and others unmistakably anxious to spur me to the expression of wrathful antagonismfavour me with reports or copies of such productions  i found one of the latter category among the accumulated arrears to which i have already referred  it is a full and apparently accurate report of a discourse by a person of no less ecclesiastical rank than the three authors of the sermons i have hitherto been considering but who he is and where or when the sermon was preached are secrets which wild horses shall not tear from me lest i fall again under high censure for attacking a clergyman only if the editor of this review thinks it his duty to have independent evidence that the sermon has a real existence will i in the strictest confidence communicate it to him  the preacher in this case is of a very different mind from the three bishopsand this mind is different in quality different in spirit and different in contents he discourses on the à priori objections to miracles apparently without being aware in spite of all the discussions of the last seven or eight years that he is doing battle with a shadow  i trust i do not misrepresent the bishop of manchester in saying that the essence of his remarkable discourse is the insistence upon the supreme importance of the purely spiritual in our faith and of the relative if not absolute insignificance of aught else he obviously perceives the bearing of his arguments against the alterability of the course of outward nature by prayer on the question of miracles in general for he is careful to say that the possibility of miracles of a rare and unusual transcendence of the world order is not here in question p 38 it may be permitted me to suppose however that if miracles were in question the speaker who warns us that we must look for the heart of the absolute religion in that part of it which prescribes our moral and religious relations p 46 would not be disposed to advise those who had found the heart of christianity to take much thought about its miraculous integument  my anonymous sermon will have nothing to do with such notions as these and its preacher is not too polite to say nothing of charitable towards those who entertain them       scientific men therefore are perfectly right in asserting      that christianity rests on miracles if miracles never      happened christianity in any sense which is not a mockery      which does not make the term of none effect has no reality      i dwell on this because there is now an effort making to get      up a nonmiraculous invertebrate christianity which may      escape the ban of science and i would warn you very      distinctly against this new contrivance christianity is      essentially miraculous and falls to the ground if miracles      be impossible  well warning for warning i venture to warn this preacher and those who with him persist in identifying christianity with the miraculous that such forms of christianity are not only doomed to fall to the ground but that within the last half century they have been driving that way with continually accelerated velocity  the socalled religious world is given to a strange delusion it fondly imagines that it possesses the monopoly of serious and constant reflection upon the terrible problems of existence and that those who cannot accept its shibboleths are either mere gallios caring for none of these things or libertines desiring to escape from the restraints of morality it does not appear to have entered the imaginations of these people that outside their pale and firmly resolved never to enter it there are thousands of men certainly not their inferiors in character capacity or knowledge of the questions at issue who estimate those purely spiritual elements of the christian faith of which the bishop of manchester speaks as highly as the bishop does but who will have nothing to do with the christian churches because in their apprehension and for them the profession of belief in the miraculous on the evidence offered would be simply immoral  so far as my experience goes men of science are neither better nor worse than the rest of the world occupation with the endlessly great parts of the universe does not necessarily involve greatness of character nor does microscopic study of the infinitely little always produce humility we have our full share of original sin need greed and vainglory beset us as they do other mortals and our progress is for the most part like that of a tacking ship the resultant of opposite divergencies from the straight path but for all that there is one moral benefit which the pursuit of science unquestionably bestows it keeps the estimate of the value of evidence up to the proper mark and we are constantly receiving lessons and sometimes very sharp ones on the nature of proof men of science will always act up to their standard of veracity when mankind in general leave off sinning but that standard appears to me to be higher among them than in any other class of the community  i do not know any body of scientific men who could be got to listen without the strongest expressions of disgusted repudiation to the exposition of a pretended scientific discovery which had no better evidence to show for itself than the story of the devils entering a herd of swine or of the figtree that was blasted for bearing no figs when it was not the season of figs whether such events are possible or impossible no man can say but scientific ethics can and does declare that the profession of belief in them on the evidence of documents of unknown date and of unknown authorship is immoral theological apologists who insist that morality will vanish if their dogmas are exploded would do well to consider the fact that in the matter of intellectual veracity science is already a long way ahead of the churches and that in this particular it is exerting an educational influence on mankind of which the churches have shown themselves utterly incapable  undoubtedly that varying compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of paganism and judaism moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the western world which since the second century has assumed to itself the title of orthodox christianity rests on miracles and falls to the ground not if miracles be impossible but if those to which it is committed prove themselves unable to fulfil the conditions of honest belief that this christianity is doomed to fall is to my mind beyond a doubt but its fall will be neither sudden nor speedy the church with all the aid lent it by the secular arm took many centuries to extirpate the open practice of pagan idolatry within its own fold and those who have travelled in southern europe will be aware that it has not extirpated the essence of such idolatry even yet mutato nomine it is probable that there is as much sheer fetichism among the roman populace now as there was eighteen hundred years ago and if marcus antonius could descend from his horse and ascend the steps of the ara coeli church about twelfth day the only thing that need strike him would be the extremely contemptible character of the modern idols as works of art  science will certainly neither ask for nor receive the aid of the secular arm it will trust to the much better and more powerful help of that education in scientific truth and in the morals of assent which is rendered as indispensable as it is inevitable by the permeation of practical life with the products and ideas of science but no one who considers the present state of even the most developed countries can doubt that the scientific light that has come into the world will have to shine in the midst of darkness for a long time the urban populations driven into contact with science by trade and manufacture will more and more receive it while the pagani will lag behind let us hope that no julian may arise among them to head a forlorn hope against the inevitable whatever happens science may bide her time in patience and in confidence  but to return to my anonymous i am afraid that if he represents any great party in the church the spirit of justice and reasonableness which animates the three bishops has as slender a chance of being imitated on a large scale as their common sense and their courtesy for not contented with misrepresenting science on its speculative side anonymous attacks its morality       for two whole years investigations and conclusions which      would upset the theories of darwin on the formation of coral      islands were actually suppressed and that by the advice      even of those who accepted them for fear of upsetting the      faith and disturbing the judgment formed by the multitude      on the scientific characterthe infallibilityof the great      master  so far as i know anything about the matters which are here referred to the part of this passage which i have italicised is absolutely untrue i believe that i am intimately acquainted with all mr darwins immediate scientific friends and i say that no one of them nor any other man of science known to me ever could or would have given such advice to any oneif for no other reason than that with the example of the most candid and patient listener to objections that ever lived fresh in their memories they could not so grossly have at once violated their highest duty and dishonoured their friend  the charge thus brought by anonymous affects the honour and the probity of men of science if it is true we have forfeited all claim to the confidence of the general public in my belief it is utterly false and its real effect will be to discredit those who are responsible for it as is the way with slanders it has grown by repetition anonymous is responsible for the peculiarly offensive form which it has taken in his hands but he is not responsible for originating it he has evidently been inspired by an article entitled a great lesson published in the september number of this review truly it is a great lesson but not quite in the sense intended by the giver thereof  in the course of his doubtless wellmeant admonitions the duke of argyll commits himself to a greater number of statements which are demonstrably incorrect and which any one who ventured to write upon the subject ought to have known to be incorrect than i have ever seen gathered together in so small a space  i submit a gathering from the rich store for the appreciation of the public  first       mr murrays new explanation of the structure of coralreefs      and islands was communicated to the royal society of      edinburgh in 1880 and supported with such a weight of facts      and such a close texture of reasoning that no serious reply      has ever been attempted p 305  no serious reply has ever been attempted i suppose that the duke of argyll may have heard of professor dana whose years of labour devoted to corals and coralreefs when he was naturalist of the american expedition under commodore wilkes more than forty years ago have ever since caused him to be recognised as an authority of the first rank on such subjects now does his grace know or does he not know that in the year 1885 professor dana published an elaborate paper on the origin of coralreefs and islands in which after referring to a presidential address by the director of the geological survey of great britain and ireland delivered in 1883 in which special attention is directed to mr murrays views professor dana says       the existing state of doubt on the question has led the      writer to reconsider the earlier and later facts and in the      following pages he gives his results  professor dana then devotes many pages of his very serious reply to a most admirable and weighty criticism of the objections which have at various times been raised to mr darwins doctrine by professor semper by dr rein and finally by mr murray and he states his final judgment as follows       with the theory of abrasion and solution incompetent all      the hypotheses of objectors to darwins theory are alike      weak for all have made these processes their chief      reliance whether appealing to a calcareous or a volcanic      or a mountainpeak basement for the structure the      subsidence which the darwinian theory requires has not been      opposed by the mention of any fact at variance with it nor      by setting aside darwins arguments in its favour and it      has found new support in the facts from the challengers      soundings off tahiti that had been put in array against it      and strong corroboration in the facts from the west indies       darwins theory therefore remains as the theory that      accounts for the origin of reefs and islands30  be it understood that i express no opinion on the controverted points i doubt if there are ten living men who having a practical knowledge of what a coralreef is have endeavoured to master the very difficult biological and geological problems involved in their study i happen to have spent the best part of three years among coralreefs and to have made that attempt and when mr murrays work appeared i said to myself that until i had two or three months to give to the renewed study of the subject in all its bearings i must be content to remain in a condition of suspended judgment in the meanwhile the man who would be voted by common acclamation as the most competent person now living to act as umpire has delivered the verdict i have quoted and to go no further has fully justified the hesitation i and others may have felt about expressing an opinion under these circumstances it seems to me to require a good deal of courage to say no serious reply has ever been attempted and to chide the men of science in lofty tones for their reluctance to admit an error which is not admitted and for their slow and sulky acquiescence in a conclusion which they have the gravest warranty for suspecting  second       darwin himself had lived to hear of the new solution and      with that splendid candour which was eminent in him his      mind though now grown old in his own early convictions was      at least ready to entertain it and to confess that serious      doubts had been awakened as to the truth of his famous      theory p 305  i wish that darwins splendid candour could be conveyed by some description of spiritual microbe to those who write about him i am not aware that mr darwin ever entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his famous theory and there is tolerably good evidence to the contrary the second edition of his work published in 1876 proves that he entertained no such doubts then a letter to professor semper whose objections in some respects forestalled those of mr murray dated october 2 1879 expresses his continued adherence to the opinion that the atolls and barrier reefs in the middle of the pacific and indian oceans indicate subsidence and the letter of my friend professor judd printed at the end of this article which i had perhaps better say professor judd had not seen will prove that this opinion remained unaltered to the end of his life  third        darwins theory is a dream it is not only unsound but      it is in many respects the reverse of truth with all his      conscientiousness with all his caution with all his powers      of observation darwin in this matter fell into errors as      profound as the abysses of the pacific p 301  really it seems to me that under the circumstances it is pretty clear that these lines exhibit a lack of the qualities justly ascribed to mr darwin which plunges their author into a much deeper abyss and one from which there is no hope of emergence  fourth       all the acclamations with which it was received were as the      shouts of an ignorant mob p 301  but surely it should be added that the coryphæus of this ignorant mob the fugleman of the shouts was one of the most accomplished naturalists and geologists now livingthe american danawho after years of independent study extending over numerous reefs in the pacific gave his hearty assent to darwins views and after all that had been said deliberately reaffirmed that assent in the year 1885  fifth       the overthrow of darwins speculation is only beginning to      be known it has been whispered for some time the cherished      dogma has been dropping very slowly out of sight p 301  darwins speculation may be right or wrong but i submit that that which has not happened cannot even begin to be known except by those who have miraculous gifts to which we poor scientific people do not aspire the overthrow of darwins views may have been whispered by those who hoped for it and they were perhaps wise in not raising their voices above a whisper incorrect statements if made too loudly are apt to bring about unpleasant consequences  sixth  mr murrays views published in 1880 are said to have met with slow and sulky acquiescence p 305 i have proved that they cannot be said to have met with general acquiescence of any sort whether quick and cheerful or slow and sulky and if this assertion is meant to convey the impression that mr murrays views have been ignored that there has been a conspiracy of silence against them it is utterly contrary to notorious fact  professor geikies wellknown textbook of geology was published in 1882 and at pages 457459 of that work there is a careful exposition of mr murrays views moreover professor geikie has specially advocated them on other occasions31 notably in a long article on the origin of coralreefs published in two numbers of nature for 1883 and in a presidential address delivered in the same year if in so short a time after the publication of his views mr murray could boast of a convert so distinguished and influential as the director of the geological survey it seems to me that this wonderful conspiration de silence which has about as much real existence as the duke of argylls other bogie the reign of terror  must have ipso facto collapsed i wish that when i was a young man my endeavours to upset some prevalent errors had met with as speedy and effectual backing  seventh        mr john murray was strongly advised against the      publication of his views in derogation of darwins      longaccepted theory of the coral islands and was actually      induced to delay it for two years yet the late sir wyville      thomson who was at the head of the naturalists of the      challenger expedition was himself convinced by mr      murrays reasoning p 307  clearly then it could not be mr murrays official chief who gave him this advice who was it and what was the exact nature of the advice given until we have some precise information on this head i shall take leave to doubt whether this statement is more accurate than those which i have previously cited  whether such advice was wise or foolish just or immoral depends entirely on the motive of the person who gave it if he meant to suggest to mr murray that it might be wise for a young and comparatively unknown man to walk warily when he proposed to attack a generalisation based on many years labour of one undoubtedly competent person and fortified by the independent results of the many years labour of another undoubtedly competent person and even if necessary to take two whole years in fortifying his position i think that such advice would have been sagacious and kind i suppose that there are few working men of science who have not kept their ideas to themselves while gathering and sifting evidence for a much longer period than two years  if on the other hand mr murray was advised to delay the publication of his criticisms simply to save mr darwins credit and to preserve some reputation for infallibility which no one ever heard of then i have no hesitation in declaring that his adviser was profoundly dishonest as well as extremely foolish and that if he is a man of science he has disgraced his calling  but after all this supposed scientific achitophel has not yet made good the primary fact of his existence until the needful proof is forthcoming i think i am justified in suspending my judgment as to whether he is much more than an antiscientific myth i leave it to the duke of argyll to judge of the extent of the obligation under which for his own sake he may lie to produce the evidence on which his aspersions of the honour of scientific men are based i cannot pretend that we are seriously disturbed by charges which every one who is acquainted with the truth of the matter knows to be ridiculous but mud has a habit of staining if it lies too long and it is as well to have it brushed off as soon as may be  so much for the great lesson it is followed by a little lesson apparently directed against my infallibilitya doctrine about which i should be inclined to paraphrase wilkess remark to george the third when he declared that he at any rate was not a wilkite but i really should be glad to think that there are people who need the warning because then it will be obvious that this raking up of an old story cannot have been suggested by a mere fanatical desire to damage men of science i can but rejoice then that these misguided enthusiasts whose faith in me has so far exceeded the bounds of reason should be set right but that want of finish in the matter of accuracy which so terribly mars the effect of the great lesson is no less conspicuous in the case of the little lesson and instead of setting my too fervent disciples right it will set them wrong  the duke of argyll in telling the story of bathybius says that my mind was caught by this new and grand generalisation of the physical basis of life i never have been guilty of a reclamation about anything to my credit and i do not mean to be but if there is any blame going i do not choose to be relegated to a subordinate place when i have a claim to the first the responsibility for the first description and the naming of bathybius is mine and mine only the paper on some organisms living at great depths in the atlantic ocean in which i drew attention to this substance is to be found by the curious in the eighth volume of the quarterly journal of microscopical science and was published in the year 1868 whatever errors are contained in that paper are my own peculiar property but neither at the meeting of the british association in 1868 nor anywhere else have i gone beyond what is there stated except in so far that at a longsubsequent meeting of the association being importuned about the subject i ventured to express somewhat emphatically the wish that the thing was at the bottom of the sea  what is meant by my being caught by a generalisation about the physical basis of life i do not know still less can i understand the assertion that bathybius was accepted because of its supposed harmony with darwins speculations that which interested me in the matter was the apparent analogy of bathybius with other wellknown forms of lower life such as the plasmodia of the myxomycetes and the rhizopods speculative hopes or fears had nothing to do with the matter and if bathybius were brought up alive from the bottom of the atlantic tomorrow the fact would not have the slightest bearing that i can discern upon mr darwins speculations or upon any of the disputed problems of biology it would merely be one elementary organism the more added to the thousands already known  up to this moment i was not aware of the universal favour with which bathybius was received32 those simulators of an ignorant mob who according to the duke of argyll welcomed darwins theory of coralreefs made no demonstration in my favour unless his grace includes sir wyville thomson dr carpenter dr bessels and professor haeckel under that head on the contrary a sagacious friend of mine than whom there was no more competent judge the late mr george busk was not to be converted while long before the challenger work ehrenberg wrote to me very sceptically and i fully expected that that eminent man would favour me with pretty sharp criticism unfortunately he died shortly afterwards and nothing from him that i know of appeared when sir wyville thomson wrote to me a brief account of the results obtained on board the challenger i sent this statement to nature in which journal it appeared the following week without any further note or comment than was needful to explain the circumstances in thus allowing judgment to go by default i am afraid i showed a reckless and ungracious disregard for the feelings of the believers in my infallibility no doubt i ought to have hedged and fenced and attenuated the effect of sir wyville thomsons brief note in every possible way or perhaps i ought to have suppressed the note altogether on the ground that it was a mere ex parte statement my excuse is that notwithstanding a large and abiding faith in human folly i did not know then any more than i know now that there was anybody foolish enough to be unaware that the only people scientific or other who never make mistakes are those who do nothing or that anybody for whose opinion i cared would not rather see me commit ten blunders than try to hide one  pending the production of further evidence i hold that the existence of people who believe in the infallibility of men of science is as purely mythical as that of the evil counsellor who advised the withholding of the truth lest it should conflict with that belief  i venture to think then that the duke of argyll might have spared his little lesson as well as his great lesson with advantage the paternal authority who whips the child for sins he has not committed does not strengthen his moral influencerather excites contempt and repugnance and if as would seem from this and former monitory allocutions which have been addressed to us the duke aspires to the position of censor or spiritual director in relation to the men who are doing the work of physical science he really must get up his facts better there will be an end to all chance of our kissing the rod if his grace goes wrong a third time he must not say again that no serious reply has been attempted to a view which was discussed and repudiated two years before by one of the highest extant authorities on the subject he must not say that darwin accepted that which it can be proved he did not accept he must not say that a doctrine has dropped into the abyss when it is quite obviously alive and kicking at the surface he must not assimilate a man like professor dana to the components of an ignorant mob he must not say that things are beginning to be known which are not known at all he must not say that slow and sulky acquiescence has been given to that which cannot yet boast of general acquiescence of any kind he must not suggest that a view which has been publicly advocated by the director of the geological survey and no less publicly discussed by many other authoritative writers has been intentionally and systematically ignored he must not ascribe ill motives for a course of action which is the only proper one and finally if any one but myself were interested i should say that he had better not waste his time in raking up the errors of those whose lives have been occupied not in talking about science but in toiling sometimes with success and sometimes with failure to get some real work done  the most considerable difference i note among men is not in their readiness to fall into error but in their readiness to acknowledge these inevitable lapses the duke of argyll has now a splendid opportunity for proving to the world in which of these categories it is hereafter to rank him                                       dear professor huxleya short time before mr darwins death i had a conversation with him concerning the observations which had been made by mr murray upon coralreefs and the speculations which had been founded upon those observations i found that mr darwin had very carefully considered the whole subject and that while on the one hand he did not regard the actual facts recorded by mr murray as absolutely inconsistent with his own theory of subsidence on the other hand he did not believe that they necessitated or supported the hypothesis advanced by mr murray mr darwins attitude as i understood it towards mr murrays objections to the theory of subsidence was exactly similar to that maintained by him with respect to professor sempers criticism which was of a very similar character and his position with regard to the whole question was almost identical with that subsequently so clearly defined by professor dana in his wellknown articles published in the american journal of science for 1885  it is difficult to imagine how any one acquainted with the scientific literature of the last seven years could possibly suggest that mr murrays memoir published in 1880 had failed to secure a due amount of attention mr murray by his position in the challenger office occupied an exceptionally favourable position for making his views widely known and he had moreover the singular good fortune to secure from the first the advocacy of so able and brilliant a writer as professor archibald geikie who in a special discourse and in several treatises on geology and physical geology very strongly supported the new theory it would be an endless task to attempt to give references to the various scientific journals which have discussed the subject but i may add that every treatise on geology which has been published since mr murrays views were made known has dealt with his observations at considerable length this is true of professor ah greens physical geology published in 1882 of professor prestwichs geology chemical and physical and of professor james geikies outlines of geology published in 1886 similar prominence is given to the subject in de lapparents traité de géologie published in 1885 and in credners elemente der geologie which has appeared during the present year if this be a conspiracy of silence where alas can the geological speculator seek for fameyours very truly john w judd  october 10 1887  footnotes       28 the advance of science three sermons preached in           manchester cathedral on sunday september 4 1887           during the meeting of the british association for the           advancement of science by the

geikie however though a strong is a fair           and candid advocate he says of darwins theory that           it may be possibly true in some instances may be           readily granted for professor geikie then it is not           yet overthrownstill less a dream       32 i find moreover that i specially warned my readers           against hasty judgment after stating the facts of           observation i add i have hitherto said nothing           about their meaning as in an inquiry so difficult and           fraught with interest as this it seems to me to be in           the highest degree important to keep the questions of           fact and the questions of interpretation well apart           p 210     v the value of witness to the miraculous  1889   charles or more properly karl king of the franks consecrated roman emperor in st peters on christmas day ad 800 and known to posterity as the great chiefly by his agglutinative gallicised denomination of charlemagne was a man great in all ways physically and mentally within a couple of centuries after his death charlemagne became the centre of innumerable legends and the mythmaking process does not seem to have been sensibly interfered with by the existence of sober and truthful histories of the emperor and of the times which immediately preceded and followed his reign by a contemporary writer who occupied a high and confidential position in his court and in that of his successor this was one eginhard or einhard who appears to have been born about ad 770 and spent his youth at the court being educated along with charless sons there is excellent contemporary testimony not only to eginhards existence but to his abilities and to the place which he occupied in the circle of the intimate friends of the great ruler whose life he subsequently wrote in fact there is as good evidence of eginhards existence of his official position and of his being the author of the chief works attributed to him as can reasonably be expected in the case of a man who lived more than a thousand years ago and was neither a great king nor a great warrior the works are1 the life of the emperor karl 2 the annals of the franks 3 letters 4 the history of the translation of the blessed martyrs of christ ss marcellinus and petrus  it is to the last as one of the most singular and interesting records of the period during which the roman world passed into that of the middle ages that i wish to direct attention33 it was written in the ninth century somewhere apparently about the year 830 when eginhard ailing in health and weary of political life had withdrawn to the monastery of seligenstadt of which he was the founder a manuscript copy of the work made in the tenth century and once the property of the monastery of st bavon on the scheldt of which eginhard was abbot is still extant and there is no reason to believe that in this copy the original has been in any way interpolated or otherwise tampered with the main features of the strange story contained in the historia translationis are set forth in the following pages in which in regard to all matters of importance i shall adhere as closely as possible to eginhards own words       while i was still at court busied with secular affairs i      often thought of the leisure which i hoped one day to enjoy      in a solitary place far away from the crowd with which the      liberality of prince louis whom i then served had provided      me this place is situated in that part of germany which      lies between the neckar and the maine34 and is nowadays      called the odenwald by those who live in and about it and      here having built according to my capacity and resources      not only houses and permanent dwellings but also a basilica      fitted for the performance of divine service and of no mean      style of construction i began to think to what saint or      martyr i could best dedicate it a good deal of time had      passed while my thoughts fluctuated about this matter when      it happened that a certain deacon of the roman church named      deusdona arrived at the court for the purpose of seeking      the favour of the king in some affairs in which he was      interested he remained some time and then having      transacted his business he was about to return to rome      when one day moved by courtesy to a stranger we invited      him to a modest refection and while talking of many things      at table mention was made of the translation of the body of      the blessed sebastian35 and of the neglected tombs of      the martyrs of which there is such a prodigious number at      rome and the conversation having turned towards the      dedication of our new basilica i began to inquire how it      might be possible for me to obtain some of the true relics      of the saints which rest at rome he at first hesitated and      declared that he did not know how that could be done but      observing that i was both anxious and curious about the      subject he promised to give me an answer some other day       when i returned to the question some time afterwards he      immediately drew from his bosom a paper which he begged me      to read when i was alone and to tell him what i was      disposed to think of that which was therein stated i took      the paper and as he desired read it alone and in secret      cap i 2 3  i shall have occasion to return to deacon deusdonas conditions and to what happened after eginhards acceptance of them suffice it for the present to say that eginhards notary ratleicus ratleig was despatched to rome and succeeded in securing two bodies supposed to be those of the holy martyrs marcellinus and petrus and when he had got as far on his homeward journey as the burgundian town of solothurn or soleure36 notary ratleig despatched to his master at st bavon a letter announcing the success of his mission       as soon as by reading it i was assured of the arrival of the      saints i despatched a confidential messenger to maestricht      to gather together priests other clerics and also laymen      to go out to meet the coming saints as speedily as possible      and he and his companions having lost no time after a few      days met those who had charge of the saints at solothurn      joined with them and with a vast crowd of people who      gathered from all parts singing hymns and amidst great and      universal rejoicings they travelled quickly to the city of      argentoratum which is now called strasburg thence      embarking on the rhine they came to the place called      portus37 and landing on the east bank of the river at      the fifth station thence they arrived at michilinstadt38      accompanied by an immense multitude praising god this      place is in that forest of germany which in modern times is      called the odenwald and about six leagues from the maine      and here having found a basilica recently built by me but      not yet consecrated they carried the sacred remains into it      and deposited them therein as if it were to be their final      restingplace as soon as all this was reported to me i      travelled thither as quickly as i could cap ii 14  three days after eginhards arrival began the series of wonderful events which he narrates and for which we have his personal guarantee the first thing that he notices is the dream of a servant of ratleig the notary who being set to watch the holy relics in the church after vespers went to sleep and during his slumbers had a vision of two pigeons one white and one gray and white which came and sat upon the bier over the relics while at the same time a voice ordered the man to tell his master that the holy martyrs had chosen another restingplace and desired to be transported thither without delay  unfortunately the saints seem to have forgotten to mention where they wished to go and with the most anxious desire to gratify their smallest wishes eginhard was naturally greatly perplexed what to do while in this state of mind he was one day contemplating his great and wonderful treasure more precious than all the gold in the world when it struck him that the chest in which the relics were contained was quite unworthy of its contents and after vespers he gave orders to one of the sacristans to take the measure of the chest in order that a more fitting shrine might be constructed the man having lighted a wax candle and raised the pall which covered the relics in order to carry out his masters orders was astonished and terrified to observe that the chest was covered with a bloodlike exudation loculum mirum in modum humore sanguineo undique distillantem and at once sent a message to eginhard       then i and those priests who accompanied me beheld this      stupendous miracle worthy of all admiration for just as      when it is going to rain pillars and slabs and marble      images exude moisture and as it were sweat so the chest      which contained the most sacred relics was found moist with      the blood exuding on all sides cap ii 16  three days fast was ordained in order that the meaning of the portent might be ascertained all that happened however was that at the end of that time the blood which had been exuding in drops all the while dried up eginhard is careful to say that the liquid had a saline taste something like that of tears and was thin as water though of the colour of true blood and he clearly thinks this satisfactory evidence that it was blood  the same night another servant had a vision in which still more imperative orders for the removal of the relics were given and from that time forth not a single night passed without one two or even three of our companions receiving revelations in dreams that the bodies of the saints were to be transferred from that place to another at last a priest hildfrid saw in a dream a venerable whitehaired man in a priests vestments who bitterly reproached eginhard for not obeying the repeated orders of the saints and upon this the journey was commenced why eginhard delayed obedience to these repeated visions so long does not appear he does not say so in so many words but the general tenor of the narrative leads one to suppose that mulinheim afterwards seligenstadt is the solitary place in which he had built the church which awaited dedication in that case all the people about him would know that he desired that the saints should go there if a glimmering of secular sense led him to be a little suspicious about the real cause of the unanimity of the visionary beings who manifested themselves to his entourage in favour of moving on he does not say so  at the end of the first days journey the precious relics were deposited in the church of st martin in the village of ostheim hither a paralytic nun sanctimonialis quædam paralytica of the name of ruodlang was brought in a car by her friends and relatives from a monastery a league off she spent the night watching and praying by the bier of the saints and health returning to all her members on the morrow she went back to her place whence she came on her feet nobody supporting her or in any way giving her assistance cap ii 19  on the second day the relics were carried to upper mulinheim and finally in accordance with the orders of the martyrs deposited in the church of that place which was therefore renamed seligenstadt here daniel a beggar boy of fifteen and so bent that he could not look at the sky without lying on his back collapsed and fell down during the celebration of the mass thus he lay a long time as if asleep and all his limbs straightening and his flesh strengthening recepta firmitate nervorum he arose before our eyes quite well cap ii 20  some time afterwards an old man entered the church on his hands and knees being unable to use his limbs properly       he in presence of all of us by the power of god and the      merits of the blessed martyrs in the same hour in which he      entered was so perfectly cured that he walked without so      much as a stick and he said that though he had been deaf      for five years his deafness had ceased along with the      palsy cap iii 33  eginhard was now obliged to return to the court at aixlachapelle where his duties kept him through the winter and he is careful to point out that the later miracles which he proceeds to speak of are known to him only at second hand but as he naturally observes having seen such wonderful events with his own eyes why should he doubt similar narrations when they are received from trustworthy sources  wonderful stories these are indeed but as they are for the most part of the same general character as those already recounted they may be passed over there is however an account of a possessed maiden which is worth attention this is set forth in a memoir the principal contents of which are the speeches of a demon who declared himself to possess the singular appellation of wiggo and revealed himself in the presence of many witnesses before the altar close to the relics of the blessed martyrs it is noteworthy that the revelations appear to have been made in the shape of replies to the questions of the exorcising priest and there is no means of judging how far the answers are really only the questions to which the patient replied yes or no  the possessed girl about sixteen years of age was brought by her parents to the basilica of the martyrs       when she approached the tomb containing the sacred bodies      the priest according to custom read the formula of      exorcism over her head when he began to ask how and when      the demon had entered her she answered not in the tongue      of the barbarians which alone the girl knew but in the      roman tongue and when the priest was astonished and asked      how she came to know latin when her parents who stood by      were wholly ignorant of it thou hast never seen my      parents was the reply to this the priest whence art      thou then if these are not thy parents and the demon by      the mouth of the girl i am a follower and disciple of      satan and for a long time i was gatekeeper janitor in      hell but for some years along with eleven companions i      have ravaged the kingdom of the franks cap v 49  he then goes on to tell how they blasted the crops and scattered pestilence among beasts and men because of the prevalent wickedness of the people39  the enumeration of all these iniquities in oratorical style takes up a whole octavo page and at the end it is stated all these things the demon spoke in latin by the mouth of the girl       and when the priest imperatively ordered him to come out i      shall go said he not in obedience to you but on account      of the power of the saints who do not allow me to remain      any longer and having said this he threw the girl down on      the floor and there compelled her to lie prostrate for a      time as though she slumbered after a little while      however he going away the girl by the power of christ and      the merits of the blessed martyrs as it were awaking from      sleep rose up quite well to the astonishment of all      present nor after the demon had gone out was she able to      speak latin so that it was plain enough that it was not she      who had spoken in that tongue but the demon by her mouth      cap v 51  if the historia translationis contained nothing more than has been laid before the reader up to this time disbelief in the miracles of which it gives so precise and full a record might well be regarded as hyperscepticism it might fairly be said here you have a man whose high character acute intelligence and large instruction are certified by eminent contemporaries a man who stood high in the confidence of one of the greatest rulers of any age and whose other works prove him to be an accurate and judicious narrator of ordinary events this man tells you in language which bears the stamp of sincerity of things which happened within his own knowledge or within that of persons in whose veracity he has entire confidence while he appeals to his sovereign and the court as witnesses of others what possible ground can there be for disbelieving him  well it is hard upon eginhard to say so but it is exactly the honesty and sincerity of the man which are his undoing as a witness to the miraculous he himself makes it quite obvious that when his profound piety comes on the stage his good sense and even his perception of right and wrong make their exit let us go back to the point at which we left him secretly perusing the letter of deacon deusdona as he tells us its contents were       that he the deacon had many relics of saints at home and      that he would give them to me if i would furnish him with      the means of returning to rome he had observed that i had      two mules and if i would let him have one of them and would      despatch with him a confidential servant to take charge of      the relics he would at once send them to me this plausibly      expressed proposition pleased me and i made up my mind to      test the value of the somewhat ambiguous promise at      once40 so giving him the mule and money for his journey i      ordered my notary ratleig who already desired to go to rome      to offer his devotions there to go with him therefore      having left aixlachapelle where the emperor and his court      resided at the time they came to soissons here they spoke      with hildoin abbot of the monastery of st medardus      because the said deacon had assured him that he had the      means of placing in his possession the body of the blessed      tiburtius the martyr attracted by which promises he      hildoin sent with them a certain priest hunus by name a      sharp man hominem callidum whom he ordered to receive      and bring back the body of the martyr in question and so      resuming their journey they proceeded to rome as fast as      they could cap i 3  unfortunately a servant of the notary one reginbald fell ill of a tertian fever and impeded the progress of the party however this piece of adversity had its sweet uses for three days before they reached rome reginbald had a vision somebody habited as a deacon appeared to him and asked why his master was in such a hurry to get to rome and when reginbald explained their business this visionary deacon who seems to have taken the measure of his brother in the flesh with some accuracy told him not by any means to expect that deusdona would fulfil his promises moreover taking the servant by the hand he led him to the top of a high mountain and showing him rome where the man had never been pointed out a church adding tell ratleig the thing he wants is hidden there let him get it as quickly as he can and go back to his master by way of a sign that the order was authoritative the servant was promised that from that time forth his fever should disappear and as the fever did vanish to return no more the faith of eginhards people in deacon deusdona naturally vanished with it et fidem diaconi promissis non haberent nevertheless they put up at the deacons house near st peter ad vincula but time went on and no relics made their appearance while the notary and the priest were put off with all sorts of excusesthe brother to whom the relics had been confided was gone to beneventum and not expected back for some time and so onuntil ratleig and hunus began to despair and were minded to return infecto negotio       but my notary calling to mind his servants dream proposed      to his companion that they should go to the cemetery which      their host had talked about without him so having found      and hired a guide they went in the first place to the      basilica of the blessed tiburtius in the via labicana about      three thousand paces fron the town and cautiously and      carefully inspected the tomb of that martyr in order to      discover whether it could be opened without any one being      the wiser then they descended into the adjoining crypt in      which the bodies of the blessed martyrs of christ      marcellinus and petrus were buried and having made out      the nature of their tomb they went away thinking their host      would not know what they had been about but things fell out      differently from what they had imagined cap i 7  in fact deacon deusdona who doubtless kept an eye on his guests knew all about their manoeuvres and made haste to offer his services in order that with the help of god si deus votis eorum favere dignaretur they should all work together the deacon was evidently alarmed lest they should succeed without his help  so by way of preparation for the contemplated vol avec effraction they fasted three days and then at night without being seen they betook themselves to the basilica of st tiburtius and tried to break open the altar erected over his remains but the marble proving too solid they descended to the crypt and having evoked our lord jesus christ and adored the holy martyrs they proceeded to prise off the stone which covered the tomb and thereby exposed the body of the most sacred martyr marcellinus whose head rested on a marble tablet on which his name was inscribed the body was taken up with the greatest veneration wrapped in a rich covering and given over to the keeping of the deacon and his brother lunison while the stone was replaced with such care that no sign of the theft remained  as sacrilegious proceedings of this kind were punishable with death by the roman law it seems not unnatural that deacon deusdona should have become uneasy and have urged ratleig to be satisfied with what he had got and be off with his spoils but the notary having thus cleverly captured the blessed marcellinus thought it a pity he should be parted from the blessed petrus side by side with whom he had rested for five hundred years and more in the same sepulchre as eginhard pathetically observes and the pious man could neither eat drink nor sleep until he had compassed his desire to reunite the saintly colleagues this time apparently in consequence of deusdonas opposition to any further resurrectionist doings he took counsel with a greek monk one basil and accompanied by hunus but saying nothing to deusdona they committed another sacrilegious burglary securing this time not only the body of the blessed petrus but a quantity of dust which they agreed the priest should take and tell his employer that it was the remains of the blessed tiburtius how deusdona was squared and what he got for his not very valuable complicity in these transactions does not appear but at last the relics were sent off in charge of lunison the brother of deusdona and the priest hunus as far as pavia while ratleig stopped behind for a week to see if the robbery was discovered and presumably to act as a blind if any hue and cry was raised but as everything remained quiet the notary betook himself to pavia where he found lunison and hunus awaiting his arrival the notarys opinion of the character of his worthy colleagues however may be gathered from the fact that having persuaded them to set out in advance along the road which he told them he was about to take he immediately adopted another route and travelling by way of st maurice and the lake of geneva eventually reached soleure  eginhard tells all this story with the most naive air of unconsciousness that there is anything remarkable about an abbot and a high officer of state to boot being an accessory both before and after the fact to a most gross and scandalous act of sacrilegious and burglarious robbery and an amusing sequel to the story proves that where relics were concerned his friend hildoin another high ecclesiastical dignitary was even less scrupulous than himself  on going to the palace early one morning after the saints were safely bestowed at seligenstadt he found hildoin waiting for an audience in the emperors antechamber and began to talk to him about the miracle of the bloody exudation in the course of conversation eginhard happened to allude to the remarkable fineness of the garment of the blessed marcellinus whereupon abbot hildoin observed to eginhards stupefaction that his observation was quite correct much astonished at this remark from a person who was supposed not to have seen the relics eginhard asked him how he knew that upon this hildoin saw that he had better make a clean breast of it and he told the following story which he had received from his priestly agent hunus while hunus and lunison were at pavia waiting for eginhards notary hunus according to his own account had robbed the robbers the relics were placed in a church and a number of laymen and clerics of whom hunus was one undertook to keep watch over them one night however all the watchers save the wideawake hunus went to sleep and then according to the story which this sharp ecclesiastic foisted upon his patron       it was borne in upon his mind that there must be some great      reason why all the people except himself had suddenly      become somnolent and determining to avail himself of the      opportunity thus offered oblata occasione utendum he      rose and having lighted a candle silently approached the      chests then having burnt through the threads of the seals      with the flame of the candle he quickly opened the chests      which had no locks41 and taking out portions of each of      the bodies which were thus exposed he closed the chests      and connected the burnt ends of the threads with the seals      again so that they appeared not to have been touched and      no one having seen him he returned to his place cap iii      23  hildoin went on to tell eginhard that hunus at first declared to him that these purloined relics belonged to st tiburtius but afterwards confessed as a great secret how he had come by them and he wound up his discourse thus       they have a place of honour beside st medardus where they      are worshipped with great veneration by all the people but      whether we may keep them or not is for your judgment cap      iii 23  poor eginhard was thrown into a state of great perturbation of mind by this revelation an acquaintance of his had recently told him of a rumour that was spread about that hunus had contrived to abstract all the remains of ss marcellinus and petrus while eginhards agents were in a drunken sleep and that while the real relics were in abbot hildoins hands at st medardus the shrine at seligenstadt contained nothing but a little dust though greatly annoyed by this execrable rumour spread everywhere by the subtlety of the devil eginhard had doubtless comforted himself by his supposed knowledge of its falsity and he only now discovered how considerable a foundation there was for the scandal there was nothing for it but to insist upon the return of the stolen treasures one would have thought that the holy man who had admitted himself to be knowingly a receiver of stolen goods would have made instant restitution and begged only for absolution but eginhard intimates that he had very great difficulty in getting his brother abbot to see that even restitution was necessary  hildoins proceedings were not of such a nature as to lead any one to place implicit confidence in anything he might say still less had his agent priest hunus established much claim to confidence and it is not surprising that eginhard should have lost no time in summoning his notary and lunison to his presence in order that he might hear what they had to say about the business they however at once protested that priest hunuss story was a parcel of lies and that after the relics left rome no one had any opportunity of meddling with them moreover lunison throwing himself at eginhards feet confessed with many tears what actually took place it will be remembered that after the body of st marcellinus was abstracted from its tomb ratleig deposited it in the house of deusdona in charge of the latters brother lunison but hunus being very much disappointed that he could not get hold of the body of st tiburtius and afraid to go back to his abbot emptyhanded bribed lunison with four pieces of gold and five of silver to give him access to the chest this lunison did and hunus helped himself to as much as would fill a gallon measure vas sextarii mensuram of the sacred remains eginhards indignation at the rapine of this nequissimus nebulo is exquisitely droll it would appear that the adage about the receiver being as bad as the thief was not current in the ninth century  let us now briefly sum up the history of the acquisition of the relics eginhard makes a contract with deusdona for the delivery of certain relics which the latter says he possesses eginhard makes no inquiry how he came by them otherwise the transaction is innocent enough  deusdona turns out to be a swindler and has no relics thereupon eginhards agent after due fasting and prayer breaks open the tombs and helps himself  eginhard discovers by the selfbetrayal of his brother abbot hildoin that portions of his relics have been stolen and conveyed to the latter with much ado he succeeds in getting them back  hildoins agent hunus in delivering these stolen goods to him at first declared they were the relics of st tiburtius which hildoin desired him to obtain but afterwards invented a story of their being the product of a theft which the providential drowsiness of his companions enabled him to perpetrate from the relics which hildoin well knew were the property of his friend  lunison on the contrary swears that all his story is false and that he himself was bribed by hunus to allow him to steal what he pleased from the property confided to his own and his brothers care by their guest ratleig and the honest notary himself seems to have no hesitation about lying and stealing to any extent where the acquisition of relics is the object in view  for a parallel to these transactions one must read a police report of the doings of a long firm or of a set of horsecoupers yet eginhard seems to be aware of nothing but that he has been rather badly used by his friend hildoin and the nequissimus nebulo hunus  it is not easy for a modern protestant still less for any one who has the least tincture of scientific culture whether physical or historical to picture to himself the state of mind of a man of the ninth century however cultivated enlightened and sincere he may have been his deepest convictions his most cherished hopes were bound up with the belief in the miraculous life was a constant battle between saints and demons for the possession of the souls of men the most superstitious among our modern countrymen turn to supernatural agencies only when natural causes seem insufficient to eginhard and his friends the supernatural was the rule and the sufficiency of natural causes was allowed only when there was nothing to suggest others  moreover it must be recollected that the possession of miracleworking relics was greatly coveted not only on high but on very low grounds to a man like eginhard the mere satisfaction of the religious sentiment was obviously a powerful attraction but more than this the possession of such a treasure was an immense practical advantage if the saints were duly flattered and worshipped there was no telling what benefits might result from their interposition on your behalf for physical evils access to the shrine was like the grant of the use of a universal pill and ointment manufactory and pilgrimages thereto might suffice to cleanse the performers from any amount of sin a letter to lupus subsequently abbot of ferrara written while eginhard was smarting under the grief caused by the loss of his muchloved wife imma affords a striking insight into the current view of the relation between the glorified saints and their worshippers the writer shows that he is anything but satisfied with the way in which he has been treated by the blessed martyrs whose remains he has taken such pains to convey to seligenstadt and to honour there as they would never have been honoured in their roman obscurity       it is an aggravation of my grief and a reopening of my      wound that our vows have been of no avail and that the      faith which we placed in the merits and intervention of the      martyrs has been utterly disappointed  we may admit then without impeachment of eginhards sincerity or of his honour under all ordinary circumstances that when piety selfinterest the glory of the church in general and that of the church at seligenstadt in particular all pulled one way even the workaday principles of morality were disregarded and a fortiori anything like proper investigation of the reality of alleged miracles was thrown to the winds  and if this was the condition of mind of such a man as eginhard what is it not legitimate to suppose may have been that of deacon deusdona lunison hunus and company thieves and cheats by their own confession or of the probably hysterical nun or of the professional beggars for whose incapacity to walk and straighten themselves there is no guarantee but their own who is to make sure that the exorcist of the demon wiggo was not just such another priest as hunus and is it not at least possible when eginhards servants dreamed night after night in such a curiously coincident fashion that a careful inquirer might have found they were very anxious to please their master  quite apart from deliberate and conscious fraud which is a rarer thing than is often supposed people whose mythopoeic faculty is once stirred are capable of saying the thing that is not and of acting as they should not to an extent which is hardly imaginable by persons who are not so easily affected by the contagion of blind faith there is no falsity so gross that honest men and still more virtuous women anxious to promote a good cause will not lend themselves to it without any clear consciousness of the moral bearings of what they are doing  the cases of miraculouslyeffected cures of which eginhard is ocular witness appear to belong to classes of disease in which malingering is possible or hysteria presumable without modern means of diagnosis the names given to them are quite worthless one miracle however in which the patient a woman was cured by the mere sight of the church in which the relics of the blessed martyrs lay is an unmistakable case of dislocation of the lower jaw and it is obvious that as not unfrequently happens in such accidents in weakly subjects the jaws slipped suddenly back into place perhaps in consequence of a jolt as the woman rode towards the church cap v 5342  there is also a good deal said about a very questionable blind manone albricus alberichwho having been cured not of his blindness but of another disease under which he laboured took up his quarters at seligenstadt and came out as a prophet inspired by the archangel gabriel eginhard intimates that his prophecies were fulfilled but as he does not state exactly what they were or how they were accomplished the statement must be accepted with much caution it is obvious that he was not the man to hesitate to ease a prophecy until it fitted if the credit of the shrine of his favourite saints could be increased by such a procedure there is no impeachment of his honour in the supposition the logic of the matter is quite simple if somewhat sophistical the holiness of the church of the martyrs guarantees the reality of the appearance of the archangel gabriel there and what the archangel says must be true therefore if anything seem to be wrong that must be the mistake of the transmitter and in justice to the archangel it must be suppressed or set right this sort of reconciliation is not unknown in quite modern times and among people who would be very much shocked to be compared with a benighted papist of the ninth century  the readers of this essay are i imagine very largely composed of people who would be shocked to be regarded as anything but enlightened protestants it is not unlikely that those of them who have accompanied me thus far may be disposed to say well this is all very amusing as a story but what is the practical interest of it we are not likely to believe in the miracles worked by the spolia of ss marcellinus and petrus or by those of any other saints in the roman calendar  the practical interest is this if you do not believe in these miracles recounted by a witness whose character and competency are firmly established whose sincerity cannot be doubted and who appeals to his sovereign and other contemporaries as witnesses of the truth of what he says in a document of which a ms copy exists probably dating within a century of the authors death why do you profess to believe in stories of a like character which are found in documents of the dates and of the authorship of which nothing is certainly determined and no known copies of which come within two or three centuries of the events they record if it be true that the four gospels and the acts were written by matthew mark luke and john all that we know of these persons comes to nothing in comparison with our knowledge of eginhard and not only is there no proof that the traditional authors of these works wrote them but very strong reasons to the contrary may be alleged if therefore you refuse to believe that wiggo was cast out of the possessed girl on eginhards authority with what justice can you profess to believe that the legion of devils were cast out of the man among the tombs of the gadarenes and if on the other hand you accept eginhards evidence why do you laugh at the supposed efficacy of relics and the saintworship of the modern romanists it cannot be pretended in the face of all evidence that the jews of the year 30 ad or thereabouts were less imbued with the belief in the supernatural than were the franks of the year 800 ad the same influences were at work in each case and it is only reasonable to suppose that the results were the same if the evidence of eginhard is insufficient to lead reasonable men to believe in the miracles he relates a fortiori the evidence afforded by the gospels and the acts must be so43  but it may be said that no serious critic denies the genuineness of the four great pauline epistlesgalatians first and second corinthians and romansand that in three out of these four paul lays claim to the power of working miracles44 must we suppose therefore that the apostle to the gentiles has stated that which is false but to how much does this socalled claim amount it may mean much or little paul nowhere tells us what he did in this direction and in his sore need to justify his assumption of apostleship against the sneers of his enemies it is hardly likely that if he had any very striking cases to bring forward he would have neglected evidence so well calculated to put them to shame and without the slightest impeachment of pauls veracity we must further remember that his stronglymarked mental characteristics displayed in unmistakable fashion by these epistles are anything but those which would justify us in regarding him as a critical witness respecting matters of fact or as a trustworthy interpreter of their significance when a man testifies to a miracle he not only states a fact but he adds an interpretation of the fact we may admit his evidence as to the former and yet think his opinion as to the latter worthless if eginhards calm and objective narrative of the historical events of his time is no guarantee for the soundness of his judgment where the supernatural is concerned the heated rhetoric of the apostle of the gentiles his absolute confidence in the inner light and the extraordinary conceptions of the nature and requirements of logical proof which he betrays in page after page of his epistles afford still less security  there is a comparatively modern man who shared to the full pauls trust in the inner light and who though widely different from the fiery evangelist of tarsus in various obvious particulars yet if i am not mistaken shares his deepest characteristics i speak of george pox who separated himself from the current protestantism of england in the seventeenth century as paul separated himself from the judaism of the first century at the bidding of the inner light who went through persecutions as serious as those which paul enumerates who was beaten stoned cast out for dead imprisoned nine times sometimes for long periods who was in perils on land and perils at sea george fox was an even more widelytravelled missionary while his success in founding congregations and his energy in visiting them not merely in great britain and ireland and the west india islands but on the continent of europe and that of north america were no less remarkable a few years after fox began to preach there were reckoned to be a thousand friends in prison in the various gaols of england at his death less than fifty years after the foundation of the sect there were 70000 quakers in the united kingdom the cheerfulness with which these peoplewomen as well as menunderwent martyrdom in this country and in the new england states is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of religion  no one who reads the voluminous autobiography of honest george can doubt the mans utter truthfulness and though in his multitudinous letters he but rarely rises for above the incoherent commonplaces of a street preacher there can be no question of his power as a speaker nor any doubt as to the dignity and attractiveness of his personality or of his possession of a large amount of practical good sense and governing faculty  but that george fox had full faith in his own powers as a miracleworker the following passage of his autobiography to which others might he added demonstrates       now after i was set at liberty from nottingham gaol where i      had been kept a prisoner a pretty long time i travelled as      before in the work of the lord and coming to mansfield      woodhouse there was a distracted woman under a doctors      hand with her hair let loose all about her ears and he was      about to let her blood she being first bound and many      people being about her holding her by violence but he      could get no blood from her and i desired them to unbind      her and let her alone for they could not touch the spirit      in her by which she was tormented so they did unbind her      and i was moved to speak to her and in the name of the lord      to bid her be quiet and still and she was so and the      lords power settled her mind and she mended and afterwards      received the truth and continued in it to her death and the      lords name was honoured to whom the glory of all his works      belongs many great and wonderful things were wrought by the      heavenly power in those days for the lord made bare his      omnipotent arm and manifested his power to the astonishment      of many by the healing virtue whereof many have been      delivered from great infirmities and the devils were made      subject through his name of which particular instances      might be given beyond what this unbelieving age is able to      receive or bear45  it needs no long study of foxs writings however to arrive at the conviction that the distinction between subjective and objective verities had not the same place in his mind as it has in that of an ordinary mortal when an ordinary person would say i thought so and so or i made up my mind to do so and so george fox says it was opened to me or at the command of god i did so and so then at the command of god on the ninth day of the seventh month 1643 fox being just nineteen i left my relations and brake off all familiarity or friendship with young or old about the beginning of the year 1647 i was moved of the lord to go into darbyshire fox hears voices and he sees visions some of which he brings before the reader with apocalyptic power in the simple and strong english alike untutored and undefiled of which like john bunyan his contemporary he was a master  and one morning as i was sitting by the fire a great cloud came over me and a temptation beset me and i sate still and it was said all things come by nature and the elements and stars came over me so that i was in a manner quite clouded with it and as i sate still under it and let it alone a living hope arose in me and a true voice arose in me which said there is a living god who made all things and immediately the cloud and the temptation vanished away and life rose over it all and my heart was glad and i praised the living god p 13  if george fox could speak as he proves in this and some other passages he could write his astounding influence on the contemporaries of milton and of cromwell is no mystery but this modern reproduction of the ancient prophet with his thus saith the lord this is the work of the lord steeped in supernaturalism and glorying in blind faith is the mental antipodes of the philosopher founded in naturalism and a fanatic for evidence to whom these affirmations inevitably suggest the previous question how do you know that the lord saith it how do you know that the lord doeth it and who is compelled to demand that rational ground for belief without which to the man of science assent is merely an immoral pretence  and it is this rational ground of belief which the writers of the gospels no less than paul and eginhard and fox so little dream of offering that they would regard the demand for it as a kind of blasphemy  footnotes       33 my citations are made from teulets einhardi omnia           quæ extant opera paris

     40 it is pretty clear that eginhard had his doubts about           the deacon whose pledges he qualifies as sponsiones           incertæ but to be sure he wrote after events which           fully justified scepticism       41 the words are scrinia sine clave which seems to mean           having no key but the circumstances forbid the idea           of breaking open       42 eginhard speaks

two years46 it has been maintained by the defenders of ecclesiastical christianity that the demonology of the books of the new testament is an essential and integral part of the revelation of the nature of the spiritual world promulgated by jesus of nazareth indeed if the historical accuracy of the gospels and of the acts of the apostles is to be taken for granted if the teachings of the epistles are divinely inspired and if the universal belief and practice of the primitive church are the models which all later times must follow there can be no doubt that those who accept the demonology are in the right it is as plain as language can make it that the writers of the gospels believed in the existence of satan and the subordinate ministers of evil as strongly as they believed in that of god and the angels and that they had an unhesitating faith in possession and in exorcism no reader of the first three gospels can hesitate to admit that in the opinion of those persons among whom the traditions out of which they are compiled arose jesus held and constantly acted upon the same theory of the spiritual world nowhere do we find the slightest hint that he doubted the theory or questioned the efficacy of the curative operations based upon it  thus when such a story as that about the gadarene swine is placed before us the importance of the decision whether it is to be accepted or rejected cannot be overestimated if the demonological part of it is to be accepted the authority of jesus is unmistakably pledged to the demonological system current in judæa in the first century the belief in devils who possess men and can be transferred from men to pigs becomes as much a part of christian dogma as any article of the creeds if it is to be rejected there are two alternative conclusions supposing the gospels to be historically accurate it follows that jesus shared in the errors respecting the nature of the spiritual world prevalent in the age in which he lived and among the people of his nation if on the other hand the gospel traditions gives us only a popular version of the sayings and doings of jesus falsely coloured and distorted by the superstitious imaginings of the minds through which it had passed what guarantee have we that a similar unconscious falsification in accordance with preconceived ideas may not have taken place in respect of other reported sayings and doings what is to prevent a conscientious inquirer from finding himself at last in a purely agnostic position with respect to the teachings of jesus and consequently with respect to the fundamentals of christianity  in dealing with the question whether the gadarene story was to be believed or not i confined myself altogether to a discussion of the value of the evidence in its favour and as it was easy to prove that this consists of nothing more than three partially discrepant but often verbally coincident versions of an original of the authorship of which nobody knows anything it appeared to me that it was wholly worthless even if the event described had been probable such evidence would have required corroboration being grossly improbable and involving acts questionable in their moral and legal aspect the three accounts sank to the level of mere tales  thus far i am unable even after the most careful revision to find any flaw in my argument and i incline to think none has been found by my criticsat least if they have they have kept the discovery to themselves  in another part of my treatment of the case i have been less fortunate i was careful to say that for anything i could absolutely prove to the contrary there might be in the universe demonic beings who could enter into and possess men and even be transferred from them to pigs and that i for my part could not venture to declare à priori that the existence of such entities was impossible i was however no less careful to remark that i thought the evidence hitherto adduced in favour of the existence of such beings ridiculously insufficient to warrant the belief in them  to my surprise this statement of what after the closest reflection i still conceive to be the right conclusion has been hailed as a satisfactory admission by opponents and lamented as a perilous concession by sympathisers indeed the tone of the comments of some candid friends has been such that i began to suspect that i must be entering upon a process of retrogressive metamorphosis which might eventually give me a place among the respectabilities the prospect perhaps ought to have pleased me but i confess i felt something of the uneasiness of the tailor who said that whenever a customers circumference was either much less or much more than at the last measurement he at once sent in his bill and i was not consoled until i recollected that thirteen years ago in discussing humes essay on miracles i had quoted with entire assent the following passage from his writings whatever is intelligible and can be distinctly conceived implies no contradiction and can never be proved false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning à priori47  now it is certain that the existence of demons can be distinctly conceived in fact from the earliest times of which we have any record to the present day the great majority of mankind have had extremely distinct conceptions of them and their practical life has been more or less shaped by those conceptions further the notion of the existence of such beings implies no contradiction no doubt in our experience intelligence and volition are always found in connection with a certain material organisation and never disconnected with it while by the hypothesis demons have no such material substratum but then as everybody knows the exact relation between mental and physical phenomena even in ourselves is the subject of endless dispute we may all have our opinions as to whether mental phenomena have a substratum distinct from that which is assumed to underlie material phenomena or not though if any one thinks he has demonstrative evidence of either the existence or the nonexistence of a soul all i can say is his notion of demonstration differs from mine but if it be impossible to demonstrate the nonexistence of a substance of mental phenomenathat is of a soulindependent of material substance if the idea of such a soul is intelligible and can be distinctly conceived then it follows that it is not justifiable to talk of demons as impossibilities the idea of their existence implies no more contradiction than does the idea of the existence of pathogenic microbes in the air indeed the microbes constitute a tolerably exact physical analogue of the powers of the air of ancient belief  strictly speaking i am unaware of any thing that has a right to the title of an impossibility except a contradiction in terms there are impossibilities logical but none natural a round square a present past two parallel lines that intersect are impossibilities because the ideas denoted by the predicates round present intersect are contradictory of the ideas denoted by the subjects square past parallel but walking on water or turning water into wine or procreation without male intervention or raising the dead are plainly not impossibilities in this sense  in the affirmation that a man walked upon water the idea of the subject is not contradictory of that in the predicate naturalists are familiar with insects which walk on water and imagination has no more difficulty in putting a man in place of the insect than it has in giving a man some of the attributes of a bird and making an angel of him or in ascribing to him the ascensive tendencies of a balloon as the levitationists do undoubtedly there are very strong physical and biological arguments for thinking it extremely improbable that a man could be supported on the surface of the water as the insect is or that his organisation could be compatible with the possession and use of wings or that he could rise through the air without mechanical aid indeed if we have any reason to believe that our present knowledge of the nature of things exhausts the possibilities of nature we might properly say that the attributes of men are contradictory of walking on water or floating in the air and consequently that these acts are truly impossible for him but it is sufficiently obvious not only that we are at the beginning of our knowledge of nature instead of having arrived at the end of it but that the limitations of our faculties are such that we never can be in a position to set bounds to the possibilities of nature we have knowledge of what is happening and of what has happened of what will happen we have and can have no more than expectation grounded on our more or less correct reading of past experience and prompted by the faith begotten of that experience that the order of nature in the future will resemble its order in the past  the same considerations apply to the other examples of supposed miraculous events the change of water into wine undoubtedly implies a contradiction and is assuredly impossible if we are permitted to assume that the elementary bodies of the chemists are now and for ever immutable not only however is a negative proposition of this kind incapable of proof but modern chemistry is inclining towards the contrary doctrine and if carbon can be got out of hydrogen or oxygen the conversion of water into wine comes within range of scientific possibilityit becomes a mere question of molecular arrangement  as for virgin procreation it is not only clearly imaginable but modern biology recognises it as an everyday occurrence among some groups of animals so with restoration to life after death certain animals long as dry as mummies and to all appearance as dead when placed in proper conditions resume their vitality it may be said that these creatures are not dead but merely in a condition of suspended vitality that however is only begging the question by making the incapacity for restoration to life part of the definition of death in the absence of obvious lesions of some of the more important organs it is no easy matter even for experts to say that an apparently dead man is incapable of restoration to life and in the recorded instances of such restoration the want of any conclusive evidence that the man was dead is even more remarkable than the insufficiency of the testimony as to his coming to life again  it may be urged however that there is at any rate one miracle certified by all three of the synoptic gospels which really does imply a contradiction and is therefore impossible in the strictest sense of the word this is the wellknown story of the feeding of several thousand men to the complete satisfaction of their hunger by the distribution of a few loaves and fishes among them the wondrousness of this already somewhat surprising performance being intensified by the assertion that the quantity of the fragments of the meal left over amounted to much more than the original store  undoubtedly if the operation is stated in its most general form if it is to be supposed that a certain quantity or magnitude was divided into many more parts than the whole contained and that after the subtraction of several thousands of such parts the magnitude of the remainder amounted to more than the original magnitude there does seem to be an à priori difficulty about accepting the proposition seeing that it appears to be contradictory of the senses which we attach to the words whole and parts respectively but this difficulty is removed if we reflect that we are not in this case dealing with magnitude in the abstract or with whole and parts in their mathematical sense but with concrete things many of which are known to possess the power of growing or increasing in magnitude they thus furnish us with a conception of growth which we may in imagination apply to loaves and fishes just as we may in imagination apply the idea of wings to the idea of a man it must be admitted that a number of sheep might be fed on a pasture and yet there might be more grass on the pasture when the sheep left it than there was at first we may generalise this and other such facts into a perfectly definite conception of the increase of food in excess of consumption which thus becomes a possibility the limitations of which are to be discovered only by experience therefore if it is asserted that cooked food has been made to grow in excess of rapid consumption that statement cannot logically be rejected as an à priori impossibility however improbable experience of the capabilities of cooked food may justify us in holding it to be  on the strength of this undeniable improbability however we not only have a right to demand but are morally bound to require strong evidence in its favour before we even take it into serious consideration but what is the evidence in this case it is merely that of those three books48 which also concur in testifying to the truth of the monstrous legend of the herd of swine in these three books there are five accounts of a miraculous feeding which fall into two groups three of the stories obviously derived from some common source state that five loaves and two fishes sufficed to feed five thousand persons and that twelve baskets of fragments remained over in the two others also obviously derived from a common source distinct from the preceding seven loaves and a few small fishes are distributed to four thousand persons and seven baskets of fragments are left  if we were dealing with secular records i suppose no candid and competent student of history would entertain much doubt that the originals of the three stories and of the two are themselves merely divergent versions of some primitive story which existed before the three synoptic gospels were compiled out of the body of traditions current about jesus this view of the case however is incompatible with a belief in the historical accuracy of the first and second gospels49 for these agree in making jesus himself speak of both the four thousand and the five thousand miracle when i brake the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up they say unto him twelve and when the seven among the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up and they say unto him seven  thus we are face to face with a dilemma the way of escape from which is not obvious either the four thousand and the five thousand stories are both historically true and describe two separate events or the first and second gospels testify to the very words of a conversation between jesus and his disciples which cannot have been uttered  my choice between these alternatives is determined by no à priori speculations about the possibility or impossibility of such events as the feeding of the four or of the five thousand but i ask myself the question what evidence ought to be produced before i could feel justified in saying that i believed such an event to have occurred that question is very easily answered proof must be given 1 of the weight of the loaves and fishes at starting 2 of the distribution to 45000 persons without any additional supply of this quantity and quality of food 3 of the satisfaction of these peoples appetites 4 of the weight and quality of the fragments gathered up into the baskets whatever my present notions of probability and improbability may be satisfactory testimony under these four heads would lead me to believe that they were erroneous and i should accept the socalled miracle as a new and unexpected example of the possibilities of nature  but when instead of such evidence nothing is produced but two sets of discrepant stories originating nobody knows how or when among persons who could believe as firmly in devils which enter pigs i confess that my feeling is one of astonishment that any one should expect a reasonable man to take such testimony seriously  i am anxious to bring about a clear understanding of the difference between impossibilities and improbabilities because mistakes on this point lay us open to the attacks of ecclesiastical apologists of the type of the late cardinal newman acute sophists who think it fitting to employ their intellects as burglars employ dark lanterns for the discovery of other peoples weak places while they carefully keep the light away from their own position  when it is rightly stated the agnostic view of miracles is in my judgment unassailable we are not justifiable in the à priori assertion that the order of nature as experience has revealed it to us cannot change in arguing about the miraculous the assumption is illegitimate because it involves the whole point in dispute furthermore it is an assumption which takes us beyond the range of our faculties obviously no amount of past experience can warrant us in anything more than a correspondingly strong expectation for the present and future we find practically that expectations based upon careful observations of events are as a rule trustworthy we should be foolish indeed not to follow the only guide we have through life but for all that our highest and surest generalisations remain on the level of justifiable expectations that is very high probabilities for my part i am unable to conceive of an intelligence shaped on the model of that of man however superior it might be which could be any better off than our own in this respect that is which could possess logically justifiable grounds for certainty about the constancy of the order of things and therefore be in a position to declare that such and such events are impossible some of the old mythologies recognised this clearly enough beyond and above zeus and odin there lay the unknown and inscrutable fate which one day or other would crumple up them and the world they ruled to give place to a new order of things  i sincerely hope that i shall not be accused of pyrrhonism or of any desire to weaken the foundations of rational certainty i have merely desired to point out that rational certainty is one thing and talk about impossibilities or violation of natural laws another rational certainty rests upon two groundsthe one that the evidence in favour of a given statement is as good as it can be the other that such evidence is plainly insufficient in the former case the statement is to be taken as true in the latter as untrue until something arises to modify the verdict which however properly reached may always be more or less wrong the best information being never complete and the best reasoning being liable to fallacy  to quarrel with the uncertainty that besets us in intellectual affairs would be about as reasonable as to object to live ones life with due thought for the morrow because no man can be sure he will be alive an hour hence such are the conditions imposed upon us by nature and we have to make the best of them and i think that the greatest mistake those of us who are interested in the progress of free thought can make is to overlook these limitations and to deck ourselves with the dogmatic feathers which are the traditional adornment of our opponents let us be content with rational certainty leaving irrational certainties to those who like to muddle their minds with them i cannot see my way to say that demons are impossibilities but i am not more certain about anything than i am that the evidence tendered in favour of the demonology of which the gadarene story is a typical example is utterly valueless i cannot see my way to say that it is impossible that the hunger of thousands of men should be satisfied out of the food supplied by halfadozen loaves and a fish or two but it seems to me monstrous that i should be asked to believe it on the faith of the five stories which testify to such an occurrence it is true that the position that miracles are impossible cannot be sustained but i know of nothing which calls upon me to qualify the grave verdict of hume there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned goodness education and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood and at the same time attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable all which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men50       the preceding paper called forth the following criticism      signed agnosco to which i append my reply       while agreeing generally with professor huxleys remarks      respecting miracles in the agnostic annual for 1892 it      has seemed to me that one of his arguments at least requires      qualification the professor in maintaining that socalled      miraculous events are possible although the evidence      adduced is not sufficient to render them probable refers to      the possibility of changing water into wine by molecular      recomposition he tells us that if carbon can be got out      of hydrogen or oxygen the conversion of water into wine      comes within range of scientific possibility but in      maintaining that miracles socalled have a prospective      possibility professor huxley loses sightat least so it      appears to meof the question of their retrospective      possibility for if it requires a certain degree of      knowledge and experience yet far from having been attained      to perform those acts which have been called miraculous it      is not only improbable but impossible likewise that they      should have been done by men whose knowledge and experience      were considerably less than our own it has seemed to me in      fact that this question of the retrospective possibility of      miracles is more important to us rationalists and for the      matter of that to christians also than the question of      their prospective possibility with which professor huxleys      article mainly deals perhaps the professor himself could      help those of us who think so by giving us his opinion       i am not sure that i fully appreciate the point raised by      agnosco nor the distinction between the prospective and      the retrospective possibility of such a miracle as the      conversion of water into wine if we may contemplate such an      event as possible in london in the year 1900 it must in      the same sense have been possible in the year 30 or      thereabouts at cana in galilee if i should live so long i      shall take great interest in the announcement of the      performance of this operation say nine years hence and      if there is no objection raised by chemical experts i shall      accept the fact that the feat has been performed without      hesitation but i shall have no more ground for believing      the cana story than i had before simply because the      evidence in its favour will remain for me exactly where it      is possible or impossible that evidence is worth nothing      to leave the safe ground of no evidence for speculations      about impossibilities consequent upon the want of      scientific knowledge of the supposed workers of miracles      appears to me to be a mistake especially in view of the      orthodox contention that they possessed supernatural power      and supernatural knowledge th huxley  footnotes

ii     vii agnosticism  1889   within the last few months the public has received much and varied information on the subject of agnostics their tenets and even their future agnosticism exercised the orators of the church congress at manchester51 it has been furnished with a set of articles fewer but not less rigid and certainly not less consistent than the thirtynine its nature has been analysed and its future severely predicted by the most eloquent of that prophetical school whose samuel is auguste comte it may still be a question however whether the public is as much the wiser as might be expected considering all the trouble that has been taken to enlighten it not only are the three accounts of the agnostic position sadly out of harmony with one another but i propose to show cause for my belief that all three must be seriously questioned by any one who employs the term agnostic in the sense in which it was originally used the learned principal of kings college who brought the topic of agnosticism before the church congress took a short and easy way of settling the business       but if this be so for a man to urge as an escape from this      article of belief that he has no means of a scientific      knowledge of the unseen world or of the future is      irrelevant his difference from christians lies not in the      fact that he has no knowledge of these things but that he      does not believe the authority on which they are stated he      may prefer to call himself an agnostic but his real name is      an older onehe is an infidel that is to say an      unbeliever the word infidel perhaps carries an unpleasant      significance perhaps it is right that it should it is and      it ought to be an unpleasant thing for a man to have to say      plainly that he does not believe in jesus christ52  so much of dr waces address either explicitly or implicitly concerns me that i take upon myself to deal with it but in so doing it must be understood that i speak for myself alone i am not aware that there is any sect of agnostics and if there be i am not its acknowledged prophet or pope i desire to leave to the comtists the entire monopoly of the manufacture of imitation ecclesiasticism  let us calmly and dispassionately consider dr waces appreciation of agnosticism the agnostic according to his view is a person who says he has no means of attaining a scientific knowledge of the unseen world or of the future by which somewhat loose phraseology dr wace presumably means the theological unseen world and future i cannot think this description happy either in form or substance but for the present it may pass dr wace continues that it is not his difference from christians are there then any christians who say that they know nothing about the unseen world and the future i was ignorant of the fact but t am ready to accept it on the authority of a professional theologian and i proceed to dr waces next proposition  the real state of the case then is that the agnostic does not believe the authority on which these things are stated which authority is jesus christ he is simply an oldfashioned infidel who is afraid to own to his right name as presbyter is priest writ large so is agnostic the mere greek equivalent for the latin infidel there is an attractive simplicity about this solution of the problem and it has that advantage of being somewhat offensive to the persons attacked which is so dear to the less refined sort of controversialist the agnostic says i cannot find good evidence that so and so is true ah says his adversary seizing his opportunity then you declare that jesus christ was untruthful for he said so and so a very telling method of rousing prejudice but suppose that the value of the evidence as to what jesus may have said and done and as to the exact nature and scope of his authority is just that which the agnostic finds it most difficult to determine if i venture to doubt that the duke of wellington gave the command up guards and at em at waterloo i do not think that even dr wace would accuse me of disbelieving the duke yet it would be just as reasonable to do this as to accuse any one of denying what jesus said before the preliminary question as to what he did say is settled  now the question as to what jesus really said and did is strictly a scientific problem which is capable of solution by no other methods than those practised by the historian and the literary critic it is a problem of immense difficulty which has occupied some of the best heads in europe for the last century and it is only of late years that their investigations have begun to converge towards one conclusion53  that kind of faith which dr wace describes and lauds is of no use here indeed he himself takes pains to destroy its evidential value  what made the mahommedan world trust and faith in the declarations and assurances of mahommed and what made the christian world trust and faith in the declarations and assurances of jesus christ and his apostles lc p 253 the triumphant tone of this imaginary catechism leads me to suspect that its author has hardly appreciated its full import presumably dr wace regards mahommed as an unbeliever or to use the term which he prefers infidel and considers that his assurances have given rise to a vast delusion which has led and is leading millions of men straight to everlasting punishment and this being so the trust and faith which have made the mahommedan world in just the same sense as they have made the christian world must be trust and faith in falsehoods no man who has studied history or even attended to the occurrences of everyday life can doubt the enormous practical value of trust and faith but as little will he be inclined to deny that this practical value has not the least relation to the reality of the objects of that trust and faith in examples of patient constancy of faith and of unswerving trust the acta martyrum do not excel the annals of babism54                                       the discussion upon which we have now entered goes so thoroughly to the root of the whole matter the question of the day is so completely as the author of robert elsmere says the value of testimony that i shall offer no apology for following it out somewhat in detail and by way of giving substance to the argument i shall base what i have to say upon a case the consideration of which lies strictly within the province of natural science and of that particular part of it known as the physiology and pathology of the nervous system  i find in the second gospel chap v a statement to all appearance intended to have the same evidential value as any other contained in that history it is the wellknown story of the devils who were cast out of a man and ordered or permitted to enter into a herd of swine to the great loss and damage of the innocent gerasene or gadarene pig owners there can be no doubt that the narrator intends to convey to his readers his own conviction that this casting out and entering in were effected by the agency of jesus of nazareth that by speech and action jesus enforced this conviction nor does any inkling of the legal and moral difficulties of the case manifest itself  on the other hand everything that i know of physiological and pathological science leads me to entertain a very strong conviction that the phenomena ascribed to possession are as purely natural as those which constitute smallpox everything that i know of anthropology leads me to think that the belief in demons and demoniacal possession is a mere survival of a once universal superstition and that its persistence at the present time is pretty much in the inverse ratio of the general instruction intelligence and sound judgment of the population among whom it prevails everything that i know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example again the study of history and especially of that of the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries leaves no shadow of doubt on my mind that the belief in the reality of possession and of witchcraft justly based alike by catholics and protestants upon this and innumerable other passages in both the old and new testaments gave rise through the special influence of christian ecclesiastics to the most horrible persecutions and judicial murders of thousands upon thousands of innocent men women and children and when i reflect that the record of a plain and simple declaration upon such an occasion as this that the belief in witchcraft and possession is wicked nonsense would have rendered the long agony of mediæval humanity impossible i am prompted to reject as dishonouring the supposition that such declaration was withheld out of condescension to popular error  come forth thou unclean spirit out of the man mark v 855 are the words attributed to jesus if i declare as i have no hesitation in doing that i utterly disbelieve in the existence of unclean spirits and consequently in the possibility of their coming forth out of a man i suppose that dr wace will tell me i am disregarding the testimony of our lord for if these words were really used the most resourceful of reconcilers can hardly venture to affirm that they are compatible with a disbelief in these things as the learned and fairminded as well as orthodox dr alexander remarks in an editorial note to the article demoniacs in the biblical cyclopædia vol i p 664 note        on the lowest grounds on which our lord and his apostles      can be placed they must at least be regarded as honest      men now though honest speech does not require that words      should be used always and only in their etymological sense      it does require that they should not be used so as to affirm      what the speaker knows to be false whilst therefore our      lord and his apostles might use the word greek daimonizesthai      or the phrase greek daimonion echein as a popular      description of certain diseases without giving in to the      belief which lay at the source of such a mode of expression      they could not speak of demons entering into a man or being      cast out of him without pledging themselves to the belief of      an actual possession of the man by the demons campbell      prel diss vi 1 10 if consequently they did not hold      this belief they spoke not as honest men  the story which we are considering does not rest on the authority of the second gospel alone the third confirms the second especially in the matter of commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man luke viii 29 and although the first gospel either gives a different version of the same story or tells another of like kind the essential point remains if thou cast us out send us away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go matt viii 31 32  if the concurrent testimony of the three synoptics then is really sufficient to do away with all rational doubt as to a matter of fact of the utmost practical and speculative importancebelief or disbelief in which may affect and has affected mens lives and their conduct towards other men in the most serious waythen i am bound to believe that jesus implicitly affirmed himself to possess a knowledge of the unseen world which afforded full confirmation of the belief in demons and possession current among his contemporaries if the story is true the mediæval theory of the invisible world may be and probably is quite correct and the witchfinders from sprenger to hopkins and mather are muchmaligned men  on the other hand humanity noting the frightful consequences of this belief common sense observing the futility of the evidence on which it is based in all cases that have been properly investigated science more and more seeing its way to inclose all the phenomena of socalled possession within the domain of pathology so far as they are not to be relegated to that of the policeall these powerful influences concur in warning us at our peril against accepting the belief without the most careful scrutiny of the authority on which it rests  i can discern no escape from this dilemma either jesus said what he is reported to have said or he did not in the former case it is inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the unseen world should be roughly shaken in the latter the blow falls upon the authority of the synoptic gospels if their report on a matter of such stupendous and farreaching practical import as this is untrustworthy how can we be sure of its trustworthiness in other cases the favourite earth in which the hardpressed reconciler takes refuge that the bible does not profess to teach science56 is stopped in this instance for the question of the existence of demons and of possession by them though it lies strictly within the province of science is also of the deepest moral and religious significance if physical and mental disorders are caused by demons gregory of tours and his contemporaries rightly considered that relics and exorcists were more useful than doctors the gravest questions arise as to the legal and moral responsibilities of persons inspired by demoniacal impulses and our whole conception of the universe and of our relations to it becomes totally different from what it would be on the contrary hypothesis  the theory of life of an average mediæval christian was as different from that of an average nineteenthcentury englishman as that of a west african negro is now in these respects the modern world is slowly but surely shaking off these and other monstrous survivals of savage delusions and whatever happens it will not return to that wallowing in the mire until the contrary is proved i venture to doubt whether at this present moment any protestant theologian who has a reputation to lose will say that he believes the gadarene story  the choice then lies between discrediting those who compiled the gospel biographies and disbelieving the master whom they simple souls thought to honour by preserving such traditions of the exercise of his authority over satans invisible world this is the dilemma no deep scholarship nothing but a knowledge of the revised version on which it is to be supposed all that mere scholarship can do has been done with the application thereto of the commonest canons of common sense is needful to enable us to make a choice between its alternatives it is hardly doubtful that the story as told in the first gospel is merely a version of that told in the second and third nevertheless the discrepancies are serious and irreconcilable and on this ground alone a suspension of judgment at the least is called for but there is a great deal more to be said from the dawn of scientific biblical criticism until the present day the evidence against the longcherished notion that the three synoptic gospels are the works of three independent authors each prompted by divine inspiration has steadily accumulated until at the present time there is no visible escape from the conclusion that each of the three is a compilation consisting of a groundwork common to all threethe threefold tradition and of a superstructure consisting firstly of matter common to it with one of the others and secondly of matter special to each the use of the terms groundwork and superstructure by no means implies that the latter must be of later date than the former on the contrary some parts of it may be and probably are older than some parts of the groundwork57  the story of the gadarene swine belongs to the groundwork at least the essential part of it in which the belief in demoniac possession is expressed does and therefore the compilers of the first second and third gospels whoever they were certainly accepted that belief which indeed was universal among both jews and pagans at that time and attributed it to jesus  what then do we know about the originator or originators of this groundworkof that threefold tradition which all three witnesses in paleys phrase agree uponthat we should allow their mere statements to outweigh the counter arguments of humanity of common sense of exact science and to imperil the respect which all would be glad to be able to render to their master  absolutely nothing58 there is no proof nothing more than a fair presumption that any one of the gospels existed in the state in which we find it in the authorised version of the bible before the second century or in other words sixty or seventy years after the events recorded and between that time and the date of the oldest extant manuscripts of the gospels there is no telling what additions and alterations and interpolations may have been made it may be said that this is all mere speculation but it is a good deal more as competent scholars and honest men our revisers have felt compelled to point out that such things have happened even since the date of the oldest known manuscripts the oldest two copies of the second gospel end with the 8th verse of the 16th chapter the remaining twelve verses are spurious and it is noteworthy that the maker of the addition has not hesitation to introduce a speech in which jesus promises his disciples that in my name shall they cast out devils  the other passage rejected to the margin is still more instructive it is that touching apologue with its profound ethical sense of the woman taken in adulterywhich if internal evidence were an infallible guide might well be affirmed to be a typical example of the teachings of jesus yet say the revisers pitilessly most of the ancient authorities emit john vii 53viii 11 now let any reasonable man ask himself this question if after an approximate settlement of the canon of the new testament and even later than the fourth and fifth centuries literary fabricators had the skill and the audacity to make such additions and interpolations as these what may they have done when no one had thought of a canon when oral tradition still unfixed was regarded as more valuable than such written records as may have existed in the latter portion of the first century or to take the other alternative if those who gradually settled the canon did not know of the existence of the oldest codices which have come down to us or if knowing them they rejected their authority what is to be thought of their competency as critics of the text  people who object to free criticism of the christian scriptures forget that they are what they are in virtue of very free criticism unless the advocates of inspiration are prepared to affirm that the majority of influential ecclesiastics during several centuries were safeguarded against error for even granting that some books of the period were inspired they were certainly few amongst many and those who selected the canonical books unless they themselves were also inspired must be regarded in the light of mere critics and from the evidence they have left of their intellectual habits very uncritical critics when one thinks that such delicate questions as those involved fell into the hands of men like papias who believed in the famous millenarian grape story of irenæus with his reasons for the existence of only four gospels and of such calm and dispassionate judges as tertullian with his credo quia impossibile the marvel is that the selection which constitutes our new testament is as free as it is from obviously objectionable matter the apocryphal gospels certainly deserve to be apocryphal but one may suspect that a little more critical discrimination would have enlarged the apocrypha not inconsiderably  at this point a very obvious objection arises and deserves full and candid consideration it may be said that critical scepticism carried to the length suggested is historical pyrrhonism that if we are altogether to discredit an ancient or a modern historian because he has assumed fabulous matter to be true it will be as well to give up paying any attention to history it may be said and with great justice that eginhards life of charlemagne is none the less trustworthy because of the astounding revelation of credulity of lack of judgment and even of respect for the eighth commandment which he has unconsciously made in the history of the translation of the blessed martyrs marcellinus and paul or to go no further back than the last number of the nineteenth century surely that excellent lady miss strickland is not to be refused all credence because of the myth about the second jamess remains which she seems to have unconsciously invented  of course this is perfectly true i am afraid there is no man alive whose witness could be accepted if the condition precedent were proof that he had never invented and promulgated a myth in the minds of all of us there are little places here and there like the indistinguishable spots on a rock which give foothold to moss or stonecrop on which if the germ of a myth fall it is certain to grow without in the least degree affecting our accuracy or truthfulness elsewhere sir walter scott knew that he could not repeat a story without as he said giving it a new hat and stick most of us differ from sir walter only in not knowing about this tendency of the mythopoeic faculty to break out unnoticed but it is also perfectly true that the mythopoeic faculty is not equally active in all minds nor in all regions and under all conditions of the same mind david hume was certainly not so liable to temptation as the venerable bede or even as some recent historians who could be mentioned and the most imaginative of debtors if he owes five pounds never makes an obligation to pay a hundred out of it the rule of common sense is primâ facie to trust a witness in all matters in which neither his selfinterest his passions his prejudices nor that love of the marvellous which is inherent to a greater or less degree in all mankind are strongly concerned and when they are involved to require corroborative evidence in exact proportion to the contravention of probability by the thing testified  now in the gadarene affair i do not think i am unreasonably sceptical if i say that the existence of demons who can be transferred from a man to a pig does thus contravene probability let me be perfectly candid i admit i have no à priori objection to offer there are physical things such as tæniæ and trichinæ which can be transferred from men to pigs and vice versâ and which do undoubtedly produce most diabolical and deadly effects on both for anything i can absolutely prove to the contrary there may be spiritual things capable of the same transmigration with like effects moreover i am bound to add that perfectly truthful persons for whom i have the greatest respect believe in stories about spirits of the present day quite as improbable as that we are considering  so i declare as plainly as i can that i am unable to show cause why these transferable devils should not exist nor can i deny that not merely the whole roman church but many wacean infidels of no mean repute do honestly and firmly believe that the activity of such like demonic beings is in full swing in this year of grace 1889  nevertheless as good bishop butler says probability is the guide of life and it seems to me that this is just one of the cases in which the canon of credibility and testimony which i have ventured to lay down has full force so that with the most entire respect for many by no means for all of our witnesses for the truth of demonology ancient and modern i conceive their evidence on this particular matter to be ridiculously insufficient to warrant their conclusion59  after what has been said i do not think that any sensible man unless he happen to be angry will accuse me of contradicting the lord and his apostles if i reiterate my total disbelief in the whole gadarene story but if that story is discredited all the other stories of demoniac possession fall under suspicion and if the belief in demons and demoniac possession which forms the sombre background of the whole picture of primitive christianity presented to us in the new testament is shaken what is to be said in any case of the uncorroborated testimony of the gospels with respect to the unseen world  i am not aware that i have been influenced by any more bias in regard to the gadarene story than i have been in dealing with other cases of like kind the investigation of which has interested me i was brought up in the strictest school of evangelical orthodoxy and when i was old enough to think for myself i started upon my journey of inquiry with little doubt about the general truth of what i had been taught and with that feeling of the unpleasantness of being called an infidel which we are told is so right and proper near my journeys end i find myself in a condition of something more than mere doubt about these matters  in the course of other inquiries i have had to do with fossil remains which looked quite plain at a distance and became more and more indistinct as i tried to define their outline by close inspection there was something theresomething which if i could win assurance about it might mark a new epoch in the history of the earth but study as long as i might certainty eluded my grasp so had it been with me in my efforts to define the grand figure of jesus as it lies in the primary strata of christian literature is he the kindly peaceful christ depicted in the catacombs or is he the stern judge who frowns upon the altar of ss cosmas and damianus or can he be rightly represented by the bleeding ascetic broken down by physical pain of too many mediæval pictures are we to accept the jesus of the second or the jesus of the fourth gospel as the true jesus what did he really say and do and how much that is attributed to him in speech and action is the embroidery of the various parties into which his followers tended to split themselves within twenty years of his death when even the threefold tradition was only nascent  if any one will answer these questions for me with something more to the point than feeble talk about the cowardice of agnosticism i shall be deeply his debtor unless and until they are satisfactorily answered i say of agnosticism in this matter jy suis et jy reste  but as we have seen it is asserted that i have no business to call myself an agnostic that if i am not a christian i am an infidel and that i ought to call myself by that name of unpleasant significance well i do not care much what i am called by other people and if i had at my side all those who since the christian era have been called infidels by other folks i could not desire better company if these are my ancestors i prefer with the old frank to be with them wherever they are but there are several points in dr waces contention which must be elucidated before i can even think of undertaking to carry out his wishes i must for instance know what a christian is now what is a christian by whose authority is the signification of that term defined is there any doubt that the immediate followers of jesus the sect of the nazarenes were strictly orthodox jews differing from other jews not more than the sadducees the pharisees and the essenes differed from one another in fact only in the belief that the messiah for whom the rest of their nation waited had come was not their chief james the brother of the lord reverenced alike by sadducee pharisee and nazarene at the famous conference which according to the acts took place at jerusalem does not james declare that myriads of jews who by that time had become nazarenes were all zealous for the law was not the name of christian first used to denote the converts to the doctrine promulgated by paul and barnabas at antioch does the subsequent history of christianity leave any doubt that from this time forth the little rift within the lute caused by the new teaching developed if not inaugurated at antioch grew wider and wider until the two types of doctrines irreconcilably diverged did not the primitive nazarenism or ebionism develop into the nazarenism and ebionism and elkasaitism of later ages and finally die out in obscurity and condemnation as damnable heresy while the younger doctrine throve and pushed out its shoots into that endless variety of sects of which the three strongest survivors are the roman and greek churches and modern protestantism  singular state of things if i were to profess the doctrine which was held by james the brother of the lord and by every one of the myriads of his followers and coreligionists in jerusalem up to twenty or thirty years after the crucifixion and one knows not how much later at pella i should be condemned with unanimity as an ebionising heretic by the roman greek and protestant churches and probably this hearty and unanimous condemnation of the creed held by those who were in the closest personal relation with their lord is almost the only point upon which they would be cordially of one mind on the other hand though i hardly dare imagine such a thing i very much fear that the pillars of the primitive hierosolymitan church would have considered dr wace an infidel no one can read the famous second chapter of galatians and the book of revelation without seeing how narrow was even pauls escape from a similar fate and if ecclesiastical history is to be trusted the thirtynine articles be they right or wrong diverge from the primitive doctrine of the nazarenes vastly more than even pauline christianity did  but further than this i have great difficulty in assuring myself that even james the brother of the lord and his myriads of nazarenes properly represented the doctrines of their master for it is constantly asserted by our modern pillars that one of the chief features of the work of jesus was the instauration of religion by the abolition of what our sticklers for articles and liturgies with unconscious humour call the narrow restrictions of the law yet if james knew this how could the bitter controversy with paul have arisen and why did not one or the other side quote any of the various sayings of jesus recorded in the gospels which directly bear on the questionsometimes apparently in opposite directions  so if i am asked to call myself an infidel i reply to what doctrine do you ask me to be faithful is it that contained in the nicene and the athanasian creeds my firm belief is that the nazarenes say of the year 40 headed by james would have stopped their ears and thought worthy of stoning the audacious man who propounded it to them is it contained in the socalled apostles creed i am pretty sure that even that would have created a recalcitrant commotion at pella in the year 70 among the nazarenes of jerusalem who had fled from the soldiers of titus and yet if the unadulterated tradition of the teachings of the nazarene were to be found anywhere it surely should have been amidst those not very aged disciples who may have heard them as they were delivered  therefore however sorry i may be to be unable to demonstrate that if necessary i should not be afraid to call myself an infidel i cannot do it infidel is a term of reproach which christians and mahommedans in their modesty agree to apply to those who differ from them if he had only thought of it dr wace might have used the term miscreant which with the same etymological signification has the advantage of being still more unpleasant to the persons to whom it is applied but why should a man be expected to call himself a miscreant or an infidel that st patrick had two birthdays because he was a twin is a reasonable and intelligible utterance beside that of the man who should declare himself to be an infidel on the ground of denying his own belief it may be logically if not ethically defensible that a christian should call a mahommedan an infidel and vice versâ but on dr waces principles both ought to call themselves infidels because each applies the term to the other  now i am afraid that all the mahommedan world would agree in reciprocating that appellation to dr wace himself i once visited the hazar mosque the great university of mohammedanism in cairo in ignorance of the fact that i was unprovided with proper authority a swarm of angry undergraduates as i suppose i ought to call them came buzzing about me and my guide and if i had known arabic i suspect that dog of an infidel would have been by no means the most unpleasant of the epithets showered upon me before i could explain and apologise for the mistake if i had had the pleasure of dr waces company on that occasion the undiscriminative followers of the prophet would i am afraid have made no difference between us not even if they had known that he was the head of an orthodox christian seminary and i have not the smallest doubt that even one of the learned mollahs if his grave courtesy would have permitted him to say anything offensive to men of another mode of belief would have told us that he wondered we did not find it very unpleasant to disbelieve in the prophet of islam  from what precedes i think it becomes sufficiently clear that dr waces account of the origin of the name of agnostic is quite wrong indeed i am bound to add that very slight effort to discover the truth would have convinced him that as a matter of fact the term arose otherwise i am loath to go over an old story once more but more than one object which i have in view will be served by telling it a little more fully than it has yet been told  looking back nearly fifty years i see myself as a boy whose education has been interrupted and who intellectually was left for some years altogether to his own devices at that time i was a voracious and omnivorous reader a dreamer and speculator of the first water well endowed with that splendid courage in attacking any and every subject which is the blessed compensation of youth and inexperience among the books and essays on all sorts of topics from metaphysics to heraldry which i read at this time two left indelible impressions on my mind one was guizots history of civilization the other was sir william hamiltons essay on the philosophy of the unconditioned which i came upon by chance in an odd volume of the edinburgh review the latter was certainly strange reading for a boy and i could not possibly have understood a great deal of it60 nevertheless i devoured it with avidity and it stamped upon my mind the strong conviction that on even the most solemn and important of questions men are apt to take cunning phrases for answers and that the limitation of our faculties in a great number of cases renders real answers to such questions not merely actually impossible but theoretically inconceivable  philosophy and history having laid hold of me in this eccentric fashion have never loosened their grip i have no pretension to be an expert in either subject but the turn for philosophical and historical reading which rendered hamilton and guizot attractive to me has not only filled many lawful leisure hours and still more sleepless ones with the repose of changed mental occupation but has not unfrequently disputed my proper worktime with my liege lady natural science in this way i have found it possible to cover a good deal of ground in the territory of philosophy and all the more easily that i have never cared much about as or bs opinions but have rather sought to know what answer he had to give to the questions i had to put to himthat of the limitation of possible knowledge being the chief the ordinary examiner with his state the views of soandso would have floored me at any time if he had said what do you think about any given problem i might have got on fairly well  the reader who has had the patience to follow the enforced but unwilling egotism of this veritable history especially if his studies have led him in the same direction will now see why my mind steadily gravitated towards the conclusions of hume and kant so well stated by the latter in a sentence which i have quoted elsewhere  the greatest and perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure reason is after all merely negative since it serves not as an organon for the enlargement of knowledge but as a discipline for its delimitation and instead of discovering truth has only the modest merit of preventing error61  when i reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether i was an atheist a theist or a pantheist a materialist or an idealist a christian or a freethinker i found that the more i learned and reflected the less ready was the answer until at last i came to the conclusion that i had neither art nor part with any of these denominations except the last the one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which i differed from them they were quite sure they had attained a certain gnosishad more or less successfully solved the problem of existence while i was quite sure i had not and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble and with hume and kant on my side i could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion like dante      nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita       mi ritrovai per una selva oscura  but unlike dante i cannot add      che la diritta via era smarrita  on the contrary i had and have the firmest conviction that i never left the verace viathe straight road and that this road led nowhere else but into the dark depths of a wild and tangled forest and though i have found leopards and lions in the path though i have made abundant acquaintance with the hungry wolf that with privy paw devours apace and nothing said as another great poet says of the ravening beast and though no friendly spectre has even yet offered his guidance i was and am minded to go straight on until i either come out on the other side of the wood or find there is no other side to it at least none attainable by me  this was my situation when i had the good fortune to find a place among the members of that remarkable confraternity of antagonists long since deceased but of green and pious memory the metaphysical society every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there and expressed itself with entire openness most of my colleagues were ists of one sort or another and however kind and friendly they might be i the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the historical fox when after leaving the trap in which his tail remained he presented himself to his normally elongated companions so i took thought and invented what i conceived to be the appropriate title of agnostic it came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the gnostic of church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which i was ignorant and i took the earliest opportunity of parading it at our society to show that i too had a tail like the other foxes to my great satisfaction the term took and when the spectator had stood godfather to it any suspicion in the minds of respectable people that a knowledge of its parentage might have awakened was of course completely lulled  that is the history of the origin of the terms agnostic and agnosticism and it will be observed that it does not quite agree with the confident assertion of the reverend principal of kings college that the adoption of the term agnostic is only an attempt to shift the issue and that it involves a mere evasion in relation to the church and christianity62                                       the last objection i rejoice as much as my readers must do that it is the last which i have to take to dr waces deliverance before the church congress arises i am sorry to say on a question of morality  it is and it ought to be authoritatively declares this official representative of christian ethics an unpleasant thing for a man to have to say plainly that he does not believe in jesus christ lc p 254  whether it is so depends i imagine a good deal on whether the man was brought up in a christian household or not i do not see why it should be unpleasant for a mahommedan or buddhist to say so but that it ought to be unpleasant for any man to say anything which he sincerely and after due deliberation believes is to my mind a proposition of the most profoundly immoral character i verily believe that the great good which has been effected in the world by christianity has been largely counteracted by the pestilent doctrine on which all the churches have insisted that honest disbelief in their more or less astonishing creeds is a moral offence indeed a sin of the deepest dye deserving and involving the same future retribution as murder and robbery if we could only see in one view the torrents of hypocrisy and cruelty the lies the slaughter the violations of every obligation of humanity which have flowed from this source along the course of the history of christian nations our worst imaginations of hell would pale beside the vision  a thousand times no it ought not to be unpleasant to say that which one honestly believes or disbelieves that it so constantly is painful to do so is quite enough obstacle to the progress of mankind in that most valuable of all qualities honesty of word or of deed without erecting a sad concomitant of human weakness into something to be admired and cherished the bravest of soldiers often and very naturally feel it unpleasant to go into action but a courtmartial which did its duty would make short work of the officer who promulgated the doctrine that his men ought to fell their duty unpleasant  i am very well aware as i suppose most thoughtful people are in these times that the process of breaking away from old beliefs is extremely unpleasant and i am much disposed to think that the encouragement the consolation and the peace afforded to earnest believers in even the worst forms of christianity are of great practical advantage to them what deductions must be made from this gain on the score of the harm done to the citizen by the ascetic otherworldliness of logical christianity to the ruler by the hatred malice and all uncharitableness of sectarian bigotry to the legislator by the spirit of exclusiveness and domination of those that count themselves pillars of orthodoxy to the philosopher by the restraints on the freedom of learning and teaching which every church exercises when it is strong enough to the conscientious soul by the introspective hunting after sins of the mint and cummin type the fear of theological error and the overpowering terror of possible damnation which have accompanied the churches like their shadow i need not now consider but they are assuredly not small if agnostics lose heavily on the one side they gain a good deal on the other people who talk about the comforts of belief appear to forget its discomforts they ignore the fact that the christianity of the churches is something more than faith in the ideal personality of jesus which they create for themselves plus so much as can be carried into practice without disorganising civil society of the maxims of the sermon on the mount trip in morals or in doctrine especially in doctrine without due repentance or retractation or fail to get properly baptized before you die and a plébiscite of the christians of europe if they were true to their creeds would affirm your everlasting damnation by an immense majority  preachers orthodox and heterodox din into our ears that the world cannot get on without faith of some sort there is a sense in which that is as eminently as obviously true there is another in which in my judgment it is as eminently as obviously false and it seems to me that the hortatory or pulpit mind is apt to oscillate between the false and the true meanings without being aware of the fact  it is quite true that the ground of every one of our actions and the validity of all our reasonings rest upon the great act of faith which leads us to take the experience of the past as a safe guide in our dealings with the present and the future from the nature of ratiocination it is obvious that the axioms on which it is based cannot be demonstrated by ratiocination it is also a trite observation that in the business of life we constantly take the most serious action upon evidence of an utterly insufficient character but it is surely plain that faith is not necessarily entitled to dispense with ratiocination because ratiocination cannot dispense with faith as a startingpoint and that because we are often obliged by the pressure of events to act on very bad evidence it does not follow that it is proper to act on such evidence when the pressure is absent  the writer of the epistle to the hebrews tells us that faith is the assurance of things hoped for the proving of things not seen in the authorised version substance stands for assurance and evidence for proving the question of the exact meaning of the two words greek hypostasis and greek elegchos affords a fine field of discussion for the scholar and the metaphysician but i fancy we shall be not far from the mark if we take the writer to have had in his mind the profound psychological truth that men constantly feel certain about things for which they strongly hope but have no evidence in the legal or logical sense of the word and he calls this feeling faith i may have the most absolute faith that a friend has not committed the crime of which he is accused in the early days of english history if my friend could have obtained a few more compurgators of a like robust faith he would have been acquitted at the present day if i tendered myself as a witness on that score the judge would tell me to stand down and the youngest barrister would smile at my simplicity miserable indeed is the man who has not such faith in some of his fellowmenonly less miserable than the man who allows himself to forget that such faith is not strictly speaking evidence and when his faith is disappointed as will happen now and again turns timon and blames the universe for his own blunders and so if a man can find a friend the hypostasis of all his hopes the mirror of his ethical ideal in the jesus of any or all of the gospels let him live by faith in that ideal who shall or can forbid him but let him not delude himself with the notion that his faith is evidence of the objective reality of that in which he trusts such evidence is to be obtained only by the use of the methods of science as applied to history and to literature and it amounts at present to very little  it appears that mr gladstone some time ago asked mr laing if he could draw up a short summary of the negative creed a body of negative propositions which have so far been adopted on the negative side as to be what the apostles and other accepted creeds are on the positive and mr laing at once kindly obliged mr gladstone with the desired articleseight of them  if any one had preferred this request to me i should have replied that if he referred to agnostics they have no creed and by the nature of the case cannot have any agnosticism in fact is not a creed but a method the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle that principle is of great antiquity it is as old as socrates as old as the writer who said try all things hold fast by that which is good it is the foundation of the reformation which simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to give a reason for the faith that is in him it is the great principle of descartes it is the fundamental axiom of modern science positively the principle may be expressed in matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration and negatively in matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable that i take to be the agnostic faith which if a man keep whole and undefiled he shall not be ashamed to look the universe in the face whatever the future may have in store for him  the results of the working out of the agnostic principle will vary according to individual knowledge and capacity and according to the general condition of science that which is unproven today may be proven by the help of new discoveries tomorrow the only negative fixed points will be those negations which flow from the demonstrable limitation of our faculties and the only obligation accepted is to have the mind always open to conviction agnostics who never fail in carrying out their principles are i am afraid as rare as other people of whom the same consistency can be truthfully predicated but if you were to meet with such a phoenix and to tell him that you had discovered that two and two make five he would patiently ask you to state your reasons for that conviction and express his readiness to agree with you if he found them satisfactory the apostolic injunction to suffer fools gladly should be the rule of life of a true agnostic i am deeply conscious how far i myself fall short of this ideal but it is my personal conception of what agnostics ought to be  however as i began by stating i speak only for myself and i do not dream of anathematizing and excommunicating mr laing but when i consider his creed and compare it with the athanasian i think i have on the whole a clearer conception of the meaning of the latter polarity in article viii for example is a word about which i heard a good deal in my youth when naturphilosophie was in fashion and greatly did i suffer from it for many years past whenever i have met with polarity anywhere but in a discussion of some purely physical topic such as magnetism i have shut the book mr laing must excuse me if the force of habit was too much for me when i read his eighth article  and now what is to be said to mr harrisons remarkable deliverance on the future of agnosticism 63 i would that it were not my business to say anything for i am afraid i can say nothing which shall manifest my great personal respect for this able writer and for the zeal and energy with which he ever and anon galvanises the weakly frame of positivism until it looks more than ever like john bunyans pope and pagan rolled into one there is a story often repeated and i am afraid none the less mythical on that account of a valiant and loudvoiced corporal in command of two full privates who falling in with a regiment of the enemy in the dark orders it to surrender under pain of instant annihilation by his force and the enemy surrenders accordingly i am always reminded of this tale when i read the positivist commands to the forces of christianity and of science only the enemy show no more signs of intending to obey now than they have done any time these forty years  the allocution under consideration has a certain papal flavour mr harrison speaks with authority and not as one of the common scribes of the period he knows not only what agnosticism is and how it has come about but what will become of it the agnostic is to content himself with being the precursor of the positivist in his place as a sort of navvy levelling the ground and cleansing it of such poor stuff as christianity he is a useful creature who deserves patting on the back on condition that he does not venture beyond his last but let not these scientific sanballats presume that they are good enough to take part in the building of the templethey are mere samaritans doomed to die out in proportion as the religion of humanity is accepted by mankind well if that is their fate they have time to be cheerful but let us hear mr harrisons pronouncement of their doom  agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion an entirely negative stage the point reached by physicists a purely mental conclusion with no relation to things social at all p 154 i am quite dazed by this declaration are there then any conclusions that are not purely mental is there no relation to things social in mental conclusions which affect mens whole conception of life was that prince of agnostics david hume particularly imbued with physical science supposing physical science to be nonexistent would not the agnostic principle applied by the philologist and the historian lead to exactly the same results is the modern more or less complete suspension of judgment as to the facts of the history of regal rome or the real origin of the homeric poems anything but agnosticism in history and in literature and if so how can agnosticism be the mere negation of the physicist  agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion no two people agree as to what is meant by the term religion but if it means as i think it ought to mean simply the reverence and love for the ethical ideal and the desire to realise that ideal in life which every man ought to feelthen i say agnosticism has no more to do with it than it has to do with music or painting if on the other hand mr harrison like most people means by religion theology then in my judgment agnosticism can be said to be a stage in its evolution only as death may be said to be the final stage in the evolution of life       when agnostic logic is simply one of the canons of thought      agnosticism as a distinctive faith will have spontaneously      disappeared p 155  i can but marvel that such sentences as this and those already quoted should have proceeded from mr harrisons pen does he really mean to suggest that agnostics have a logic peculiar to themselves will lie kindly help me out of my bewilderment when i try to think of logic being anything else than the canon which i believe means rule of thought as to agnosticism being a distinctive faith i have already shown that it cannot possibly be anything of the kind unless perfect faith in logic is distinctive of agnostics which after all it may be       agnosticism as a religious philosophy per se rests on an      almost total ignoring of history and social evolution p      152  but neither per se nor per aliud has agnosticism if i know anything about it the least pretension to be a religious philosophy so far from resting on ignorance of history and that social evolution of which history is the account it is and has been the inevitable result of the strict adherence to scientific methods by historical investigators our forefathers were quite confident about the existence of romulus and remus of king arthur and of hengist and horsa most of us have become agnostics in regard to the reality of these worthies it is a matter of notoriety of which mr harrison who accuses us all so freely of ignoring history should not be ignorant that the critical process which has shattered the foundations of orthodox christian doctrine owes its origin not to the devotees of physical science but before all to richard simon the learned french oratorian just two hundred years ago i cannot find evidence that either simon or any one of the great scholars and critics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who have continued simons work had any particular acquaintance with physical science i have already pointed out that hume was independent of it and certainly one of the most potent influences in the same direction upon history in the present century that of grote did not come from the physical side physical science in fact has had nothing directly to do with the criticism of the gospels it is wholly incompetent to furnish demonstrative evidence that any statement made in these histories is untrue indeed modern physiology can find parallels in nature for events of apparently the most eminently supernatural kind recounted in some of those histories  it is a comfort to hear upon mr harrisons authority that the laws of physical nature show no signs of becoming less definite less consistent or less popular as time goes on p 154 how a law of nature is to become indefinite or inconsistent passes my poor powers of imagination but with universal suffrage and the coachdog theory of premiership in full view the theory i mean that the whole duty of a political chief is to look sharp for the way the social coach is driving and then run in front and bark loudas if being the leading noisemaker and guiding were the same thingsit is truly satisfactory to me to know that the laws of nature are increasing in popularity looking at recent developments of the policy which is said to express the great heart of the people i have had my doubts of the fact and my love for my fellowcountrymen has led me to reflect with dread on what will happen to them if any of the laws of nature ever become so unpopular in their eyes as to be voted down by the transcendent authority of universal suffrage if the legion of demons before they set out on their journey in the swine had had time to hold a meeting and to resolve unanimously that the law of gravitation is oppressive and ought to be repealed i am afraid it would have made no sort of difference to the result when their two thousand unwilling porters were once launched down the steep slopes of the fatal shore of gennesaret       the question of the place of religion as an element of human      nature as a force of human society its origin analysis      and functions has never been considered at all from an      agnostic point of view p 152  i doubt not that mr harrison knows vastly more about history than i do in fact he tells the public that some of my friends and i have had no opportunity of occupying ourselves with that subject i do not like to contradict any statement which mr harrison makes on his own authority only if i may be true to my agnostic principles i humbly ask how he has obtained assurance on this head i do not profess to know anything about the range of mr harrisons studies but as he has thought it fitting to start the subject i may venture to point out that on evidence adduced it might be equally permissible to draw the conclusion that mr harrisons other labours have not allowed him to acquire that acquaintance with the methods and results of physical science or with the history of philosophy or of philological and historical criticism which is essential to any one who desires to obtain a right understanding of agnosticism incompetence in philosophy and in all branches of science except mathematics is the wellknown mental characteristic of the founder of positivism faithfulness in disciples is an admirable quality in itself the pity is that it not unfrequently leads to the imitation of the weaknesses as well as of the strength of the master it is only such overfaithfulness which can account for a strong mind really saturated with the historical sense p 153 exhibiting the extraordinary forgetfulness of the historical fact of the existence of david hume implied by the assertion that       it would be difficult to name a single known agnostic who      has given to history anything like the amount of thought and      study which he brings to a knowledge of the physical world      p 153  whoso calls to mind what i may venture to term the bright side of christianitythat ideal of manhood with its strength and its patience its justice and its pity for human frailty its helpfulness to the extremity of selfsacrifice its ethical purity and nobility which apostles have pictured in which armies of martyrs have placed their unshakable faith and whence obscure men and women like catherine of sienna and john knox have derived the courage to rebuke popes and kingsis not likely to underrate the importance of the christian faith as a factor in human history or to doubt that if that faith should prove to be incompatible with our knowledge or necessary want of knowledge some other hypostasis of mens hopes genuine enough and worthy enough to replace it will arise but that the incongruous mixture of bad science with eviscerated papistry out of which comte manufactured the positivist religion will be the heir of the christian ages i have too much respect for the humanity of the future to believe charles the second told his brother they will not kill me james to make you king and if critical science is remorselessly destroying the historical foundations of the noblest ideal of humanity which mankind have yet worshipped it is little likely to permit the pitiful reality to climb into the vacant shrine  that a man should determine to devote himself to the service of humanityincluding intellectual and moral selfculture under that name that this should be in the proper sense of the word his religionis not only an intelligible but i think a laudable resolution and i am greatly disposed to believe that it is the only religion which will prove itself to be unassailably acceptable so long as the human race endures but when the comtist asks me to worship humanitythat is to say to adore the generalised conception of men as they ever have been and probably ever will bei must reply that i could just as soon bow down and worship the generalised conception of a wilderness of apes surely we are not going back to the days of paganism when individual men were deified and the hard good sense of a dying vepasian could prompt the bitter jest ut puto deus fio no divinity doth hedge a modern man be he even a sovereign ruler nor is there any one except a municipal magistrate who is officially declared worshipful but if there is no spark of worshipworthy divinity in the individual twigs of humanity whence comes that godlike splendour which the moses of positivism fondly imagines to pervade the whole bush  i know no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the evolution of humanity as it is set forth in the annals of history out of the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the marks of his lowly origin strong upon him he is a brute only more intelligent than the other brutes a blind prey to impulses which as often as not lead him to destruction a victim to endless illusions which make his mental existence a terror and a burden and fill his physical life with barren toil and battle he attains a certain degree of physical comfort and develops a more or less workable theory of life in such favourable situations as the plains of mesopotamia or of egypt and then for thousands and thousands of years struggles with varying fortunes attended by infinite wickedness bloodshed and misery to maintain himself at this point against the greed and the ambition of his fellowmen he makes a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all those who first try to get him to move on and when he has moved on a step foolishly confers postmortem deification on his victims he exactly repeats the process with all who want to move a step yet farther and the best men of the best epochs are simply those who make the fewest blunders and commit the fewest sins  that one should rejoice in the good man forgive the bad man and pity and help all men to the best of ones ability is surely indisputable it is the glory of judaism and of christianity to have proclaimed this truth through all their aberrations but the worship of a god who needs forgiveness and help and deserves pity every hour of his existence is no better than that of any other voluntarily selected fetish the emperor julians project was hopeful in comparison with the prospects of the comtist anthropolatry  when the historian of religion in the twentieth century is writing about the nineteenth i foresee he will say something of this kind  the most curious and instructive events in the religious history of the preceding century are the rise and progress of two new sects called mormons and positivists to the student who has carefully considered these remarkable phenomena nothing in the records of religious selfdelusion can appear improbable  the mormons arose in the midst of the great republic which though comparatively insignificant at that time in territory as in the number of its citizens was as we know from the fragments of the speeches of its orators which have come down to us no less remarkable for the native intelligence of its population than for the wide extent of their information owing to the activity of their publishers in diffusing all that they could invent beg borrow or steal nor were they less noted for their perfect freedom from all restraints in thought or speech or deed except to be sure the beneficent and wise influence of the majority exerted in case of need through an institution known as tarring and feathering the exact nature of which is now disputed  there is a complete consensus of testimony that the founder of mormonism one joseph smith was a lowminded ignorant scamp and that he stole the scriptures which he propounded not being clever enough to forge even such contemptible stuff as they contain nevertheless he must have been a man of some force of character for a considerable number of disciples soon gathered about him in spite of repeated outbursts of popular hatred and violenceduring one of which persecutions smith was brutally murderedthe mormon body steadily increased and became a flourishing community but the mormon practices being objectionable to the majority they were more than once without any pretence of law but by force of riot arson and murder driven away from the land they had occupied harried by these persecutions the mormon body eventually committed itself to the tender mercies of a desert as barren as that of sinai and after terrible sufferings and privations reached the oasis of utah here it grew and flourished sending out missionaries to and receiving converts from all parts of europe sometimes to the number of 10000 in a year until in 1880 the rich and flourishing community numbered 110000 souls in utah alone while there were probably 30000 or 40000 scattered abroad elsewhere in the whole history of religions there is no more remarkable example of the power of faith and in this case the founder of that faith was indubitably a most despicable creature it is interesting to observe that the course taken by the great republic and its citizens runs exactly parallel with that taken by the roman empire and its citizens towards the early christians except that the romans had a certain legal excuse for their acts of violence inasmuch as the christian sodalitia were not licensed and consequently were ipso facto illegal assemblages until in the latter part of the nineteenth century the united states legislature decreed the illegality of polygamy the mormons were wholly within the law  nothing can present a greater contrast to all this than the history of the postivists this sect arose much about the same time as that of the mormons in the upper and most instructed stratum of the quickwitted sceptical population of paris the founder auguste comte was a teacher of mathematics but of no eminence in that department of knowledge and with nothing but an amateurs acquaintance with physical chemical and biological science his works are repulsive on account of the dull diffuseness of their style and a certain air as of a superior person which characterises them but nevertheless they contain good things here and there it would take too much space to reproduce in detail a system which proposes to regulate all human life by the promulgation of a gentile leviticus suffice it to say that m comte may be described as a syncretic who like the gnostics of early church history attempted to combine the substance of imperfectly comprehended contemporary science with the form of roman christianity it may be that this is the reason why his disciples were so very angry with some obscure people called agnostics whose views if we may judge by the account left in the works of a great positivist controversial writer were very absurd  to put the matter briefly m comte finding christianity and science at daggers drawn seems to have said to science you find christianity rotten at the core do you well i will scoop out the inside of it and to romanism you find science mere dry lightcold and bare well i will put your shell over it and so as schoolboys make a spectre out of a turnip and a tallow candle behold the new religion of humanity complete  unfortunately neither the romanists nor the people who were something more than amateurs in science could be got to worship m comtes new idol properly in the native country of positivism one distinguished man of letters and one of science for a time helped to make up a roomful of the faithful but their love soon grew cold in england on the other hand there appears to be little doubt that in the ninth decade of the century the multitude of disciples reached the grand total of several score they had the advantage of the advocacy of one or two most eloquent and learned apostles and at any rate the sympathy of several persons of light and leading and if they were not seen they were heard all over the world on the other hand as a sect they laboured under the prodigious disadvantage of being refined estimable people living in the midst of the wornout civilisation of the old world where any one who had tried to persecute them as the mormons were persecuted would have been instantly hanged but the majority never dreamed of persecuting them on the contrary they were rather given to scold and otherwise try the patience of the majority  the history of these sects in the closing years of the century is highly instructive mormonism   but i find i have suddenly slipped off mr harrisons tripod which i had borrowed for the occasion the fact is i am not equal to the prophetical business and ought not to have undertaken it                                       it did not occur to me while writing the latter part of this essay that it could be needful to disclaim the intention of putting the religious system of comte on a level with mormonism and i was unaware of the fact that mr harrison rejects the greater part of the positivist religion as taught by comte i have therefore erased one or two passages which implied his adherence to the religion of humanity as developed by comte 1893  footnotes       51 see the official report of the church congress held           at manchester october 1888 pp 253 254       52 in this place and in the eleventh essay there are           references to the late archbishop of york which are of           no importance to my main argument and which i have           expunged because i desire to obliterate the traces of a           temporary misunderstanding with a man of rare ability           candour and wit for whom i entertained a great liking           and no less respect i rejoice to think now of the           then bishops cordial hail the first time we met           after our little skirmish well is it to be peace or           war i replied a little of both but there was only           peace when we parted and ever after       53 dr wace tells us it may be asked how far we can rely           on the accounts we possess of our lords teaching on           these subjects and he seems to think the question           appropriately answered by the assertion that it ought           to be regarded as settled by m renans practical           surrender of the adverse case i thought i knew m           renans works pretty well but i have contrived to miss           this practical i wish dr wace had defined the scope           of that useful adjective surrender however as dr           wace can find no difficulty in pointing out the passage           of m renans writings by which he feels justified in           making his statement i shall wait for further           enlightenment contenting myself for the present with           remarking that if m renan were to retract and do           penance in notredame tomorrow for any contributions           to biblical criticism that may be specially his           property the main results of that criticism as they           are set forth in the works of strauss baur reuss and           volkmar for example would not be sensibly affected       54 see de gobineau les religions et les philosophies           dans lasie centrale and the recently published work           of mr eg browne the episode of the bab       55 here as always the revised version is cited       56 does any one really mean to say that there is any           internal or external criterion by which the reader of a           biblical statement in which scientific matter is           contained is enabled to judge whether it is to betaken           au sérieux or not is the account of the deluge           accepted as true in the new testament less precise and           specific than that of the call of abraham also           accepted as true therein by what mark does the story           of the feeding with manna in the wilderness which           involves some very curious scientific problems show           that it is meant merely for edification while the           story of the inscription of the law on stone by the           hand of jahveh is literally true if the story of the           fall is not the true record of an historical           occurrence what becomes of pauline theology yet the           story of the fall as directly conflicts with           probability and is as devoid of trustworthy evidence           as that of the creation or that of the deluge with           which it forms an harmoniously legendary series       57 see for an admirable discussion of the whole subject           dr abbotts article on the gospels in the           encyclopædia britannica and the remarkable monograph           by professor volkmar jesus nazarenus und die erste           christliche zeit 1882 whether we agree with the           conclusions of these writers or not the method of           critical investigation which they adopt is           unimpeachable       58 notwithstanding the hard words shot at me from behind           the hedge of anonymity by a writer in a recent number           of the quarterly review i repeat without the           slightest fear of refutation that the four gospels as           they have come to us are the work of unknown writers       59 their arguments in the long run are always reducible           to one form otherwise trustworthy witnesses affirm           that such and such events took place these events are           inexplicable except the agency of spirits is           admitted therefore spirits were the cause of the           phenomena            and the heads of the reply are always the same           remember goethes aphorism alles factische ist schon           theorie trustworthy witnesses are constantly           deceived or deceive themselves in their           interpretation of sensible phenomena no one can prove           that the sensible phenomena in these cases could be           caused only by the agency of spirits and there is           abundant ground for believing that they may be produced           in other ways therefore the utmost that can be           reasonably asked for on the evidence as it stands is           suspension of judgment and on the necessity for even           that suspension reasonable men may differ according           to their views of probability       60 yet i must somehow have laid hold of the pith of the           matter for many years afterwards when dean mansels           bampton lectures were published it seemed to me i           already knew all that this eminently agnostic thinker           had to tell me       61 kritik der reinen vernunft edit hartenstein p 256       62 report of the church congress manchester 1888 p 252       63 fortnightly review jan 1889     viii agnosticism a rejoinder  1889   those who passed from dr waces article in the last number of the nineteenth century to the anticipatory confutation of it which followed in the new reformation must have enjoyed the pleasure of a dramatic surprisejust as when the fifth act of a new play proves unexpectedly bright and interesting mrs ward will i hope pardon the comparison if i say that her effective clearing away of antiquated incumbrances from the lists of the controversy reminds me of nothing so much as of the action of some neathanded but strongwristed phyllis who gracefully wielding her longhandled turks head sweeps away the accumulated results of the toil of generations of spiders i am the more indebted to this luminous sketch of the results of critical investigation as it is carried out among these theologians who are men of science and not mere counsel for creeds since it has relieved me from the necessity of dealing with the greater part of dr waces polemic and enables me to devote more space to the really important issues which have been raised64  perhaps however it may be well for me to observe that approbation of the manner in which a great biblical scholar for instance reuss does his work does not commit me to the adoption of all or indeed any of his views and further that the disagreements of a series of investigators do not in any way interfere with the fact that each of them has made important contributions to the body of truth ultimately established if i cite buffon linnæus lamarck and cuvier as having each and all taken a leading share in building up modern biology the statement that every one of these great naturalists disagreed with and even more or less contradicted all the rest is quite true but the supposition that the latter assertion is in any way inconsistent with the former would betray a strange ignorance of the manner in which all true science advances  dr wace takes a great deal of trouble to make it appear that i have desired to evade the real questions raised by his attack upon me at the church congress i assure the reverend principal that in this as in some other respects he has entertained a very erroneous conception of my intentions things would assume more accurate proportions in dr waces mind if he would kindly remember that it is just thirty years since ecclesiastical thunderbolts began to fly about my ears i have had the lion and the bear to deal with and it is long since i got quite used to the threatenings of episcopal goliaths whose croziers were like unto a weavers beam so that i almost think i might not have noticed dr waces attack personal as it was and although as he is good enough to tell us separate copies are to be had for the modest equivalent of twopence as a matter of fact it did not come under my notice for a long time after it was made may i further venture to point out that reckoning postage the expenditure of twopencehalfpenny or at the most threepence would have enabled dr wace so far to comply with ordinary conventions as to direct my attention to the fact that he had attacked me before a meeting at which i was not present i really am not responsible for the five months neglect of which dr wace complains singularly enough the englishry who swarmed about the engadine during the three months that i was being brought back to life by the glorious air and perfect comfort of the maloja did not in my hearing say anything about the important events which had taken place at the church congress and i think i can venture to affirm that there was not a single copy of dr waces pamphlet in any of the hotel libraries which i rummaged in search of something more edifying than dull english or questionable french novels  and now having as i hope set myself right with the public as regards the sins of commission and omission with which i have been charged i feel free to deal with matters to which time and type may be more profitably devoted  i believe that there is not a solitary argument i have used or that i am about to use which is original or has anything to do with the fact that i have been chiefly occupied with natural science they are all facts and reasoning alike either identical with or consequential upon propositions which are to be found in the works of scholars and theologians of the highest repute in the only two countries holland and germany65 in which at the present time professors of theology are to be found whose tenure of their posts does not depend upon the results to which their inquiries lead them66 it is true that to the best of my ability i have satisfied myself of the soundness of the foundations on which my arguments are built and i desire to be held fully responsible for everything i say but nevertheless nay position is really no more than that of an expositor and my justification for undertaking it is simply that conviction of the supremacy of private judgment indeed of the impossibility of escaping it which is the foundation of the protestant reformation and which was the doctrine accepted by the vast majority of the anglicans of my youth before that backsliding towards the beggarly rudiments of an effete and idolatrous sacerdotalism which has even now provided us with the saddest spectacle which has been offered to the eyes of englishmen in this generation a high court of ecclesiastical jurisdiction with a host of great lawyers in battle array is and for heaven knows how long will be occupied with these very questions of washing of cups and pots and brazen vessels which the master whose professed representatives are rending the church over these squabbles had in his mind when as we are told he uttered the scathing rebuke      well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written         this people honoureth me with their lips         but their heart is far from me         but in vain do they worship me         teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men                                           mark vii 67  men who can be absorbed in bickerings over miserable disputes of this kind can have but little sympathy with the old evangelical doctrine of the open bible or anything but a grave misgiving of the results of diligent reading of the bible without the help of ecclesiastical spectacles by the mass of the people greatly to the surprise of many of my friends i have always advocated the reading of the bible and the diffusion of the study of that most remarkable collection of books among the people its teachings are so infinitely superior to those of the sects who are just as busy now as the pharisees were eighteen hundred years ago in smothering them under the precepts of men it is so certain to my mind that the bible contains within itself the refutation of ninetenths of the mixture of sophistical metaphysics and oldworld superstition which has been piled round it by the socalled christians of later times it is so clear that the only immediate and ready antidote to the poison which has been mixed with christianity to the intoxication and delusion of mankind lies in copious draughts from the undefiled spring that i exercise the right and duty of free judgment on the part of every man mainly for the purpose of inducing other laymen to follow my example if the new testament is translated into zulu by protestant missionaries it must be assumed that a zulu convert is competent to draw from its contents all the truths which it is necessary for him to believe i trust that i may without immodesty claim to be put on the same footing as a zulu  the most constant reproach which is launched against persons of my way of thinking is that it is all very well for us to talk about the deductions of scientific thought but what are the poor and the uneducated to do has it ever occurred to those who talk in this fashion that their creeds and the articles of their several confessions their determination of the exact nature and extent of the teachings of jesus their expositions of the real meaning of that which is written in the epistles to leave aside all questions concerning the old testament are nothing more than deductions which at any rate profess to be the result of strictly scientific thinking and which are not worth attending to unless they really possess that character if it is not historically true that such and such things happened in palestine eighteen centuries ago what becomes of christianity and what is historical truth but that of which the evidence bears strict scientific investigation i do not call to mind any problem of natural science which has come under my notice which is more difficult or more curiously interesting as a mere problem than that of the origin of the synoptic gospels and that of the historical value of the narratives which they contain the christianity of the churches stands or falls by the results of the purely scientific investigation of these questions they were first taken up in a purely scientific spirit about a century ago they have been studied over and over again by men of vast knowledge and critical acumen but he would be a rash man who should assert that any solution of these problems as yet formulated is exhaustive the most that can be said is that certain prevalent solutions are certainly false while others are more or less probably true  if i am doing my best to rouse my countrymen out of their dogmatic slumbers it is not that they may be amused by seeing who gets the best of it in a contest between a scientist and a theologian the serious question is whether theological men of science or theological special pleaders are to have the confidence of the general public it is the question whether a country in which it is possible for a body of excellent clerical and lay gentlemen to discuss in public meeting assembled how much it is desirable to let the congregations of the faithful know of the results of biblical criticism is likely to wake up with anything short of the grasp of a rough lay hand upon its shoulder it is the question whether the new testament books being as i believe they were written and compiled by people who according to their lights were perfectly sincere will not when properly studied as ordinary historical documents afford us the means of selfcriticism and it must be remembered that the new testament books are not responsible for the doctrine invented by the churches that they are anything but ordinary historical documents the author of the third gospel tells us as straightforwardly as a man can that he has no claim to any other character than that of an ordinary compiler and editor who had before him the works of many and variously qualified predecessors                                       in my former papers according to dr wace i have evaded giving an answer to his main proposition which he states as follows       apart from all disputed points of criticism no one      practically doubts that our lord lived and that he died on      the cross in the most intense sense of filial relation to      his father in heaven and that he bore testimony to that      fathers providence love and grace towards mankind the      lords prayer affords a sufficient evidence on these points      if the sermon on the mount alone be added the whole unseen      world of which the agnostic refuses to know anything      stands unveiled before us if jesus christ preached that      sermon made those promises and taught that prayer then      any one who says that we know nothing of god or of a future      life or of an unseen world says that he does not believe      jesus christ pp 354355  again       the main question at issue in a word is one which      professor huxley has chosen to leave entirely on one      sidewhether namely allowing for the utmost uncertainty      on other points of the criticism to which he appeals there      is any reasonable doubt that the lords prayer and the      sermon on the mount afford a true account of our lords      essential belief and cardinal teaching p 355  i certainly was not aware that i had evaded the questions here stated indeed i should say that i have indicated my reply to them pretty clearly but as dr wace wants a plainer answer he shall certainly be gratified if as dr wace declares it is his whole case is involved in the argument as stated in the latter of these two extracts so much the worse for his whole case for i am of opinion that there is the gravest reason for doubting whether the sermon on the mount was ever preached and whether the socalled lords prayer was ever prayed by jesus of nazareth my reasons for this opinion are among others thesethere is now no doubt that the three synoptic gospels so far from being the work of three independent writers are closely interdependent67 and that in one of two ways either all three contain as their foundation versions to a large extent verbally identical of one and the same tradition or two of them are thus closely dependent on the third and the opinion of the majority of the best critics has of late years more and more converged towards the conviction that our canonical second gospel the socalled marks gospel is that which most closely represents the primitive groundwork of the three68 that i take to be one of the most valuable results of new testament criticism of immeasurably greater importance than the discussion about dates and authorship  but if as i believe to be the case beyond any rational doubt or dispute the second gospel is the nearest extant representative of the oldest tradition whether written or oral how comes it that it contains neither the sermon on the mount nor the lords prayer those typical embodiments according to dr wace of the essential belief and cardinal teaching of jesus not only does marks gospel fail to contain the sermon on the mount or anything but a very few of the sayings contained in that collection but at the point of the history of jesus where the sermon occurs in matthew there is in mark an apparently unbroken narrative from the calling of james and john to the healing of simons wifes mother thus the oldest tradition not only ignores the sermon on the mount but by implication raises a probability against its being delivered when and where the later matthew inserts it in his compilation  and still more weighty is the fact that the third gospel the author of which tells us that he wrote after many others had taken in hand the same enterprise who should therefore have known the first gospel if it existed and was bound to pay to it the deference due to the work of an apostolic eyewitness if he had any reason for thinking it was sothis writer who exhibits far more literary competence than the other two ignores any sermon on the mount such as that reported by matthew just as much as the oldest authority does yet luke has a great many passages identical or parallel with those in matthews sermon on the mount which are for the most part scattered about in a totally different connection  interposed however between the nomination of the apostles and a visit to capernaum occupying therefore a place which answers to that of the sermon on the mount in the first gospel there is in the third gospel a discourse which is as closely similar to the sermon on the mount in some particulars as it is widely unlike it in others  this discourse is said to have been delivered in a plain or level place luke vi 17 and by way of distinction we may call it the sermon on the plain  i see no reason to doubt that the two evangelists are dealing to a considerable extent with the same traditional material and a comparison of the two sermons suggests very strongly that lukes version is the earlier the correspondences between the two forbid the notion that they are independent they both begin with a series of blessings some of which are almost verbally identical in the middle of each luke vi 2738 matt v 4348 there is a striking exposition of the ethical spirit of the command given in leviticus xix 18 and each ends with a passage containing the declaration that a tree is to be known by its fruit and the parable of the house built on the sand but while there are only 29 verses in the sermon on the plain there are 107 in the sermon on the mount the excess in length of the latter being chiefly due to the long interpolations one of 30 verses before and one of 34 verses after the middlemost parallelism with luke under these circumstances it is quite impossible to admit that there is more probability that matthews version of the sermon is historically accurate than there is that lukes version is so and they cannot both be accurate  luke either knew the collection of looselyconnected and aphoristic utterances which appear under the name of the sermon on the mount in matthew or he did not if he did not he must have been ignorant of the existence of such a document as our canonical matthew a fact which does not make for the genuineness or the authority of that book if he did he has shown that he does not care for its authority on a matter of fact of no small importance and that does not permit us to conceive that he believed the first gospel to be the work of an authority to whom he ought to defer let alone that of an apostolic eyewitness  the tradition of the church about the second gospel which i believe to be quite worthless but which is all the evidence there is for marks authorship would have us believe that mark was little more than the mouthpiece of the apostle peter consequently we are to suppose that peter either did not know or did not care very much for that account of the essential belief and cardinal teaching of jesus which is contained in the sermon on the mount and certainly he could not have shared dr waces view of its importance69  i thought that all fairly attentive and intelligent students of the gospels to say nothing of theologians of reputation knew these things but how can any one who does know them have the conscience to ask whether there is any reasonable doubt that the sermon on the mount was preached by jesus of nazareth if conjecture is permissible where nothing else is possible the most probable conjecture seems to be that matthew having a cento of sayings attributedrightly or wrongly it is impossible to sayto jesus among his materials thought they were or might be records of a continuous discourse and put them in at the place he thought likeliest ancient historians of the highest character saw no harm in composing long speeches which never were spoken and putting them into the mouths of statesmen and warriors and i presume that whoever is represented by matthew would have been grievously astonished to find that any one objected to his following the example of the best models accessible to him  so with the lords prayer absent in our representative of the oldest tradition it appears in both matthew and luke there is reason to believe that every pious jew at the commencement of our era prayed three times a day according to a formula which is embodied in the present schmoneesre70 of the jewish prayerbook jesus who was assuredly in all respects a pious jew whatever else he may have been doubtless did the same whether he modified the current formula or whether the socalled lords prayer is the prayer substituted for the schmoneesre in the congregations of the gentiles is a question which can hardly be answered  in a subsequent passage of dr waces article p 356 he adds to the list of the verities which he imagines to be unassailable the story of the passion i am not quite sure what he means by this i am not aware that any one with the exception of certain ancient heretics has propounded doubts as to the reality of the crucifixion and certainly i have no inclination to argue about the precise accuracy of every detail of that pathetic story of suffering and wrong but if dr wace means as i suppose he does that that which according to the orthodox view happened after the crucifixion and which is in a dogmatic sense the most important part of the story is founded on solid historical proofs i must beg leave to express a diametrically opposite conviction  what do we find when the accounts of the events in question contained in the three synoptic gospels are compared together in the oldest there is a simple straightforward statement which for anything that i have to urge to the contrary may he exactly true in the other two there is round this possible and probable nucleus a mass of accretions of the most questionable character  the cruelty of death by crucifixion depended very much upon its lingering character if there were a support for the weight of the body as not unfrequently was the practice the pain during the first hours of the infliction was not necessarily extreme nor need any serious physical symptoms at once arise from the wounds made by the nails in the hands and feet supposing they were nailed which was not invariably the case when exhaustion set in and hunger thirst and nervous irritation had done their work the agony of the sufferer must have been terrible and the more terrible that in the absence of any effectual disturbance of the machinery of physical life it might be prolonged for many hours or even days temperate strong men such as were the ordinary galilean peasants might live for several days on the cross it is necessary to bear these facts in mind when we read the account contained in the fifteenth chapter of the second gospel  jesus was crucified at the third hour xv 25 and the narrative seems to imply that he died immediately after the ninth hour v 34 in this case he would have been crucified only six hours and the time spent on the cross cannot have been much longer because joseph of arimathæa must have gone to pilate made his preparations and deposited the body in the rockcut tomb before sunset which at that time of the year was about the twelfth hour that any one should die after only six hours crucifixion could not have been at all in accordance with pilates large experience of the effects of that method of punishment it therefore quite agrees with what might be expected that pilate marvelled if he were already dead and required to be satisfied on this point by the testimony of the roman officer who was in command of the execution party those who have paid attention to the extraordinary difficult question what are the indisputable signs of deathwill be able to estimate the value of the opinion of a rough soldier on such a subject even if his report to the procurator were in no wise affected by the fact that the friend of jesus who anxiously awaited his answer was a man of influence and of wealth  the inanimate body wrapped in linen was deposited in a spacious71 cool rock chamber the entrance of which was closed not by a wellfitting door but by a stone rolled against the opening which would of course allow free passage of air a little more than thirtysix hours afterwards friday 6 pm to sunday 6 am or a little after three women visit the tomb and find it empty and they are told by a young man arrayed in a white robe that jesus is gone to his native country of galilee and that the disciples and peter will find him there  thus it stands plainly recorded in the oldest tradition that for any evidence to the contrary the sepulchre may have been emptied at any time during the friday or saturday nights if it is said that no jew would have violated the sabbath by taking the former course it is to be recollected that joseph of arimathæa might well be familiar with that wise and liberal interpretation of the fourth commandment which permitted works of mercy to mennay even the drawing of an ox or an ass out of a piton the sabbath at any rate the saturday night was free to the most scrupulous of observers of the law  these are the facts of the case as stated by the oldest extant narrative of them i do not see why any one should have a word to say against the inherent probability of that narrative and for my part i am quite ready to accept it as an historical fact that so much and no more is positively known of the end of jesus of nazareth on what grounds can a reasonable man be asked to believe any more so far as the narrative in the first gospel on the one hand and those in the third gospel and the acts on the other go beyond what is stated in the second gospel they are hopelessly discrepant with one another and this is the more significant because the pregnant phrase some doubted in the first gospel is ignored in the third  but it is said that we have the witness paul speaking to us directly in the epistles there is little doubt that we have and a very singular witness he is according to his own showing paul in the vigour of his manhood with every means of becoming acquainted at first hand with the evidence of eyewitnesses not merely refused to credit them but persecuted the church of god and made havoc of it the reasoning of stephen fell dead upon the acute intellect of this zealot for the traditions of his fathers his eyes were blind to the ecstatic illumination of the martyrs countenance as it had been the face of an angel and when at the words behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god the murderous mob rushed upon and stoned the rapt disciple of jesus paul ostentatiously made himself their official accomplice  yet this strange man because he has a vision one day at once and with equally headlong zeal flies to the opposite pole of opinion and he is most careful to tell us that he abstained from any reexamination of the facts       immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither      went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before      me but i went away into arabia galatians i 16 17  i do not presume to quarrel with pauls procedure if it satisfied him that was his affair and if it satisfies anyone else i am not called upon to dispute the right of that person to be satisfied but i certainly have the right to say that it would not satisfy me in like case that i should be very much ashamed to pretend that it could or ought to satisfy me and that i can entertain but a very low estimate of the value of the evidence of people who are to be satisfied in this fashion when questions of objective fact in which their faith is interested are concerned so that when i am called upon to believe a great deal more than the oldest gospel tells me about the final events of the history of jesus on the authority of paul 1 corinthians xv 58 i must pause did he think it at any subsequent time worth while to confer with flesh and blood or in modern phrase to reexamine the facts for himself or was he ready to accept anything that fitted in with his preconceived ideas does he mean when he speaks of all the appearances of jesus after the crucifixion as if they were of the same kind that they were all visions like the manifestation to himself and finally how is this account to be reconciled with those in the first and third gospelswhich as we have seen disagree with one another  until these questions are satisfactorily answered i am afraid that so far as i am concerned pauls testimony cannot be seriously regarded except as it may afford evidence of the state of traditional opinion at the time at which he wrote say between 55 and 60 ad that is more than twenty years after the event a period much more than sufficient for the development of any amount of mythology about matters of which nothing was really known a few years later among the contemporaries and neighbours of the jews and if the most probable interpretation of the apocalypse can he trusted among the followers of jesus also it was fully believed in spite of all the evidence to the contrary that the emperor nero was not really dead but that he was hidden away somewhere in the east and would speedily come again at the head of a great army to be revenged upon his enemies72  thus i conceive that i have shown cause for the opinion that dr waces challenge touching the sermon on the mount the lords prayer and the passion was more valorous than discreet after all this discussion i am still at the agnostic point tell me first what jesus can be proved to have been said and done and i will say whether i believe him or in him73 or not as dr wace admits that i have dissipated his lingering shade of unbelief about the bedevilment of the gadarene pigs he might have done something to help mine instead of that he manifests a total want of conception of the nature of the obstacles which impede the conversion of his infidels  the truth i believe to be that the difficulties in the way of arriving at a sure conclusion as to these matters from the sermon on the mount the lords prayer or any other data offered by the synoptic gospels and a fortiori from the fourth gospel are insuperable every one of these records is coloured by the prepossessions of those among whom the primitive traditions arose and of those by whom they were collected and edited and the difficulty of making allowance for these prepossessions is enhanced by our ignorance of the exact dates at which the documents were first put together of the extent to which they have been subsequently worked over and interpolated and of the historical sense or want of sense and the dogmatic tendencies of their compilers and editors let us see if there is any other road which will take us into something better than negation  there is a widespread notion that the primitive church while under the guidance of the apostles and their immediate successors was a sort of dogmatic dovecot pervaded by the most loving unity and doctrinal harmony protestants especially are fond of attributing to themselves the merit of being nearer the church of the apostles than their neighbours and they are the less to be excused for their strange delusion because they are great readers of the documents which prove the exact contrary the fact is that in the course of the first three centuries of its existence the church rapidly underwent a process of evolution of the most remarkable character the final stage of which is far more different from the first than anglicanism is from quakerism the key to the comprehension of the problem of the origin of that which is now called christianity and its relation to jesus of nazareth lies here nor can we arrive at any sound conclusion as to what it is probable that jesus actually said and did without being clear on this head by far the most important and subsequently influential steps in the evolution of christianity took place in the course of the century more or less which followed upon the crucifixion it is almost the darkest period of church history but most fortunately the beginning and the end of the period are brightly illuminated by the contemporary evidence of two writers of whose historical existence there is no doubt74 and against the genuineness of whose most important works there is no widelyadmitted objection these are justin the philosopher and martyr and paul the apostle to the gentiles i shall call upon these witnesses only to testify to the condition of opinion among those who called themselves disciples of jesus in their time  justin in his dialogue with trypho the jew which was written somewhere about the middle of the second century enumerates certain categories of persons who in his opinion will or will not be saved75 these are  1 orthodox jews who refuse to believe that those who do observe it to be heretics saved  2 jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ but who insist on the observance of the law by gentile converts not saved  3 jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ and hold that gentile converts need not observe the law saved in justins opinion but some of his fellowchristians think the contrary  4 gentile converts to the belief in jesus as the christ who observe the law saved possibly  5 gentile believers in jesus as the christ who do not observe the law themselves except so far as the refusal of idol sacrifices but do not consider those who do observe it heretics saved this is justins own view  6 gentile believers who do not observe the law except in refusing idol sacrifices and hold those who do observe it to be heretics saved  7 gentiles who believe jesus to be the christ and call themselves christians but who eat meats sacrificed to idols not saved  8 gentiles who disbelieve in jesus as the christ not saved  justin does not consider christians who believe in the natural birth of jesus of whom he implies that there is a respectable minority to be heretics though he himself strongly holds the preternatural birth of jesus and his preexistence as the logos or word he conceives the logos to be a second god inferior to the first unknowable god with respect to whom justin like philo is a complete agnostic the holy spirit is not regarded by justin as a separate personality and is often mixed up with the logos the doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul is for justin a heresy and he is as firm a believer in the resurrection of the body as in the speedy second coming and the establishment of the millennium  the pillar of the church in the middle of the second centurya muchtravelled native of samariawas certainly well acquainted with rome probably with alexandria and it is likely that he knew the state of opinion throughout the length and breadth of the christian world as well as any man of his time if the various categories above enumerated are arranged in a series thus                       justins christianity                         \                                            \ orthodox    judæochristianity     idolothytic judaism      \          christianity   paganism                             \       i     ii  iii  iv    v       vi  vii          viii  it is obvious that they form a gradational series from orthodox judaism on the extreme left to paganism whether philosophic or popular on the extreme right and it will further be observed that while justins conception of christianity is very broad he rigorously excludes two classes of persons who in his time called themselves christians namely those who insist on circumcision and other observances of the law on the part of gentile converts that is to say the strict judæochristians ii and on the other hand those who assert the lawfulness of eating meat offered to idolswhether they are gnostic or not vii these last i have called idolothytic christians because i cannot devise a better name not because it is strictly defensible etymologically  at the present moment i do not suppose there is an english missionary in any heathen land who would trouble himself whether the materials of his dinner had been previously offered to idols or not on the other hand i suppose there is no protestant sect within the pale of orthodoxy to say nothing of the roman and greek churches which would hesitate to declare the practice of circumcision and the observance of the jewish sabbath and dietary rules shockingly heretical  modern christianity has in fact not only shifted far to the right of justins position but it is of much narrower compass                               justin                      \                                                  \            judæochristianity   modern christianity  paganism judaism     \                   \                          \                                 \     i     ii    iii     iv        v   vi    vii     viii  for though it includes vii and even in saint and relic worship cuts a monstrous cantle out of paganism it excludes not only all judæochristians but all who doubt that such are heretics ever since the thirteenth century the inquisition would have cheerfully burned and in spain did abundantly burn all persons who came under the categories ii iii iv v and the wolf would play the same havoc now if it could only get its bloodstained jaws free from the muzzle imposed by the secular arm  further there is not a protestant body except the unitarian which would not declare justin himself a heretic on account of his doctrine of the inferior godship of the logos while i am very much afraid that in strict logic dr wace would be under the necessity so painful to him of calling him an infidel on the same and on other grounds  now let us turn to our other authority if there is any result of critical investigations of the sources of christianity which is certain76 it is that paul of tarsus wrote the epistle to the galatians somewhere between the years 55 and 60 ad that is to say roughly twenty or fiveandtwenty years after the crucifixion if this is so the epistle to the galatians is one of the oldest if not the very oldest of extant documentary evidences of the state of the primitive church and be it observed if it is pauls writing it unquestionably furnishes us with the evidence of a participator in the transactions narrated with the exception of two or three of the other pauline epistles there is not one solitary book in the new testament of the authorship and authority of which we have such good evidence  and what is the state of things we find disclosed a bitter quarrel in his account of which paul by no means minces matters or hesitates to hurl defiant sarcasms against those who were reputed to be pillars james the brother of the lord peter the rock on whom jesus is said to have built his church and john the beloved disciple and no deference toward the rock withholds paul from charging peter to his face with dissimulation  the subject of the hot dispute was simply this were gentile converts bound to obey the law or not paul answered in the negative and acting upon his opinion he had created at antioch and elsewhere a specifically christian community the sole qualifications for admission into which were the confession of the belief that jesus was the messiah and baptism upon that confession in the epistle in question paul puts thishis gospel as he calls itin its most extreme form not only does he deny the necessity of conformity with the law but he declares such conformity to have a negative value behold i paul say unto you that if ye receive circumcision christ will profit you nothing galatians v 2 he calls the legal observances beggarly rudiments and anathematises every one who preaches to the galatians any other gospel than his own that is to say by direct consequence he anathematises the nazarenes of jerusalem whose zeal for the law is testified by james in a passage of the acts cited further on in the first epistle to the corinthians dealing with the question of eating meat offered to idols it is clear that paul himself thinks it a matter of indifference but he advises that it should not he done for the sake of the weaker brethren on the other hand the nazarenes of jerusalem most strenuously opposed pauls gospel insisting on every convert becoming a regular jewish proselyte and consequently on his observance of the whole law and this party was led by james and peter and john galatians ii 9 paul does not suggest that the question of principle was settled by the discussion referred to in galatians all he says is that it ended in the practical agreement that he and barnabas should do as they had been doing in respect to the gentiles while james and peter and john should deal in their own fashion with jewish converts afterwards he complains bitterly of peter because when on a visit to antioch he at first inclined to pauls view and ate with the gentile converts but when certain came from james drew back and separated himself fearing them that were of the circumcision and the rest of the jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch as even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation galatians ii 1213  there is but one conclusion to be drawn from pauls account of this famous dispute the settlement of which determined the fortunes of the nascent religion it is that the disciples at jerusalem headed by james the lords brother and by the leading apostles peter and john were strict jews who had objected to admit any converts into their body unless these either by birth or by becoming proselytes were also strict jews in fact the sole difference between james and peter and john with the body of the disciples whom they led and the jews by whom they were surrounded and with whom they for many years shared the religious observances of the temple was that they believed that the messiah whom the leaders of the nation yet looked for had already come in the person of jesus of nazareth  the acts of the apostles is hardly a very trustworthy history it is certainly of later date than the pauline epistles supposing them to be genuine and the writers version of the conference of which paul gives so graphic a description if that is correct is unmistakably coloured with all the art of a reconciler anxious to cover up a scandal but it is none the less instructive on this account the judgment of the council delivered by james is that the gentile converts shall merely abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication but notwithstanding the accommodation in which the writer of the acts would have us believe the jerusalem church held to its endeavour to retain the observance of the law long after the conference some time after the writing of the epistles to the galatians and corinthians and immediately after the despatch of that to the romans paul makes his last visit to jerusalem and presents himself to james and all the elders and this is what the acts tells us of the interview       and they said unto him thou seest brother how many      thousands or myriads there are among the jews of them      which have believed and they are all zealous for the law      and they have been informed concerning thee that thou      teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to      forsake moses telling them not to circumcise their      children neither to walk after the customs acts xxi 20      21  they therefore request that he should perform a certain public religious act in the temple in order that       all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof      they have been informed concerning thee but that thou      thyself walkest orderly keeping the law ibid 2477  how far paul could do what he is here requested to do and which the writer of the acts goes on to say he did with a clear conscience if he wrote the epistles to the galatians and corinthians i may leave any candid reader of these epistles to decide the point to which i wish to direct attention is the declaration that the jerusalem church led by the brother of jesus and by his personal disciples and friends twenty years and more after his death consisted of strict and zealous jews  tertullus the orator caring very little about the internal dissensions of the followers of jesus speaks of paul as a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes acts xxiv 5 which must have affected james much in the same way as it would have moved the archbishop of canterbury in george foxs day to hear the latter called a ringleader of the sect of anglicans in fact nazarene was as is well known the distinctive appellation applied to jesus his immediate followers were known as nazarenes while the congregation of the disciples and later of converts at jerusalemthe jerusalem churchwas emphatically the sect of the nazarenes no more in itself to be regarded as anything outside judaism than the sect of the sadducees or that of the essenes78 in fact the tenets of both the sadducees and the essenes diverged much more widely from the pharisaic standard of orthodoxy than nazarenism did  let us consider the condition of affairs now ad 5060 in relation to that which obtained in justins time a century later it is plain that the nazarenespresided over by james the brother of the lord and comprising within their body all the twelve apostlesbelonged to justins second category of jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ but who insist on the observance of the law by gentile converts up till the time at which the controversy reported by paul arose they then according to paul simply allowed him to form his congregations of nonlegal gentile converts at antioch and elsewhere and it would seem that it was to these converts who would come under justins fifth category that the title of christian was first applied if any of these christians had acted upon the more than halfpermission given by paul and had eaten meats offered to idols they would have belonged to justins seventh category  hence it appears that if justins opinion which was probably that of the church generally in the middle of the second century was correct james and peter and john and their followers could not be saved neither could paul if he carried into practice his views as to the indifference of eating meats offered to idols or to put the matter another way the centre of gravity of orthodoxy which is at the extreme right of the series in the nineteenth century was at the extreme left just before the middle of the first century when the sect of the nazarenes constituted the whole church founded by jesus and the apostles while in the time of justin it lay midway between the two it is therefore a profound mistake to imagine that the judæochristians nazarenes and ebionites of later times were heretical outgrowths from a primitive universalist christianity on the contrary the universalist christianity is an outgrowth from the primitive purely jewish nazarenism which gradually eliminating all the ceremonial and dietary parts of the jewish law has thrust aside its parent and all the intermediate stages of its development into the position of damnable heresies  such being the case we are in a position to form a safe judgment of the limits within which the teaching of jesus of nazareth must have been confined ecclesiastical authority would have us believe that the words which are given at the end of the first gospel go ye therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost are part of the last commands of jesus issued at the moment of his parting with the eleven if so peter and john must have heard these words they are too plain to be misunderstood and the occasion is too solemn for them ever to be forgotten yet the acts tells us that peter needed a vision to enable him so much as to baptize cornelius and paul in the galatians knows nothing of words which would have completely borne him out as against those who though they heard must be supposed to have either forgotten or ignored them on the other hand peter and john who are supposed to have heard the sermon on the mount know nothing of the saying that jesus had not come to destroy the law but that every jot and tittle of the law must be fulfilled which surely would have been pretty good evidence for their view of the question  we are sometimes told that the personal friends and daily companions of jesus remained zealous jews and opposed pauls innovations because they were hard of heart and dull of comprehension this hypothesis is hardly in accordance with the concomitant faith of those who adopt it in the miraculous insight and superhuman sagacity of their master nor do i see any way of getting it to harmonise with the orthodox postulate namely that matthew was the author of the first gospel and john of the fourth if that is so then most assuredly matthew was no dullard and as for the fourth gospela theosophic romance of the first orderit could have been written by none but a man of remarkable literary capacity who had drunk deep of alexandrian philosophy moreover the doctrine of the writer of the fourth gospel is more remote from that of the sect of the nazarenes than is that of paul himself i am quite aware that orthodox critics have been capable of maintaining that john the nazarene who was probably well past fifty years of age when he is supposed to have written the most thoroughly judaising book in the new testamentthe apocalypsein the roughest of greek underwent an astounding metamorphosis of both doctrine and style by the time he reached the ripe age of ninety or so and provided the world with a history in which the acutest critic cannot always make out where the speeches of jesus end and the text of the narrative begins while that narrative is utterly irreconcilable in regard to matters of fact with that of his fellowapostle matthew  the end of the whole matter is thisthe sect of the nazarenes the brother and the immediate followers of jesus commissioned by him as apostles and those who were taught by them up to the year 50 ad were not christians in the sense in which that term has been understood ever since its asserted origin at antioch but jewsstrict orthodox jewswhose belief in the messiahship of jesus never led to their exclusion from the temple services nor would have shut them out from the wide embrace of judaism79 the open proclamation of their special view about the messiah was doubtless offensive to the pharisees just as rampant low churchism is offensive to bigoted high churchism in our own country or as any kind of dissent is offensive to fervid religionists of all creeds to the sadducees no doubt the political danger of any messianic movement was serious and they would have been glad to put down nazarenism lest it should end in useless rebellion against their roman masters like that other galilean movement headed by judas a generation earlier galilee was always a hotbed of seditious enthusiasm against the rule of rome and high priest and procurator alike had need to keep a sharp eye upon natives of that district on the whole however the nazarenes were but little troubled for the first twenty years of their existence and the undying hatred of the jews against those later converts whom they regarded as apostates and fautors of a sham judaism was awakened by paul from their point of view he was a mere renegade jew opposed alike to orthodox judaism and to orthodox nazarenism and whose teachings threatened judaism with destruction and from their point of view they were quite right in the course of a century pauline influences had a large share in driving primitive nazarenism from being the very heart of the new faith into the position of scouted error and the spirit of pauls doctrine continued its work of driving christianity farther and farther away from judaism until meats offered to idols might be eaten without scruple while the nazarene methods of observing even the sabbath or the passover were branded with the mark of judaising heresy  but if the primitive nazarenes of whom the acts speak were orthodox jews what sort of probability can there be that jesus was anything else how can he have founded the universal religion which was not heard of till twenty years after his death80 that jesus possessed in a rare degree the gift of attaching men to his person and to his fortunes that he was the author of many a striking saying and the advocate of equity of love and of humility that he may have disregarded the subtleties of the bigots for legal observance and appealed rather to those noble conceptions of religion which constituted the pith and kernel of the teaching of the great prophets of his nation seven hundred years earlier and that in the last scenes of his career he may have embodied the ideal sufferer of isaiah may be as i think it is extremely probable but all this involves not a step beyond the borders of orthodox judaism again who is to say whether jesus proclaimed himself the veritable messiah expected by his nation since the appearance of the pseudoprophetic work of daniel a century and a half before his time or whether the enthusiasm of his followers gradually forced him to assume that position  but one thing is quite certain if that belief in the speedy second coming of the messiah which was shared by all parties in the primitive church whether nazarene or pauline which jesus is made to prophesy over and over again in the synoptic gospels and which dominated the life of christians during the first century after the crucifixionif he believed and taught that then assuredly he was under an illusion and he is responsible for that which the mere effluxion of time has demonstrated to be a prodigious error  when i ventured to doubt whether any protestant theologian who has a reputation to lose will say that he believes the gadarene story it appears that i reckoned without dr wace who referring to this passage in my paper says       he will judge whether i fall under his description but i      repeat that i believe it and that he has removed the only      objection to my believing it p 363  far be it from me to set myself up as a judge of any such delicate question as that put before me but i think i may venture to express the conviction that in the matter of courage dr wace has raised for himself a monument ære perennius for really in my poor judgment a certain splendid intrepidity such as one admires in the leader of a forlorn hope is manifested by dr wace when he solemnly affirms that he believes the gadarene story on the evidence offered i feel less complimented perhaps than i ought to do when i am told that i have been an accomplice in extinguishing in dr waces mind the last glimmer of doubt which common sense may have suggested in fact i must disclaim all responsibility for the use to which the information i supplied has been put i formally decline to admit that the expression of my ignorance whether devils in the existence of which i do not believe if they did exist might or might not be made to go out of men into pigs can as a matter of logic have been of any use whatever to a person who already believed in devils and in the historical accuracy of the gospels  of the gadarene story dr wace with all solemnity and twice over affirms that he believes it i am sorry to trouble him further but what does he mean by it because there are two stories one in mark and luke and the other in matthew in the former which i quoted in my previous paper there is one possessed man in the latter there are two the story is told fully with the vigorous homely diction and the picturesque details of a piece of folklore in the second gospel the immediately antecedent event is the storm on the lake of gennesaret the immediately consequent events are the message from the ruler of the synagogue and the healing of the woman with an issue of blood in the third gospel the order of events is exactly the same and there is an extremely close general and verbal correspondence between the narratives of the miracle both agree in stating that there was only one possessed man and that he was the residence of many devils whose name was legion  in the first gospel the event which immediately precedes the gadarene affair is as before the storm the message from the ruler and the healing of the issue are separated from it by the accounts of the healing of a paralytic of the calling of matthew and of a discussion with some pharisees again while the second gospel speaks of the country of the gerasenes as the locality of the event the third gospel has gerasenes gergesenes and gadarenes in different ancient mss while the first has gadarenes  the really important points to be noticed however in the narrative of the first gospel are thesethat there are two possessed men instead of one and that while the story is abbreviated by omissions what there is of it is often verbally identical with the corresponding passages in the other two gospels the most unabashed of reconcilers cannot well say that one man is the same as two or two as one and though the suggestion really has been made that two different miracles agreeing in all essential particulars except the number of the possessed were effected immediately after the storm on the lake i should be sorry to accuse any one of seriously adopting it nor will it he pretended that the allegory refuge is accessible in this particular case  so when dr wace says that he believes in the synoptic evangelists account of the miraculous bedevilment of swine i may fairly ask which of them does he believe does he hold by the one evangelists story or by that of the two evangelists and having made his election what reasons has he to give for his choice if it is suggested that the witness of two is to be taken against that of one not only is the testimony dealt with in that commonsense fashion against which the theologians of his school protest so warmly not only is all question of inspiration at an end but the further inquiry arises after all is it the testimony of two against one are the authors of the versions in the second and third gospels really independent witnesses in order to answer this question it is only needful to place the english versions of the two side by side and compare them carefully it will then be seen that the coincidences between them not merely in substance but in arrangement and in the use of identical words in the same order are such that only two alternatives are conceivable either one evangelist freely copied from the other or both based themselves upon a common source which may either have been a written document or a definite oral tradition learned by heart assuredly these two testimonies are not those of independent witnesses further when the narrative in the first gospel is compared with that in the other two the same fact comes out  supposing then that dr wace is right in his assumption that matthew mark and luke wrote the works which we find attributed to them by tradition what is the value of their agreement even that something more or less like this particular miracle occurred since it is demonstrable either that all depend on some antecedent statement of the authorship of which nothing is known or that two are dependent upon the third  dr wace says he believes the gadarene story whichever version of it he accepts therefore he believes that jesus said what he is stated in all the versions to have said and thereby virtually declared that the theory of the nature of the spiritual world involved in the story is true now i hold that this theory is false that it is a monstrous and mischievous fiction and i unhesitatingly express my disbelief in any assertion that it is true by whomsoever made so that if dr wace is right in his belief he is also quite right in classing me among the people he calls infidels and although i cannot fulfil the eccentric expectation that i shall glory in a title which from my point of view it would be simply silly to adopt i certainly shall rejoice not to be reckoned among christians so long as the profession of belief in such stories as the gadarene pig affair on the strength of a tradition of unknown origin of which two discrepant reports also of unknown origin alone remain forms any part of the christian faith and although i have more than once repudiated the gift of prophecy yet i think i may venture to express the anticipation that if christians generally are going to follow the line taken by dr wace it will not be long before all men of common sense qualify for a place among the infidels  footnotes       64 i may perhaps return to the question of the authorship           of the gospels for the present i must content myself           with warning my readers against any reliance upon dr           waces statements as to the results arrived at by           modern criticism they are as gravely as surprisingly           erroneous       65 the united states ought perhaps to be added but           i am not sure       66 imagine that all our chairs of astronomy had been           founded in the fourteenth century and that their           incumbents were bound to sign ptolemaic articles in

  written for the opinion of a scientific theologian           about theologians of this stamp see pp 225 and 227 of           the vorträge       67 i suppose this is what dr wace is thinking about when           he says that i allege that there is no visible escape           from the supposition of an urmarcus p 367 that a           theologian of repute should confound an indisputable           fact with one of the modes of explaining that fact is           not so singular as those who are unaccustomed to the           ways of theologians might imagine       68 any examiner whose duty it has been to examine into a           case of copying will be particularly well prepared to           appreciate the force of the case stated in that most           excellent little book the common tradition of the           synoptic gospels by dr abbott and mr rushbrooke           macmillan 1884 to those who have not passed through           such painful experiences i may recommend the brief           discussion of the genuineness of the casket letters           in my friend mr skeltons interesting book maitland           of lethington the second edition of holtzmanns           lehrbuch published in 1886 gives a remarkably fair           and full account of the present results of criticism           at p 366 he writes that the present burning question           is whether the relatively primitive narrative and the           root of the other synoptic texts is contained in           matthew or in mark it is only on this point that           properlyinformed sachkundige critics differ and           he decides in favour of mark       69 holtzmann die synoptischen evangelien 1863 p 75           following ewald argues that the source a  the           threefold tradition more or less contained something           that answered to the sermon on the plain immediately           after the words of our present mark and he cometh           into a house iii 19 but what conceivable motive           could mark have for omitting it holtzmann has no           doubt however that the sermon on the mount is a           compilation or as he calls it in his

what difference it makes whether one           believes jesus or believes in jesus much thought           has not enabled me to discover if you believe him           you must believe him to be what he professed to           bethat is believe in him and if you believe in           him you must necessarily believe him       74 true for justin but there is a school of theological           critics who more or less question the historical           reality of paul and the genuineness of even the four           cardinal epistles       75 see dial cum tryphone §47 and §35 it is to be           understood that justin does not arrange these           categories in order as i have done       76 i guard myself against being supposed to affirm that           even the four cardinal epistles of paul may not have           been seriously tampered with see note 1 p 287 above       77 paul in fact is required to commit in jerusalem an act           of the same character as that which he brands as           dissimulation on the part of peter in antioch       78 all this was quite clearly pointed out by ritschl nearly           forty years ago see die entstchung der           altkatholischen kirche 1850 p 108       79 if every one was baptized as soon as he acknowledged           jesus to be the messiah the first christians can have           been aware of no other essential differences

doctrine and again p 65           it is not difficult to set against every portion of           the utterances of jesus an observation which deprives           him of originality see also zusatz 4 on the same           page     ix agnosticism and christianity  1889  nemo ergo ex me scire quærat quod me nescire scio nisi forte ut nescire discataugustinus de civ dei xii 7   81 the present discussion has arisen out of the use which has become general in the last few years of the terms agnostic and agnosticism  the people who call themselves agnostics have been charged with doing so because they have not the courage to declare themselves infidels it has been insinuated that they have adopted a new name in order to escape the unpleasantness which attaches to their proper denomination to this wholly erroneous imputation i have replied by showing that the term agnostic did as a matter of fact arise in a manner which negatives it and my statement has not been and cannot be refuted moreover speaking for myself and without impugning the right of any other person to use the term in another sense i further say that agnosticism is not properly described as a negative creed nor indeed as a creed of any kind except in so far as it expresses absolute faith in the validity of a principle which is as much ethical as intellectual this principle may be stated in various ways but they all amount to this that it is wrong for a man to say that he is certain of the objective truth of any proposition unless he can produce evidence which logically justifies that certainty this is what agnosticism asserts and in my opinion it is all that is essential to agnosticism that which agnostics deny and repudiate as immoral is the contrary doctrine that there are propositions which men ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions the justification of the agnostic principle lies in the success which follows upon its application whether in the field of natural or in that of civil history and in the fact that so far as these topics are concerned no sane man thinks of denying its validity  still speaking for myself i add that though agnosticism is not and cannot be a creed except in so far as its general principle is concerned yet that the application of that principle results in the denial of or the suspension of judgment concerning a number of propositions respecting which our contemporary ecclesiastical gnostics profess entire certainty and in so far as these ecclesiastical persons can be justified in their oldestablished custom which many nowadays think more honoured in the breach than the observance of using opprobrious names to those who differ from them i fully admit their right to call me and those who think with me infidels all i have ventured to urge is that they must not expect us to speak of ourselves by that title  the extent of the region of the uncertain the number of the problems the investigation of which ends in a verdict of not proven will vary according to the knowledge and the intellectual habits of the individual agnostic i do not very much care to speak of anything as unknowable82 what i am sure about is that there are many topics about which i know nothing and which so far as i can see are out of reach of my faculties but whether these things are knowable by any one else is exactly one of those matters which is beyond my knowledge though i may have a tolerably strong opinion as to the probabilities of the case relatively to myself i am quite sure that the region of uncertaintythe nebulous country in which words play the part of realitiesis far more extensive than i could wish materialism and idealism theism and atheism the doctrine of the soul and its mortality or immortalityappear in the history of philosophy like the shades of scandinavian heroes eternally slaying one another and eternally coming to life again in a metaphysical nifelheim it is getting on for twentyfive centuries at least since mankind began seriously to give their minds to these topics generation after generation philosophy has been doomed to roll the stone uphill and just as all the world swore it was at the top down it has rolled to the bottom again all this is written in innumerable books and he who will toil through them will discover that the stone is just where it was when the work began hume saw this kant saw it since their time more and more eyes have been cleansed of the films which prevented them from seeing it until now the weight and number of those who refuse to be the prey of verbal mystifications has begun to tell in practical life  it was inevitable that a conflict should arise between agnosticism and theology or rather i ought to say between agnosticism and ecclesiasticism for theology the science is one thing and ecclesiasticism the championship of a foregone conclusion83 as to the truth of a particular form of theology is another with scientific theology agnosticism has no quarrel on the contrary the agnostic knowing too well the influence of prejudice and idiosyncrasy even on those who desire most earnestly to be impartial can wish for nothing more urgently than that the scientific theologian should not only be at perfect liberty to thresh out the matter in his own fashion but that he should if he can find flaws in the agnostic position and even if demonstration is not to be had that he should put in their full force the grounds of the conclusions he thinks probable the scientific theologian admits the agnostic principle however widely his results may differ from those reached by the majority of agnostics  but as between agnosticism and ecclesiasticism or as our neighbours across the channel call it clericalism there can be neither peace nor truce the cleric asserts that it is morally wrong not to believe certain propositions whatever the results of a strict scientific investigation of the evidence of these propositions he tells us that religious error is in itself of an immoral nature84 he declares that he has prejudged certain conclusions and looks upon those who show cause for arrest of judgment as emissaries of satan it necessarily follows that for him the attainment of faith not the ascertainment of truth is the highest aim of mental life and on careful analysis of the nature of this faith it will too often be found to be not the mystic process of unity with the divine understood by the religious enthusiast but that which the candid simplicity of a sunday scholar once defined it to be faith said this unconscious plagiarist of tertullian is the power of saying you believe things which are incredible  now i and many other agnostics believe that faith in this sense is an abomination and though we do not indulge in the luxury of selfrighteousness so far as to call those who are not of our way of thinking hard names we do not feel that the disagreement between ourselves and those who hold this doctrine is even more moral than intellectual it is desirable there should be an end of any mistakes on this topic if our clerical opponents were clearly aware of the real state of the case there would be an end of the curious delusion which often appears between the lines of their writings that those whom they are so fond of calling infidels are people who not only ought to be but in their hearts are ashamed of themselves it would be discourteous to do more than hint the antipodal opposition of this pleasant dream of theirs to facts  the clerics and their lay allies commonly tell us that if we refuse to admit that there is good ground for expressing definite convictions about certain topics the bonds of human society will dissolve and mankind lapse into savagery there are several answers to this assertion one is that the bonds of human society were formed without the aid of their theology and in the opinion of not a few competent judges have been weakened rather than strengthened by a good deal of it greek science greek art the ethics of old israel the social organisation of old rome contrived to come into being without the help of any one who believed in a single distinctive article of the simplest of the christian creeds the science the art the jurisprudence the chief political and social theories of the modern world have grown out of those of greece and romenot by favour of but in the teeth of the fundamental teachings of early christianity to which science art and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable  again all that is best in the ethics of the modern world in so far as it has not grown out of greek thought or barbarian manhood is the direct development of the ethics of old israel there is no code of legislation ancient or modern at once so just and so merciful so tender to the weak and poor as the jewish law and if the gospels are to be trusted jesus of nazareth himself declared that he taught nothing but that which lay implicitly or explicitly in the religious and ethical system of his people       and the scribe said unto him of a truth teacher thou hast      well said that he is one and there is none other but he      and to love him with all the heart and with all the      understanding and with all the strength and to love his      neighbour as himself is much more than all whole burnt      offerings and sacrifices mark xii 32 33  here is the briefest of summaries of the teaching of the prophets of israel of the eighth century does the teacher whose doctrine is thus set forth in his presence repudiate the exposition nay we are told on the contrary that jesus saw that he answered discreetly and replied thou art not far from the kingdom of god  so that i think that even if the creeds from the socalled apostles to the socalled athanasian were swept into oblivion and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed is not a matter of the least consequence it will get on very well the causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind which have guided or impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless and even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct had any foundation if all the world is going to thieve murder and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the agnostic principle  surely the attempt to cast out beelzebub by the aid of beelzebub is a hopeful procedure as compared to that of preserving morality by the aid of immorality for i suppose it is admitted that an agnostic may be perfectly sincere may be competent and may have studied the question at issue with as much care as his clerical opponents but if the agnostic really believes what he says the dreadful consequence argufier consistently i admit with his own principles virtually asks him to abstain from telling the truth or to say what he believes to be untrue because of the supposed injurious consequences to morality beloved brethren that we may be spotlessly moral before all things let us lie is the sum total of many an exhortation addressed to the infidel now as i have already pointed out we cannot oblige our exhorters we leave the practical application of the convenient doctrines of reserve and nonnatural interpretation to those who invented them  i trust that i have now made amends for any ambiguity or want of fulness in my previous exposition of that which i hold to be the essence of the agnostic doctrine henceforward i might hope to hear no more of the assertion that we are necessarily materialists idealists atheists theists or any other ists if experience had led me to think that the proved falsity of a statement was any guarantee against its repetition and those who appreciate the nature of our position will see at once that when ecclesiasticism declares that we ought to believe this that and the other and are very wicked if we dont it is impossible for us to give any answer but this we have not the slightest objection to believe anything you like if you will give us good grounds for belief but if you cannot we must respectfully refuse even if that refusal should wreck mortality and insure our own damnation several times over we are quite content to leave that to the decision of the future the course of the past has impressed us with the firm conviction that no good ever comes of falsehood and we feel warranted in refusing even to experiment in that direction                                       in the course of the present discussion it has been asserted that the sermon on the mount and the lords prayer furnish a summary and condensed view of the essentials of the teaching of jesus of nazareth set forth by himself now this supposed summa of nazarene theology distinctly affirms the existence of a spiritual world of a heaven and of a hell of fire it teaches the fatherhood of god and the malignity of the devil it declares the superintending providence of the former and our need of deliverance from the machinations of the latter it affirms the fact of demoniac possession and the power of casting out devils by the faithful and from these premises the conclusion is drawn that those agnostics who deny that there is any evidence of such a character as to justify certainty respecting the existence and the nature of the spiritual world contradict the express declarations of jesus i have replied to this argumentation by showing that there is strong reason to doubt the historical accuracy of the attribution to jesus of either the sermon on the mount or the lords prayer and therefore that the conclusion in question is not warranted at any rate on the grounds set forth  but whether the gospels contain trustworthy statements about this and other alleged historical facts or not it is quite certain that from them taken together with the other books of the new testament we may collect a pretty complete exposition of that theory of the spiritual world which was held by both nazarenes and christians and which was undoubtedly supposed by them to be fully sanctioned by jesus though it is just as clear that they did not imagine it contained any revelation by him of something heretofore unknown if the pneumatological doctrine which pervades the whole new testament is nowhere systematically stated it is everywhere assumed the writers of the gospels and of the acts take it for granted as a matter of common knowledge and it is easy to gather from these sources a series of propositions which only need arrangement to form a complete system  in this system man is considered to be a duality formed of a spiritual element the soul and a corporeal85 element the body and this duality is repeated in the universe which consists of a corporeal world embraced and interpenetrated by a spiritual world the former consists of the earth as its principal and central constituent with the subsidiary sun planets and stars above the earth is the air and below is the watery abyss whether the heaven which is conceived to be above the air and the hell in or below the subterranean deeps are to be taken as corporeal or incorporeal is not clear however this may be the heaven and the air the earth and the abyss are peopled by innumerable beings analogous in nature to the spiritual element in man and these spirits are of two kinds good and bad the chief of the good spirits infinitely superior to all the others and their creator as well as the creator of the corporeal world and of the bad spirits is god his residence is heaven where he is surrounded by the ordered hosts of good spirits his angels or messengers and the executors of his will throughout the universe  on the other hand the chief of the bad spirits is satan the devil par excellence he and his company of demons are free to roam through all parts of the universe except the heaven these bad spirits are far superior to man in power and subtlety and their whole energies are devoted to bringing physical and moral evils upon him and to thwarting so far as his power goes the benevolent intentions of the supreme being in fact the souls and bodies of men form both the theatre and the prize of an incessant warfare between the good and the evil spiritsthe powers of light and the powers of darkness by leading eve astray satan brought sin and death upon mankind as the gods of the heathen the demons are the founders and maintainers of idolatry as the powers of the air they afflict mankind with pestilence and famine as unclean spirits they cause disease of mind and body  the significance of the appearance of jesus in the capacity of the messiah or christ is the reversal of the satanic work by putting an end to both sin and death he announces that the kingdom of god is at hand when the prince of this world shall be finally cast out john xii 31 from the cosmos as jesus during his earthly career cast him out from individuals then will satan and all his devilry along with the wicked whom they have seduced to their destruction be hurled into the abyss of unquenchable firethere to endure continual torture without a hope of winning pardon from the merciful god their father or of moving the glorified messiah to one more act of pitiful intercession or even of interrupting by a momentary sympathy with their wretchedness the harmonious psalmody of their brother angels and men eternally lapped in bliss unspeakable  the straitest protestant who refuses to admit the existence of any source of divine truth except the bible will not deny that every point of the pneumatological theory here set forth has ample scriptural warranty the gospels the acts the epistles and the apocalypse assert the existence of the devil of his demons and of hell as plainly as they do that of god and his angels and heaven it is plain that the messianic and the satanic conceptions of the writers of these books are the obverse and the reverse of the same intellectual coinage if we turn from scripture to the traditions of the fathers and the confessions of the churches it will appear that in this one particular at any rate time has brought about no important deviation from primitive belief from justin onwards it may often be a fair question whether god or the devil occupies a larger share of the attention of the fathers it is the devil who instigates the roman authorities to persecute the gods and goddesses of paganism are devils and idolatry itself is an invention of satan if a saint falls away from grace it is by the seduction of the demon if heresy arises the devil has suggested it and some of the fathers86 go so far as to challenge the pagans to a sort of exorcising match by way of testing the truth of christianity mediæval christianity is at one with patristic on this head the masses the clergy the theologians and the philosophers alike live and move and have their being in a world full of demons in which sorcery and possession are everyday occurrences nor did the reformation make any difference whatever else luther assailed he left the traditional demonology untouched nor could any one have entertained a more hearty and uncompromising belief in the devil than he and at a later period the calvinistic fanatics of new england did finally in these last years of the nineteenth century the demonological hypotheses of the first century are explicitly or implicitly held and occasionally acted upon by the immense majority of christians of all confessions  only here and there has the progress of scientific thought outside the ecclesiastical world so far affected christians that they and their teachers fight shy of the demonology of their creed they are fain to conceal their real disbelief in one half of christian doctrine by judicious silence about it or by flight to those refuges for the logically destitute accommodation or allegory but the faithful who fly to allegory in order to escape absurdity resemble nothing so much as the sheep in the fable whoto save their livesjumped into the pit the allegory pit is too commodious is ready to swallow up so much more than one wants to put into it if the story of the temptation is an allegory if the early recognition of jesus as the son of god by the demons is an allegory if the plain declaration of the writer of the first epistle of john iii 8 to this end was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil is allegorical then the pauline version of the fall may be allegorical and still more the words of consecration of the eucharist or the promise of the second coming in fact there is not a dogma of ecclesiastical christianity the scriptural basis of which may not be whittled away by a similar process  as to accommodation let any honest man who can read the new testament ask himself whether jesus and his immediate friends and disciples can be dishonoured more grossly than by the supposition that they said and did that which is attributed to them while in reality they disbelieved in satan and his demons in possession and in exorcism87  an eminent theologian has justly observed that we have no right to look at the propositions of the christian faith with one eye open and the other shut tract 85 p 29 it really is not permissible to see with one eye that jesus is affirmed to declare the personality and the fatherhood of god his loving providence and his accessibility to prayer and to shut the other to the no less definite teaching ascribed to jesus in regard to the personality and the misanthropy of the devil his malignant watchfulness and his subjection to exorcistic formula and rites jesus is made to say that the devil was a murderer from the beginning john viii 44 by the same authority as that upon which we depend for his asserted declaration that god is a spirit john iv 24  to those who admit the authority of the famous vincentian dictum that the doctrine which has been held always everywhere and by all is to be received as authoritative the demonology must possess a higher sanction than any other christian dogma except perhaps those of the resurrection and of the messiahship of jesus for it would be difficult to name any other points of doctrine on which the nazarene does not differ from the christian and the different historical stages and contemporary subdivisions of christianity from one another and if the demonology is accepted there can be no reason for rejecting all those miracles in which demons play a part the gadarene story fits into the general scheme of christianity and the evidence for legion and their doings is just as good as any other in the new testament for the doctrine which the story illustrates  it was with the purpose of bringing this great fact into prominence of getting people to open both their eyes when they look at ecclesiasticism that i devoted so much space to that miraculous story which happens to be one of the best types of its class and i could not wish for a better justification of the course i have adopted than the fact that my heroically consistent adversary has declared his implicit belief in the gadarene story and by necessary consequence in the christian demonology as a whole it must be obvious by this time that if the account of the spiritual world given in the new testament professedly on the authority of jesus is true then the demonological half of that account must be just as true as the other half and therefore those who question the demonology or try to explain it away deny the truth of what jesus said and are in ecclesiastical terminology infidels just as much as those who deny the spirituality of god this is as plain as anything can well be and the dilemma for my opponent was either to assert that the gadarene pigbedevilment actually occurred or to write himself down an infidel as was to be expected he chose the former alternative and i may express my great satisfaction at finding that there is one spot of common ground on which both he and i stand so far as i can judge we are agreed to state one of the broad issues between the consequences of agnostic principles as i draw them and the consequences of ecclesiastical dogmatism as he accepts it as follows  ecclesiasticism says the demonology of the gospels is an essential part of that account of that spiritual world the truth of which it declares to be certified by jesus  agnosticism me judice says there is no good evidence of the existence of a demoniac spiritual world and much reason for doubting it  hereupon the ecclesiastic may observe your doubt means that you disbelieve jesus therefore you are an infidel instead of an agnostic to which the agnostic may reply no for two reasons first because your evidence that jesus said what you say he said is worth very little and secondly because a man may be an agnostic in the sense of admitting he has no positive knowledge and yet consider that he has more or less probable ground for accepting any given hypothesis about the spiritual world just as a man may frankly declare that he has no means of knowing whether the planets generally are inhabited or not and yet may think one of the two possible hypotheses more likely that the other so he may admit that he has no means of knowing anything about the spiritual world and yet may think one or other of the current views on the subject to some extent probable  the second answer is so obviously valid that it needs no discussion i draw attention to it simply in justice to those agnostics who may attach greater value that i do to any sort of pneumatological speculations and not because i wish to escape the responsibility of declaring that whether jesus sanctioned the demonological part of christianity or not i unhesitatingly reject it the first answer on the other hand opens up the whole question of the claim of the biblical and other sources from which hypotheses concerning the spiritual world are derived to be regarded as unimpeachable historical evidence as to matters of fact  now in respect of the trustworthiness of the gospel narratives i was anxious to get rid of the common assumption that the determination of the authorship and of the dates of these works is a matter of fundamental importance that assumption is based upon the notion that what contemporary witnesses say must be true or at least has always a primâ facie claim to be so regarded so that if the writers of any of the gospels were contemporaries of the events and still more if they were in the position of eyewitnesses the miracles they narrate must be historically true and consequently the demonology which they involve must be accepted but the story of the translation of the blessed martyrs marcellinus and petrus and the other considerations to which endless additions might have been made from the fathers and the mediæval writers set forth in a preceding essay yield in my judgment satisfactory proof that where the miraculous is concerned neither considerable intellectual ability nor undoubted honesty nor knowledge of the world nor proved faithfulness as civil historians nor profound piety on the part of eyewitnesses and contemporaries affords any guarantee of the objective truth of their statements when we know that a firm belief in the miraculous was ingrained in their minds and was the presupposition of their observations and reasonings  therefore although it be as i believe demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship or of the date of composition of the gospels as they have come down to us and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject i have not cared to expend any space on the question it will be admitted i suppose that the authors of the works attributed to matthew mark luke and john whoever they may be are personages whose capacity and judgment in the narration of ordinary events are not quite so well certified as those of eginhard and we have seen what the value of eginhards evidence is when the miraculous is in question                                       i have been careful to explain that the arguments which i have used in the course of this discussion are not new that they are historical and have nothing to do with what is commonly called science and that they are all to the best of my belief to be found in the works of theologians of repute  the position which i have taken up that the evidence in favour of such miracles as those recorded by eginhard and consequently of mediæval demonology is quite as good as that in favour of such miracles as the gadarene and consequently of nazarene demonology is none of my discovery its strength was wittingly or unwittingly suggested a century and a half ago by a theological scholar of eminence and it has been if not exactly occupied yet so fortified with bastions and redoubts by a living ecclesiastical vauban that in my judgment it has been rendered impregnable in the early part of the last century the ecclesiastical mind in this country was much exercised by the question not exactly of miracles the occurrence of which in biblical times was axiomatic but by the problem when did miracles cease anglican divines were quite sure that no miracles had happened in their day nor for some time past they were equally sure that they happened sixteen or seventeen centuries earlier and it was a vital question for them to determine at what point of time between this terminus a quo and that terminus ad quem miracles came to an end  the anglicans and the romanists agreed in the assumption that the possession of the gift of miracleworking was primâ facie evidence of the soundness of the faith of the miracleworkers the supposition that miraculous powers might be wielded by heretics though it might be supported by high authority led to consequences too frightful to be entertained by people who were busied in building their dogmatic house on the sands of early church history if as the romanists maintained an unbroken series of genuine miracles adorned the records of their church throughout the whole of its existence no anglican could lightly venture to accuse them of doctrinal corruption hence the anglicans who indulged in such accusations were bound to prove the modern the mediæval roman and the later patristic miracles false and to shut off the wonderworking power from the church at the exact point of time when anglican doctrine ceased and roman doctrine began with a little adjustmenta squeeze here and a pull therethe christianity of the first three or four centuries might be made to fit or seem to fit pretty well into the anglican scheme so the miracles from justin say to jerome might be recognised while in later times the church having become corruptthat is to say having pursued one and the same line of development further than was pleasing to anglicansits alleged miracles must needs be shams and impostures  under these circumstances it may be imagined that the establishment of a scientific frontier between the earlier realm of supposed fact and the later of asserted delusion had its difficulties and torrents of theological special pleading about the subject flowed from clerical pens until that learned and acute anglican divine conyers middleton in his free inquiry tore the sophistical web they had laboriously woven to pieces and demonstrated that the miracles of the patristic age early and late must stand or fall together inasmuch as the evidence for the later is just as good as the evidence for the earlier wonders if the one set are certified by contemporaneous witnesses of high repute so are the other and in point of probability there is not a pin to choose between the two that is the solid and irrefragable result of middletons contribution to the subject but the free inquirers freedom had its limits and he draws a sharp line of demarcation between the patristic and the new testament miracleson the professed ground that the accounts of the latter being inspired are out of the reach of criticism  a century later the question was taken up by another divine middletons equal in learning and acuteness and far his superior in subtlety and dialectic skill who though an anglican scorned the name of protestant and while yet a churchman made it his business to parade with infinite skill the utter hollowness of the arguments of those of his brother churchmen who dreamed that they could be both anglicans and protestants the argument of the essay on the miracles recorded in the ecclesiastical history of the early ages88 by the present 1889 roman cardinal but then anglican doctor john henry newman is compendiously stated by himself in the following passage       if the miracles of church history cannot be defended by the      arguments of leslie lyttleton paley or douglas how many      of the scripture miracles satisfy their conditions p cvii  and although the answer is not given in so many words little doubt is left on the mind of the reader that in the mind of the writer it is none in fact this conclusion is one which cannot be resisted if the argument in favour of the scripture miracles is based upon that which laymen whether lawyers or men of science or historians or ordinary men of affairs call evidence but there is something really impressive in the magnificent contempt with which at times dr newman sweeps aside alike those who offer and those who demand such evidence       some infidel authors advise us to accept no miracles which      would not have a verdict in their favour in a court of      justice that is they employ against scripture a weapon      which protestants would confine to attacks upon the church      as if moral and religious questions required legal proof      and evidence were the test of truth89 p cvii  as if evidence were the test of truthalthough the truth in question is the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of certain phenomena at a certain time and in a certain place this sudden revelation of the great gulf fixed between the ecclesiastical and the scientific mind is enough to take away the breath of any one unfamiliar with the clerical organon as if one may retort the assumption that miracles may or have served a moral or a religious end in any way alters the fact that they profess to be historical events things that actually happened and as such must needs be exactly those subjects about which evidence is appropriate and legal proofs which are such merely because they afford adequate evidence may be justly demanded the gadarene miracle either happened or it did not whether the gadarene question is moral or religious or not has nothing to do with the fact that it is a purely historical question whether the demons said what they are declared to have said and the devilpossessed pigs did or did not rush over the heights bounding the lake of gennesaret on a certain day of a certain year after ad 26 and before ad 36 for vague and uncertain as new testament chronology is i suppose it may be assumed that the event in question if it happened at all took place during the procuratorship of pilate if that is not a matter about which evidence ought to be required and not only legal but strict scientific proof demanded by sane men who are asked to believe the storywhat is is a reasonable being to be seriously asked to credit statements which to put the case gently are not exactly probable and on the acceptance or rejection of which his whole view of life may depend without asking for as much legal proof as would send an alleged pickpocket to goal or as would suffice to prove the validity of a disputed will  infidel authors if as i am assured i may answer for them will decline to waste time on mere darkenings of counsel of this sort but to those anglicans who accept his premises dr newman is a truly formidable antagonist what indeed are they to reply when he puts the very pertinent question       whether persons who not merely question but prejudge the      ecclesiastical miracles on the ground of their want of      resemblance whatever that be to those contained in      scriptureas if the almighty could not do in the christian      church what he had not already done at the time of its      foundation or under the mosaic covenantwhether such      reasoners are not siding with the sceptic  and       whether it is not a happy inconsistency by which they      continue to believe the scriptures while they reject the      church90 p liii  again i invite anglican orthodoxy to consider this passage       the narrative of the combats of st anthony with evil      spirits is a development rather than a contradiction of      revelation viz of such texts as speak of satan being cast      out by prayer and fasting to be shocked then at the      miracles of ecclesiastical history or to ridicule them for      their strangeness is no part of a scriptural philosophy      pp liiiliv  further on dr newman declares that it has been admitted       that a distinct line can be drawn in point of character and      circumstance between the miracles of scripture and of church      history but this is by no means the case p lv       specimens are not wanting in the history of the church of      miracles as awful in their character and as momentous in      their effects as those which are recorded in scripture the      fire interrupting the rebuilding of the jewish temple and      the death of arius are instances in ecclesiastical      history of such solemn events on the other hand difficult      instances in the scripture history are such as these the      serpent in eden the ark jacobs vision for the      multiplication of his cattle the speaking of balaams ass      the axe swimming at elishas word the miracle on the swine      and various instances of prayers or prophecies in which as      in that of noahs blessing and curse words which seem the      result of private feeling are expressly or virtually      ascribed to a divine suggestion p lvi  who is to gainsay our ecclesiastical authority here infidel authors might be accused of a wish to ridicule the scripture miracles by putting them on a level with the remarkable story about the fire which stopped the rebuilding of the temple or that about the death of ariusbut dr newman is above suspicion the pity is that his list of what he delicately terms difficult instances is so short why omit the manufacture of eve out of adams rib on the strict historical accuracy of which the chief argument of the defenders of an iniquitous portion of our present law depends why leave out the account of the bene elohim and their gallantries on which a large part of the worst practices of the mediæval inquisitors into witchcraft was based why forget the angel who wrestled with jacob and as the account suggests somewhat overstepped the bounds of fair play at the end of the struggle surely we must agree with dr newman that if all these camels have gone down it savours of affectation to strain at such gnats as the sudden ailment of arius in the midst of his deadly if prayerful91 enemies and the fiery explosion which stopped the julian building operations though the words of the conclusion of the essay on miracles may perhaps be quoted against me i may express my satisfaction at finding myself in substantial accordance with a theologian above all suspicion of heterodoxy with all my heart i can declare my belief that there is just as good reason for believing in the miraculous slaying of the man who fell short of the athanasian power of affirming contradictories with respect to the nature of the godhead as there is for believing in the stories of the serpent and the ark told in genesis the speaking of balaams ass in numbers or the floating of the axe at elishas order in the second book of kings                                       it is one of the peculiarities of a really sound argument that it is susceptible of the fullest development and that it sometimes leads to conclusions unexpected by those who employ it to my mind it is impossible to refuse to follow dr newman when he extends his reasoning from the miracles of the patristic and mediæval ages backward in time as far as miracles are recorded but if the rules of logic are valid i feel compelled to extend the argument forwards to the alleged roman miracles of the present day which dr newman might not have admitted but which cardinal newman may hardly reject beyond question there is as good or perhaps better evidence for the miracles worked by our lady of lourdes as there is for the floating of elishas axe or the speaking of balaams ass but we must go still further there is a modern system of thaumaturgy and demonology which is just as well certified as the ancient92 veracious excellent sometimes learned and acute persons even philosophers of no mean pretensions testify to the levitation of bodies much heavier than elishas axe to the existence of spirits who to the mere tactile sense have been indistinguishable from flesh and blood and occasionally have wrested with all the vigour of jacobs opponent yet further to the speech in the language of raps of spiritual beings whose discourses in point of coherence and value are far inferior to that of balaams humble but sagacious steed i have not the smallest doubt that if these were persecuting times there is many a worthy spiritualist who would cheerfully go to the stake in support of his pneumatological faith and furnish evidence after paleys own heart in proof of the truth of his doctrines not a few modern divines doubtless struck by the impossibility of refusing the spiritualist evidence if the ecclesiastical evidence is accepted and deprived of any à priori objection by their implicit belief in christian demonology show themselves ready to take poor sludge seriously and to believe that he is possessed by other devils than those of need greed and vainglory  under these circumstances it was to be expected though it is none the less interesting to note the fact that the arguments of the latest school of spiritualists present a wonderful family likeness to those which adorn the subtle disquisitions of the advocate of ecclesiastical miracles of forty years ago it is unfortunate for the spiritualists that over and over again celebrated and trusted media who really in some respects call to mind the montanist93 and gnostic seers of the second century are either proved in courts of law to be fraudulent impostors or in sheer weariness as it would seem of the honest dupes who swear by them spontaneously confess their longcontinued iniquities as the fox women did the other day in new york94 but whenever a catastrophe of this kind takes place the believers are no wise dismayed by it they freely admit that not only the media but the spirits whom they summon are sadly apt to lose sight of the elementary principles of right and wrong and they triumphantly ask how does the occurrence of occasional impostures disprove the genuine manifestations that is to say all those which have not yet been proved to be impostures or delusions and in this they unconsciously plagiarise from the churchman who just as freely admits that many ecclesiastical miracles may have been forged and asks with calm contempt not only of legal proofs but of commonsense probability why does it follow that none are to be supposed genuine i must say however that the spiritualists so far as i know do not venture to outrage right reason so boldly as the ecclesiastics they do not sneer at evidence nor repudiate the requirement of legal proofs in fact there can be no doubt that the spiritualists produce better evidence for their manifestations than can be shown either for the miraculous death of arius or for the invention of the cross95  from the levitation of the axe at one end of a period of near three thousand years to the levitation of sludge  co at the other end there is a complete continuity of the miraculous with every gradation from the childish to the stupendous from the gratification of a caprice to the illustration of sublime truth there is no drawing a line in the series that might be set out of plausibly attested cases of spiritual intervention if one is true all may be true if one is false all may be false                                       this is to my mind the inevitable result of that method of reasoning which is applied to the confutation of protestantism with so much success by one of the acutest and subtlest disputants who have ever championed ecclesiasticismand one cannot put his claims to acuteness and subtlety higher        the christianity of history is not protestantism if      ever there were a safe truth it is this to be deep in      history is to cease to be a protestant96  i have not a shadow of doubt that these antiprotestant epigrams are profoundly true but i have as little that in the same sense the christianity of history is not romanism and that to be deeper in history is to cease to be a romanist the reasons which compel my doubts about the compatibility of the roman doctrine or any other form of catholicism with history arise out of exactly the same line of argument as that adopted by dr newman in the famous essay which i have just cited if with one hand dr newman has destroyed protestantism he has annihilated romanism with the other and the total result of his ambidextral efforts is to shake christianity to its foundations nor was any one better aware that this must be the inevitable result of his argumentsif the world should refuse to accept roman doctrines and roman miraclesthan the writer of tract 85  dr newman made his choice and passed over to the roman church half a century ago some of those who were essentially in harmony with his views preceded and many followed him but many remained and as the quondam puseyite and present ritualistic party they are continuing that work of sapping and mining the protestantism of the anglican church which he and his friends so ably commenced at the present time they have no little claim to be considered victorious all along the line i am old enough to recollect the small beginnings of the tractarian party and i am amazed when i consider the present position of their heirs their little leaven has leavened if not the whole yet a very large lump of the anglican church which is now pretty much of a preparatory school for papistry so that it really behoves englishmen who as i have been informed by high authority are all legally members of the state church if they profess to belong to no other sect to wake up to what that powerful organization is about and whither it is tending on this point the writings of dr newman while he still remained within the anglican fold are a vast store of the best and the most authoritative information his doctrines on ecclesiastical miracles and on development are the cornerstones of the tractarian fabric he believed that his arguments led either romeward or to what ecclesiastics call infidelity and i call agnosticism i believe that he was quite right in this conviction but while he chooses the one alternative i choose the other as he rejects protestantism on the ground of its incompatibility with history so a fortiori i conceive that romanism ought to be rejected and that an impartial consideration of the evidence must refuse the authority of jesus to anything more than the nazarenism of james and peter and john and let it not be supposed that this is a mere infidel perversion of the facts no one has more openly and clearly admitted the possibility that they may be fairly interpreted in this way than dr newman if he says there are texts which seem to show that jesus contemplated the evangelisation of the heathen        did not the apostles hear our lord and what was their      impression from what they heard is it not certain that the      apostles did not gather this truth from his teaching tract      85 p 63       he said preach the gospel to every creature these words      need have only meant bring all men to christianity      through judaism make them jews that they may enjoy      christs privileges which are lodged in judaism teach them      those rites and ceremonies circumcision and the like which      hitherto have been dead ordinances and now are living and      so the apostles seem to have understood them ibid p      65  so far as nazarenism differentiated itself from contemporary orthodox judaism it seems to have tended towards a revival of the ethical and religious spirit of the prophetic age accompanied by the belief in jesus as the messiah and by various accretions which had grown round judaism subsequently to the exile to these belong the doctrines of the resurrection of the last judgment of heaven and hell of the hierarchy of good angels of satan and the hierarchy of evil spirits and there is very strong ground for believing that all these doctrines at least in the shapes in which they were held by the postexilic jews were derived from persian and babylonian97 sources and are essentially of heathen origin  how far jesus positively sanctioned all these indrainings of circumjacent paganism into judaism how far any one has a right to declare that the refusal to accept one or other of these doctrines as ascertained verities comes to the same thing as contradicting jesus it appears to me not easy to say but it is hardly less difficult to conceive that he could have distinctly negatived any of them and more especially that demonology which has been accepted by the christian churches in every age and under all their mutual antagonisms but i repeat my conviction that whether jesus sanctioned the demonology of his time and nation or not it is doomed the future of christianity as a dogmatic system and apart from the old israelitish ethics which it has appropriated and developed lies in the answer which mankind will eventually give to the question whether they are prepared to believe such stories as the gadarene and the pneumatological hypotheses which go with it or not my belief is they will decline to do anything of the sort whenever and wherever their minds have been disciplined by science and that discipline must and will at once follow and lead the footsteps of advancing civilisation  the preceding pages were written before i became acquainted with the contents of the may number of the nineteenth century wherein i discover many things which are decidedly not to my advantage it would appear that evasion is my chief resource incapacity for strict argument and rottenness of ratiocination my main mental characteristics and that it is barely credible that a statement which i profess to make of my own knowledge is true all which things i notice merely to illustrate the great truth forced on me by long experience that it is only from those who enjoy the blessing of a firm hold of the christian faith that such manifestations of meekness patience and charity are to be expected  i had imagined that no one who had read my preceding papers could entertain a doubt as to my position in respect of the main issue as it has been stated and restated by my opponent       an agnosticism which knows nothing of the relation of man to      god must not only refuse belief to our lords most undoubted      teaching but must deny the reality of the spiritual      convictions in which he lived98  that is said to be the simple question which is at issue between us and the three testimonies to that teaching and those convictions selected are the sermon on the mount the lords prayer and the story of the passion  my answer reduced to its briefest form has been in the first place the evidence is such that the exact nature of the teachings and the convictions of jesus is extremely uncertain so that what ecclesiastics are pleased to call a denial of them may be nothing of the kind and in the second place if jesus taught the demonological system involved in the gadarene storyif a belief in that system formed a part of the spiritual convictions in which he lived and diedthen i for my part unhesitatingly refuse belief in that teaching and deny the reality of those spiritual convictions and i go further and add that exactly in so far as it can be proved that jesus sanctioned the essentially pagan demonological theories current among the jews of his age exactly in so far for me will his authority in any matter touching the spiritual world be weakened  with respect to the first half of my answer i have pointed out that the sermon on the mount as given in the first gospel is in the opinion of the best critics a mosaic work of materials derived from different sources and i do not understand that this statement is challenged the only other gospelthe thirdwhich contains something like it makes not only the discourse but the circumstances under which it was delivered very different now it is one thing to say that there was something real at the bottom of the two discourseswhich is quite possible and another to affirm that we have any right to say what that something was or to fix upon any particular phrase and declare it to be a genuine utterance those who pursue theology as a science and bring to the study an adequate knowledge of the ways of ancient historians will find no difficulty in providing illustrations of my meaning i may supply one which has come within range of my own limited vision  in josephuss history of the wars of the jews chap xix that writer reports a speech which he says herod made at the opening of a war with the arabians it is in the first person and would naturally be supposed by the reader to be intended for a true version of what herod said in the antiquities written some seventeen years later the same writer gives another report also in the first person of herods speech on the same occasion this second oration is twice as long as the first and though the general tenor of the two speeches is pretty much the same there is hardly any verbal identity and a good deal of matter is introduced into the one which is absent from the other josephus prides himself on his accuracy people whose fathers might have heard herods oration were his contemporaries and yet his historical sense is so curiously undeveloped that he can quite innocently perpetrate an obvious literary fabrication for one of the two accounts must be incorrect now if i am asked whether i believe that herod made some particular statement on this occasion whether for example he uttered the pious aphorism where god is there is both multitude and courage which is given in the antiquities but not in the wars i am compelled to say i do not know one of the two reports must be erroneous possibly both are at any rate i cannot tell how much of either is true and if some fervent admirer of the idumean should build up a theory of herods piety upon josephuss evidence that he propounded the aphorism it is a mere evasion to say in reply that the evidence that he did utter it is worthless  it appears again that adopting the tactics of conachar when brought face to face with hal o the wynd i have been trying to get my simpleminded adversary to follow me on a wildgoose chase through the early history of christianity in the hope of escaping impending defeat on the main issue but i may be permitted to point out that there is an alternative hypothesis which equally fits the facts and that after all there may have been method in the madness of my supposed panic  for suppose it to be established that gentile christianity was a totally different thing from the nazarenism of jesus and his immediate disciples suppose it to be demonstrable that as early as the sixth decade of our era at least there were violent divergencies of opinion among the followers of jesus suppose it to be hardly doubtful that the gospels and the acts took their present shapes under the influence of those divergencies suppose that their authors and those through whose hands they passed had notions of historical veracity not more eccentric than those which josephus occasionally displays surely the chances that the gospels are altogether trustworthy records of the teachings of jesus become very slender and since the whole of the case of the other side is based on the supposition that they are accurate records especially of speeches about which ancient historians are so curiously loose i really do venture to submit that this part of my argument bears very seriously on the main issue and as ratiocination is sound to the core  again when i passed by the topic of the speeches of jesus on the cross it appears that i could have had no other motive than the dictates of my native evasiveness an ecclesiastical dignitary may have respectable reasons for declining a fencing match in sight of gethsemane and calvary but an ecclesiastical infidel never it is obviously impossible that in the belief that the greater includes the less i having declared the gospel evidence in general as to the sayings of jesus to be of questionable value thought it needless to select for illustration of my views those particular instances which were likely to be most offensive to persons of another way of thinking but any supposition that may have been entertained that the old familiar tones of the ecclesiastical wardrum will tempt me to engage in such needless discussion had better be renounced i shall do nothing of the kind let it suffice that i ask my readers to turn to the twentythird chapter of luke revised version verse thirtyfour and he will find in the margin       some ancient authorities omit and jesus said father      forgive them for they know not what they do  so that even as late as the fourth century there were ancient authorities indeed some of the most ancient and weightiest who either did not know of this utterance so often quoted as characteristic of jesus or did not believe it had been uttered  many years ago i received an anonymous letter which abused me heartily for my want of moral courage in not speaking out i thought that one of the oddest charges an anonymous letterwriter could bring but i am not sure that the plentiful sowing of the pages of the article with which i am dealing with accusations of evasion may not seem odder to those who consider that the main strength of the answers with which i have been favoured in this review and elsewhere is devoted not to anything in the text of my first paper but to a note which occurs at p 212 in this i say       dr wace tells us it may be asked how far we can rely on      the accounts we possess of our lords teaching on these      subjects and he seems to think the question appropriately      answered by the assertion that it ought to be regarded as      settled by m renans practical surrender of the adverse      case  i requested dr wace to point out the passages of m renans works in which as he affirms this practical surrender not merely as to the age and authorship of the gospels be it observed but as to their historical value is made and he has been so good as to do so now let us consider the parts of dr waces citation from renan which are relevant to the issue       the author of this gospel luke is certainly the same as      the author of the acts of the apostles now the author of      the acts seems to be a companion of st paula character      which accords completely with st luke i know that more      than one objection may be opposed to this reasoning but one      thing at all events is beyond doubt namely that the      author of the third gospel and of the acts is a man who      belonged to the second apostolic generation and this      suffices for our purpose  this is a curious practical surrender of the adverse case m renan thinks that there is no doubt that the author of the third gospel is the author of the actsa conclusion in which i suppose critics generally agree he goes on to remark that this person seems to be a companion of st paul and adds that luke was a companion of st paul then somewhat needlessly m renan points out that there is more than one objection to jumping from such data as these to the conclusion that luke is the writer of the third gospel and finally m renan is content to reduce that which is beyond doubt to the fact that the author of the two books is a man of the second apostolic generation well it seems to me that i could agree with all that m renan considers beyond doubt here without surrendering anything either practically or theoretically  dr wace nineteenth century march p 363 states that he derives the above citation from the preface to the 15th edition of the vie de jésus my copy of les Évangiles dated 1877 contains a list of renans oeuvres complètes at the head of which i find vie de jésus 15e édition it is therefore a later work than the edition of the vie de jésus which dr wace quotes now les Évangiles as its name implies treats fully of the questions respecting the date and authorship of the gospels and any one who desired not merely to use m renans expressions for controversial purposes but to give a fair account of his views in their full significance would i think refer to the later source  if this course had been taken dr wace might have found some as decided expressions of opinion in favour of lukes authorship of the third gospel as he has discovered in the apostles i mention this circumstance because i desire to point out that taking even the strongest of renans statements i am still at a loss to see how it justifies that largesounding phrase practical surrender of the adverse case for on p 438 of les Évangiles renan speaks of the way in which lukes excellent intentions have led him to torture history in the acts he declares luke to be the founder of that eternal fiction which is called ecclesiastical history and on the preceding page he talks of the myth of the ascensionwith its mise en scène voulue at p 435 i find luc ou lauteur quel quil soit du troisième Évangile at p 280 the accounts of the passion the death and the resurrection of jesus are said to be peu historiques at p 283 la valeur historique du troisième Évangile est sûrement moindre que celles des deux premiers a pyrrhic sort of victory for orthodoxy this surrender and all the while the scientific student of theology knows that the more reason there may be to believe that luke was the companion of paul the more doubtful becomes his credibility if he really wrote the acts for in that case he could not fail to have been acquainted with pauls account of the jerusalem conference and he must have consciously misrepresented it  we may next turn to the essential part of dr waces citation nineteenth century p 365 touching the first gospel       st matthew evidently deserves peculiar confidence for the      discourses here are the oraclesthe very notes taken      while the memory of the instruction of jesus was living and      definite  m renan here expresses the very general opinion as to the existence of a collection of logia having a different origin from the text in which they are embedded in matthew notes are somewhat suggestive of a shorthand writer but the suggestion is unintentional for m renan assumes that these notes were taken not at the time of the delivery of the logia but subsequently while as he assumes the memory of them was living and definite so that in this very citation m renan leaves open the question of the general historical value of the first gospel while it is obvious that the accuracy of notes taken not at the time of delivery but from memory is a matter about which more than one opinion may be fairly held moreover renan expressly calls attention to the difficulty of distinguishing the authentic logia from later additions of the same kind les Évangiles p 201 the fact is there is no contradiction here to that opinion about the first gospel which is expressed in les Évangiles p 175       the text of the socalled matthew supposes the preexistence      of that of mark and does little more than complete it he      completes it in two fashionsfirst by the insertion of      those long discourses which gave their chief value to the      hebrew gospels then by adding traditions of a more modern      formation results of successive developments of the legend      and to which the christian consciousness already attached      infinite value  m renan goes on to suggest that besides mark pseudomatthew used an aramaic version of the gospel originally set forth in that dialect finally as to the second gospel nineteenth century p 365       he mark is full of minute observations proceeding beyond      doubt from an eyewitness there is nothing to conflict      with the supposition that this eyewitness  was the      apostle peter himself as papias has it  let us consider this citation by the light of les Évangiles       this work although composed after the death of peter was      in a sense the work of peter it represents the way in      which peter was accustomed to relate the life of jesus p      116  m renan goes on to say that as an historical document the gospel of mark has a great superiority p 116 but mark has a motive for omitting the discourses and he attaches a puerile importance to miracles p 117 the gospel of mark is less a legend than a biography written with credulity p 118 it would be rash to say that mark has not been interpolated and retouched p 120  if any one thinks that i have not been warranted in drawing a sharp distinction between scientific theologians and counsels for creeds or that my warning against the too ready acceptance of certain declarations as to the state of biblical criticism was needless or that my anxiety as to the sense of the word practical was superfluous let him compare the statement that m renan has made a practical surrender of the adverse case with the facts just set forth for what is the adverse case the question as dr wace puts it is it may be asked how far can we rely on the accounts we possess of our lords teaching on these subjects it will be obvious that m renans statements amount to an adverse answerto a practical denial that any great reliance can be placed on these accounts he does not believe that matthew the apostle wrote the first gospel he does not profess to know who is responsible for the collection of logia or how many of them are authentic though he calls the second gospel the most historical he points out that it is written with credulity and may have been interpolated and retouched and as to the author quel quil soit of the third gospel who is to rely on the accounts of a writer who deserves the cavalier treatment which luke meets with at m renans hands  i repeat what i have already more than once said that the question of the age and the authorship of the gospels has not in my judgment the importance which is so commonly assigned to it for the simple reason that the reports even of eyewitnesses would not suffice to justify belief in a large and essential part of their contents on the contrary these reports would discredit the witnesses the gadarene miracle for example is so extremely improbable that the fact of its being reported by three even independent authorities could not justify belief in it unless we had the clearest evidence as to their capacity as observers and as interpreters of their observations but it is evident that the three authorities are not independent that they have simply adopted a legend of which there were two versions and instead of their proving its truth it suggests their superstitious credulity so that if matthew mark and luke are really responsible for the gospels it is not the better for the gadarene story but the worse for them  a wonderful amount of controversial capital has been made out of my assertion in the note to which i have referred as an obiter dictum of no consequence to my argument that if renans work99 were nonextant the main results of biblical criticism as set forth in the works of strauss baur reuss and volkmar for example would not be sensibly affected i thought i had explained it satisfactorily already but it seems that my explanation has only exhibited still more of my native perversity so i ask for one more chance  in the course of the historical development of any branch of science what is universally observed is this that the men who make epochs and are the real architects of the fabric of exact knowledge are those who introduce fruitful ideas or methods as a rule the man who does this pushes his idea or his method too far or if he does not his school is sure to do so and those who follow have to reduce his work to its proper value and assign it its place in the whole not unfrequently they in their turn overdo the critical process and in trying to eliminate error throw away truth  thus as i said linnæus buffon cuvier lamarck really set forth the results of a developing science although they often heartily contradict one another notwithstanding this circumstance modern classificatory method and nomenclature have largely grown out of the work of linnæus the modern conception of biology as a science and of its relation to climatology geography and geology are as largely rooted in the results of the labours of buffon comparative anatomy and palæontology owe a vast debt to cuviers results while invertebrate zoology and the revival of the idea of evolution are intimately dependent on the results of the work of lamarck in other words the main results of biology up to the early years of this century are to be found in or spring out of the works of these men  so if i mistake not strauss if he did not originate the idea of taking the mythopoeic faculty into account in the development of the gospel narratives and though he may have exaggerated the influence of that faculty obliged scientific theology hereafter to take that element into serious consideration so baur in giving prominence to the cardinal fact of the divergence of the nazarene and pauline tendencies in the primitive church so reuss in setting a marvellous example of the cool and dispassionate application of the principles of scientific criticism over the whole field of scripture so volkmar in his clear and forcible statement of the nazarene limitations of jesus contributed results of permanent value in scientific theology i took these names as they occurred to me undoubtedly i might have advantageously added to them perhaps i might have made a better selection but it really is absurd to try to make out that i did not know that these writers widely disagree and i believe that no scientific theologian will deny that in principle what i have said is perfectly correct ecclesiastical advocates of course cannot be expected to take this view of the matter to them these mere seekers after truth in so far as their results are unfavourable to the creed the clerics have to support are more or less infidels or favourers of infidelity and the only thing they care to see or probably can see is the fact that in a great many matters the truthseekers differ from one another and therefore can easily be exhibited to the public as if they did nothing else as if any one who referred to their having each and all contributed his share to the results of theological science was merely showing his ignorance and as if a charge of inconsistency could be based on the fact that he himself often disagrees with what they say i have never lent a shadow of foundation to the assumption that i am a follower of either strauss or baur or reuss or volkmar or renan my debts to these eminent menso far my superiors in theological knowledgeis indeed great yet it is not for their opinions but for those i have been able to form for myself by their help  in agnosticism a rejoinder p 266 i have referred to the difficulties under which those professors of the science of theology whose tenure of their posts depends on the results of their investigations must labour and in a note i add       imagine that all our chairs of astronomy had been founded in      the fourteenth century and that their incumbents were bound      to sign ptolemaic articles in that case with every respect      for the efforts of persons thus hampered to attain and      expound the truth i think men of common sense would go      elsewhere to learn astronomy  i did not write this paragraph without a knowledge that its sense would be open to the kind of perversion which it has suffered but if that was clear the necessity for the statement was still clearer it is my deliberate opinion i reiterate it and i say that in my judgment it is extremely inexpedient that any subject which calls itself a science should be intrusted to teachers who are debarred from freely following out scientific methods to their legitimate conclusions whatever those conclusions may be if i may borrow a phrase paraded at the church congress i think it ought to be unpleasant for any man of science to find himself in the position of such a teacher  human nature is not altered by seating it in a professorial chair even of theology i have very little doubt that if in the year 1859 the tenure of my office had depended upon my adherence to the doctrines of cuvier the objections to them set forth in the origin of species would have had a halo of gravity about them that being free to teach what i pleased i failed to discover and in making that statement it does not appear to me that i am confessing that i should have been debarred by selfish interests from making candid inquiry or that i should have been biassed by sordid motives i hope that even such a fragment of moral sense as may remain in an ecclesiastical infidel might have got me through the difficulty but it would be unworthy to deny or disguise the fact that a very serious difficulty must have been created for me by the nature of my tenure and let it be observed that the temptation in my case would have been far slighter than in that of a professor of theology whatever biological doctrine i had repudiated nobody i cared for would have thought the worse of me for so doing no scientific journals would have howled me down as the religious newspapers howled down my too honest friend the late bishop of natal nor would my colleagues of the royal society have turned their backs upon me as his episcopal colleagues boycotted him  i say these facts are obvious and that it is wholesome and needful that they should be stated it is in the interests of theology if it be a science and it is in the interests of those teachers of theology who desire to be something better than counsel for creeds that it should be taken to heart the seeker after theological truth and that only will no more suppose that i have insulted him than the prisoner who works in fetters will try to pick a quarrel with me if i suggest that he would get on better if the fetters were knocked off unless indeed as it is said does happen in the course of long captivities that the victim at length ceases to feel the weight of his chains or even takes to hugging them as if they were honourable

to an end of disputation and that the hatchet of war was finally superseded by the calumet which as mr gladstone i believe objects to tobacco i was quite willing to smoke for both but i have had once again to discover that the adage that whoso seeks peace will ensue it is a somewhat hasty generalisation the renowned warrior with whom it is my misfortune to be opposed in most things has dug up the axe and is on the warpath once more the weapon has been wielded with all the dexterity which long practice has conferred on a past master in craft whether of wood or state and i have reason to believe that the simpler sort of the great tribe which he heads imagine that my scalp is already on its way to adorn their big chiefs wigwam i am glad therefore to be able to relieve any anxieties which my friends may entertain without delay i assure them that my skull retains its normal covering and that though naturally i may have felt alarmed nothing serious has happened my doughty adversary has merely performed a war dance and his blows have for the most part cut the air i regret to add however that by misadventure and i am afraid i must say carelessness he has inflicted one or two severe contusions on himself  when the noise of approaching battle roused me from the dreams of peace which occupy my retirement i was glad to observe since i must fight that the campaign was to be opened upon a new field when the contest raged over the pentateuchal myth of the creation mr gladstones manifest want of acquaintance with the facts and principles involved in the discussion no less than with the best literature on his own side of the subject gave me the uncomfortable feeling that i had my adversary at a disadvantage the sun of science at my back was in his eyes but on the present occasion we are happily on an equality history and biblical criticism are as much or as little my vocation as they are that of mr gladstone the blinding from too much light or the blindness from too little may be presumed to be equally shared by both of us  mr gladstone takes up his new position in the country of the gadarenes his strategic sense justly leads him to see that the authority of the teachings of the synoptic gospels touching the nature of the spiritual world turns upon the acceptance or the rejection of the gadarene and other like stories as we accept or repudiate such histories as that of the possessed pigs so shall we accept or reject the witness of the synoptics to such miraculous interventions  it is exactly because these stories constitute the keystone of the orthodox arch that i originally drew attention to them and in spite of my longing for peace i am truly obliged to mr gladstone for compelling me to place my case before the public once more it may be thought that this is a work of supererogation by those who are aware that my essay is the subject of attack in a work so largely circulated as the impregnable rock of holy scripture and who may possibly in their simplicity assume that it must be truthfully set forth in that work but the warmest admirers of mr gladstone will hardly be prepared to maintain that mathematical accuracy in stating the opinions of an opponent is the most prominent feature of his controversial method and what follows will show that in the present case the desire to be fair and accurate the existence of which i am bound to assume has not borne as much fruit as might have been expected  in referring to the statement of the narrators that the herd of swine perished in consequence of the entrance into them of the demons by the permission or order of jesus of nazareth i said  everything that i know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example nineteenth century february 1889 p 172  mr gladstone has not found it convenient to cite this passage and in view of various considerations i dare not assume that he would assent to it without sundry subtle modifications which for me might possibly rob it of its argumentative value but until the proposition is seriously controverted i shall assume it to be true and content myself with warning the reader that neither he nor i have any grounds for assuming mr gladstones concurrence with this caution i proceed to remark that i think it may be granted that the people whose herd of 2000 swine more or fewer was suddenly destroyed suffered great loss and damage and it is quite certain that the narrators of the gadarene story do not in any way refer to the point of morality and legality thus raised as i said they show no inkling of the moral and legal difficulties which arise  such being the facts of the case i submit that for those who admit the principle laid down the conclusion which i have drawn necessarily follows though i repeat that since mr gladstone does not explicitly admit the principle i am far from suggesting that he is bound by its logical consequences however i distinctly reiterate the opinion that any one who acted in the way described in the story would in my judgment be guilty of a misdemeanour of evil example about that point i desire to leave no ambiguity whatever and it follows that if i believed the story i should have no hesitation in applying this judgment to the chief actor in it  but if any one will do me the favour to turn to the paper in which these passages occur he will find that a considerable part of it is devoted to the exposure of the familiar trick of the counsel for creeds who when they wish to profit by the easily stirred odium theologicum are careful to confuse disbelief in a narrative of a mans act or disapproval of the acts as narrated with disbelieving and vilipending the man himself if i say that according to paragraphs in several newspapers my valued separatist friend ab has houghed a lot of cattle which he considered to be unlawfully in the possession of an irish landgrabber that in my opinion any such act is a misdemeanour of evil example but that i utterly disbelieve the whole story and have no doubt that it is a mere fabrication it really appears to me that if any one charges me with calling ab an immoral misdemeanant i should be justified in using very strong language respecting either his sanity or his veracity and if an analogous charge has been brought in reference to the gadarene story there is certainly no excuse producible on account of any lack of plain speech on my part surely no language can be more explicit than that which follows  i can discern no escape from this dilemma either jesus said what he is reported to have said or he did not in the former case it is inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the unseen world should be roughly shaken in the latter the blow falls upon the authority of the synoptic gospels p 173 the choice then lies between discrediting those who compiled the gospel biographies and disbelieving the master whom they simple souls thought to honour by preserving such traditions of the exercise of his authority over satans invisible world p 174 and i leave no shadow of doubt as to my own choice after what has been said i do not think that any sensible man unless he happen to be angry will accuse me of contradicting the lord and his apostles if i reiterate my total disbelief in the whole gadarene story p 178  i am afraid therefore that mr gladstone must have been exceedingly angry when he committed himself to such a statement as follows       so then after eighteen centuries of worship offered to our      lord by the most cultivated the most developed and the      most progressive portion of the human race it has been      reserved to a scientific inquirer to discover that he was no      better than a lawbreaker and an evildoer how in such      a matter came the honours of originality to be reserved to      our time and to professor huxley pp 269 270  truly the hatchet is hardly a weapon of precision but would seem to have rather more the character of the boomerang which returns to damage the reckless thrower doubtless such incidents are somewhat ludicrous but they have a very serious side and if i rated the opinion of those who blindly follow mr gladstones leading but not light in these matters much higher than the great duke of wellingtons famous standard of minimum value i think i might fairly beg them to reflect upon the general bearings of this particular example of his controversial method i imagine it can hardly commend itself to their cool judgment  after this tragicomical ending to what an old historian calls a robustious and rough coming on and after some praises of the provisions of the mosaic law in the matter of not eating porkin which as pork disagrees with me and for some other reasons i am much disposed to concur though i do not see what they have to do with the matter in handcomes the serious onslaught       mr huxley exercising his rapid judgment on the text does      not appear to have encumbered himself with the labour of      inquiring what anybody else had known or said about it he      has thus missed a point which might have been set up in      support of his accusation against our lord p 273  unhappily for my conduct i have been much exercised in controversy during the past thirty years and the only compensation for the loss of time and the trials of temper which it has inflicted upon me is that i have come to regard it as a branch of the fine arts and to take an impartial and æsthetic interest in the way in which it is conducted even by those whose efforts are directed against myself now from the purely artistic point of view which as we are all being told has nothing to do with morals i consider it an axiom that one should never appear to doubt that the other side has performed the elementary duty of acquiring proper elementary information unless there is demonstrative evidence to the contrary and i think though i admit that this may be a purely subjective appreciation that unless you are quite certain there is a want of finish as a great master of disputation once put it about the suggestion that your opponent has missed a point on his own side because it may happen that he has not missed it at all but only thought it unworthy of serious notice and if he proves that the suggestion looks foolish  merely noting the careful repetition of a charge the absurdity of which has been sufficiently exposed above i now ask my readers to accompany me on a little voyage of discovery in search of the side on which the rapid judgment and the ignorance of the literature of the subject lie i think i may promise them very little trouble and a good deal of entertainment  mr gladstone is of opinion that the gadarene swinefolk were hebrews bound by the mosaic law p 274 and he conceives that it has not occurred to me to learn what may be said in favour of and against this view he tells us that       some commentators have alleged the authority of josephus for      stating that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of      jews from whence it might be inferred that to keep swine      was innocent and lawful p 273  mr gladstone then goes on to inform his readers that in his painstaking search after truth he has submitted to the labour of personally examining the writings of josephus moreover in a note he positively exhibits an acquaintance in addition with the works of bishop wordsworth and of archbishop trench and even shows that he has read hudsons commentary on josephus and yet people say that our biblical critics do not equal the germans in research but mr gladstones citation of cuvier and sir john herschel about the creation myth and his ignorance of all the best modern writings on his own side produced a great impression on my mind i have had the audacity to suspect that his acquaintance with what has been done in biblical history might stand at no higher level than his information about the natural sciences however unwillingly i have felt bound to consider the possibility that mr gladstones labours in this matter may have carried him no further than josephus and the worthy but somewhat antique episcopal and other authorities to whom he refers that even his reading of josephus may have been of the most cursory nature directed not to the understanding of his author but to the discovery of useful controversial matter and that in view of the not inconsiderable misrepresentation of my statements to which i have drawn attention it might be that mr gladstones exposition of the evidence of josephus was not more trustworthy i proceed to show that my previsions have been fully justified i doubt if controversial literature contains anything more piquant than the story i have to unfold  that i should be reproved for rapidity of judgment is very just however quaint the situation of mr gladstone as the reprover may seem to people blessed with a sense of humour but it is a quality the defects of which have been painfully obvious to me all my life and i try to keep my pegasusat best a poor shetland variety of that species of quadrupedat a respectable jogtrot by loading him heavily with bales of reading those who took the trouble to study my paper in good faith and not for mere controversial purposes have a right to know that something more than a hasty glimpse of two or three passages of josephus even with as many episcopal works thrown in lay at the back of the few paragraphs i devoted to the gadarene story i proceed to set forth as briefly as i can some results of that preparatory work my artistic principles do not permit me at present to express a doubt that mr gladstone was acquainted with the facts i am about to mention when he undertook to write but if he did know them then both what he has said and what he has not said his assertions and his omissions alike will require a paragraph to themselves  the common consent of the synoptic gospels affirms that the miraculous transference of devils from a man or men to sundry pigs took place somewhere on the eastern shore of the lake of tiberias on the other side of the sea over against galilee the western shore being without doubt included in the latter province but there is no such concord when we come to the name of the part of the eastern shore on which according to the story jesus and his disciples landed in the revised version matthew calls it the country of the gadarenes luke and mark have gerasenes in sundry very ancient manuscripts gergesenes occurs  the existence of any place called gergesa however is declared by the weightiest authorities whom i have consulted to be very questionable and no such town is mentioned in the list of the cities of the decapolis in the territory of which as it would seem from mark v 20 the transaction was supposed to take place about gerasa on the other hand there hangs no such doubt it was a large and important member of the group of the decapolitan cities but gerasa is more than thirty miles distant from the nearest part of the lake of tiberias while the city mentioned in the narrative could not have been very far off the scene of the event however as gerasa was a very important hellenic city not much more than a score of miles from gadara it is easily imaginable that a locality which was part of decapolitan territory may have been spoken of as belonging to one of the two cities when it really appertained to the other after weighing all the arguments no doubt remains on my mind that gadarene is the proper reading at the period under consideration gadara appears to have been a goodsized fortified town about two miles in circumference it was a place of considerable strategic importance inasmuch as it lay on a high ridge at the point of intersection of the roads from tiberias scythopolis damascus and gerasa three miles north from it where the tiberias road descended into the valley of the hieromices lay the famous hot springs and the fashionable baths of amatha on the northeast side the remains of the extensive necropolis of gadara are still to be seen innumerable sepulchral chambers are excavated in the limestone cliffs and many of them still contain sarcophaguses of basalt while not a few are converted into dwellings by the inhabitants of the present village of um keis the distance of gadara from the southeastern shore of the lake of tiberias is less than seven miles the nearest of the other cities of the decapolis to the north is hippos which also lay some seven miles off in the southeastern corner of the shore of the lake in accordance with the ancient hellenic practice that each city should be surrounded by a certain amount of territory amenable to its jurisdiction101 and on other grounds it may be taken for certain that the intermediate country was divided between gadara and hippos and that the citizens of gadara had free access to a port on the lake hence the title of country of the gadarenes applied to the locality of the porcine catastrophe becomes easily intelligible the swine may well be imagined to have been feeding as they do now in the adjacent region on the hillsides which slope somewhat steeply down to the lake from the northern boundary wall of the valley of the hieromices nahr yarmuk about halfway between the city and the shore and doubtless lay well within the territory of the polis of gadara  the proof that gadara was to all intents and purposes a gentile and not a jewish city is complete the date and the occasion of its foundation are unknown but it certainly existed in the third century bc antiochus the great annexed it to his dominions in bc 198 after this during the brief revival of jewish autonomy alexander jannæus took it and for the first time so far as the records go it fell under jewish rule102 from this it was rescued by pompey bc 63 who rebuilt the city and incorporated it with the province of syria in gratitude to the romans for the dissolution of a hated union the gadarenes adopted the pompeian era of their coinage gadara was a commercial centre of some importance and therefore it may be assumed jews settled in it as they settled in almost all considerable gentile cities but a wholly mistaken estimate of the magnitude of the jewish colony has been based upon the notion that gabinius proconsul of syria in 5755 bc seated one of the five sanhedrins in gadara schürer has pointed out that what he really did was to lodge one of them in gadara far away on the other side of the jordan this is one of the many errors which have arisen out of the confusion of the names gadara gazara and gabara  augustus made a present of gadara to herod the great as an appanage personal to himself and upon herods death recognising it to be a grecian city like hippos and gaza103 he transferred it back to its former place in the province of syria that herod made no effort to judaise his temporary possession but rather the contrary is obvious from the fact that the coins of gadara while under his rule bear the image of augustus with the superscription greek sebastosa flying in the face of jewish prejudices which even he did not dare to venture upon in judæa and i may remark that if my cotrustee of the british museum had taken the trouble to visit the splendid numismatic collection under our charge he might have seen two coins of gadara one of the time of tiberius and the other of that of titus each bearing the effigies of the emperor on the obverse while the personified genius of the city is on the reverse of the former further the wellknown works of de saulcy and of ekhel would have supplied the information that from the time of augustus to that of gordian the gadarene coinage had the same thoroughly gentile character curious that a city of hebrews bound by the mosaic law should tolerate such a mint  whatever increase in population the ghetto of gadara may have undergone between bc 4 and ad 66 it nowise affected the gentile and antijudaic character of the city at the outbreak of the great war for josephus tells us that immediately after the great massacre of cæsarea the revolted jews laid waste the villages of the syrians and their neighbouring cities philadelphia and sebonitis and gerasa and pella and scythopolis and after them gadara and hippos wars ii xviii 1 i submit that if gadara had been a city of hebrews bound by the mosaic law the ravaging of their territory by their brother jews in revenge for the massacre of the cæsarean jews by the gentile population of that place would surely have been a somewhat unaccountable proceeding but when we proceed a little further to the fifth section of the chapter in which this statement occurs the whole affair becomes intelligible enough       besides this murder at scythopolis the other cities rose up      against the jews that were among them those of askelon slew      two thousand five hundred and those of ptolemais two      thousand and put not a few into bonds those of tyre also      put a great number to death but kept a great number in      prison moreover those of hippos and those of gadara did      the like while they put to death the boldest of the jews      but kept those of whom they were most afraid in custody as      did the rest of the cities of syria according as they every      one either hated them or were afraid of them  josephus is not always trustworthy but he has no conceivable motive for altering facts here he speaks of contemporary events in which he himself took an active part and he characterises the cities in the way familiar to him for josephus gadara is just as much a gentile city as ptolemais it was reserved for his latest commentator either ignoring or ignorant of all this to tell us that gadara had a hebrew population bound by the mosaic law  in the face of all this evidence most of which has been put before serious students with full reference to the needful authorities and in a thoroughly judicial manner by schürer in his classical work104 one reads with stupefaction the statement which mr gladstone has thought fit to put before the uninstructed public       some commentators have alleged the authority of josephus for      stating that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of      jews from whence it might be inferred that to keep swine      was innocent and lawful this is not quite the place for a      critical examination of the matter but i have examined it      and have satisfied myself that josephus gives no reason      whatever to suppose that the population of gadara and still      less if less may be the population of the neighbourhood      and least of all the swineherding or lower portion of that      population were other than hebrews bound by the mosaic law      pp 3734  even rapid judgment cannot be pleaded in excuse for this surprising statement because a note on the gadarene miracle is added in a special appendix in which the references are given to the passages of josephus by the improved interpretation of which mr gladstone has thus contrived to satisfy himself of the thing which is not one of these is antiquities xvii xiii 4 in which section i regret to say i can find no mention of gadara in antiquities xvii xi 4 however there is a passage which would appear to be that mr gladstone means and i will give it in full although i have already cited part of it       there were also certain of the cities which paid tribute to      archelaus stratos tower and sebaste with joppa and      jerusalem for as to gaza gadara and hippos they were      grecian cities which cæsar separated from his government      and added them to the province of syria  that is to say augustus simply restored the state of things which existed before he gave gadara then certainly a gentile city lying outside judæa to herod as a mark of great personal favour yet mr gladstone can gravely tell those who are not in a position to check his statements       the sense seems to be not that these cities were inhabited      by a greek population but that they had politically been      taken out of judæa and added to syria which i presume was      classified as simply hellenic a portion of the great greek      empire erected by alexander pp 2956  mr gladstones next reference is to the wars iii vii 1       so vespasian marched to the city gadara and took it upon      the first onset because he found it destitute of a      considerable number of men grown up for war he then came      into it and slew all the youth the romans having no mercy      on any age whatsoever and this was done out of the hatred      they bore the nation and because of the iniquity they had      been guilty of in the affair of cestius  obviously then gadara was an ultrajewish city qed but a student trained in the use of weapons of precision rather than in that of rhetorical tomahawks has had many and painful warnings to look well about him before trusting an argument to the mercies of a passage the context of which he has not carefully considered if mr gladstone had not been too much in a hurry to turn his imaginary prize to accountif he had paused just to look at the preceding chapter of josephushe would have discovered that his much haste meant very little speed he would have found wars iii vi 2 that vespasian marched from his base the port of ptolemais acre on the shores of the mediterranean into galilee and having dealt with the socalled gadara was minded to finish with jotapata a strong place about fourteen miles southeast of ptolemais into which josephus who at first had fled to tiberias eventually threw himselfvespasian arriving before jotapata the very next day now if any one will take a decent map of ancient palestine in hand he will see that jotapata as i have said lies about fourteen miles in a straight line eastsoutheast of ptolemais while a certain town gabara which was also held by the jews is situated about the same distance to the east of that port nothing can be more obvious than that vespasian wishing to advance from ptolemais into galilee could not afford to leave these strongholds in the possession of the enemy and as gabara would lie on his left flank when he moved to jotapata he took that city whence his communications with his base could easily be threatened first it might really have been fair evidence of demoniac possession if the best general of rome had marched forty odd miles as the crow flies through hostile galilee to take a city which moreover had just tried to abolish its jewish population on the other side of the jordan and then marched back again to a place fourteen miles off his startingpoint105 one would think that the most careless of readers must be startled by this incongruity into inquiring whether there might not be something wrong with the text and if he had done so he would have easily discovered that since the time of reland a century and a half ago careful scholars have read gabara for gadara106  once more i venture to point out that training in the use of the weapons of precision of science may have its value in historical studies if only in preventing the occurrence of droll blunders in geography  in the third citation wars iv vii josephus tells us that vespasian marched against gadara which he calls the metropolis of peræa it was possibly the seat of a common festival of the decapolitan cities and entered it without opposition the wealthy and powerful citizens having opened negotiations with him without the knowledge of an opposite party who as being inferior in number to their enemies who were within the city and seeing the romans very near the city resolved to fly before doing so however they after a fashion unfortunately too common among the zealots murdered and shockingly mutilated dolesus a man of the first rank who had promoted the embassy to vespasian and then ran out of the city hereupon the people of gadara surely not this time hebrews bound by the mosaic law received vespasian with joyful acclamations voluntarily pulled down their wall so that the city could not in future be used as a fortress by the jews and accepted a roman garrison for their future protection granting that this gadara really is the city of the gadarenes the reference without citation to the passage in support of mr gladstones contention seems rather remarkable taken in conjunction with the shortly antecedent ravaging of the gadarene territory by the jews in fact better proof could hardly be expected of the real state of the case namely that the population of gadara and notably the wealthy and respectable part of it was thoroughly hellenic though as in cæsarea and elsewhere among the palestinian cities the rabble contained a considerable body of fanatical jews whose reckless ferocity made them even though a mere minority of the population a standing danger to the city  thus mr gladstones conclusion from his study of josephus that the population of gadara were hebrews bound by the mosaic law turns out to depend upon nothing better than the marvellously complete misinterpretation of what that author says combined with equally marvellous geographical misunderstandings long since exposed and rectified while the positive evidence that gadara like other cities of the decapolis was thoroughly hellenic in organisation and essentially gentile in population is overwhelming  and that being the fact of the matter patent to all who will take the trouble to enquire about what has been said about it however obscure to those who merely talk of so doing the thesis that the gadarene swineherds or owners were jews violating the mosaic law shows itself to be an empty and most unfortunate guess but really whether they that kept the swine were jews or whether they were gentiles is a consideration which has no relevance whatever to my case the legal provisions which alone had authority over an inhabitant of the country of the gadarenes were the gentile laws sanctioned by the roman suzerain of the province of syria just as the only law which has authority in england is that recognised by the sovereign legislature jewish communities in england may have their private code as they doubtless had in gadara but an english magistrate if called upon to enforce their peculiar laws would dismiss the complainants from the judgment seat let us hope with more politeness than gallio did in a like case but quite as firmly moreover in the matter of keeping pigs we may be quite certain that gadarene law left everybody free to do as he pleased indeed encouraged the practice rather than otherwise not only was pork one of the commonest and one of the most favourite articles of roman diet but to both greeks and romans the pig was a sacrificial animal of high importance sucking pigs played an important part in hellenic purificatory rites and everybody knows the significance of the roman suovetaurilia depicted on so many basreliefs  under these circumstances only the extreme need of a despairing reconciler drowning in a sea of adverse facts can explain the catching at such a poor straw as the reckless guess that the swineherds of the country of the gadarenes were erring jews doing a little clandestine business on their own account the endeavour to justify the asserted destruction of the swine by the analogy of breaking open a cask of smuggled spirits and wasting their contents on the ground is curiously unfortunate does mr gladstone mean to suggest that a frenchman landing at dover and coming upon a cask of smuggled brandy in the course of a stroll along the cliffs has the right to break it open and waste its contents on the ground yet the party of galileans who according to the narrative landed and took a walk on the gadarene territory were as much foreigners in the decapolis as frenchmen would be at dover herod antipas their sovereign had no jurisdiction in the decapolisthey were strangers and aliens with no more right to interfere with a pigkeeping hebrew than i have a right to interfere with an english professor of the israelitic faith if i see a slice of ham on his plate according to the law of the country in which these galilean foreigners found themselves men might keep pigs if they pleased if the men who kept them were jews it might be permissible for the strangers to inform the religious authority acknowledged by the jews of gadara but to interfere themselves in such a matter was a step devoid of either moral or legal justification  suppose a modern english sabbatarian fanatic who believes on the strength of his interpretation of the fourth commandment that it is a deadly sin to work on the lords day sees a fellow puritan yielding to the temptation of getting in his harvest on a fine sunday morningis the former justified in setting fire to the latters corn would not an english court of justice speedily teach him better  in truth the government which permits private persons on any pretext especially pious and patriotic pretexts to take the law into their own hands fails in the performance of the primary duties of all governments while those who set the example of such acts or who approve them or who fail to disapprove them are doing their best to dissolve civil society they are compassers of illegality and fautors of immorality  i fully understand that mr gladstone may not see the matter in this light he may possibly consider that the union of gadara with the decapolis by augustus was a blackguard transaction which deprived hellenic gadarene law of all moral force and that it was quite proper for a jewish galilean going back to the time when the land of the girgashites was given to his ancestors some 1500 years before to act as if the state of things which ought to obtain in territory which traditionally at any rate belonged to his forefathers did really exist and that being so i can only say i do not agree with him but leave the matter to the appreciation of those of our countrymen happily not yet the minority who believe that the first condition of enduring liberty is obedience to the law of the land                                       the end of the month drawing nigh i thought it well to send away the manuscript of the foregoing pages yesterday leaving open in my own mind the possibility of adding a succinct characterisation of mr gladstones controversial methods as illustrated therein this morning however i had the pleasure of reading a speech which i think must satisfy the requirements of the most fastidious of controversial artists and there occurs in it so concise yet so complete a delineation of mr gladstones way of dealing with disputed questions of another kind that no poor effort of mine could better it as a description of the aspect which his treatment of scientific historical and critical questions presents to me       the smallest examination would have told a man of his      capacity and of his experience that he was uttering the      grossest exaggerations that he was basing arguments upon      the slightest hypotheses and that his discussions only had      to be critically examined by the most careless critic in      order to show their intrinsic hollowness  those who have followed me through this paper will hardly dispute the justice of this judgment severe as it is but the chief secretary for ireland has science in the blood and has the advantage of a natural as well as a highly cultivated aptitude for the use of methods of precision in investigation and for the exact enunciation of the results thereby obtained  footnotes      101 thus josephus lib ix says that his rival justus           persuaded the citizens of tiberias to set the villages           that belonged to gadara and hippos on fire which           villages were situated on the borders of tiberias and           of the region of scythopolis      102 it is said to have been destroyed by its captors      103 but as to the grecian cities gaza and gadara and           hippos he cut them off from the kingdom and added

contributed by mr gladstone to good words having been revised and enlarged by their author appeared last year as a separate volume under the somewhat defiant title of the impregnable rock of holy scripture  the last of these essays entitled conclusion contains an attack or rather several attacks couched in language which certainly does not err upon the side of moderation or of courtesy upon statements and opinions of mine one of these assaults is a deliberately devised attempt not merely to rouse the theological prejudices ingrained in the majority of mr gladstones readers but to hold me up as a person who has endeavoured to besmirch the personal character of the object of their veneration for mr gladstone asserts that i have undertaken to try the character of our lord p 268 and he tells the many who are as i think unfortunately predisposed to place implicit credit in his assertions that it has been reserved for me to discover that jesus was no better than a lawbreaker and an evildoer p 269  it was extremely easy for me to prove as i did in the pages of this review last december that under the most favourable interpretation this amazing declaration must be ascribed to extreme confusion of thought and by bringing an abundance of goodwill to the consideration of the subject i have now convinced myself that it is right for me to admit that a person of mr gladstones intellectual acuteness really did mistake the reprobation of the course of conduct ascribed to jesus in a story of which i expressly say i do not believe a word for an attack on his character and a declaration that he was no better than a lawbreaker and an evildoer at any rate so far as i can see this is what mr gladstone wished to be believed when he wrote the following passage       i must however in passing make the confession that i did      not state with accuracy as i ought to have done the      precise form of the accusation i treated it as an      imputation on the action of our lord he replies that it is      only an imputation on the narrative of three evangelists      respecting him the difference from his point of view is      probably material and i therefore regret that i overlooked      it107  considering the gravity of the error which is here admitted the fashion of the withdrawal appears more singular than admirable from my point of viewnot from mr gladstones apparentlythe little discrepancy between the facts and mr gladstones carefully offensive travesty of them is probably only probably material however as mr gladstone concludes with an official expression of regret for his error it is my business to return an equally official expression of gratitude for the attenuated reparation with which i am favoured  having cleared this specimen of mr gladstones controversial method out of the way i may proceed to the next assault that on a passage in an article on agnosticism nineteenth century february 1889 published two years ago i there said in referring to the gadarene story everything i know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example on this mr gladstone continuing his candid and urbane observations remarks impregnable rock p 273 that exercising his rapid judgment on the text and not inquiring what anybody else had known or said about it i had missed a point in support of that accusation against our lord which he has now been constrained to admit i never made  the point in question is that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of jews from whence it might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful i conceive that i have abundantly proved that gadara answered exactly to the description here given of it and i shall show by and by that mr gladstone has used language which to my mind involves the admission that the authorities of the city were not jews but i have also taken a good deal of pains to show that the question thus raised is of no importance in relation to the main issue108 if gadara was as i maintain it was a city of the decapolis hellenistic in constitution and containing a predominantly gentile population my case is superabundantly fortified on the other hand if the hypothesis that gadara was under jewish government which mr gladstone seems sometimes to defend and sometimes to give up were accepted my case would be nowise weakened at any rate gadara was not included within the jurisdiction of the tetrach of galilee if it had been the galileans who crossed over the lake to gadara had no official status and they had no more civil right to punish lawbreakers than any other strangers  in my turn however i may remark that there is a point which appears to have escaped mr gladstones notice and that is somewhat unfortunate because his whole argument turns upon it mr gladstone assumes as a matter of course that pigkeeping was an offence against the law of moses and therefore that jews who kept pigs were as much liable to legal pains and penalties as englishmen who smuggle brandy impregnable rock p 274  there can be no doubt that according to the law as it is defined in the pentateuch the pig was an unclean animal and that pork was a forbidden article of diet moreover since pigs are hardly likely to be kept for the mere love of those unsavoury animals pigowning or swineherding must have been and evidently was regarded as a suspicious and degrading occupation by strict jews in the first century ad but i should like to know on what provision of the mosaic law as it is laid down in the pentateuch mr gladstone bases the assumption which is essential to his case that the possession of pigs and the calling of a swineherd were actually illegal the inquiry was put to me the other day and as i could not answer it i turned up the article schwein in riehms standard handwörterbuch for help out of my difficulty but unfortunately without success after speaking of the martyrdom which the jews under antiochus epiphanes preferred to eating pork the writer proceeds       it may be nevertheless that the practice of keeping pigs      may have found its way into palestine in the græcoroman      time in consequence of the great increase of the nonjewish      population yet there is no evidence of it in the new      testament the great herd of swine 2000 in number      mentioned in the narrative of the possessed was feeding in      the territory of gadara which belonged to the decapolis      and the prodigal son became a swineherd with the native of a      far country into which he had wandered in neither of these      cases is there reason for thinking that the possessors of      these herds were jews109  having failed in my search so far i took up the next book of reference at hand kittos cyclopædia vol iii 1876 there under swine the writer colonel hamilton smith seemed at first to give me what i wanted as he says that swine appear to have been repeatedly introduced and reared by the hebrew people110 notwithstanding the strong prohibition in the law of moses is lxv 4 but in the first place isaiahs writings form no part of the law of moses and in the second place the people denounced by the prophet in this passage are neither the possessors of pigs nor swineherds but these which eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels and when in despair i turned to the provisions of the law itself my difficulty was not cleared up leviticus xi 8 revised version says in reference to the pig and other unclean animals of their flesh ye shall not eat and their carcasses ye shall not touch in the revised version of deuteronomy xiv 8 the words of the prohibition are identical and a skilful refiner might possibly satisfy himself even if he satisfied nobody else that carcase means the body of a live animal as well as a dead one and that since swineherds could hardly avoid contact with their charges their calling was implicitly forbidden111 unfortunately the authorised version expressly says dead carcase and thus the most rabbinically minded of reconcilers might find his casuistry foiled by that great source of surprises the original hebrew that such check is at any rate possible is clear from the fact that the legal uncleanness of some animals as food did not interfere with their being lawfully possessed cared for and sold by jews the provisions for the ransoming of unclean beasts lev xxvii 27 and for the redemption of their sucklings numbers xviii 15 sufficiently prove this as the late dr kalisch has observed in his commentary on leviticus part ii p 129 note       though asses and horses camels and dogs were kept by the      israelites they were to a certain extent associated with      the notion of impurity they might be turned to profitable      account by their labour or otherwise but in respect to food      they were an abomination  the same learned commentator loc cit p 88 proves that the talmudists forbade the rearing of pigs by jews unconditionally and everywhere and even included it under the same ban as the study of greek philosophy since both alike were considered to lead to the desertion of the jewish faith it is very possible indeed probable that the pharisees of the fourth decade of our first century took as strong a view of pigkeeping as did their spiritual descendants but for all that it does not follow that the practice was illegal the stricter jews could not have despised and hated swineherds more than they did publicans but so far as i know there is no provision in the law against the practice of the calling of a taxgatherer by a jew the publican was in fact very much in the position of an irish processserver at the present daymore rather than less despised and hated on account of the perfect legality of his occupation except for certain sacrificial purposes pigs were held in such abhorrence by the ancient egyptians that swineherds were not permitted to enter a temple or to intermarry with other castes and any one who had touched a pig even accidentally was unclean but these very regulations prove that pigkeeping was not illegal it merely involved certain civil and religious disabilities for the jews dogs were typically unclean animals but when that eminently pious hebrew tobit went forth with the angel the young mans dog went with them tobit v 16 without apparent remonstrance from the celestial guide i really do not see how an appeal to the law could have justified any one in drowning tobits dog on the ground that his master was keeping and feeding an animal quite as unclean as any pig certainly the excellent raguel must have failed to see the harm of dogkeeping for we are told that on the travellers return homewards the dog went after them xi 4  until better light than i have been able to obtain is thrown upon the subject therefore it is obvious that mr gladstones argumentative house has been built upon an extremely slippery quicksand perhaps even has no foundation at all  yet another point does not seem to have occurred to mr gladstone who is so much shocked that i attach no overwhelming weight to the assertions contained in the synoptic gospels even when all three concur these gospels agree in stating in the most express and to some extent verbally identical terms that the devils entered the pigs at their own request112 and the third gospel viii 31 tells us what the motive of the demons was in asking the singular boon they intreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss from this it would seem that the devils thought to exchange the heavy punishment of transportation to the abyss for the lighter penalty of imprisonment in swine and some commentators more ingenious than respectful to the supposed chief actor in this extraordinary fable have dwelt with satisfaction upon the very unpleasant quarter of an hour which the evil spirits must have had when the headlong rush of their maddened tenements convinced them how completely they were taken in in the whole story there is not one solitary hint that the destruction of the pigs was intended as a punishment of their owners or of the swineherds on the contrary the concurrent testimony of the three narratives is to the effect that the catastrophe was the consequence of diabolic suggestion and indeed no source could be more appropriate for an act of such manifest injustice and illegality  i can but marvel that modern defenders of the faith should not be glad of any reasonable excuse for getting rid of a story which if it had been invented by voltaire would have justly let loose floods of orthodox indignation                                       thus the hypothesis to which mr gladstone so fondly clings finds no support in the provisions of the law of moses as that law is defined in the pentateuch while it is wholly inconsistent with the concurrent testimony of the synoptic gospels to which mr gladstone attaches so much weight in my judgment it is directly contrary to everything which profane history tells us about the constitution and the population of the city of gadara and it commits those who accept it to a story which if it were true would implicate the founder of christianity in an illegal and inequitable act  such being the case i consider myself excused from following mr gladstone through all the meanderings of his late attempt to extricate himself from the maze of historical and exegetical difficulties in which he is entangled i content myself with assuring those who with my paper not mr gladstones version of my arguments in hand consult the original authorities that they will find full justification for every statement i have made but in order to dispose those who cannot or will not take that trouble to believe that the proverbial blindness of one that judges his own cause plays no part in inducing me to speak thus decidedly i beg their attention to the following examination which shall be as brief as i can make it of the seven propositions in which mr gladstone professes to give a faithful summary of my errors  when in the middle of the seventeenth century the holy see declared that certain propositions contained in the work of bishop jansen were heretical the jansenists of port royal replied that while they were ready to defer to the papal authority about questions of faith and morals they must be permitted to judge about questions of fact for themselves and that really the condemned propositions were not to be found in jansens writings as everybody knows his holiness and the grand monarque replied to this surely not unreasonable plea after the manner of lord peter in the tale of a tub it is therefore not without some apprehension of meeting with a similar fate that i put in a like plea against mr gladstones bull the seven propositions declared to be false and condemnable in that kindly and gentle way which so pleasantly compares with the authoritative style of the vatican no 5 more particularly may or may not be true but they are not to be found in anything i have written and some of them diametrically contravene that which i have written i proceed to prove my assertions  prop 1 throughout the paper he confounds together what i had distinguished namely the city of gadara and the vicinage attached to it not as a mere pomoerium but as a rural district  in my judgment this statement is devoid of foundation in my paper on the keepers of the herd of swine i point out at some length that in accordance with the ancient hellenic practice each city of the decapolis must have been surrounded by a certain amount of territory amenable to its jurisdiction and to enforce this conclusion i quote what josephus says about the villages that belonged to gadara and hippos as i understand the term pomerium or pomoerium113 it means the space which according to roman custom was kept free from buildings immediately within and without the walls of a city and which defined the range of the auspicia urbana the conception of a pomoerium as a vicinage attached to a city appears to be something quite novel and original but then to be sure i do not know how many senses mr gladstone may attach to the word vicinage  whether gadara had a pomoerium in the proper technical sense or not is a point on which i offer no opinion but that the city had a very considerable rural district attached to it and notwithstanding its distinctness amenable to the jurisdiction of the gentile municipal authorities is one of the main points of my case  prop 2 he more fatally confounds the local civil government and its following including perhaps the whole wealthy class and those attached to it with the ethnical character of a general population  having survived confusion no 1 which turns out not to be on my side i am now confronted in no 2 with a more fatal errorand so it is if there be degrees of fatality but again it is mr gladstones and not mine it would appear from this proposition about the grammatical interpretation of which however i admit there are difficulties that mr gladstone holds that the local civil government and its following among the wealthy were ethnically different from the general population on p 348 he further admits that the wealthy and the local governing power were friendly to the romans are we then to suppose that it was the persons of jewish ethnical character who favoured the romans while those of gentile ethnical character were opposed to them but if that supposition is absurd the only alternative is that the local civil government was ethnically gentile this is exactly my contention  at pp 379 to 391 of the essay on the keepers of the herd of swine i have fully discussed the question of the ethnical character of the general population i have shown that according to josephus who surely ought to have known gadara was as much a gentile city as ptolemais i have proved that he includes gadara amongst the cities that rose up against the jews that were amongst them which is a pretty definite expression of his belief that the ethnical character of the general population was gentile there is no question here of jews of the roman party fighting with jews of the zealot party as mr gladstone suggests it is the nonjewish and antijewish general population which rises up against the jews who had settled among them  prop 3 his one item of direct evidence as to the gentile character of the city refers only to the former and not to the latter  more fatal still but once more not to me i adduce not one but a variety of items in proof of the nonjudaic character of the population of gadara the evidence of history that of the coinage of the city the direct testimony of josephus just citedto mention no others i repeat if the wealthy people and those connected with themthe classes and the hangers on of mr gladstones wellknown taxonomywere as he appears to admit they were gentiles if the civil government of the city was in their hands as the coinage proves it was what becomes of mr gladstones original proposition in the impregnable rock of scripture that the population of gadara and still less if less may be the population of the neighbourhood were hebrews bound by the mosaic law and what is the importance of estimating the precise proportion of hebrews who may have resided either in the city of gadara or in its independent territory when as mr gladstone now seems to admit i am careful to say seems the government and consequently the law which ruled in that territory and defined civil right and wrong was gentile and not judaic but perhaps mr gladstone is prepared to maintain that the gentile local civil government of a city of the decapolis administered jewish law and showed their respect for it more particularly by stamping their coinage with effigies of the emperors  in point of fact in his haste to attribute to me errors which i have not committed mr gladstone has given away his case  prop 4 he fatally confounds the question of political party with those of nationality and of religion and assumes that those who took the side of rome in the factions that prevailed could not be subject to the mosaic law  it would seem that i have a feline tenacity of life once more a fatal error but mr gladstone has forgotten an excellent rule of controversy say what is true of course but mind that it is decently probable now it is not decently probable hardly indeed conceivable that any one who has read josephus or any other historian of the jewish war should be unaware that there were jews of whom josephus himself was one who romanised and more or less openly opposed the war party but however that may be i assert that mr gladstone neither has produced nor can produce a passage of my writing which affords the slightest foundation for this particular article of his indictment  prop 5 his examination of the text of josephus is alike onesided inadequate and erroneous  easy to say hard to prove so long as the authorities whom i have cited are on my side i do not know why this singularly temperate and convincing dictum should trouble me i have yet to become acquainted with mr gladstones claims to speak with an authority equal to that of scholars of the rank of schürer whose obviously just and necessary emendations he so unceremoniously poohpoohs  prop 6 finally he sets aside on grounds not critical or historical but partly subjective the primary historical testimony on the subject namely that of the three synoptic evangelists who write as contemporaries and deal directly with the subject neither of which is done by any other authority  really this is too much the fact is as anybody can see who will turn to my article of february 1889 vii supra out of which all this discussion has arisen that the arguments upon which i rest the strength of my case touching the swinemiracle are exactly historical and critical expressly and in words that cannot be misunderstood i refuse to rest on what mr gladstone calls subjective evidence i abstain from denying the possibility of the gadarene occurrence and i even go so far as to speak of some physical analogies to possession in fact my quondam opponent dr wace shrewdly but quite fairly made the most of these admissions and stated that i had removed the only consideration which would have been a serious obstacle in the way of his belief in the gadarene story114  so far from setting aside the authority of the synoptics on subjective grounds i have taken a great deal of trouble to show that my nonbelief in the story is based upon what appears to me to be evident firstly that the accounts of the three synoptic gospels are not independent but are founded upon a common source secondly that even if the story of the common tradition proceeded from a contemporary it would still be worthy of very little credit seeing the manner in which the legends about mediæval miracles have been propounded by contemporaries and in illustration of this position i wrote a special essay about the miracles reported by eginhard115  in truth one need go no further than mr gladstones sixth proposition to be convinced that contemporary testimony even of wellknown and distinguished persons may be but a very frail reed for the support of the historian when theological prepossession blinds the witness116  prop 7 and he treats the entire question in the narrowed form in which it arises upon secular testimony as if it were capable of a solution so clear and summary as to warrant the use of the extremest weapons of controversy against those who presume to differ from him  the six heretical propositions which have gone before are enunciated with sufficient clearness to enable me to prove without any difficulty that whosesoever they are they are not mine but number seven i confess is too hard for me i cannot undertake to contradict that which i do not understand  what is the entire question which arises in a narrowed form upon secular testimony after much guessing i am fain to give up the conundrum the question may be the ownership of the pigs or the ethnological character of the gadarenes or the propriety of meddling with other peoples property without legal warrant and each of these questions might be so narrowed when it arose on secular testimony that i should not know where i was so i am silent on this part of the proposition  but i do dimly discern in the latter moiety of this mysterious paragraph a reproof of that use of the extremest weapons of controversy which is attributed to me upon which i have to observe that i guide myself in such matters very much by the maxim of a great statesman do ut des if mr gladstone objects to the employment of such weapons of defence he would do well to abstain from them in attack he should not frame charges which he has afterwards to admit are erroneous in language of carefully calculated offensiveness impregnable rock pp 26970 he should not assume that persons with whom he disagrees are so recklessly unconscientious as to evade the trouble of inquiring what has been said or known about a grave question impregnable rock p 273 he should not qualify the results of careful thought as handoverhead reasoning impregnable rock p 274 he should not as in the extraordinary propositions which i have just analysed make assertions respecting his opponents position and arguments which are contradicted by the plainest facts  persons who like myself have spent their lives outside the political world yet take a mild and philosophical concern in what goes on in it often find it difficult to understand what our neighbours call the psychological moment of this or that party leader and are occasionally loth to believe in the seeming conditions of certain kinds of success and when some chieftain famous in political warfare adventures into the region of letters or of science in full confidence that the methods which have brought fame and honour in his own province will answer there he is apt to forget that he will be judged by these people on whom rhetorical artifices have long ceased to take effect and to whom mere dexterity in putting together cleverly ambiguous phrases and even the great art of offensive misrepresentation are unspeakably wearisome and if that weariness finds its expression in sarcasm the offender really has no right to cry out assuredly ridicule is no test of truth but it is the righteous meed of some kinds of error nor ought the attempt to confound the expression of a revolted sense of fair dealing with arrogant impatience of contradiction to restrain those to whom the extreme weapons of controversy come handy from using them the function of police in the intellectual if not in the civil economy may sometimes be legitimately discharged by volunteers                                       some time ago in one of the many criticisms with which i am favoured i met with the remark that at our time of life mr gladstone and i might be better occupied than in fighting over the gadarene pigs and if these too famous swine were the only parties to the suit i for my part should fully admit the justice of the rebuke but under the beneficent rule of the court of chancery in former times it was not uncommon that a quarrel about a few perches of worthless land ended in the ruin of ancient families and the engulfing of great estates and i think that our admonisher failed to observe the analogyto note the momentous consequences of the judgment which may be awarded in the present apparently insignificant action in re the swineherds of gadara  the immediate effect of such judgment will be the decision of the question whether the men of the nineteenth century are to adopt the demonology of the men of the first century as divinely revealed truth or to reject it as degrading falsity the reverend principal of kings college has delivered his judgment in perfectly clear and candid terms two years since dr wace said that he believed the story as it stands and consequently he holds as a part of divine revelation that the spiritual world comprises devils who under certain circumstances may enter men and be transferred from them to fourfooted beasts for the distinguished anglican divine and biblical scholar that is part and parcel of the teachings respecting the spiritual world which we owe to the founder of christianity it is an inseparable part of that christian orthodoxy which if a man rejects he is to be considered and called an infidel according to the ordinary rules of interpretation of language mr gladstone must hold the same view  if antiquity and universality are valid tests of the truth of any belief no doubt this is one of the beliefs so certified there are no known savages nor people sunk in the ignorance of partial civilisation who do not hold them the great majority of christians have held them and still hold them moreover the oldest records we possess of the early conceptions of mankind in egypt and in mesopotamia prove that exactly such demonology as is implied in the gadarene story formed the substratum and among the early accadians apparently the greater part of their supposed knowledge of the spiritual world m lenormants profoundly interesting work on babylonian magic and the magical texts given in the appendix to professor sayces hibbert lectures leave no doubt on this head they prove that the doctrine of possession and even the particular case of pig possession117 were firmly believed in by the egyptians and the mesopotamians before the tribes of israel invaded palestine and it is evident that these beliefs from some time after the exile and probably much earlier completely interpenetrated the jewish mind and thus became inseparably interwoven with the fabric of the synoptic gospels  therefore behind the question of the acceptance of the doctrines of the oldest heathen demonology as part of the fundamental beliefs of christianity there lies the question of the credibility of the gospels and of their claim to act as our instructors outside that ethical province in which they appeal to the consciousness of all thoughtful men and still behind this problem there lies anotherhow far do these ancient records give a sure foundation to the prodigious fabric of christian dogma which has been built upon them by the continuous labours of speculative theologians during eighteen centuries  i submit that there are few questions before the men of the rising generation on the answer to which the future hangs more fatally than this we are at the parting of the ways whether the twentieth century shall see a recrudescence of the superstitions of mediæval papistry or whether it shall witness the severance of the living body of the ethical ideal of prophetic israel from the carcase foul with savage superstitions and cankered with false philosophy to which the theologians have bound it turns upon their final judgment of the gadarene tale  the gravity of the problems ultimately involved in the discussion of the legend of gadara will i hope excuse a persistence in returning to the subject to which i should not have been moved by merely personal considerations  with respect to the diluvial invective which overflowed thirtythree pages of the nineteenth century last january i doubt not that it has a catastrophic importance in the estimation of its author i on the other hand may be permitted to regard it as a mere spate noisy and threatening while it lasted but forgotten almost as soon as it was over without my help it will be judged by every instructed and clearheaded reader and that is fortunate because were aid necessary i have cogent reasons for withholding it  in an article characterised by the same qualities of thought and diction entitled a great lesson which appeared in the nineteenth century for september 1887 the duke of argyll firstly charged the whole body of men of science interested in the question with having conspired to ignore certain criticisms of mr darwins theory of the origin of coral reefs and secondly he asserted that some person unnamed had actually induced mr john murray to delay the publication of his views on that subject for two years  it was easy for me and for others to prove that the first statement was not only to use the duke of argylls favourite expression contrary to fact but that it was without any foundation whatever the second statement rested on the duke of argylls personal authority all i could do was to demand the production of the evidence for it up to the present time so far as i know that evidence has not made its appearance nor has there been any withdrawal of or apology for the erroneous charge  under these circumstances most people will understand why the duke of argyll may feel quite secure of having the battle all to himself whenever it pleases him to attack me  see the note at the end of hasisadras adventure vol iv p 283 the discussion on coral reefs at the meeting of the british association this year proves that mr darwins views are defended now as strongly as in 1891 by highly competent authorities october 25 1893  footnotes      107 nineteenth century february 1891 pp 33940      108 neither is it of any consequence whether the locality           of the supposed miracle was gadara or gerasa or           gergesa but i may say that i was well acquainted with           origens opinion respecting gergesa it is fully           discussed and rejected in riehms handwörterbuch in           kittos biblical cyclopædia ii p 51 professor           porter remarks that origen merely conjectures that           gergesa was indicated and he adds now in a question           of this kind conjectures cannot be admitted we must           implicitly follow the most ancient and creditable           testimony which clearly pronounces in favour of           gadarênhôn this reading is adopted by tischendorf           alford and tregelles      109 i may call attention in passing to the fact that this           authority at any rate has no sort of doubt of the           fact that jewish law did not rule in gadara indeed           under the head of gadara in the same work it is           expressly stated that the population of the place           consisted predominantly of heathens and that he           scouts the notion that the gadarene swineherds were           jews      110 the evidence adduced so far as postexile times are           concerned appears to me insufficient to prove this           assertion      111 even leviticus xi 26 cited without reference to the           context will not serve the purpose because the swine           is clovenfooted lev xi 7      112 1st gospel and the devils besought him saying           if thou cast us out send us away into the

discrepancy between the facts of the case and mr           gladstones account of them            now in the gadarene affair i do not think i am           unreasonably sceptical if i say that the existence of           demons who can be transferred from a man to a pig does           thus contravene probability let me be perfectly           candid i admit i have no à priori objection to
