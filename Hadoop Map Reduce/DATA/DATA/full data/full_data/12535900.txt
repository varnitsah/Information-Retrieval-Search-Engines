rochester  cried                                                       73   she swayed for a moment and fell over on  her side                                                   222     the moving finger     prologue  the dreamer   the boy sat with his back to a rock his knees drawn up and clasped within fingers nervously interlocked his eyes were fixed upon the great stretch of landscape below shadowy now and indistinct like a rolling plain of patchwork woven by mysterious fingers gray mists were floating over the meadows and lowlying lands away in the distance they marked the circuitous course of the river which only an hour ago had shone like a belt of silver in the light of the setting sun twilight had fallen with unexpected swiftness here and there a light flashed from the isolated farmhouses on the darkening horizon a warm glow was reflected in the clouds from the distant town  the boy when he had settled down to his vigil had been alone from over the brow of the hill however had come a few minutes ago a man dressed in loose shooting clothes and with a gun under his arm he came to a standstill by the side of the boy and stood there watching him for several moments with a certain faintly amused curiosity shining out of his somewhat supercilious gray eyes the newcomer was obviously a person of breeding and culturethe sort of person who assumes without question the title of gentleman the boy wore readymade clothes and hobnailed boots they remained within a few feet of one another for several moments without speech  my young friend the newcomer said at last you will be late for your tea or whatever name is given to your evening meal did you not hear the bell it rang nearly halfanhour ago  the boy moved his head slightly but made no attempt to rise  it does not matter i am not hungry  the newcomer leaned his gun against the rock and drawing a pipe from the pocket of his shootingcoat commenced leisurely to fill it every now and then he glanced at the boy who seemed once more to have become unconscious of his presence he struck a match and lit the tobacco stooping down for a moment to escape the slight evening breeze then he threw the match away and lounged against the lichencovered fragment of stone  i wonder he remarked why when you have the whole day in which to come and look at this magnificent view you should choose to come just at the hour when it has practically been swallowed up  the boy lifted his head for the first time his face was a little long his features irregular but not displeasing his deepset eyes seemed unnaturally bright his cheeks were sunken his forehead unusually prominent the whole effect of his personality was a little curious if he had no claims to be considered goodlooking his face was at least a striking one  illustration he came to a standstill by the side of the boy  i come at this hour he said slowly because the view does not attract me so much at any other time it is only when the twilight falls that one can seeproperly  the newcomer took his pipe from his mouth  you must have marvelous eyesight my young friend he remarked to me everything seems blurred and uncertain  you dont understand said the boy impatiently i do not come here to see the things that anyone can see at any hour of the day there is nothing satisfying in that i come here to look down and see the things which do not really exist it is easy enough when one is alone he added a little pointedly  the newcomer laughed softlythere was more banter than humor in his mirth  so my company displeases you he remarked do you know that i have the right to tell you to get up and never to pass through that gate again  the boy shrugged his shoulders  one place is as good as another he said  the man smoked in silence for several moments then he withdrew the pipe from his teeth and sighed gently  these are indeed democratic days he said you do not know my young friend that i am henry prestgate rochester esquire if you please high sheriff of this county magistrate and member of parliament owner by the bye of that rock against which you are leaning and of most of that country below which you can or cannot see  really the boy answered slowly my name is bertrand saton and i am staying at the convalescent home down there a luxury which is costing me exactly eight shillings a week  so i concluded his companion remarked may i ask what your occupation is when in health  its of no consequence the boy answered a little impatiently perhaps i havent one at all whatever it is as you may imagine it has not brought me any great success if you wish me to go  not at all rochester interrupted with a little protesting gesture  i do not wish to remain here on sufferance the boy continued i understood that we were allowed to spend our time upon the hills here  that is quite true i believe rochester admitted my bailiff sees to those things and if it amuses you to sit here all night you are perfectly welcome  i shall probably do so  rochester watched him curiously for a few seconds  look here he said i will make a bargain with you you shall have the free run of all my lands for as long as you like and in return you shall just answer me one question  the boy turned his head slightly  the question he asked  you shall tell me the things which you see down there rochester declared holding his hand straight out in front of him pointing downward toward the halfhidden panorama  the boy shook his head  for other people they would not count he said they are for myself only what i see would be invisible to you  a matter of eyesight rochester asked with raised eyebrows  of imagination the boy answered there is no necessity for you to look outside your own immediate surroundings to see beautiful things unless you choose deliberately to make your life an ugly thing with us it is differentwith us who work for a living who dwell in the cities and who have no power to push back the wheels of life if we are presumptuous enough to wish to take into our lives anything of the beautiful anything to help us fight our daily battle against the commonplace we have to create it for ourselves that is why i am here just now and why i was regretting when i heard your footstep that one finds it so hard to be alone  so i am to be ordered off rochester remarked smiling  the boy did not answer the man did not move the minutes went by and the silence remained unbroken below the twilight seemed to be passing into night with unusual rapidity it was a shapeless world now a world of black and gray more lights flashed out every few seconds  it was the boy who broke the silence at last he seemed in some awkward way to be trying to atone for his former unsociability  this is my last night at the convalescent home he said a little abruptly i am cured tomorrow i am going back to my work in mechester for many days i shall see nothing except actual things i shall know nothing of life except its dreary and material side that is why i came here with the twilight that is why i am going to sit here till the night comesperhaps even i shall wait until the dawn i want one last long rest i want to carry away with me some absolute impression of life as i would have it down there he added moving his head slowly down there i can see the things i wantthe things which if i could i would take into my life i am going to look at them and think of them and long for them until they seem real i am going to create a concrete memory and take it away with me  rochester looked more than a little puzzled the boys speech seemed in no way in keeping with his attire and the fact of his presence in a charitable home  might one inquire once more he asked what your occupation in mechester is  it is of no consequence the boy answered shortly it is an occupation that does not count it does not make for anything in life one must do something to earn ones daily bread  you find my questioning rather a nuisance i am afraid rochester remarked politely  i will not deny it the boy answered i will admit that i wish to be alone i am hoping that very soon you will be going  on the contrary rochester replied smiling i am much too interested in your amiable conversation you see he added knocking the ashes from his pipe and leaning carelessly back against the rock i live in a world every member of which is more or less satisfied i will be frank with you and i will admit that i find satisfaction in either man or woman a most reprehensible state i find a certain relief therefore in talking to a person who wants something he hasnt got or who wants to be something that he isnt  then you can find all the satisfaction you want in talking to me the boy declared gloomily i am at the opposite pole of life you see to those friends of yours i want everything i havent got i am content with nothing that i have  for instance rochester asked suggestively  i want freedom from the life of a slave the boy said i want money the money that gives power i want the right to shape my own life in my own way and to my own ends instead of being forced to remain a miserable ineffective part of a useless scheme of existence  your desires are perfectly reasonable rochester remarked calmly imagine if you pleaseyou seem to have plenty of imaginative forcethat i am a fairy godfather i may not look the part but at least i can live up to it i will provide the key for your escape i will set you down in the world you are thirsting to enter you shall take your place with the others and run your race  the boy suddenly abandoned his huddledup position and rose to his feet against the background of empty air and in the gathering darkness he seemed thinner than ever and smaller  i am going he said shortly it may seem amusing to you to make fun of me i will not stay  dont be a fool rochester interrupted havent you heard that i am more than half a madman i am going to justify my character for eccentricity you see my house down therebeauleys they call it at twelve oclock tomorrow if you come to me i will give you a sum of money sufficient to keep you for several years i do not specify the amount at this moment i shall think it over before you come  the boy had no words he simply stared at his chance companion in blank astonishment  my offer seems to surprise you rochester remarked pleasantly it need not you can go and tell the whole world of it if you like although as a reputation for sanity is quite a valuable asset nowadays i should suggest that you keep your mouth closed still if you do speak of it no one will be in the least surprised my friendsi havent manycall me the most eccentric man in christendom my enemies wonder how it is that i keep out of the asylum personally i consider myself a perfectly reasonable mortal i have whims and i am not afraid to indulge them i give you this money on oneor perhaps we had better say two conditions the first is that you make a bonâ fide use of it when i say that i mean that you leave immediately your present employment whatever it may be and go out into the world with the steadfast purpose of finding for yourself the things which you saw a few minutes ago down in the valley there you may not find them but still i pledge you to the search the second condition is that some day or other you find your way back into this part of the country and tell me how my experiment has fared  the boy realized with a little gasp  am i to thank you he asked  it would be usual but foolish rochester answered i need no thanks i deserve none i yield to a whim nothing else i do this thing for my own pleasure the sum of money which i propose to put into your hands will probably represent to me what a fiveshilling piece might to you this may sound vulgar but it is true i think that i need not warn you never to come to me for more you need not look so horrified i am quite sure that you would not do that and there is one thing further  yes the boy asked another condition  rochester shook his head  no he said it is not a condition it is just a little advice the way through life hasnt been made clear for everyone you may find yourself brought up in the thorny paths take my advice dont be content with anything less than success if you fail strip off your clothes and swim out to sea on a sunny day swim out until your strength fails and you must sink it is the pleasantest form of oblivion i know of dont live on you are only a nuisance to yourself and a bad influence to the rest of the world succeed or make your little bow my young friend it is the best advice i can give you remember that the men who have failed and who live on are creatures of the gutter  you are right the boy muttered i have read that somewhere and it comes home to me failure is the one unforgivable sin if i have to commit every other crime in the decalogue i will at least avoid that one  rochester shouldered his gun and prepared to stroll off  at twelve oclock tomorrow then he said i wouldnt hurry away now if i were you sit down in your old place and see if there isnt a thread of gold down there in the valley  the boy obeyed almost mechanically his heart was beating fast his back was pressed against the cold rock the fingers of both hands were nervously buried in the soft turf once more his eyes were riveted upon this land of shifting shadows the whole panorama of life seemed suddenly unveiled before his eyes more real more brilliant now were the things upon which he looked the thread of gold was indeed there     chapter i  a letter proves useful   bertrand saton leaned against the stone coping of the bridge and looked downwards as though watching the seagulls circling round and round waiting for their usual feast of scraps the gulls however were only his excuse he stood there looking hard at the gray muddy water beneath trying to make up his mind to this final and inevitable act of despair he had walked the last hundred yards almost eagerly he had told himself that he was absolutely and entirely prepared for death yet the first sight of that gray coldlooking river had chilled him he felt a new and unaccountable reluctance to quit the world which certainly seemed to have made up its mind that it had no need of him his thoughts rushed backwards swim out to sea on a sunny day he repeated to himself slowly yes but this it was a different thing this the longer he looked below the more he shrank from such a death  he stood upright with a little shiver and beganit was not for the first time that daya searching investigation into the contents of his pocket the result was uninspiring there was not an article there which would have fetched the price of a dose of poison then his fingers strayed into a breastpocket which he seldom used and brought out a letter unopened all grimy and showing signs of having been there for some considerable time he held it between his fingers doubtful at first from where it had come then suddenly he remembered he remembered the runaway horses in the bois and the strangelooking old woman who had sat in the carriage with grim drawn lips and pallid face he remembered the dash into the roadway the brief maddening race by the side of the horses his clutch at the reins the sense of being dragged along the dusty road it was perhaps the one physically courageous action of his life the horses were stopped and the womans life was saved he looked at the letter in his hand  why not he asked himself softly  he hesitated and glanced downward once more toward the river the sight seemed to decide him he turned his weary footsteps again westward  walking with visible effort and resting whenever he had a chance he reached at last the oxford street end of bond street holding the letter in his hand he made his way slowly and more painfully than ever down the righthand side people stared at him a little curiously he was a strange figure passing through the crowds of welldressed sauntering men and women he was unnaturally thinthe pallor of his cheeks and the gleam in his eyes spoke of starvation his clothes had been wellcut but they were almost in rags his cap had cost him a few pence at a secondhand store  he made his way toward his destination looking neither to the right nor to the left the days had gone when he found it interesting to study the faces of the passersby looking out always for adventures amusing himself with shrewd speculations as to the character and occupation of those who seemed worthy of notice this was his last quest nowthe quest of life or death  he stopped in front of a certain number and comparing it with the tattered envelope which he held in his hand finally entered the liftboy who was lounging in the little hall looked at him in surprise  i want to find madame helga the young man said shortly this is number 38 isnt it  the boy looked at him doubtfully and led the way to the lift  third floor he said ill take you up  the lift stopped and bertrand saton found in front of him a door upon which was a small brass plate engraved simply with the name of helga he knocked twice and received no answer then turning the handle he entered and stood looking about him with some curiosity  it was a small room luxuriously but sombrely furnished heavy curtains were drawn more than halfway across the windows and the room was so dark that at first he was not sure whether it was indeed empty on a small black oak table in the middle of the rich green carpet stood a crystal ball there was nothing else unusual about the apartment except the absence of any pictures upon the walls and a faint aromatic odor as though somewhere dried weeds were being burned  some curtains opposite him were suddenly thrust aside a woman stood there looking at him she was of middle height fair with a complexion which even in that indistinct light he could see owed little of its smoothness to nature she wore a loose gown which seemed to hang from her shoulders of some soft green material drawn around her waist with a girdle her eyes were deepset and penetrating  you wish to see me she asked  he held out the note  if you are madame helga he answered  she came a little further into the room looking at him with a slight frown contracting her pencilled eyebrows he had no appearance of being a client  you have brought a letter then she asked  my name is bertrand saton he explained this letter was given to me in paris more than a year ago by an elderly lady i have carried it with me all that time at first it did not seem likely that i should ever need to use it unfortunately he added a little bitterly things have changed  she took the letter and tore open the envelope its contents consisted only of a few lines which she read with some appearance of surprise then she turned once more to the young man  you are the mr bertrand saton of whom the writer of this letter speaks she asked  he nodded  i am he answered  she looked him over from head to foot there was scarcely an inch of his person which did not speak of poverty and starvation  you have had trouble she remarked  i have he admitted  the lady who wrote that letter she said is at present in spain  he turned to go  i am not surprised he answered my star is not exactly in the ascendant just now  dont be too sure she said and whatever you do dont go away sit down if you are tired you dont seem strong  i am not he admitted would you like he added to know what is the matter with me  it is nothing serious i hope  i am starving he declared simply i have eaten nothing for twentyfour hours  she looked at him for a moment as though doubting his words then she moved rapidly to a desk which stood in a corner of the room  you are a very foolish person she said to allow yourself to get into such a state when all the time you had this letter in your pocket but i forgot she added unlocking the desk you had not read it you had better have some money to buy yourself food and clothes and come here again  food and clothes he repeated vaguely i do not understand  she touched the letter with her forefinger  you have a very powerful friend here she said i am told to give you whatever you may be in need of and to telegraph to her in whatever part of the world she may be if ever you should present this letter  saton began to laugh softly  it is the turn of the wheel he said i am too weak to hear any more give me some money and i will come back i must eat or i shall faint  she gave him some notes and watched him curiously as he staggered out of the room he forgot the lift and descended by the stairs unsteadily like a drunken person reeling from the banisters to the wall and back again out in the street people looked at him curiously as he turned northward toward oxford street his eyes searched the shopwindows he hurried along like a man feverishly anxious to make use of his last stint of strength he was in search of food     chapter ii  old acquaintances   rochester was walking slowly along the country lane which led from the main road to beauleys when the hoot of a motor overtaking him caused him to slacken his pace and draw in close to the hedgeside the great car swung by with a covered top upon which was luggage a chauffeur immaculate in dark green livery and inside two people rochester caught a glimpse of them as they passed bythe woman heavily muffled up notwithstanding the warm afternoon old and withered the man young with dark sallow complexion and thoughtful eyes they were gone like a flash yet rochester stood for a moment in the road looking after them before he turned into a field to escape the cloud of dust the mans face was peculiar and strangely enough it was familiar he racked his brains in vain for some clue to its identitysearched every corner of his memory without success finally with a little shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the subject  he was soon to be reminded of it though for when he reached home he was told at once that a gentleman was waiting to see him in the study then rochester with a little gasp of surprise recalled that likeness which had puzzled him so much he knew who his visitor was he walked toward the study filled with a curiousperhaps even an ominous sense of excitement  they were face to face in a few seconds the man was unchanged the boy alone was altered rochesters hair was a little grayer perhaps but his face was still smooth his outofdoor life and that wonderful mouth of his with its half humorous half cynical curve still kept his face young to the boy had come a change much more marked and evident he was a boy no longernot even a youth he carried himself with the assured bearing of a man of the world his thick black hair was carefully parted his clothes bore the stamp of saville row his face was puzzling his eyes were still the eyes of a dreamer the eyes of a man who is content to be rather than to do yet the rest of his face seemed somehow to have suffered his cheeks had filled out his mouth and expression were no longer easy to read there were things in his face which would have puzzled a physiognomist  rochester had entered the library and closed the door behind him he nodded toward the man who rose slowly to greet him but ignored his outstretched hand  i am sure that i cannot be mistaken he said it is my young friend of the hillside  it is he saton answered i scarcely expected to be remembered  one sees so few fresh faces rochester murmured you have kept the condition then i must confess that i am glad to see you i shall hope that you will have a great deal that is interesting to tell me at any rate it is a good sign that you have kept the condition  i have kept the condition saton answered i was never likely to break it i have wandered up and down the world a good deal during the past five years and i have met many strange sorts of people but i have never yet met with philanthropy on such a unique scale as yours  not philanthropy my young friend rochester murmured i had but one motive in making you that little giftcuriosity pure and simple  forgive me saton remarked we will call it a loan if you do not mind i am not going to offer you any interest the five hundred pounds are here  he handed a little packet across to rochester who slipped it carelessly into his pocket  this is romance indeed he declared with something of the old banter in his tone you are worse than the industrious apprentice have i by chance the pleasure of speaking to one of the worlds mastersa millionaire  the young man laughed his laugh at any rate was not unpleasant  no he said i dont suppose that i am even wealthy as the world reckons wealth i have succeeded to a certain extent although i came very very near to disaster i have made a little money and i can make more when it is necessary  your commercial instincts rochester remarked have not been thoroughly aroused then  the young man smiled  do i need to tell you he asked that great wealth was not among the things i saw that night  that was a marvelous motorcar in which you passed me remarked the other  it belongs to the lady saton said who brought me down from london  rochester nodded  it will be interesting to me he remarked later on to hear something of your adventures to judge by your appearance and your repayment of that small amount of money you have prospered  one hates the word saton murmured with a sudden frown upon his forehead i suppose i must admit that i have been fortunate to some extent i am able to repay my debt to you  that rochester interrupted is a trifle it was not worth considering in fact i am rather disappointed that you have paid me back  i was forced to do it saton answered one cannot accept alms  rochester eyed his visitor a little thoughtfully  a platitude merely he said one accepts alms every day every moment of the day one goes about the world giving and receiving it is a small point of view which reckons gold as the only means of exchange  the young man bowed  i am corrected he said yet you must admit that there is something different in the obligation which is created by money  mine i fear rochester answered is not an analytic mind a blunt regard to truth has always been one of my characteristics therefore at the risk of indelicacy i am going on to ask you a question i found you on the hillside a discontented miserable youth and i did for you something which very few sane people would have been inclined even to consider years afterwardsit must be nearly seven isnt ityou return me my money and we exchange a few polite platitudes i noticeor is it that i only seem to noticeon your part an entire lack of gratitude for that eccentric action of mine the discontented boy has become presumably a prosperous citizen of the world the two are so far apart perhaps  saton threw out his hands for the first time there flashed into his face something of the boy some trace of that more primitive more passionate hold upon life he abandoned his measured tones his calm almost studied bearing  gratitude he interrupted i am not sure that i feel any in those days i had at least dreams i am not sure that it was not a devilish experiment of yours to send me out to grope my way amongst the mirages you were a man of the world then you knew and understood you knew how bitter a thing life is how for one who climbs a thousand must fall i am not sure he repeated with a little catch in his throat that i feel any gratitude  rochester nodded thoughtfully he was not in the least annoyed  you interest me he murmured from what you say i gather that your material prosperity has been somewhat dearly bought  there isnt much to be wrung from life saton answered bitterly that one doesnt pay for  a little later on rochester said it will give me very much pleasure to hear something of your adventures at present i fear that i must deny myself that pleasure my wife has done me the honor to make me one of her somewhat rare visits and my house is consequently full of guests  i will not intrude the young man answered rising i shall stay in the village for a few days we may perhaps meet again  rochester hesitated for a moment then the corners of his mouth twitched there was humor in this situation after all and in the thing which he proposed to himself  you must not hurry way he said come and be introduced to some of my friends  if rochester expected any hesitation on the part of his visitor he was disappointed the young man seemed to accept the suggestion as the most natural in the world  i shall be very glad he said calmly i shall be interested too to meet your wife at the time when i had the pleasure of seeing you before you were i believe unmarried  rochester opened the door and led the way out into the hall without a word     chapter iii  who is mr saton   really henry lady mary rochester said to her husband a few minutes before the dinnergong sounded for once you have been positively useful a new young man is such a godsend and charlie peyton threw us over most abominably so mean of him too after the number of times i had him to dine in grosvenor square  hes gone to ostend i suppose  lady mary nodded  so foolish she declared he hasnt a shilling in the world and he never wins anything he might just as well have come down here and made himself agreeable to lois  matchmaking again rochester asked  she shook her head  what nonsense charlie is one of my favorite young men i am not at all sure that i could spare him even to lois but the poor boy must marry someone i dont see how else he is to live by the bye who is your protégé  rochester who was lounging in a low chair in his wifes dressingroom looked thoughtfully at the tip of his patent shoe  i havent the faintest idea he declared  his wife frowned a little impatiently  you are so extreme she protested of course you know something about him what am i to tell people they will be sure to ask  make them all happy rochester suggested tell lady blanche that he is a millionaire from new york and lois that he is the latest thing in spring poets they probably wont compare notes until tomorrow so it really doesnt matter  i wish you could be serious for five minutes lady mary said you really are a trial henry you seem to see everything from some quaint point of view of your own and to forget all the time that there are a few other people in the world whose eyesight is not so distorted sometimes i cant help realizing how fortunate it is that we see so little of one another  i can scarcely be expected to agree with you rochester answered with an ironical bow i must try and mend my ways however to return to the actual subject under discussion then i can really tell you very little about this young man  you can tell me where he comes from at any rate lady mary remarked  rochester shook his head  he comes from the land of mysteries he declared i really am ashamed to be so disappointing but i only met him once before in my life  lady mary sighed gently  it is almost a relief she said to hear you admit that you have seen him before at all please tell me where it was that you met she added studying the effect of a tiara upon her splendidly coiffured hair  i met him rochester answered sitting with his back to a rock on the top of one of my hills  what you mean here at beauleys lady mary asked  on beacon hill her husband assented it was seven years ago and as you can gather from his present appearance he was little more than a boy he sat there in the twilight seeing things down in the valley which did not and never had existedseeing things that never were born you knowthings for which you stretch out your arms only to find them float away he was quite young of course  lady mary turned around  henry she exclaimed  my dear  you are absolutely the most irritating person i ever attempted to live with  and i have tried so hard to make myself agreeable he sighed  you are one of those uncomfortable people she declared who loathe what they call the obvious and adore riddles you would commit any sort of mental gymnastic rather than answer a plain question in a straightforward manner  it is perfectly true he admitted you have such insight my dear mary  i am to take it then she continued that you know absolutely nothing about your protégé you know nothing for instance about his family or his means  absolutely nothing he admitted he has an uncommon name but i believe that i gathered from him once that his parentage was not particularly exalted  at least she said with a little sigh he is quite presentable i call him in fact remarkably goodlooking and his manners leave nothing to be desired he has lived abroad i should think  he may have lived anywhere rochester admitted  well ill have him next me at dinner she declared i daresay i shall find out all about him pretty soon come henry i am quite sure that everyone is down you and i play host and hostess so seldom that we have forgotten our manners  they descended to the drawingroom and lady mary murmured her apologies everyone however seemed too absorbed to hear them they were listening to saton who was standing the centre of a little group telling stories  it was in buenos ayres rochester heard him conclude amidst a ripple of laughter i can assure you that i saw the incident with my own eyes  lois champneyesan heiress pretty and rochesters wardcame floating across the room to them she wore a plain muslin gown of simpler cut than was usually seen at lady marys houseparties and her complexion showed no signs whatever of town life her hairit was bright chestnut color merging in places to goldenwas twisted simply in one large coil on the top of her head she wore no jewelry and she had very much the appearance of a child just escaped from the schoolroom  mary she exclaimed drawing her hostess on one side you must send me in with mr saton he is perfectly charming and isnt it a lovely name do tell me who he is and whether i may fall in love with him  lady mary nodded  my dear child she said i shall do nothing of the sort you are not nearly old enough to take care of yourself and we know nothing about this young man at all besides i want him for myself  you are the most selfish hostess i ever stayed with lois declared turning away with a little pout never mind ill make him talk to me after dinner  is your friend in the diplomatic service lord penarvon asked rochester he is a most amusing fellow  not at present at any rate rochester answered i really forget what he used to do when i met him first as a matter of fact i have seen very little of him lately  a servant announced dinner and they all trooped across the hall a little informally it was only a small party and lady mary was a hostess whose ideas were distinctly modern conversation at first was nearly altogether general saton without in any way asserting himself bore at least his part in it he spoke modestly enough and yet everything he said seemed to tell from the first the dinner was a success  rochester found himself listening with a curiosity for which he could not wholly account to this young man seated only a few feet away his presence was so decidedly piquant it appealed immensely to his sense of humor satons appearance was in every respect irreproachable his tie was perfectly tied his collar of the latest shape his general appearance was that of an exceedingly smart young man about town the only sign of eccentricity which he displayed was an unobtrusive eyeglass suspended from his neck by a narrow black ribbon and which he had only used to study the menu  rochester looked at him across the white tablecloth with its glittering load of silver and glass its perfumed banks of pink blossoms and told himself that one at least of his somewhat eccentric experiments had borne strange fruit he thought of that night upon the hillside the boys passionate words his almost wild desire to realize to turn into actual life the fantasies which were then only the creation of his fancy how far had he realized them he wondered what did this alteration in his exterior denote from a few casual and halfforgotten inquiries rochester knew that he was the son or rather the orphan of workingpeople in the neighboring town there was nothing in his blood to make him in any way the social equal of these men and women amongst whom he now sat with such perfect selfpossession rochester found himself watching for some traces of inferior breeding some lapse of speech some signs of an innate lack of refinement the absence of any of these things puzzled him saton was assured without being overconfident he spoke of himself only seldom it was marvelous how often he seemed to avoid the use of the first person he seemed too modestly unconscious of the fact that his conversation was in any way more interesting than the speech of those by whom he was surrounded  you seem to have lived his hostess said to him once in so many countries mr saton are you really only as old as you look  how can i answer that he asked smiling except by telling you that i am twentyfive  you must have commenced to live in your perambulator she declared  i have lived nowhere he answered i have visited many places and travelled through many lands but life with me has been a search  a search she murmured dropping her voice a little and intimating by the slight movement of her head towards him that their conversation was to become a têteátête well she continued i suppose that life is that with all of us only you see with us poor frivolous people a search means nearly always the same thinga search for amusement or distraction whichever you choose to call it  saton shrugged his shoulders slightly  different things amuse different people he remarked my search i will admit was of a different order  it is finished she asked  it will never be finished he answered the man who finds what he seeks he added raising his dark eyes to hers as a rule has fixed his ambitions too low  speaking of ambitions mr saton lord penarvon asked across the table are you interested in politics  not in the least saton answered frankly there seem to me to be so many other things in life better worth doing than making fugitive laws for a dissatisfied country  tell me his hostess asked what do you yourself consider the things better worth doing  saton hesitated for the first time he seemed scarcely at his ease he glanced across at rochester and down at his plate  the sciences he answered quietly there are many torches lit which need strong hands to carry them forward  lois leaned across the table as yet she had scarcely spoken but she had listened intently to his every word  which of the sciences mr saton she asked a little breathlessly  he smiled at her and hesitated a moment before answering  there are so many he said which are equally fascinating but i think that it is always the least known which is the most attractive when i spoke i was really thinking of one which many people would scarcely reckon amongst the orthodox list i mean occultism  there was a little murmur of interest saton himself however deliberately turned the conversation he reverted to a diplomatic incident which had come to his notice when in brazil and asked lord penarvons opinion concerning it  by the bye the latter asked as their conversation drew toward a close how long did you say that you had been in england mr saton  a very short time saton answered with a faint smile i have been something of a wanderer for years  and you came from rochester asked leaning a little forward  saton smiled as his eyes met his hosts he hesitated perceptibly  i came from the land where the impossible sometimes happens he answered lightly the land where one dreams in the evening and is never sure when one wakes in the morning that ones dreams have not become solid things  lady mary sighed  can one get a cooks ticket she asked  can one get there by motorcar or even flyingmachine lois demanded i would risk my bones to find my way there  saton laughed  unfortunately he said there is a different path for every one of us and there are no signposts  lady mary sighed as she rose to her feet she nodded a friendly little farewell to her interesting neighbor  then we may as well go and have some really good bridge she said until you men take it into your heads to come and disturb us     chapter iv  a question of obligation   afternoon tea was being served in the hall at beauleys on the day after satons arrival saton himself was sitting with lois champneyes in a retired corner  i was going to ask you he remarked as he handed her some cakes about mr rochesters marriage he was a bachelor when ifirst met him  were you very intimate in those days she asked  not in the least he answered with a faint reminiscent smile  then you never heard about the romance of his life she asked  saton shook his head  never he declared nor should i ever have associated the word with mr rochester  she sighed gently  i daresay he was very different in those days she said before the beauleys property came to him he was quite poor and he was very much in love with the dearest womanpauline hambledon it was impossible for them to marryher people wouldnt hear of itso he went abroad and she married sir walter marrabel such a pig everyone hated him then old mr stephen rochester died suddenly without a will and all this property came to henry  and then he married i suppose saton remarked  i was going to tell you about that lois continued mary was a niece of stephen rochester and a daughter of the marquis of haselton who was absolutely bankrupt when he died stephen rochester adopted her and then died without leaving her a farthing so there she was poor dear penniless and henry had everything of course he had to marry her  why not saton remarked she is quite charming  yes but this is the tantalizing part of it lois continued they hadnt been married a year when sir walter marrabel died pauline is a widow now she is coming here in a few days i do hope you will meet her  this is quite interesting saton murmured how do lady mary and her husband get on  lois made a little grimace  they go different ways most of the time she answered i suppose theyre only what people call modern isnt that a motor horn she cried out springing to her feet i wonder if its guerdie  for a man who has been a great lawyer lord penarvon declared guerdon is the most uncertain and unpunctual of men one never knows when to expect him  he was to have arrived yesterday lady mary remarked we sent to the station twice  i suppose rochester said that even to gratify the impatience of an expectant houseparty it is not possible to quicken the slow process of the law if you look at the morning papers you will see that he was at the central criminal court trying some case or other all day yesterday the man who pleads not guilty and who pays for his defence expects to be heard out to the bitter end it is really only natural  saton who had been left alone in his corner rose suddenly to his feet and came into the circle he handed his cup to his hostess and turned toward rochester  you were speaking of judges he remarked  rochester nodded  in a few moments he said you will probably meet the cleverest one we have upon the english bench without his robe and wig some people find him insignificant personally i must confess that i never feel his eyes upon me without a shiver they say that he never loses sight of a fact or forgets a face  and what is the name of this wonderful person saton asked  lord guerdon rochester answered even though you have spent so little time in england of late years you must have heard of him  the curtains were suddenly thrown aside and a footman entered announcing the newlyarrived guest from the hall beyond came the sound of a departing motor and the clatter of luggage being brought in the footman stood on one side  lord guerdon he announced  lady mary held out her hands across the teatray rochester came a few steps forward everyone ceased their conversation to look at the small spare figure of the man who clad in a suit of travelling clothes of gray tweed and cut after a somewhat ancient pattern insignificantlooking in figure and even in bearing yet carried something in his cleanshaven wrinkled face at once impressive and commanding everyone seemed to lean forward with a little air of interest prepared to exchange greetings with him as soon as he had spoken to his host and hostess only saton stood quite still still as a figure turned suddenly into stone no one appeared to notice him to notice the twitching of his fingers the almost ashen gray of his cheeksno one except the girl with whom he had been talking and whose eyes had scarcely left his he recovered himself quickly when rochester turned towards him a moment or so later he was almost at his ease  you find us all old friends guerdon he said except that i have to present to you my friend mr saton saton this is lord guerdon whose caricature you have doubtless admired in many papers comic and otherwise and who i am happy to assure you is not nearly so terrible a person as he might seem from behind that ominous iron bar  saton held out his hand but almost immediately withdrawing it contented himself with a murmured word and a somewhat low bow for a second the judges eyebrows were upraised his keen eyes seemed to narrow he made no movement to shake hands  i am very glad to meet mr saton he said slowly by the bye he continued after a seconds pause is this our first meeting i seem to have an ideayour face is somehow familiar to me  there were few men who could have faced the piercing gaze of those bright brown eyes set deep in the withered face without any sign of embarrassment yet saton smiled back pleasantly enough he was completely at his ease his face showed only a reasonable amount of pleasure at this encounter with the famous man  i am afraid lord guerdon he said that i cannot claim the privilege of any previous acquaintance although i am an englishman my own country has seen little of me during the last few years  come and have some tea at once lady mary insisted looking up at the judge i want to hear all about this wonderful clancorry case oh i know youre not supposed to talk about it but that really doesnt matter down here you shall have a comfortable chair by my side and some hot muffins  saton went back to his seat by the side of lois champneyes carrying his refilled teacup in his hand she looked at him a little curiously  tell me she said have you really never met lord guerdon before  never in my life he answered  did he remind you of anyone she asked  it is curious that you should ask that saton remarked in a way he did  i thought so she declared with a little breath of relief that was it of course do you know how you looked when you first heard his namewhen he came into the room  i have no idea he answered i only know that when i saw him enter it gave me almost a shock he reminded me most strangely of a man who has been dead for many years i could scarcely take my eyes off him at first  i will tell you she said what your look reminded me of many years before i was outin my mothers timethere was a man named mallory who was tried for murder the murder of a friend who everyone knew was his rival well he got off but only after a long trial and only by a little weakness in the chain of evidence which even his friends at the time thought providential he went abroad for a long time then he came into a title and returned to england he was obliged to take up his position and people were willing enough to forget the past he opened his london house and accepted every invitation which came at the very first party he went to he came face to face with the judge who had tried him my mother was there i remember she told me how he looked it was foolish of me but i thought of it when i saw you just then  saton smiled sympathetically  and the end of the story he asked  the man had such a shock she continued that he shut up his house gave up all his schemes for reentering life left england and never set foot in the country again  saton rose to his feet  i see that my host is beckoning me he said will you excuse me for a moment  rochester passed his arm through the younger mans  come into the gunroom for a few minutes he said i want to show you the salmon flies i was speaking of  saton smiled a little curiously and followed his host across the hall and down the long stone passage which led to the back quarters of the house the gunroom was deserted and empty rochester closed the door  my young friend he said if you do not object i should like to have a few minutes of plain speaking with you  i should be delighted saton answered seating himself deliberately in a battered old easychair  seven years ago rochester continued leaning his elbow against the mantelpiece we made a bargain i sent you out into the world an egotistical don quixote and i provided you with the means with which you were to turn the windmills into castles i made one conditiontwo in fact one that you came back well you have kept that the other was that you told me what it was like to build the castles of bricks and mortar which in the days when i knew you you built in fancy only  arent you a little allegorical saton asked calmly  i admit it rochester answered i was very nearly in fact out of my depth tell me in plain words what have you done with yourself these seven years  you want me saton remarked to give an account of my stewardship  put it any way you please rochester answered the fact remains that though you are a guest in my house you are a complete stranger to me  saton smiled  you might have thought of that he said before you asked me here  rochester shrugged his shoulders  perhaps he said i preferred to keep up my reputation as an eccentric person at any rate you must remember that it was open to me at any moment to ask you the question i have asked you now  saton sat perfectly still in his chair his eyes apparently fixed upon the ground all the time rochester was watching him was it seven years ago seven years only since he had stood by the side of that boy whose longing eyes had been fixed with almost passionate intensity upon that world of shadows and unseen things this was a different person with the swiftness of inspiration itself he recognised something of the change which had taken place saton had fought his battle twice over he might esteem himself a winner he might even say that he had proved it yet there was another side this young man with the lined face and the almost unnatural restraint of manner might well have taken up the thread of life which the boy had laid down but there was a difference the thread might be the same but it was no longer of gold  then saton raised his eyes and rochester who was watching him intensely realized with a sudden convincing thrill something which he had felt from the moment when he had stepped into the library and welcomed this unexpected visitor there was nothing left of gratitude or even kindly feeling in the heart of this young man there was something else which looked out from his eyes something else which he did not even trouble to conceal rochester knew from that moment that he had an enemy  there are just two things saton said quietly of which i should like to remind you the first is that from the day i left this house with five hundred pounds in banknotes buttoned up in my pocket i regarded that sum as a loan i have always regarded it as a loan and i have repaid it  i do not consider your obligation to me lessened rochester remarked coldly if it was a loan it was a loan such as no sane man would have made you had not a penny in the world and i did not even know your name the chances were fifty to one against my ever seeing a penny of my money again  i admit that saton answered yet i will remind you of your own wordsfive hundred pounds were no more to you than a crown piece to me you gave me the money you gave me little else you gave me no encouragement no word of kindly advice go back that seven years and remember what you said to me when you stood by my side toying with your gun and looking at me superciliously as though i were some sort of curiosity which it amused you to turn inside outthe one unforgivable thing in life you said was failure do you remember telling me that if i failed i was to swim out on a sunny dayto swim and swim until the end came do you remember telling me that death was sometimes a pleasant thing but that life after failure was hell itself  rochester nodded  i always had such a clear insight into life he murmured i was perfectly right  from your point of view you doubtless were saton answered you were a cynic and a pessimist and i find you now unchanged i went away with your words ringing in my brain it was the first poisonous thought which had ever entered there and i never lost it i said to myself that whatever price i paid for success success of some sort i would gain when things went against me i seemed to hear always those bitter supercilious words i could even see the curl of your lips as you looked down upon me and figured to yourself the only possible result of trusting me an unfledged imaginative boy with the means to carve his way a little further into the world failure i wrote the word out of the dictionary of my life sin crime illdoing of any sort if they became necessaryi kept them there but failureno and this was your doing now you come to ask me questions you want to know if i am a fit and proper person to receive in your house perhaps i have sinned perhaps i have robbed perhaps i have proved myself a master in every form of illdoing but i have not failed i have paid you back your five hundred pounds  the question of ethics rochester remarked interests me very little if at all the only point is that whereas on the hillside you were simply a stray unit of humanity and the things which we said to one another concerned ourselves only here matters are a little different in a thoughtless moment i asked you to become a guest under my roof it was i frankly admit a mistake i trust that i need not say more  if you will have my things removed to the inn saton said slowly  no such extreme measures are necessary rochester answered you will stay with us until tomorrow morning after luncheon you will probably find it convenient to terminate your visit as soon as possible  i shall be gone saton answered before any of your guests are up in case i do not see you again alone let me ask you a question or rather a favor  rochester bowed slightly  there is a house below the convalescent homeblackbirds nest they call it saton said it is empty nowtoo large for your keepers too small for a country seat will you let it to me  rochester looked at him with uplifted eyebrows  let it to you he repeated do you mean to say that after an adventurous career such as i imagine you have had you think of settling down at your age in a neighborhood like this  scarcely that saton answered i shall be here only for a few days at a time at different periods in the year the one taste which i share in common with the boy whom you knew is a love for the country especially this part of it  you wish to live there alone rochester asked  there is oneother person saton answered with some hesitation  rochester sighed gently  alas he said instinct tells me that that person will turn out to be of the other sex if only you knew my young friend what the morals of this neighborhood are you would understand how fatal your proposal is  something that was almost malign gleamed for a moment in satons eyes  it is true he said that the person i spoke of is a woman but as she is at least sixty years old and can only walk with the help of a stick i do not think that she would be apt to disturb the moral prejudices of your friends  what has she to do with you rochester asked a little shortly have you found relatives out in the world or are you married  saton smiled  i am not married he answered and as the lady in question is a foreigner there is no question of any relationship between us i am as a matter of fact her adopted son  you can go and see my agent rochester answered personally i shall not interfere i am to take it for granted then i presume that you have nothing more to tell me concerning yourself  at present nothing saton answered some day perhaps he added rising i may tell you everything you see he added i feel that my life such as it is is in some respects dedicated to you and that you therefore have a certain right to know something of it but that time has not come yet  once more there was a short and somewhat inexplicable pause and once more rochester knew that he was in the presence of an enemy he shrugged his shoulders and turned toward the door  well he said we had better be getting off guerdon is a decent fellow but he always needs looking after if he is bored for five minutes he gets sulky if he is bored for a quarter of an hour he goes home you never met lord guerdon before i suppose he asked as he threw open the door  they were men of nerve both of them neither flinched rochesters question had been asked in an absolutely matteroffact tone and satons reply was entirely casual yet he knew very well that it was only since the coming of the great judge that rochester had suddenly realized that amongst the guests staying in his house there was one who might have been any sort of criminal  i have seen him in court saton remarked with a slight smile and of course i have seen pictures of him everywhere do not let me keep you please i have some letters to write in my room  rochester went back to his guests his brows were knitted he was unusually thoughtful his wife who was watching him called him across to the bridge table where she was dummy  well she asked what is it  rochester looked down at her the corners of his mouth slowly unbent  have you ever heard he whispered in her ear of the legend of the frankenstein     chapter v  a morning walk   my dear henry lady mary said a few days later swinging round in her chair from the writingtable whatever in this world induced you to encourage that extraordinary person bertrand saton to settle down in this part of the world  rochester continued for a moment to gaze out of the window across the park with expressionless face  my dear mary he said i did not encourage him to do anything of the sort  you let him blackbirds nest she reminded him  i had scarcely a reasonable excuse for refusing to let it rochester answered i did not suggest that he should take it i merely referred him to my agents he went to see old bland the very next morning and the thing was arranged  i think lady mary said deliberately that it is one of those cases where you should have exercised a little more discrimination this is a small neighborhood and i find it irritating to be continually running up against people whom i dislike  you dislike saton rochester remarked nonchalantly  dislike is perhaps a strong word his wife answered i distrust him i disbelieve in him and i dislike exceedingly the friendship between him and lois  rochester shrugged his shoulders  does it amount to a friendship he asked  what else his wife answered it was obvious that she was interested in him when he was staying here and twice since i have met them walking together i hate mysterious people they tell me that he has made blackbirds nest look like a museum inside and there is the most awful old woman with white hair and black eyes who never leaves his side they say when he is at home  she is rochester remarked i presume of an age to disarm scandal  she looks as old as methuselah his wife answered but what does the man want with such a creature at all  she may be an elderly relative rochester suggested  relative why she calls herself the comtesse somebody lady mary declared i do wish you would tell me henry exactly what you know and what you do not know about this young man  what i do know is simple enough he answered what i do not know would i begin to believe fill a volume  then you had better go and see him and readjust matters she declared a little sharply i want lois to marry well and she mustnt have her head turned by this young man  rochester strolled through the open frenchwindow into the flowergarden he pulled a low basket chair out into the sun close to a bed of pink and white hyacinths a manservant seeing him brought out the morning papers which had just arrived but rochester waved them away  fancy reading the newspapers on a morning like this he murmured half to himself the person who would welcome the intrusion of a world of vulgar facts into an æsthetically perfect halfhour deserveswell deserves to be the sort of person he must be take the papers away groves he added as the man stood by a little embarrassed take them to lord penarvon or mr hinckley  the man bowed and withdrew rochester half closed his eyes but opened them again almost immediately a white clad figure was passing down the path on the other side of the lawn he roused himself to a sitting posture  lois he called out lois  she waved her hand but did not stop he rose to his feet and called again she paused with a reluctance which was indifferently concealed  i am going down to the village she said  he crossed the lawn towards her  i will be a model host he said and come with you it is always the function of the model host is it not to neglect the whole of the rest of the guests and attach himself to the one most charming  she shook her head at him  i dare not risk being so unpopular she declared really dont bother to come it is such a very short distance  that decides me he answered falling into step with her a short walk is exactly what i want for the last few days i have been oppressed with a horrible fear i am afraid of growing fat  she looked at his long slim figure and laughed derisively  you will have to find another reason for this sudden desire for exercise she remarked  do i need to find one he answered laughing down into her pretty face  she shook her head  this is all very well she said but i quite understand that it is my last morning i know what will happen this afternoon and i really do not think that i shall allow you to come past that gate  why not he asked earnestly  you know very well that pauline is coming she answered  the change in his face was too slight for her to notice it but there was a change his lips moved as though he were repeating the name to himself  and why should paulines coming affect the situation he asked  she shook her head  you say nice things to me she declared looking at him reproachfully but only when pauline isnt here we all know that directly she comes we are no longer any of us human beings i wish i were intelligent  dont he begged dont wish anything so foolish intelligence is the greatest curse of the day few people possess it it is true but those few spend most of their time wishing they were fools  am i a fool she asked  of course he answered all pretty and charming people are fools  and pauline she asked  pauline unfortunately is amongst the cursed he answered  that i suppose she remarked is what brings you so close together  it is a bond of common suffering he declared by the bye who is this ferociouslooking person  it was saton who had suddenly turned the corner and whose expression had certainly darkened for a moment as he came face to face with the two he was correctly enough dressed in gray tweeds and thick walking boots but somehow or other his sallow face and dark plentiful hair seemed to go oddly with his country clothes  rochester glanced at his companion and he distinctly saw a little grimace saton would have passed on for rochesters nod was of the slightest but lois insisted upon stopping  mr saton she said i have been hearing all sorts of wonderful things about your house when are you going to ask us all to tea to see your curiosities  saton looked into rochesters immovable face  whenever you choose to come he answered calmly i am nearly always at home in the afternoon or rather i shall be after next thursday he added as an afterthought i am going to town this evening  going away she asked a little blankly  i have to go up to london he answered but it is only for two days  there was a short uneasy silence rochester purposely avoided speech he understood the situation exactly they had something to say to one another and wished him away  you wont be able to send me that book then she asked  i will leave it at the house this afternoon if i may he answered half looking toward rochester  rochester made no sign saton raised his cap and passed on  wonderful syringa bush that rochester remarked pointing with his stick  wonderful lois answered  quite an ideal village mine he continued you see there are crocuses growing out even in the roadway  very pretty she answered  you are not by any chance annoyed with me  i did not think you were very civil to that poor young man  naturally he answered i didnt mean to be civil i am one of those simple folk who are always annoyed by the incomprehensible i do not understand mr bertrand saton i do not quite understand either why you should find him an interesting companion for your morning walks  you are a hateful person she declared as he held open the gate which led back to the park  i intend to remain so he answered drily  the sound of footsteps coming along the path which they had just quitted attracted his attention momentarily he turned round lois too hesitated  i beg your pardon sir the newcomer said but can you tell me whereabouts in this neighborhood i can find a house called blackbirds nest a mr bertrand saton lives there i believe  rochester hesitated for a few seconds he looked at the woman summing her up with swift comprehension lois by his side stared at her in surprise she was inclined to be stout and her face was flushed with walking notwithstanding an obviously recent use of the powderpuff a mass of coppercolored hair was untidily arranged underneath a large black hat her clothes were fashionable in cut but cheap in quality she wore openwork stockings and highheeled shoes which had already suffered from walking along the dusty roads while she waited for an answer to her question she drew a handkerchief from her pocket and the perfume of the violet scented hedge by the side of which they stood was no longer a thing apparent  rochester whose hatred of perfumes was one of his few weaknesses drew back a step involuntarily  if you pass through the village he said blackbirds nest is the second house upon the righthand side it lies a little way back from the road but you cannot miss it  i am sure i am very much obliged the lady answered if i had known it was as far as this id have waited till i could have found a carriage the porter at the station told me that it was just a step  rochester raised his cap and turned away lois walked soberly by his side for several moments  i wonder she said softly what a person like that could want with mr saton  rochester shrugged his shoulders  we know nothing of saton or his life he answered he has wandered up and down the world and i daresay he has made some queer acquaintances  but his taste lois persisted is so perfect i cannot understand his permitting a creature like that to even come near him  rochester smiled  one does strange things under compulsion he remarked i see that they have been rolling the putting greens shall we go and challenge penarvon and mrs hinckley to a round at golf  she glanced once more over her shoulder toward the villageperhaps beyond  if you like she answered resignedly     chapter vi  pauline marrabel   the words which passed between pauline marrabel and her host at the railway station were words which the whole world might have heard and remained unedified the first part of their drive homeward even passed in complete silence yet if their faces told the story rochester was with the woman he loved he had driven a small ponycart to the station there was no room even for a groom behind they sat side by side jogging on through the green country lanes until they came to the long hill which led to the higher country the luggage cart and the omnibus with her maid and the groom who had driven down with rochester passed them soon after they had left the station they were alone in the country lane alone behind a fat pony who had ideas of his own as to what was the proper pace to travel on a warm spring afternoon  more than once he looked at her her oval face was almost devoid of color there were rings underneath her large soft eyes her dark hair was brushed simply back from her forehead her travelling clothes were of the plainest yet she was always beautifulmore so than ever just now perhaps when the slight hardness had gone from her mouth and the strain had passed from her features  rochester too was curiously altered by the change in the curve of his lips there was a new smile there a new light in his eyes as they jogged on between the honeysucklewreathed hedges their silence was even curiously protracted but underneath the holland apron his left hand was clasping hers  how are things with you she asked softly  about the same he answered we make the best of it you know mary amuses herself easily enough she has what she wanteda home and i have someone to entertain my guests i believe that we are considered quite a model couple  pauline sighed  henry she said it is beautiful to be here to be here with you the days will not seem long enough  rochester so apt of speech seemed curiously tonguetied his fingers pressed hers he made no answer she leaned a little forward and looked into his face  wonderful person she declared never a line or a wrinkle  he smiled  i live quietly he said i am out of doors all day excitement of any sort has not touched my life for many years sometimes i feel that this perfect health is a torture sometimes i am afraid of never growing old  she laughed very softlya dear familiar sound it was to him he turned his head to watch the curve of the lips that he loved the faint contraction of her eyebrows as the smile spread  you dear man she murmured to look at you makes me feel quite passée  the daily telegraph should reassure you he answered i read this morning that the most beautiful woman at the opera last night was lady marrabel  the daily telegraph man is such a delightful creature she answered i do not like reporters but i fancy that i must once have been civil to this one by mistake henry you have had the road shortened i am perfectly certain of it we cannot be there  i am afraid it is the sad truth he answered you see they are all having tea upon the lawn  he touched the pony with his whip and turning off the main avenue drew up at the bottom of one of the lawns before a sunk fence a servant came hurrying down to the ponys head and together pauline and he made their way across the short green turf to where lady mary was dispensing tea rochesters face suddenly darkened seated next to his wife with lois on the other side of him was saton  lady mary rose to welcome her guest and rochester exchanged greetings with some callers who had just arrived to saton he merely nodded but when a little later lois rose and announced that she was going to show mr saton the orchid houses he intervened lazily  we will all go he said lady penarvon is interested in orchids and i am sure that pauline would like to see the houses  i am interested in everything belonging to this delightful place she declared rising  lois frowned slightly satons face remained inscrutable in the general exodus rochester found himself for a moment behind with his wife  did you encourage that young man to stay to tea he asked i thought you disliked him so much  lady mary sighed she was a gentle fluffy little creature who had a new whim every few minutes  i am so changeable she declared i detested him yesterday he wore such an ugly tie and he would monopolize lois this afternoon i found him most interesting i believe he knows all about the future if one could only get him to tell us things  really rochester remarked politely  he has been talking in a most interesting fashion continued lady mary  has he been telling you all your fortunes  you put it so crudely my dear henry his wife declared of course he doesnt tell fortunes only hes the sort of person that if one really wanted to know anything i believe his advice would be better than most peoples perhaps he will talk to us about it after dinner  what is he dining here rochester asked  i have asked him to lady mary answered complacently we are short of young men as you know and really this afternoon he quite fascinated us all the dear duchess is so difficult and heavy to entertain but she quite woke up when he began to talk lady penarvon just told me that she thought he was wonderful  he seems to have the knack of interesting women rochester remarked  and therefore i suppose lady mary said you men will all hate him never mind i have changed my opinion entirely i think that he is going to be an acquisition to the neighborhood and i am going to study occultism  rochester turned away with a barely concealed grimace he went up to lois calmly usurping satons place  my dear lois he said as they fell behind a few paces so your latest young man has been charming everybody  he is nice isnt he she answered turning to him a little impulsively  marvelously rochester answered hatefully so has he told you anything by the bye about himself  she shook her head  nothing that i can remember she answered he is so clever she added enthusiastically and he has explained all sorts of wonderful things to me if one had only brains she continued with a little sigh there is so much to learn  rochester picked a great red rose and handed it to her  my dear child he said there is nothing in knowledge so beautiful as that flower by the bye he added raising his voice to saton who was just ahead i thought you were going to london today  i have put off my visit until tomorrow saton answered your wife has been kind enough to ask me to dine  rochester nodded he carefully avoided endorsing the invitation  by the bye he remarked we had the pleasure of directing a lady in distress to your house this morning  saton paused for a moment before he answered  i am very much obliged to you he said  he offered no explanation rochester with a little shrug of the shoulders rejoined pauline lady mary was called away to receive some visitors and for the first time lois and saton were alone  mr rochester has taken a dislike to me he said quietly  lois was distressed  i wonder why she said as a rule he is so indifferent to people  saton shook his head a little sadly  i cannot tell he answered certainly i cannot think of anything i have done to offend him but i am nearly always unfortunate the people whom i would like to have care about me as a rule dont  there are exceptions she murmured  she met his eyes and looked away he smiled softly to himself women had looked away from him before like that  fortunately he continued lady mary seems to be a little more gracious it was very kind of her to ask me to dine tonight  she is always so interested lois said in things which she does not understand you talked so well this afternoon mr saton i am afraid i could not follow you but it sounded very brilliant and very wonderful  one speaks convincingly he said when one really feels some day remember he continued we are going to have a long long talk we are going to begin at the beginning and you are going to let me help you to understand how many wonderful things there are in life which scarcely any of us ever even think about i wonder  well she asked looking up at him  will they let me take you down to dinner  she shook her head doubtfully  i am afraid not she said i am almost certain to go in with captain vandermere  he sighed  after all he said perhaps i had better have taken that train to town     chapter vii  an unwelcome visitor   saton was only a few minutes being whirled down the avenue of beauleys and up along the narrow country lane wreathed with honeysuckle and wild roses to blackbirds nest he leaned back in the great car his unseeing eyes travelling over the quiet landscape there was something out of keeping a little uncanny even in the flight of the motorcar with its solitary passenger along the country lane past the hay carts and the villagers resting after their long days toil the man who leaned back amongst the cushions with his pale drawn face and dark melancholy eyes seemed to them like a creature from another world even as the vehicle in which he travelled so swift and luxurious filled them with wonder saton heard nothing of their respectful goodnights he saw nothing of their doffed hats and curious wondering glances he was thinking with a considerable amount of uneasiness of the interview which probably lay before him  the car turned in at the rude gates and climbed the rough road which led to satons temporary abode a servant met him at the door as he descended a grayhaired elderly man irreproachably attired whose manner denoted at once the welltrained servant  there is a lady here sir he saidshe arrived some hours agowho has been waiting to see you you will find her in the morningroom  saton took off his hat and moved slowly down the little hall  i trust that i did not make a mistake sir in allowing her to wait the man asked she assured me that she was intimately known to you  you were quite right parkins saton answered i think i know who she is but i was scarcely expecting her today  he opened the door of the morningroom and closed it quickly the woman rose up from the couch where she had apparently been asleep and looked at him  at last she exclaimed bertrand do you know that i have been here since the morning  how was i to know he answered you sent no word that you were coming i certainly did not expect you  are you glad she asked a little abruptly  i am always glad to see you violet he said putting his arm around her waist and kissing her all the same i am not sure that your coming here is altogether wise  i waited as long as i could she answered you didnt come to me you scarcely even answered my letters i couldnt bear it any longer i had to come and see you bertrand you havent forgotten tell me that you havent forgotten  he sat down by her side she was a young woman and though her face was a little hardened by the constant use of cosmetics she was still well enough looking  my dear violet he said of course i have not forgotten only dont you see how unwise it is of you to come down here if she were to know  she will not know the girl interrupted she is safe in london and will be there for a week  the servants here might tell her that you have been he suggested  you will have to see to it that they dont she said bertrand i am so unhappy when are you coming back  very soon he answered  we can spend the evening together cant we she asked looking at him anxiously my train doesnt go back until nine  that is just what we cannot do he answered you did not tell me that you were coming and i have to go out to dinner tonight  to dinner here she repeated you have soon made friends and her face darkened  i stayed here when i was a boy he answered there is someone living here who knew me then  cant you put it off bertrand she begged it is five weeks since i have seen you every day i have hoped that you would run up if it was only for an hour bertrand dear dont go to this dinner cant we have something here and go for a walk in the country before my train goes or sit in your study and talk there are so many things i want to ask you about our future  he took her hand and leaned towards her  my dear violet he said you must be reasonable i dare not offend these people with whom i have promised to dine and apart from that i think it is very unwise that i should spend any time at all here with you you know what sort of a person it is whom we both have to consider she would turn us both into the street and treat it all as a jest if it pleased her i tell you frankly violet i have been too near starvation once to care about facing it again i am going to send you back to the station in the car now you can catch a train to london almost at once  her face grew suddenly hard she looked older the light which had flashed into her face at his coming was gone one saw now the irregularities of her complexion the overred lips  you dismiss me she said in a low tone i have come all this way have waited all this time and you throw me a kiss out of pity and you tell me to go home as fast as i can bertrand you did not talk like this a few months ago you did not talk like this when you asked me to marry you  nor shall i talk like it he answered when we meet once more in london and have another of our cosy little dinners but frankly you are doing an absolutely unwise thing in staying here these people are not my servants they are hers they are beyond my bribing violet he added dropping his voice a little and drawing her into his arms dont be foolish dear dont run the risk of bringing disaster upon both of us you wouldnt care to have to do without her now nor should i it was a little thoughtless of you to come dear do follow my advice now and i will try and make it up to you very soon i shall certainly be in london next week  she rested in his arms for a moment with half closed eyes as though content with his words and his embrace yet as she disengaged herself she sighed a little she was willing to deceive herselfshe was anxious to do sobut always the doubt remained  very well bertrand she said i will go  you will just catch a fast train to london he said more cheerfully you will change at mechester and you will find a diningcar there have you plenty of money  plenty thank you she answered  he walked with her out into the hall  madame will be so sorry he said to have missed you the telegram must have been a complete misunderstanding till next week then  he handed her into the car and raising her fingers to his lips kissed them gallantly  to the station william he ordered the chauffeur and then get back for me as quickly as you can  the car swung off saton stood watching it with darkening face there was some pity in his heart for this somewhat passée young person who had been kind to him during those first few weeks of his reentering into life he recognised the fact that his swift progress was unfortunate for her he even sat for a moment or two smoking a cigarette in his very luxurious dressingroom fingering the goldtopped bottles of his dressingcase and wondering what would be the most effectual and least painful means of coming to an understanding with her     chapter viii  an instance of occultism   the guests at beauleys were all grouped together in the hall after dinner the men and some of the women smoking cigarettes coffee and liqueurs were being served from the great oak sideboard lord guerdon and his host had drawn a little apart from the others at the formers instigation  your friend satonextraordinary name by the byeseems to have struck upon an interesting theme of conversation the judge remarked a little drily glancing across to where saton stood surrounded by most of the other guests  he has travelled a great deal rochester said and he seems to be one of that extravagant sort of persons who imbibe more or less the ideas of every country chiefly froth i should imagine but it gives him plenty to talk about  the judge nodded thoughtfully  his face he declared still puzzles me a little sometimes i am sure that i have seen it before at others i find it quite unfamiliar  rochester who was watching pauline shrugged his shoulders  we may as well hear what the fellow is talking about he remarked let us join the adoring throng   i will tell you one thing which i have realized in the course of my travels saton was saying as they drew near amongst all the nations of the world we english are at once the most ignorant and the slowest to receive a new thing in the exact sciences we are perhaps just able to hold our own but when it comes to the great unexplored fields the average english person turns away with a shrug of the shoulders i do not believe he says stolidly and that is sufficient he does not believe since the birth of time there has been no more pitiful cry than that  one might easily be convinced that the fellow is in earnest rochester whispered  the judge laid his hand upon his hosts shoulder there was a curious gleam in those deepset eyes  let him go on he said this is interesting i begin to remember  we all have a hobby i suppose saton continued mine has always been the study of the least understood of the sciencesi mean occultism i too was prejudiced at first i saw wonderful things in india and my british instincts rose up like a wall i did not believe i refused to believe my eyes in egypt and on the west coast of africa i had the chance of learning new things and again i refused but there came a time when even i was impressed then i began to study i began to see that some of those things which we accept as being wonderful and from which we turn away with a shrug of the shoulders are capable of explanationare submissive in fact to natural laws there is not a doubt that in the generations to come people will smile upon us and pity us for our colossal stupidity  no wise person my dear mr saton mrs hinckley remarked would deny that there is yet a great deal to learn in life but tell us exactly to what you refer  saton raised his dark eyes and looked steadfastly at her  i mean madam he said the apprehension of things happening in the present in other parts the apprehension of things about to happen in the future our brain we realize and our muscles but there is a subtler part of ourselves of which we are as ignorant today as our forefathers were of electricity  lady mary drew a little sigh  this is so fascinating she said do you really believe then that it is possible to foretell the future  why not saton answered quietly the world is governed by laws just as inevitable as the physical laws which govern the seasons it is only a matter of apprehension a deliberate schooling of ourselves into the necessary temperament  then all these people in bond streetthese crystal gazers and fortunetellers lois began eagerly  they are charlatans and stand in the way of progress saton declared fiercely they have not the faintest glimmering of the truth and they turn what should be the greatest of the sciences into buffoonery to the real student it is never possible to answer questions to foretell specific things on the other hand it is as sure as the coming of night itself that there are times when a person who has studied these matters even so slightly as i myself can feel the coming of events  give us an instance lady mary begged tell us of something that is going to happen  saton moved a little back his face was unnaturally pale  no he answered dont ask me that remember this is not a game it might even happen that i should tell you something terrifying i am sorry that ive talked like this he went on a little wildly i am sorry that i came here tonight before i came i felt it coming if you will excuse me lady mary  she held out her hands and refused to accept his adieux  you shall not go she declared there is something in your mind you could tell us something if you would  saton looked around as one genuinely anxious to escape on the outskirts of the circle he saw rochester smiling faintly half amused half contemptuous and by his side the parchmentlike face of lord guerdon whose eyes seemed riveted upon his  my dear saton rochester said pray dont disappoint us of our thrill after all this most effective preliminary you believe that you possess a gift which we none of us share give us a proof of it no one here is afraid to hear the truth is it one specific thing you could tell  one specific thing saton answered quickly about to happen to one person and one person only  is it a man or a woman rochester asked  a man was the quick reply  rochester glanced carelessly around the little circle  come he said the women can have their thrill there is nothing to fear penarvon here has all the pluck in the world hinckley is a vc captain vandermere is a soldier and i will answer for it that he has no nerves guerdon and i i am sure are safe let us hear your gruesome prophecy my dear saton and if it comes true we will form a little society and you shall be our apostle we will study occultism in place of bridge we will be the founders of a new cult  saton pushed them away from him his face was almost ghastly  it is not fair this he cried you do not know what you are asking cant you feel it any of you others as i do he exclaimed looking a little wildly around there is something else in the room something else besides you warm and living people be still all of you  there was a moments breathless silence some papers on the table rustled a picture on the wall shook lady mary sat down in a chair lois gave a little scream  there is a slight draught rochester remarked calmly  it is no draught saton answered you want the truth and you shall have it see there are five men presenthe counted rapidly with his forefinger one of them will be dead before we leave this room  rochester strolled over to the sideboard and helped himself to a cigarette  come he said this is going a little too far look at the cheeks of these ladies saton a little melodrama is all very well but you are too good an actor hinckley and all of you he said looking around i propose that we end the strain let us go into the billiardroom and have a pool i presume that the spell will then be broken  lady mary shrieked  dont move any of you she cried i am afraid  rochester laughed softly and crossed the floor with firm footsteps he stood on the threshold of the door leading to the billiardroom  come he said i am indeed between life and death for i have one foot in one room and one in the other come you others and seek safety too  the women also rose there was a rush for the door a swish of draperies a little sob from lois who was terrified saton remained standing alone he had not moved his eyes were fixed upon the figure of the judge who also lingered they two were left in the centre of the hall  come guerdon rochester cried you and i will take the lot on  guerdon did not move he motioned to saton slightly  young man he said we have met before i said so when you first came in my memory is improving  saton leaned forward  illustration some water quick and brandy rochester cried  be careful judge he said  be careful be dd the judge answered rochester come here god in heaven  his left hand went suddenly to his throat he almost tore away the collar and primly arranged tie rochester was by his side in a second and saved him from falling his face was white to the lips a shriek from the women rang through the hall and came echoing back again from the black rafters  some water quick and brandy rochester cried tearing open the shirt from the man he was supporting send for a doctor someone penarvon you see to that let them take the motor keep those dd women quiet  the judge opened his eyes  i remember him he faltered  drink some of this old fellow rochester said youll be better in a moment  the judges eyes were closed again he had suddenly become a dead weight on rochesters arm vandermere who had done amateur doctoring at the war brought a pillow for his head they cut off more of his clothes they tried by every means to keep a flicker of life in him until the doctor came only rochester knew it was useless he had seen the shadow of death pass across the gray stricken face     chapter ix  a sentimental talk   lois opened the gate and stole into the lane with the air of a guilty child she gave a little gasp as she came face to face with saton and picking up her skirts seemed for a moment about to fly he stood quite stillhis face was sadalmost reproachful she dropped her skirt and came slowly doubtfully towards him  i have come she said i was forced to come oh mr saton how could you  his features were wan there were lines under his dark eyes he was looking thin and nervous his voice too had lost some of its pleasant qualities  my dear young lady he said my dear lois what do you mean you dont supposeyou cantthat it was through me in any way thatthat thing happened  oh i dont know she faltered with white lips it was all so horrible you pointed to him and your eyes when you looked at him seemed to shine as though they were on fire i saw him shrink away and the color leave his cheeks it was horrible  but lois he protested you cannot imagine that by looking at a man i could help to kill him i cant explain what happened as yet there are things in the world which no one can explain this is one of them i know a little more than most people it is partly temperament perhapspartly study but it is surely true that i can sometimes feel things coming from the first moment i looked into guerdons face at dinnertime i knew what was going to happen out there in the hall i felt it once before in south america i saw a man shoot himself i tell you that i was certain of what he was going to do before i knew that he had even a revolver in his pocket it comes to me the knowledge of these things i cannot be blamed for it some day i shall write the first textbook that has ever been written of a new science i shall evolve the first few rudimentary laws and after that the thing will go easily every generation will add to them but lois because i am the first because i have seen a little further into the world than others you are not going to look at me as though i were a murderer  she drew a little breath a breath of relief her hand fell upon his arm  no she said i have been foolish it is absurd to imagine that you could have brought that about by just wishing for it  why even should i have wished for it he asked lord guerdon was a stranger to me as an acquaintance i found him pleasant enough i had no grudge against him  she drew him a little way on down the lane  i must only stay for a few minutes she said if we walk down here we shall meet nobody do you know what mr rochester has suggested  no saton answered what  he says that lord guerdon had always been uneasily conscious of having seen you somewhere before he says that at the very moment when he was stricken down he seemed to remember  that does not seem to me to be important saton remarked  cant you understand she continued mr rochester seems to think that lord guerdon had seen you somewhere under disgraceful circumstances there ive got it out now she added with a wan little smile that is why he feels sure that somehow or other you did your best to help him toward death  and the others saton asked  oh it hasnt been talked about she answered everyone has left the house you know i only knew this through mary  saton smiled scornfully  my dear girl he said i know for a fact that lord guerdon was suffering from acute heart disease he went about always with a letter in his pocket giving directions as to what should become of him if he were to die suddenly  is that really true she asked oh i am glad lord penarvon said so but no one else seemed sure  there is no need even for an inquest saton continued i went to see the doctor this morning and he told me so i am very very sorry he went on taking her hand in his that such a thing should happen to spoil the memory of these few days they have been wonderful days lois  she drew her hand quietly away  yes she admitted they have been wonderful in many ways  for you he continued walking a little more slowly and with his hands clasped behind him they have been perhaps just a tiny little leaf out of the book of your life to me i fancy they have been something different you see i have been a wanderer all my days i have had no home and i have had few friends all the time i have had to fight and there seems to have been no time for the gentler things for the things that really make for happiness perhaps he continued reflectively that is why i find it sometimes a little difficult to talk to you you are so young and fresh and wonderful your feet are scarcely yet upon the threshold of the life whose scars i am bearing  i am not so very young lois said nor are you so very old  and yet he answered looking into her face there is a great gulf between us a gulf perhaps of more than years miss lois i am not going to ask you too much but i would like to ask you one thing have these days meant just a little to you also  she raised her eyes and looked him frankly in the face they were honest brown eyes a little clouded just now with some reflection of the vague trouble which was stirring in her heart  i will answer you frankly she said yes they have meant something to me and yet listen i am going to say something unkind there is somethingi dont know what it isbetween us which troubles me oh i know that you are much cleverer than other men and i would not have you different yet there is something else would you be very angry i wonder if i told the truth  no he assured her go on please  i feel sometimes she continued as though i could not trust you there dont be angry she went on laying her fingers on his arm i know how horrid it sounds but it is there in my heart and it is because i would like to believe it is because i want there to be nothing between us of distrust that i have told you  they walked slowly on side by side his face was turned a little from hers she was bending forward as though anxious to catch a glimpse of his expression through the case hardening of years her voice for a moment seemed to have found its way back into the heart of the boy to have brought him at least a momentary twinge as he realized with a passing regret the abstract beauty of the more simple ways in life those few minutes were effective enough they helped his pose the regret passed a shadow of pain took its place he came to a standstill and took her hands in his  dear little girl he said perhaps you are right i am not altogether honest i am not in the least like the sort of man who ought to look at you and feel towards you as i have looked and felt during these wonderful days but all of us have our weak spots you know i think that you found mine goodbye little girl  she would have called him back but he had no idea of lending himself to anything so inartistic with head thrown back he left the footpath and climbed the hill round which they had been walking not once did he look behind not once did he turn his head till he stood on the top of the rockstrewn eminence his figure clearly outlined against the blue sky then he straightened himself and turned round thinking all the time how wonderfully effective his profile must seem in that deep soft light if she should have the sense to look  she did look she was standing very nearly where he had left her she was waving her handkerchief beckoning him to come down he raised his hand above his head as though in farewell and turned slowly away as soon as he was quite sure that he was out of sight he took his cigarette case from his pocket and began to smoke     chapter x  the scene changes   saton left the country on the following afternoon arrived at st pancras soon after five and drove at once to a large roomy house on the north side of regents park he was admitted by a trim parlormaidparkins had been left behind to superintend the removal from blackbirds nestand he found himself asking his first question with a certain amount of temerity  madame is in he inquired  madame is in the drawingroom the maid answered  alone saton asked  quite alone sir  saton ascended the stairs and entered the drawingroom which was on the first floor unannounced at the further end of the apartment a woman was sitting her hands folded in front of her her eyes fixed upon the wall saton advanced with outstretched hands  at last he exclaimed  the woman made no reply her silence while he crossed a considerable space of carpet would have been embarrassing to a less accomplished poseur she was tall dressed in a gown of plain black silk and her brown withered face seemed one of those which defy alike time and its reckoning her white hair was drawn back from her forehead and tied in a loose knot at the back of her head her mouth was cruel her eyes were hard and brilliant there was not an atom of softness or of human weakness of any sort to be traced in any one of her features around her neck she wore a scarf of brilliant red the ends of which were fastened with a great topaz  saton bent over her affectionately he kissed her upon the forehead and remained with his arm resting upon her shoulder she did not return his embrace in any way  so youve come back she said speaking with a sharpness which would have been unpleasant but for the slight foreign accent  as you see he answered i left this afternoon and came straight here  that woman helga has been down there what did she want she demanded  saton shrugged his shoulders slightly and turning away fetched a chair which he brought close to her side  i am afraid he said bluntly that she came to see me  the womans eyes flashed  ah she exclaimed go on  saton took her hand and held it between his it was dry and withered but the nails were exquisitely manicured and the fingers were aflame with jewels  dear rachael he said you must remember that when i was alone in london waiting to hear from you i naturally saw a good deal of helga she was kind to me and she was the means by which your letters and messages reached me i am afraid he continued thoughtfully that i was so happy in those days to have found anyone who was kind and talked decently to me that i may have misled her there has been a little trouble once or twice since i have tried to be pleasant and friendly with her she seemsforgive me if it sounds conceitedshe seems to want more  hussy the old lady declared she shall go  dont send her away he begged replacing her hand gently on her lap i daresay it was entirely my fault  the woman looked at him and a cruel smile parted her lips  i have no doubt it was she said you are like that you know bertrand still one must have discipline she asked for a days holiday to go into the country to see her relatives and i find her going to see you behind my back it cannot be permitted  it will not happen again he assured her i feel myself so much to blame  i have no doubt she said that you are entirely to blame but that is not the question unfortunately there are other things to be considered or she would have been sent packing before now tell me bertrand what kept you down in the country these last few days  i wanted a rest he answered i have to read my paper tonight you know and i was tired  you have been spending your time alone  no he answered with scarcely a seconds hesitation i have been once or twice to beauleys  to see your friend henry rochester i suppose she asked  satons face darkened  no he answered i would not move a step to see him i hate him and i think he knows it  who were the ladies of the party the woman asked their names one by one mind begin with the eldest  lady penarvon  i know go on she said  mrs hinckley  go on  miss lois champneyes  young the woman asked  yes  pretty  yes  a victim  saton frowned  there was also he continued my hostess lady mary rochester  a silly fluffy little woman madame declared did she flirt  not with me at any rate saton answered  too experienced madame remarked perhaps too good a judge of your sex who else  lady marrabel  a very beautiful woman i have heard madame remarked also young i believe also i presume a victim  it is not kind of you saton protested these women were staying in the house one has to make oneself agreeable to them  someone else was staying in the house madame continued fixing her brilliant eyes upon his face someone else i see died there  you mean lord guerdon saton muttered softly  he died there she said nodding bertrand did hedid he recognise you  he would have done saton said slowly if he had not died he was just beginning to remember  she looked at him curiously for several minutes  well she said i ask no questions perhaps it is wiser not but remember this bertrand i know something of the world and the men and women who live in it you are a born deceiver of women it is the rôle which nature meant you to play you can turn them if you will inside out perhaps you think you do the same with me let that go and remember this have as little to do with men as possible your very strength with women would be your very weakness with men remember i have warned you  you dont flatter me he said a little unpleasantly  bah she answered why should you and i play with words we know one another for what we are give me your hands  he held them out she took them suddenly in hers and drew him towards her  kiss me she commanded  he obeyed at once then she thrust him away  i go with you to this conversazione tonight she said it is well that we should sometimes be seen together i shall let it be known that you are my adopted son  that is as you will he said with secret satisfaction  why not she declared i never had a son but im foolish enough to care for you quite as much as i could for any child of my own go and get ready we dine at sevenno come back  she placed her long clawlike fingers upon his shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks she held him tightly by the arms as though there was something else she would have saidher lips a little parted her eyes brilliant  go and get ready she said abruptly look your prettiest you have a chance to make friends tonight     chapter xi  a busy evening   the conversazione was in its way a brilliant gathering there were present scientists men of letters artists with a very fair sprinkling of society people always anxious to absorb any new sensation one saw there amongst the whitehaired men passing backwards and forwards or talking together in little knots professors whose names were famous throughout europe  a very great man indeed brought saton up to pauline with a little word of explanation  i am sure he said to hershe was one of his oldest friendsthat you will be glad to meet the gentleman whose brilliant paper has interested us all so much this is lady marrabel saton whose father was professor at oxford before your day  the great man passed on paulines first impulse had been to hold out her hand but she had immediately withdrawn it saton contented himself with a grave bow  i am afraid lady marrabel he said that you are prejudiced against me  i think not she answered naturally seeing you so suddenly brought into my mind the terrible occurrence of only a few days ago  an occurrence he declared which no one could regret so greatly as myself but apart from that lady marrabel i am afraid that you are not prepared to do me justice you look at me through rochesters eyes and i am quite sure that all his days rochester will believe that i am more or less of a charlatan  your paper was very wonderful mr saton she said slowly i am convinced that mr rochester would have admitted that himself if he had been here  he might saton said he might have admitted that much with a supercilious smile and a little shrug of the shoulders rochester is a clever man i believe but he is absolutely insular there is a belt of prejudice around him to the hardening of which centuries have come and gone you are not you cannot be like that he continued with conviction there is truth in these things i am not an ignorant mountebank posing as a messiah of science look at the men and women who are here tonight they know a little they understand a little they are only eager to see a little further through the shadows i do not ask you to become a convert i ask you only to believe that i speak of the things in which i have faith  i am quite sure that you do she answered with a marked access of cordiality in her tone believe me it was not from any distrust of that sort that i perhaps looked strangely at you when you came up you must remember that it is a very short time since our last meeting one does not often come face to face with a tragedy like that  you are right he answered it was awful yet you saw how they drove me on i spoke what i felt and knew it is not often that those things come to one but that there was death in the room that night i knew as surely as i am sitting with you here now they goaded me on to speak of it i could not help it  it was very terrible and very wonderful she said looking at him with troubled eyes they say that lady mary is still suffering from the shock  it might have happened at any moment he reminded her the man had heart disease he had had his warning he knew very well that the end might come at any moment  that is true i suppose she admitted the medical examination seemed to account easily enough for his death yet there was something uncanny about it  the party broke up the next day i suppose he continued i have been down in the country but i have heard nothing  we left before the funeral of course she answered  fortunately for me he remarked i had important things to think of i had to prepare this paper the invitation to read it came quite unexpectedly i have been in london for so short a time indeed that i scarcely expected the honor of being asked to take any share in a meeting so important as this  i do not see why you should be surprised she said  you certainly seem to have gone as far in the study of occultism as any of those others  he looked at her thoughtfully  you yourself should read a little about these things he saidread a little and think a little you would find very much to interest you  i am sure of it she answered almost humbly will you come and see me one day and talk about it i live at number 17 cadogan street  i will come with pleasure he answered rising will you forgive me if i leave you now there is a man just leaving with whom i must speak  he passed away and left the room with a little thrill of satisfaction he had contrived to impress the one woman whom he was anxious to impress children like little lois champneyes and those others were easy this woman he knew at once was something different besides she was a friend of rochesters and that meant something to him  he walked along regent street to the end and crossing the road entered a large café here he sat before one of the marbletopped tables and ordered some coffee in a few minutes he was joined by another man who handed his coat and hat to the waiter and sat down with the air of one who was expected saton nodded a little curtly  will you take anything he asked  a bottle of beer and a cigar the newcomer ordered a shilling cigar i think tonight it will run to it  anything special saton asked  things in general are about the same as usual his companion answered they did a little better in oxford street and regent street but violet had a dull day in bond street i have closed up the egyptian place in the arcadeayesha we called it the police are always suspicious of a womans name and i had a hint from a detective i know  saton nodded  you have something else to tell me havent you he asked  yes the other answered we had a very important client in bond street this afternoon one of those whose names you gave me  saton leaned across the table  who was it he asked  lady mary rochester of beauleys the other answeredgot a town house and a big country place down in mechestershire  something flashed for a moment in satons eyes but he said nothing his companion commenced to draw leisurely a sheet of paper from his breast coat pocket he was fair and middleaged respectably dressed and with the air of a prosperous city merchant his eyes were a little small and his cheeks inclined to be fat or he would have been reasonably goodlooking  lady mary called without giving her name he continued but we knew her of course by our picture gallery she called professedly to amuse herself she was told the usual sorts of things with a few additions thrown in from our knowledge of her she seemed very much impressed and in the end she came to a specific inquiry  go on said saton  the specific inquiry was briefly this the man continued she gave herself away the moment she opened her mouth she behaved in fact like a farmers daughter asking questions of a gipsy girl she showed us the photograph of a man whom we also recognised and wanted to know the usual sort of rubbishwhether he was really fond of her whether he would be true to her if she married him  married him saton repeated  she posed as a widow the other man reminded him  what was the reply  violet was clever the man remarked with a slow smile she saw at once that this was a case where something might be done she asked for three days and for a letter from the man she said that it was a case in which a sight of his handwriting and a close study of it would help them to give an absolutely truthful answer  she agreed saton asked  the other nodded and produced a letter from his pocket  she handed one over at once he said it isnt particularly compromising perhaps but its full of the usual sort of rot shes coming for it on tuesday  saton smiled as he thrust it into his pocketbook  i will put this into dorringtons hands at once he said this has been very well managed huntley i will have a liqueur and you shall have some more beer  dont mind if i do mr huntley assented cheerfully its thirsty weather  they summoned a waiter and saton lit a cigarette  youve been amongst the big pots tonight huntley remarked looking at him  saton nodded  i have been keeping our end up he said in the legitimate branch of our profession you neednt grin like that he added a little irritably there is a legitimate side and a very wonderful side only a brain like yours is not capable of assimilating it you should have heard my paper tonight upon selfdirected mesmeric waves  the man shook his head and laughed complacently  its not in my way he answered our business is good enough as it is  you are a fool saton said a little contemptuously you cant see that but for the legitimate side there would be no business at all unless there was a glimmer of truth at the bottom of the well unless there existed somewhere a prototype madame helga and omega and naomi might sit in their empty temples from morning till night people know or are beginning to know that there are forces abroad beyond the control of the ordinary commonplace mortal they are willing to take it for granted that those who declare themselves able to do so are able to govern them  he broke off a little abruptly huntleys unsympathetic face with the big cigar in the corner of his mouth choked the flow of his words  never mind he said this isnt interesting to you of course as you say the business side is the more important i will see you at the hotel tomorrow night considering where i have been this evening it is scarcely wise for us to be seen together  huntley took the hint finished his drink and departed saton sat for a few more minutes alone then he too went out into the street and walked slowly homewards he let himself into the house in regents park with his latchkey and went thoughtfully upstairs the room was still brilliantly illuminated and the woman who was sitting over the fire turned round to greet him  well she asked  saton divested himself of his hat and coat madames black eyes were still fixed upon him he came slowly across towards her  well she repeated  you were there he reminded her i saw you sitting almost in the front row what did you think of it  she shrugged her shoulders  what does it matter what i think of it tell me about the others  my paper was pronounced everywhere to be a great success he declared many of the cleverest men in london were there they listened to every syllable  madame nodded  why trouble to teach them she asked a little scornfully what of huntley have you seen him how have they done today  it goes well he answered it always goes well  she moved her head slowly  yet tonight you are not thinking of it she said for many nights you have not counted your earnings you are thinking of other things she declared harshly dont look away from me look into my eyes  it is true he answered tonight i have been with clever men i have measured my wits against theirs i have pushed into their consciousness things which they were unwilling to believe i have made them believe there were many people there who felt i believe for the first time that they were ignorant  the woman looked at him scornfully there was no softening in her face and yet she had taken his hand in hers and held it  what do we gain by that she asked harshly what we want is gold gold all the time you ought to know that you who have been so near to starvation are you a fool that you dont realize it  i am not a fool saton answered calmly but there is another side to the whole matter a meeting such as tonights gives an immense fillip on the part of society to what they are pleased to call the supernatural it is only the fear of ridicule which keeps half the people in the world from flooding our branches every one of them eager to have their fortunes told a night like tonight is a great help clever men men who are believed in have accepted the principle that there are laws which govern the future so surely as the past in its turn has been governed one needs only to apprehend those laws to reduce them to intelligible formulæ it is an exact study an exact science this is the doctrine which i have preached when people once believe it what is to keep them from coming in their thousands to those who know more than they do  the woman shook her head derisively  no need to wait for those days she answered the world is packed full of fools now no need to wrestle with nature to wear oneself inside out to give them truth give them any rubbish give them what they seem to want it is enough so long as they bring the gold how much was taken today altogether  saton passed on to her the papers which the man huntley had given him in the café  there is the account he said you see it grows larger every day  what becomes of the money she asked  it is paid into the bank and the bankers receipt comes to me each morning there is no chance for fraud i must make some more investments soon our balance grows and grows  the womans eyes glittered  bring me some money tomorrow she begged grasping his other hand i like to have it here in my hands money and you bertrand my sonthey are all i care for banks and investments are well enough i like money kiss me bertrand  he laughed tolerantly and kissed her cheek  my dear rachael he said you have already bagsful of gold about the place  they are safe she assured him absolutely safe they never leave my person i feel them as i sit i sleep with them at night i am going to bed now bertrand  well he asked  she pointed to him with long forefinger a forefinger aflame with jewels  look we play with no fortunetelling here what is there in your face what is there in your life you are not telling me of is it a woman  there are many women in my life he answered you know that  i do she answered poor fools play with them all you will but rememberthe one whom you choose must have gold  he nodded  i am not likely to forget he said  she left the room with a farewell caress there was something almost tigresslike about the way in which her arms wound themselves around himsome gleam of the terrified victim in his eyes as he felt her touch then she left the room saton sank back into an easychair and gazed steadfastly into the fire through halfclosed eyes     chapter xii  a call on lady marrabel   saton after the reading of his paper before the members of the london psychical society established a certain vogue of which he was not slow to avail himself his picture appeared in several illustrated papers his name was freely mentioned as being one of the most brilliant apostles of the younger school of occultism he subscribed to a newspaper cutting agency and he read every word that was written about himself whenever he got a chance he made friends with the press everything that he could possibly do to obtain a certain position in a certain place he sedulously attempted he was always carefully dressed and he was quite conscious of the fact that his clothes were of correct pattern and cut his ties were properly subdued in tone his gloves and hat were immaculate  yet all the time he lacked confidence in himself the word charlatan clung to him like a pestilential memory his hair was cropped close to his head he had shaved off his moustache he imitated almost slavishly the attire and bearing of those young men of fashion with whom he was brought into contact yet he was somehow conscious of a difference the women seemed never to notice itthe men always was it jealousy he wondered which made them even the most unintelligent treat him with a certain tolerance as though he were a person not quite of themselves whom they scarcely understood but were willing to make the best of  with women it was different always his encounter with pauline marrabel at the conversazione had given him the keenest pleasure he had at once fixed a day sometime ahead upon which he would take to her the books he had spoken of the day had arrived at last but he had first another engagement early in the afternoon he turned into kensington gardens and walked up and down the broad path glancing every now and then toward one of the entrances he saw at last the person for whom he was waiting  lois in a plain white muslin gown and a big hat gay with flowers came blithely towards him a little pomeranian under one arm and a parasol in the other hand  i do hope im not too dreadfully late she exclaimed setting the dog down and taking his hand a little shyly it seems such an age since i saw you last where can we go and talk  you are not frightened at me any more then  of course not she answered we spoke about that at beauleys i do not want to think any more of that evening it is over and done with what a clever person you are becoming she went on i saw your name one day last week in the morning post you read a paper before no end of clever men and do you know that your photograph is in two or three of the illustrated papers this week  his cheeks flushed with pleasure he was unreasonably glad that she appreciated these things his vanity which had been a trifle ruffled by some incident earlier in the day was effectually soothed  these things he said are absolutely valueless to me except so far as they testify to the importance of my work before long he went on i think that there will be many other people like you miss lois they will believe that there is a little more in life than their dull eyes can see you were one of those who understood from the first but there are not many  she sighed  i dont think i am a bit clever she admitted  cleverness he answered is not a matter of erudition it is a matter of instinct of capacity for grasping new truths you have that capacity dear lois and i am glad that you are here it is good to be with you again  you really are the most wonderful person she declared poking at her little dog with the end of her fluffy parasol you make me feel as though i were something quite important and you know i am really a very unformed very unintelligent young person that is what my last governess said  cat he answered laughing i can see her now she wore a pincenez and a bicycling skirt i am sure of it come and sit down here and i will prove to you how much cleverer i am than that ancient relic   they parted at the gates an hour or so later saton resented a little her evident desire to leave him there and her half frightened refusal of his invitation to lunch but he consoled himself by taking his midday meal alone at princes where several people pointed him out to others and he was aware that he was the object of a good deal of respectful interest  later in the day with several books under his arm he rang the bell at 17 cadogan street he was committed now to the enterprise which had never been out of his thoughts since the night of the conversazione  pauline kept him waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour when at last she entered he found himself lost in admiration of the marvelous simplicity of her muslin gown and her perfect figure there was about her some sort of exquisite perfection a delicacy of outline and detail almost cameolike and impossible of reproduction  she welcomed him kindly but without any enthusiasm he felt from the first that he still had prejudices to conquer he sat down by her side and commenced his task very wisely he eliminated altogether the personal note from his talk he showed her the books which he had brought and he talked of them fluently and well she became more and more interested it was scarcely possible that she could refrain from showing it for he spoke of the things which he knew and things which the citizens of the world in every age have found fascinating he seemed to her to have gone a little further into the great mysterious shadowland than anyone elseto have come a little nearer reading the great riddle she was a good listener and she interrupted him only once  but tell me this she asked towards the close of one of his arguments this apprehension which you say one must cultivate to be ablehow is it you put itto throw out feelers for the things which our ordinary senses cannot graspisnt it a matter largely of temperament  one finds it difficult or easy to acquire he answered according to ones temperament a nervous magnetic person who is not afraid of solitude of solitary thought of taking the truth to his heart and wrestling with itthat person is of course always nearer the truth than the person of phlegmatic temperament who has to struggle ever so hard to be conscious of anything not actually within the sphere of his physical apprehension these things in our generation will have a great effect in centuries to come they will become less and less apparent we move rapidly he went on and i am still a young man before i die it is my ambition to leave behind me the first textbook on this new science the first real and logical attempt to enunciate absolute laws  it is all very wonderful she said sighing gently do you think that i shall understand any more about it when i have read these books  i am sure that you will he answered you have intelligence you have sensibility you are not afraid to believethat is the trouble with most people  answer me one question she begged all these fortunetelling people who have sprung up round bond streeti mean the palmists and crystalgazers and people like thatdo they proceed upon any knowledge whatever or are they all absolute humbugs  to the best of my belief he answered fervently every one of them personally i havent very much information but it has not come under my notice that there is a single one of these people who even attempts to probe the future scientifically or even intelligently according to the demands made upon them they impose as much as they can upon the credulity of their clients i consider that their existence is absolutely the worst possible thing for us who are endeavouring to gain a foothold in the scientific world your friend mr rochester you know called me a charlatan  mr rochester is never unjust she answered quietly some day perhaps he will take that word back  he tried to give their conversation a more personal note but he found her elusive she accepted an invitation however to be present at a lecture which he was giving before another learned society during the following week with that he felt that he ought to be content nevertheless he left her a little dissatisfied he was perfectly well aware that the magnetism which he was usually able to exert over her sex had so far availed him nothing with her her eyes met his freely but without any response to the things which he was striving to express she had seemed interested all the time but she had dismissed him without regret he walked homewards a little thoughtfully if only she were a little like lois  as he passed the entrance to the park an electric brougham was suddenly pulled up and a lady leaned forward towards him he stepped up to her side hat in hand it was lady mary rochester she was exquisitely gowned and hatted with a great white veil which floated gracefully around her picturehat and she welcomed him with a brilliant smile  my dear mr saton she exclaimed what a fortunate meeting only a few minutes ago i was thinking of you  i am very much flattered he answered  i mean it she declared i wonder whether you could spare me a few minutes i dont mean here she added one can scarcely talk driving come in after dinner if you have nothing to do just for halfanhour my husband is down in the country and i am not going out until eleven  i shall be very pleased he answered a little mechanically for he found the situation not altogether an easy one to grasp  dont forget she said number 10 berkeley square with a look of relief  the electric brougham rolled on and saton crossed the road thoughtfully then a sudden smile lightened his features he realized all at once what it was that lady mary wanted from him                                       rachael was waiting for him when he returned she was seated before the table her head resting upon her hands her eyes fixed upon the little piles of gold and notes which she had arranged in front of her she watched him come in and take off his hat and coat in silence  well she asked how do things go today  i have not the reports yet he answered it is too early i shall have them later  what have you been doing she asked  i walked with a girl lois champneyes in kensington gardens most of the morning and i called upon a womanlady marrabelthis afternoon he answered  rachael nodded  safe companions for you she muttered remember what i always tell you you are of the breed that can make fools of women a man might find you out  he turned an angry face upon her  what is there to find out he demanded i am not an impostor i am a man of science i have proved it your fortunetelling temples are all very well and the money they bring is welcome enough but nevertheless i am not the vulgar adventurer that you sometimes suggest  the woman laughed laughed silently and yet heartily but she never spoke she looked away from him presently and drawing the pile of gold and notes nearer to her began to recount them with her left hand her right she held out to him slowly drawing him towards her     chapter xiii  lady marys dilemma   lady marys boudoir was certainly the most luxurious apartment of its sort into which saton had ever been admitted there were great bowls of red roses upon the small ormolu table and on the mantelpiece several exquisite etchings hung upon the lavender walls the furniture was all french every available space seemed occupied with costly knickknacks and curios photographs of beautiful women men in court dress and uniform nearly all of them signed were scattered about on every available inch of space and there was also that subtle air of femininity about the apartment to which he was unaccustomed and which went to his head like wine it was evident that only privileged visitors were received there for apart from the air of intimacy which seemed somehow to pervade the place there were several articles of apparel and a pair of slippers lying upon the hearthrug  lady mary herself came rustling in to him a few minutes after his arrival gorgeous in a wonderful shimmering gown which seemed to hang straight from her shouldersthe very latest creation in the way of teagowns  i know you will forgive my receiving you like this she said holding out her hand to tell you the truth i dined here absolutely alone and i thought that i would not dress till afterwards i am going on to the ball at huntingford house and it is always less trouble to go straight from ones maid you have had coffee yes then sit down at the end of this couch please and tell me whether you think you can help me  saton was not altogether at his ease the brilliancy of his surroundings the easy charm of the woman were a little disconcerting and she was rochesters wife the wife of the man whom he hated that in itself was a thing to be always kept in mind never before had she seemed so desirable  if you will tell me in what way i can be of service lady mary he began  she turned towards him pathetically  really she said i scarcely know why i asked for your help except that you seem to me so much cleverer than most of the men i know  i am afraid you overrate my abilities he said with a slight deprecating smile but at any rate please be sure of one thing you could not have asked the advice of anyone more anxious to serve you  how kind you are she murmured i am going to make a confession and you will see after all that the trouble i am in has something to do with you you remember that night at beauleys  yes he answered  we wont talk about it she continued we mustnt talk about it only it gave me foolish thoughts from being utterly incredulous or indifferent i went to the other extreme i became i suppose absolutely foolish i went to one of those stupid women in bond street  you went to have your fortune told he asked  she nodded  oh i suppose so she said i asked her a lot of things and she looked into a crystal globe and told me what she saw it was quite interesting but unfortunately i went a little further than i meant to i asked her some ridiculous questions abouta friend of mine  he smiled sympathetically  well he said this all seems rather like a waste of time but i scarcely see how it would be likely to land you in a difficulty  but it has she answered that is what i want to explain to you the woman insisted upon having a letter in the handwriting of the person i asked questions about and i foolishly gave her one that was in my pocket when i asked for it back again the day afterwards she said she had mislaid it  but was the letter of any importance he asked  there wasnt much in it of course she answered but it was a private letter  it is infamous he declared i should give information to the police at once  she held out her handstiny little white hands ringless and soft  my dear man she exclaimed how can i give information to the police indeed what go and admit before a magistrate that i had been to a fortuneteller especially she added looking down on such an errand  he drew a little nearer to her  i beg your pardon he answered i was thoughtless that of course is not possible tell me the name and the address of the person to whom you went  the womans name was helga she answered and it was in the upper end of bond street daisy knowles told me about the place heaps of people i know have been  and the letter he asked tell me if you can what is its precise significance  it was a letter from charlie peyton she answeredmajor peyton in the guards you know there wasnt anything in it that mattered really but i shall not have a moments peace until it is returned to me  have you told me everything he asked  no she admitted  perhaps it would be as well he murmured  she produced a letter from the bosom of her gown  i received this last night she said  he glanced it rapidly through the form of it was wellknown to him       dear madam       a letter addressed to you and in the handwriting of a      certain major charles peyton has come into our hands within      the last few hours it is dated from the army and navy club      and its postmark is june 1st the contents are probably      wellknown to you       it is our wish to return same into your hands at once but      we may say that it was handed to us in trust by a gentleman      who is indebted to us for a considerable sum of money and he      spoke of this document which we did not inspect at the      time as being a probable form of security       perhaps your ladyship can suggest some means by which we      might be able to hand over the letter to you without      breaking faith with our friend                       sincerely yours                          jacobson  coagents       17 charing cross road  a distinct attempt at blackmail saton exclaimed indignantly  isnt it wicked lady mary replied looking at him appealingly but how am i to deal with it what am i to do i dont wish to correspond with these people and i darent tell henry a thing about it  naturally he answered my dear lady mary there are two courses open to you first you can take this letter to the police when you will get your own letter back without paying a penny and these rascals will be prosecuted the only disadvantage attached to this course is that your name will appear in the papers and the letter will be made public  you must see she declared that that is an absolute impossibility my husband would be furious with me and so would major peyton please suggest something else  then on the other hand he continued the only alternative course is to make the best bargain you can with the scoundrels who are responsible for this  but how can i she asked plaintively i cannot go to see these people nor can i have them come here i dont know how much money they want you know i havent a penny of my own and although my husband is generous enough he likes to know what i want money for i have spent my allowance for the whole of the year already i believe i am even in debt  saton hesitated for several moments lady mary watched him all the time anxiously  if you will allow me he said i will take this letter away with me and see these people on your behalf i have no doubt that i can make much better terms with them than you could  she drew a little sigh of relief  that is just what i was hoping you would propose she declared handing it over to him it is so good of you mr saton i feel there are so few people i could trust in a matter like this you will be very careful wont you  i will be very careful he answered  and when you have the letter she continued you will bring it straight back to me  of course he promised only first i must find out what their terms are they will probably begin by suggesting an extravagant sum tell me how far you are prepared to go  you think i shall have to pay a great deal of money then she asked anxiously  that depends entirely he answered upon what you call a great deal of money  i might manage two hundred pounds she said doubtfully  he smiled  i am afraid he said that messrs jacobson  co or whatever their name is will expect more than that  it is so unlucky she murmured i have just paid a huge dressmakers bill and i have lost at bridge every night for a week do the best you can for me dear mr saton  he leaned towards her but he was too great an artist not to realize that her feeling for him was one of pure indifference he was to be made use of if possibleto be dazzled a little perhaps but nothing more  i will do the best i can he said rising as he saw her eyes travel towards the clock but i am afraidi dont want to frighten youbut i am afraid that you will have to find at least five hundred pounds  if i must i must she answered with a sigh i shall have to owe money everywhere or else tell henry that i have lost it at bridge this is so good of you mr saton  if i can serve you he concluded holding her hand for a moment in his it will be a pleasure even though the circumstances are so unfortunate  i shall esteem the service none the less she answered smiling at him come and see me directly you know anything i shall be so anxious  saton made his way to the café at the end of regent street this time he had to wait a little longer but in the end the man who had met him there before appeared he came in smoking a huge cigar and with his silk hat a little on one side  a splendid day he declared nearly double yesterdays receipts the papers are all here  saton nodded taking them up and glancing them rapidly through  do you know where i can find dorrington he said i want that letterthe peyton letter you know  huntley nodded  ive got it in my pocket he said i was keeping it until tomorrow  saton held out his hand  ill take it he said i can arrange terms for this matter myself  huntley looked at him in surprise  it isnt often he remarked that you care to interfere with this side of the game sure youre not running any risk we cant do without our professor you know  saton shivered a little  no i am running no risk he said it happens that i have a chance of settling this fairly well  he had a few more instructions to give afterwards he left the place the night outside was close and he was conscious of a certain breathlessness a certain impatient desire for air he turned down toward the embankment and sat on one of the seats looking out at the sky signs and colored advertisements on the other side of the river and down lower where the tall black buildings lost their outline in the growing dusk  his thoughts travelled backwards it seemed to him that once more he sat upon the hillside and built for himself dream houses saw himself fighting a splendid battle gathering into his life all the great joys the mysterious emotions which one may wrest from fate once more he thrilled with the subtle pleasure of imagined triumphs then the note of reality had come rochesters voice sounded in his ears his dreams were to become true the sword was to be put into his hand the strength was to be given him the treasurehouses of the world were to fly open at his touch and then once more he seemed to hear rochesters voice cold and penetrating anything but failure if you fail swim out on a sunny day and wait until the waves creep over your neck over your head and you sink the men who fail are the creatures of the gutter  saton gripped the sides of his seat he felt himself suddenly choking he rose and turned away  it would have been better it would have been better he muttered to himself     chapter xiv  petty worries   saton threw down the letter which he had been reading with a little exclamation of impatience it was from a man whom on the strength of an acquaintance which had certainly bordered upon friendship he had asked to propose him at a certain wellknown club       my dear mr saton it ran i was sent for today by the      committee here upon the question of your candidature for the      club they asked me a good many questions which i answered      to the best of my ability but you know they are a very      oldfashioned lot and i think it would perhaps be wisest if      i were to withdraw your name for the present this i propose      to do unless i hear from you to the contrary                      sincerely yours                          gordon chambers  saton felt his cheeks flush as he thrust the letter to the bottom of the little pile which stood in front of him it was one more of the little annoyances to which somehow or other he seemed at regular intervals to be subjected latterly things had begun to expand with him he had persuaded madame to give up the oldfashioned house in regents park and they had moved into a maisonette in mayfaira little whitefronted house with boxes full of scarlet geraniums a second manservant to open the door and an electric brougham in place of the somewhat antiquated carriage which the countess had brought with her from abroad his banking account was entirely satisfactory there were many men and women who were only too pleased to welcome him at their houses and yet he was at all times subject to such an occurrence as this  his lips were twisted in an unpleasant smile as he frowned down upon the tablecloth  it is always like it he muttered one climbs a little and then the stings come  madame entered the room and took her place at the other end of the breakfast table she leaned upon her stick as she walked and her face seemed more than ever lined in the early morning sunlight she wore a dress of some soft black material unrelieved by any patch of color against which her cheeks were almost ghastly in their pallor  the stings bertrand what are they she asked pouring herself out some coffee  saton shrugged his shoulders  nothing that you would understand he answered coldly i mean that you would not understand its significance nothing perhaps that i ought not to be prepared for  she looked across the table at him with cold expressionless eyes to see these two together in their moments of intimacy no one would ever imagine that her love for this boyhe was nothing more when chance had thrown him in her wayhad been the only real passion of her later days  you do not know she said what i understand or what i do not understand tell me what it is that worries you in that letter  he pushed it away from him impatiently  i asked a frienda man named chambersto put me up for a club i wanted to join he said he promised to do his best i have just received a letter advising me to withdraw the committee would not elect me  what club is it she asked  the wanderers he answered the social qualification is not very stringent i imagined that they would elect me  the woman looked at him as one seeking to understand some creature of an alien world  you attach importance she asked to such an incident as this you  not real importance perhaps he answered only you must remember that these are the small things that annoy they amount to nothing really i know that and yet they sting  do not dwell upon the small things then she said coldly it is well for all our sakes that you should occupy some position in the social world but it is also well that you should remember that your position there is not worth a snap of the fingers as against the great things which you and i know of what do these people matter with their strange ideas of birth and position their little social distinctions which remind one of nothing so much as swifts famous satire you are losing your sense of proportion my dear bertrand go into your study for an hour this morning and think listen to the voices of the greater life remember that all these small happenings are of less account than the flight of a bird on a summers day  you are right he answered with a little sigh and yet you must remember that you and i can scarcely look at things from the same standpoint they do not affect you in the slightest they cannot fail to remind me that i am after all an outcast rescued from shipwreck by one strange turn in the wheel of chance  she looked at him with penetrating eyes  something is happening to you bertrand she said it may be that it is your sense of proportion which is at fault it may be that your head is a little turned by the greatness of the task which it has fallen to your lot to carry out it is true that you are a young man and that i am an old woman and yet remember we are both of us little live atoms in the great world the only things which can appeal to us in a different manner are the everyday things which should not count which should not count for a single moment she added with a sudden tremor in her tone  you are right of course he answered and yet rachael you must remember this you have finished with the world i am compelled to live in it  if you are she rejoined is that any reason bertrand why you should pause to listen to the voices whose cry is meaningless think remember the blind folly of it all a decade a cycle of years and the men who pass you in pall mall and the women who smile at you from their carriages will be dead and gone youyou may become the emperor of time itself remember that  and in the meantime one has to live  keep your head in the clouds she said make use of these people but always remember that in the light of what may come they are only the dirt beneath your feet remember that you may be the first of all the ages to solve the great secretthe secret of carrying your consciousness beyond the grave  life is short he said and the task is great  too great for cowards she answered yet look at me do i despair i am seventyone years old i have no fear of death i have learnt enough at least to help me into the grave that will do bertrand go on with your breakfast and burn that letter  he tore it in half and went to the sideboard to help himself from one of the dishes when he returned madame was drumming thoughtfully upon the tablecloth with her long fingers  bertrand she said  he looked toward her curiously there was a new note a new expression in the way she had pronounced his name  the girl the little fair fool of a girl with moneylois champneyes you called herwhere is she  she is in london he answered  with the rochesters  yes  rachael frowned  you find it difficult to see her then she remarked thoughtfully  i can see her whenever i choose to he answered  you must marry her rachael said the girl will serve your purpose as well as another she is rich and she is a fool  she is not of age saton said drily and mr rochester is her guardian  she will be of age very soon rachael answered and the money is sure  do we need it he asked a little impatiently we are making now far more than we can spend  we need money all the time she answered at present things prosper yet a change might comea change in the laws a campaign in the pressanything even the truth might leak out  saton rose from his place and going once more to the sideboard took up and lit a long russian cigarette he returned with the box and laid it before rachael  if the truth should leak out he said that would be the end of us in this country we have had one escape i do not mean to find myself in the prisoners dock a second time  there is no fear of that she answered the whole business is so arranged that neither you nor i would be connected with it besides we have rearranged things we are within the pale of the law now to return to what i was saying about this girl  there is no hurry he said marriage does not interest me  marriage for its own sake perhaps no she answered and yet money you must have no man has ever succeeded in any great work without it if a pauper proclaims a theory he is laughed to scorn he is called a charlatan and an impostor if a rich man speaks of the same thing his words are listened to as one who stirs the world there is a change in you bertrand she continued you have avoided this girl lately you have avoided even your work what is it  who knows he answered lightly the weather perhapsthe moonones humor i will walk this morning in kensington gardens perhaps i shall see lois  he left the house halfanhour later after dictating some letters to a newly installed secretary he accepted a carefully brushed hat from a welltrained and perfectly respectful servant who placed also in his hands his stick and gloves he descended a few immaculate steps and turned westward frowning thoughtfully the matter with him he knew well enough he had taken his fate into his hands played his cards boldly enough but fate was beginning to get her own back  he turned not toward kensington gardens but towards cadogan street he rang the bell at one of the most pretentious houses and asked for lady marrabel the butler was doubtful whether she would be inclined to receive anyone at that hour he was shown into a morningroom and kept waiting for some time then she came in serene as usual with a faint note of inquiry in her upraised eyebrows and the tone of her voice as she welcomed him  i must apologize he began a little nervously i have no right to come at such an hour i heard this morning that max naudheim will be in london before the end of the week and i wondered whether you would care to meet him  of course i should she answered only i hope that he is more comprehensible than his book  i have never met him myself saton answered but i know that he has a letter to me he will come to my house i believe and if he follows out his usual custom he will scarcely leave it while he stays in england i shall ask a few people to talk one night i cannot attempt anything conventional it does not seem to me to be an occasion for anything of the sort if you will come i will let you know the night and the time  she hesitated for a moment  and if you should come he continued even though it be the evening please wear an old dress and hat naudheim himself seldom appears in a collar any social gathering of any sort is loathsome to him he will talk only amongst those whom he believes are his friends  i will come of course pauline answered it is good of you to think of me  he may speak to you saton continued he takes curious fancies sometimes to address a perfect stranger and talk to them intimately remember that though he lives in switzerland and has a german name he is really an englishman nothing annoys him more than to be spoken to in any other language  i will remember pauline said  there was a moments silence saton felt that he was expected to go yet there was something in her manner which he could not altogether understand some nervousness which seemed absolutely foreign to her usual demeanour he took up his hat reluctantly  you are busy today he asked  i am always busy she answered perhaps it is because i am so lazy i never do anything so there is always so much to do  he made the plunge speaking without any of his usual confidencehurriedly almost indistinctly  wont you come and have some luncheon with me at the berkeley or anywhere you please i feel like talking today i feel that i am a little nearer the first law i want to speak of it to someone  she hesitated and he saw her fingers twitch  thank you she said i am afraid i cant if you like you can come and have luncheon here i have one or two people coming in  thank you he said i shall be glad to come about halfpast one i suppose  from that to two she answered my friends drop in at any time  he passed out into the street not altogether satisfied with his visit and yet not dissatisfied he had an instinctive feeling that in some degree her demeanour towards him was changed what it meant he could not wholly tell she no longer met his eyes with that look of careless slightly contemptuous interest yet when he tried to find encouragement from the fact he felt that he lacked all his usual confidence he realized with a little impulse of annoyance that in the presence of this woman whom he was more anxious to impress than anyone else in the world he was subject to sudden lapses of selfconfidence to a certain selfdepreciation which irritated him was it he wondered because he was always fancying that she looked at him out of rochesters eyes  a cab drove past him and stopped before the house which he had just left he looked behind with a sudden feeling of almost passionate jealousy it was rochester who had driven by him unseen and who was now mounting the steps to her house     chapter xv  rochester is indignant   rochester accepted his wifes offer of a lift in her victoria after the luncheon party in cadogan street  mary he said as soon as the horses had started i cannot imagine why you were so civil to that insufferable bounder saton  she looked at him thoughtfully  is he an insufferable bounder she asked  i find him so rochester answered deliberately he dresses like other men he walks and moves like other men he speaks like other men and all the time i know that he is acting he plays the game well but it is a game the man is a bounder and you will all of you find it out some day  dont you think perhaps his wife remarked that you are prejudiced because you have some knowledge of his antecedents  not in the least rochester answered the fetish of birth has never appealed to me i find as many gentlefolk amongst my tenants and servants as at the parties to which i have the honor of escorting you it isnt that at all its a matter of insight some day you will all of you find it out  all of us i presume lady mary said includes pauline  rochester nodded  pauline has disappointed me he said never before have i known her instinct at fault she must knowin her heart she must know that there is something wrong about the fellow and yet she receives him at her house and treats him with a consideration which frankly shall we say annoys me  one might remind you lady mary remarked that it is you who are responsible for this young mans introduction amongst our friends  it is true rochester answered i regret it bitterly i regret it more than ever today  because of pauline lady mary asked  because of pauline and for one other reason rochester answered lowering his voice and turning a little in his seat towards his wife mary i was unfortunate enough to hear a sentence which passed between you and this person in the hall i would have shut my ears if i could but it was not possible am i to understand that you have made use of him in some way  lady mary gasped this was a thunderbolt to descend at her feet without a seconds warning  as a matter of fact she said slowly he has done me a service  rochesters face darkened  i should be interested he said to know the circumstances  lady mary was not a coward and she realized that there was nothing for it but the absolute truth her husbands eyes were fixed upon her filled with an expression which she very seldom saw in them after all she had little enough to fear their relations were scarcely such that he could assume the position of a jealous husband  i suppose that you will laugh at me henry she said perhaps you will be angry however one must amuse oneself frankly i think that all this talk that is going on about occultism and being able to read the future and to find new laws for the government of the will has perhaps turned my brain a little anyhow i went to one of those bond street people and asked them a few questions  you mean to one of these crystalgazers or fortunetellers he asked  precisely she answered no doubt you think that i am mad but if you had any idea of the women in our own set who have done the same thing i think you would be astonished well whilst i was there i chanced to drop or leave behindit scarcely concerns you to know whicha letter written to me by a very dear friend one of my perfectly harmless love affairs you know henry but men do make such idiots of themselves when they have pen and paper to do it with  rochester moved a little uneasily in his place  may i inquire he began  no i shouldnt she interrupted you know very well my dear henry the exact terms upon which we have both found married life endurable if i choose to receive foolish letters from foolish men it concerns you no more than your silent adoration of pauline marrabel does me you understand  i understand he answered quietly go on  well she continued a few days afterwards i had just about as terrifying a specimen of a blackmailing letter as you can possibly imagine  from these people rochester asked  no from a firm who called themselves agents and said that the letter had come into their possession had been deposited with them in fact by someone who owed them some money lady mary answered of course i was frightened to death i dont know what made me think of bertrand saton as the best person to consult but anyhow i did he took the matter up for me paid over some money on my account and recovered the letter  the sum of money being  five hundred pounds lady mary answered with a sigh it was a great deal but the letterwell the letter was certainly very foolish  rochester was silent for several moments  do you know he asked at length what the natural inference to me seemsthe inference i mean of what you have just told me  you are not going to say anything disagreeable she asked looking at him through the lace fringe of her parasol  not in the least he answered i was not thinking of the personal side of the affairso far as you and i are concerned i have accepted your declaration i claim no jurisdiction over your correspondence i mean as regards saton  no what she asked  it seems to me highly possible he declared that saton was in league with these blackmailers whoever they may have been any ordinary man whom you had consulted would have settled the matter in a very different way  i was quite satisfied lady mary answered i thought it was really very kind of him to take the trouble  indeed rochester remarked drily i must say mary that i gave you credit for greater perspicuity the man is an intriguer naturally he was only too anxious to be of service to so charming a lady  lady mary raised her eyebrows but did not answer  i might add rochester continued that however satisfactory our present relations may seem to you i still claim the privilege of being able to assist my wife in any difficulty in which she may find herself  you are very kind she murmured  further rochester said i resent the interference of any third party in such a matter you will remember this  i will remember it lady mary said still the circumstances being as they are you can scarcely blame me for having been civil to him today besides you must admit that he is clever  clever oh ive no doubt that he is clever enough rochester answered impatiently nowadays all you women seem as though you can only be attracted by something freakishbrains or peculiar gifts of some sort  lady mary laughed lightly  my dear henry she said you are not exactly a fool yourself are you and then you must remember this bertrand satons cleverness is the sort of cleverness which appeals to women we cant help our natures i suppose and we are always attracted by the mysterious we are always wanting to know something which other people dont know something of what lies behind the curtain  it is a very dangerous curiosity rochester said you are liable to become the prey of any adventurer with a plausible manner who has learned to talk glibly about the things which he doesnt understand ill get out here if i may he added and take a short cut across the park to my club mary if you want to oblige me for heavens sake dont run this fellow he gets on my nerves i hate the sight of him  lady mary turned towards her husband with a faint curious smile as the carriage drew up  you had better talk to pauline she said he is more in her line than mine  rochester walked across the park a little gloomily his wifes last words were ringing in his ears for the first time since he could remember a little cloud had loomed over his few short hours with pauline she had resented some contemptuous speech of his and as though to mark her sense of his lack of generosity she had encouraged saton to talk encouraged him to talk until the other conversation had died away and the whole room had listened to this exponent of what he declared to be a new science the fellow was a poseur and an impostor rochester told himself vigorously he knew he was absolutely convinced that he was not honest  he sat down on a seat for a few minutes and his thoughts somehow wandered back to that night when he had strolled over the hills and found a lonely boy gazing downward through the tree tops to the fading landscape he remembered his own whimsical generosity the feelings with which he had made his offer he remembered too the conditions which he had made with a sudden swift anger he realized that those conditions had not been kept saton had told him little or nothing of his doings out in the world of his struggles and his failures of the growth of this new enthusiasm if indeed it was an enthusiasm he had hinted at strange adventures but he had spoken of nothing definite he had not kept his word  rochester rose to his feet with a little exclamation  he shall tell me he muttered to himself or i will expose him if i have to turn detective and follow him round the world  he swung round again across the park toward mayfair and rang the bell at satons new house mr saton was not at home he was informed but was expected back at any moment rochester accepted an invitation to wait and was shown into a room which at first he thought empty then someone rose from an oldfashioned easychair set back amongst the shadows rachael peered forward leaning upon her stick and shading her eyes as though from the sun  who is that she asked who are you  rochester bowed and introduced himself as yet he could see very little of the person who had spoken the blinds and even the curtains of the room were close drawn it was one of rachaels strange fancies on certain days to sit in the darkness suddenly however she leaned forward and touched the knob of the electric light  my name is rochester he said i called to see mr saton for a few minutes they asked me to wait  i am the comtesse de vestignes rachael said slowly and bertrand saton is my adopted son he will be back in a few moments draw your chair up close to me i should like to talk if you do not mind this light i have been resting and my eyes are tired  rochester obeyed and seated himself by her side with a curious little thrill of interest it seemed to him that she was like the mummy of some ancient goddess the shadowy presentment of days long past she had the withered appearance of great age and yet the dignity which refuses to yield to time  come nearer she said i am no longer a young woman and i am a little deaf  you must tell me if you do not hear me rochester said my voice is generally thought to be a clear one i am very much interested in this young man suppose while we wait you tell me a few things about him you have no objection  rachael laughed softly  i wonder she said what it is that you expect to hear from me     chapter xvi  plain speaking   from the depths of her chair rachael for several moments sat and subjected her visitor to a close and merciless scrutiny  so you she said at last were the fairy godfather you were the man who trusted a nameless boy with five hundred pounds because his vaporings amused you you pushed him out into the world you bade him go and seek his fortune  i was that infernal fool rochester muttered  the woman nodded  yes a fool she said no one but a fool would do such a thing and yet great things have come of it  rochester shrugged his shoulders he was not prepared to admit that bertrand saton was in any sense great  my adopted son she continued is very wonderful egypt had its soothsayers thousands of years ago this century too may have its prophet bertrand gains power every day he is beginning to understand  you too rochester asked politely are perhaps a student of the occult  whatever i am she answered scornfully i am not one of those who because their two feet are planted upon the earth and their head reaches six feet towards the sky are prepared to declare that there is no universe save the earth upon which they stand no sky save the sky toward which they looknothing in life which their eyes will not show them or which their hands may not touch  rochester smiled faintly  materialism is an easy faith and a safe one he said imagination is very distorting  for you who feel like that she answered the way through life is simple enough we others can only pity  comtesse rochester said such an attitude is perfectly reasonable it is only when you attempt to convert that we are obliged to fall back upon our readiest weapons  you are one of those she said looking at him keenly who do not wish to understand more than you understand at present who have no desire to gain the knowledge of hidden things  you are right comtesse rochester answered with a smile i am one of those pigheaded individuals  it is the saxon race she muttered who have kept back the progress of the world for centuries  we have kept it backward perhaps he answered but wholesome  you think always of your bodies she said  they were entrusted to us madam to look after he answered  she smiled grimly  you are not such a fool she said as my adopted son would have me believe you have spared me at least that hideous latin quotation which has done so much harm to your race  out of respect to you he declared i avoided it it was really a little too obvious  come she said you are a type of man i have not met with for years you are strong and vigorous and healthy you have color upon your cheeks and strength in your tone and movements in any show of your kind you should certainly be entitled to a prize  rochester laughed at first softly and then heartily  my dear lady he said forgive me i can assure you that although my inclinations do not prompt me to sit at your sons feet and accept his mythical sayings as the words of a god i am really not a fool i will even go so far as this i will even admit the possibility that a serious and religious study of occultism might result in benefit to all of us the chief point where you and i differ is with regard to your adopted son you believe in him apparently i dont  then why are you here she asked what do you want with him do you come as an enemy  rochester was spared the necessity of making any answer he heard the door open and the womans eyes glittered as they turned toward it  bertrand is here himself she said you can settle your business with him  rochester rose to his feet saton had just entered closing the door behind him prepared for rochesters presence by the servants he greeted him calmly enough  this is an unexpected honor he said bowing i did not imagine that we should meet again so soon  nor i rochester answered where can we talk  here as well as anywhere saton answered going up to rachael and lifting her hand for a moment to his lips from this lady whose acquaintance i presume you have made i have no secrets  rochester glanced from one to the otherthe woman sitting erect and severe in her chair the young man bending affectionately over her yes he was right there was something about the two hard to explain yet apparent to him as he sat there which seemed in some way to remove them out of direct kinship with the ordinary people of the world was it he wondered with a sudden swift intuition a touch of insularity a sign of narrowness that he should find himself so utterly repelled by this foreign note in their temperaments was his disapproval after all but a mark of snobbishness the snobbishness which to use a mundane parallel takes objection to the shape of an unfashionable collar or the cut of a countrymade coat there were other races upon the world beside the race of aristocrats there was an aristocracy of brains of genius of character yet he reasoned against his inspiration nothing could make him believe that the boy who had held out his hands so eagerly toward the fire of life had not ended by gathering to himself experiences and a cult of living from which any ordinary mortal would have shrunk  i am quite content rochester said to say what i have to say before this lady especially if she knows your history i have come here to tell you this i have been your sponsor perhaps your unwilling sponsor into the society and to the friends amongst whom you spend your time i am not satisfied with my sponsorship that you came of humble parentage although you never allude to the fact goes for nothing that you may be forgiven but there are seven years of your past the knowledge of which is a pledge to me i have come to insist upon your fulfilment of it for seven years you disappeared where were you how did you blossom into prosperity how is it that you the professor of a new cult whose first work is as yet unpublished find yourself enabled to live in luxury like this you had no godmother then who is this lady why do you call her your godmother she is nothing of the sort you and i know thatyou and i and she there are things about you saton which i find it hard to understand i want to understand them for the sake of my friends  and if you do not saton asked calmly  well it must be open war rochester declared  i should say that it amounted to that now saton answered  scarcely rochester declared for if it had been open war i should have asked you before now to tell me where it was that you and lord guerdon had met remember i heard the words trembling upon his lips and i saw your face  saton did not move nor did he speak for a moment his cheeks were a little pale but he gave no sign of being moved the womans face was like the face of a sphinx withered and emotionless her eyes were fixed upon satons  you have spoken to me before somewhat in this strain sir saton said what i said to you then i repeat the account between us is ruled out you lent or gave me a sum of money and i returned it as to gratitude he went on that i may or may not feel i leave you to judge you can ask yourself if you will whether that action of yours came from an impulse of generosity or was merely the gratification of a cynical whim  my motives are beside the question rochester answered do i understand that you decline to give me any account of yourself  i see no reason saton said coldly why i should gratify your curiosity  there is no reason rochester admitted it is simply a matter of policy frankly i mistrust you there are points about your behaviour ever since in a foolish moment i asked you to stay at beauleys which i do not understand i do not understand lord guerdons sudden recognition of you and even suddener death i do not understand why it has amused you to fill the head of my young ward lois champneyes with foolish thoughts i do not understand why you should stand between my wife and the writers of a blackmailing letter i do not ask you for any explanation i simply tell you that these things present themselves as enigmas to me you have declared your position i declare mine what you will not tell me i shall make it my business to discover  the comtesse leaned a little forward her face was still unchanged her tone scornful  it is i who will answer you she said my adopted sonfor he is my adopted son if i choose to make him sowill explain nothing he has in fact nothing more to say to you you and he are quits so far as regards obligations your paths in life lie apart you are one of the selfcentred sedentary loiterers by the way for him she added throwing out suddenly her brown withered hand aflame with jewels there lie different things something he knows something he has learned much there is yet for him to learn he will go on his way undisturbed by you or any friends of yours as for his means your question is an impertinence ask at rothschilds concerning the comtesse de vestignes and remember that what belongs to me belongs to him measure your wits against his today tomorrow or any time you choose and the end is certain show your patron out bertrand he has amused me for a little time but i am tired  rochester rose to his feet  madam he said i am sorry to have fatigued you for the rest he added with a note of irony in his tone i suppose i must accept your challenge i feel that i am measuring myself and my poor powers against all sorts of nameless gifts and yet he added as he followed saton towards the door the world goes round and the things which happened yesterday repeat themselves tomorrow your new science should teach you at least not to gamble against certainties  he passed out of the room and saton returned slowly to where rachael was sitting her eyes sought his inquiringly they read the anguish in his face  you are afraid she muttered  i am afraid he admitted given an inversion of their relative positions i feel like faust befriended by mephistopheles i felt it when he stood by my side on the hilltop seven years ago i felt it when he thrust that money into my hand and bade me go and see what i could make of life bade me go without a word of kindness without a touch of his fingers without a sentence of encouragement with no admonitory words save that one single diatribe against failure you know what he told me go out he saidand try your luck go out along the road which your eyes have watched fading into the mists but remember this for men there is no such thing as failure one may swim too far out to sea on a sunny day one may trifle with a loaded revolver or drink in ones sleep the draught from which one does not awake but for men there is no failure  the woman nodded  well she said harshly you remembered that you did not fail who dares to say that you have failed  saton threw himself into the easychair drawn apart from hers his head fell forward into his hands the woman rested her head upon her fingers and watched him through the shadows     chapter xvii  the great naudheim   naudheim had finished his address and stood talking with his host  do you mind saton asked if i introduce some of these people to you you know many of them by name  naudheim shook his head he was a tall man with gray unkempt hair and long wizened face he wore a black suit of clothes of ancient cut and a stock which had literally belonged to his grandfather  no he said vigorously i will be introduced to no one why should i i have spoken to them of the things which make life for us i have told them my thoughts what need is there of introduction i shake hands with no one i leave that and silly speeches and banquets to my enemies the professors these are not my ways  it shall be as you wish of course saton replied you are very fortunate to be able to live and work alone here we have to adapt ourself in some way to the customs of the people with whom we are forced to come into daily contact  naudheim suddenly abandoned that faraway look of his his habit of seeing through the person with whom he was talking he looked into satons face steadily almost fiercely  young man he said you talk like a fool now listen to me these are my parting words there is stuff in you you know a little you could be taught much more and above all you have the temperament temperament is a wonderful thing he added and yet with all these gifts you make me feel as though i would like to take you by the collar and lift you up in my armsyes i am strong though i am thinand throw you out of that window and see you lie there because you are a fool  go on saton said his face growing a little pale  oh you know it naudheim declared you feel it in your blood you know it in your heart you truckle to these people you play at living their life and you forget if ever you knew that our great mistress has never yet opened her arms save to those who have sought her singlehearted and with a single purpose you are a dallier philanderer you will end your days wearing your fashionable clothes they may make you a professor here you will talk learnedly you will write a book and when you die people will say a great man has gone listen you listen to me now with only half your ears but listen once more the time may come the light may burn in your heart the truth may fill your soul then come to me come to me young man and i will make bone and sinew of your flabby limbs i will take you in my hands and i will teach you the way to the stars  silently and without a glance on either side of him naudheim left the room amidst a silence which was almost an instinctive thingthe realization perhaps of the strange nature of this man who from a stern sense of duty had left his hermits life for a few days to speak with his fellowworkers  it had been in some respects a very curious function this it was neither meeting nor reception there was neither host nor hostess except that saton had shaken hands with a few and from his place by the side of naudheim had indicated the turn of those who wished to speak their visitors peculiarities were wellknown to all of them he had left them abruptly not from any sense of discourtesy but because he had not the slightest idea of or sympathy with the manners of civilized people he had given them something to think about he had no desire to hear their criticisms after he had gone the doors were held open there was no one to bid them stay and so they went in little groups of twos and threes a curious heterogeneous crowd with the stamp upon their features or clothes or bearing which somehow or other is always found upon those who are seekers for new things sallow dissatisfiedlooking men women whose faces spoke many of them of a joyless life people of overtrained minds and here and there a strong zealous brilliant student of the last of the sciences left for solution  pauline would have gone with the others but saton touched her hand half unwillingly she lingered behind until they were alone in the darkened room he went to the window and threw it wide open the scent of the flowers in the windowboxes and a little wave of the soft west wind came stealing in she threw her head back with an exclamation of relief  ah she said this is good  you found the room close he asked  pauline sank into the windowseat she rested her delicate oval face upon her fingers and looked away toward the deep green foliage of the trees outside  i did not notice it she said and yet somehow or other the whole atmosphere seemed stifling naudheim is great she went on oh he is a great man of course he said wonderful things in a convincing way he made one gasp  this afternoon saton declared slowly marks an epoch what naudheim said was remarkable because of what he left unsaid couldnt you feel that didnt you understand if that man had ambitions he could startle even this matteroffact world of ours he could shake it to its very base  she shivered a little her fingers were idly tapping the windowsill her thoughtful eyes were clouded with trouble he stood over her absorbed in the charm of her presence the sensuous charm of watching her slim exquisite figure the poise of her head the delicate coloring of her cheeks the tremulous human lips which seemed somehow to humanize the spirituality of her expression they had talked so much that day of a new science saton felt his heart sink as he realized that he was the victim of a greater thing than science could teach it was madnesssheer irredeemable madness but it was in his blood it was there to be reckoned with  it is all very wonderful she continued thoughtfully and yet can you understand what i mean when i say that it makes me feel a trifle hysterical it is as though something had been poured into one which was too great too much for our capacity it is all true i believe but i dont want it to come  why not he asked  oh it seems somehow she answered as though the whole balance of life would be disturbed of course i know that it is feasible enough for thousands of years men and women lived upon the earth and never dreamed that all around them existed a great force which only needed a little humoring a little understanding to do the work of all the world oh it is easy to understand that we too carry with us some psychical force corresponding to this one feels it so often premonitions come and go we cant tell why but they are there and they are true one feels that sense at work at strange times experiments have already shown us that it exists but i wonder what sort of a place the world will be when once it has yielded itself to law  there has never been a time saton said thoughtfully when knowledge has not been for the good of man  she shook her head  i wonder she said whether we realize what is for our good knowledge development culture may reach their zenith and pass beyond we may become debauched with the surfeit of these things the end and aim of life is happiness  the end and aim of life he contradicted her is knowledge  she laughed  i am a woman you see she said thoughtfully  and am i not a man he whispered  she turned her head and looked at him the trouble in her eyes deepened she felt the color coming and going in her cheeks his eyes seemed to stir things in her against which her whole physical self rebelled she rose abruptly to her feet  i must go she said i have a thousand things to do this evening  to play at you mean he corrected her you dont really do very much do you the women dont in your world  you are polite she answered lightly please to show me the way out  in a moment he said  she was inclined to rebel they had moved a little from the window and were standing in a darker part of the room she felt his fingers upon her wrist she would have given the world to have been able to wrench it away but she could not she stood there submissively her breath coming quickly her eyes compelled to meet his  stay for a moment longer he begged i want to talk to you for a little while about this  there is no time now she said hurriedly it is an inexhaustible subject  inexhaustible indeed he answered with an enigmatic laugh  she read his thoughts she knew very well what was in his mind what was almost on his lips and she struggled to be free of him  mr saton she said i am sorrybut you must really let me go  he did not move  it is very hard to let you go he murmured cant youdont you realize a little that it is always hard for me to see you goto see you leave the world where we have at least interests in common to go back to a life of which i know so little a life in which i have so small a part a life which is scarcely worthy of you pauline  again she felt a sort of physical impotence she struggled desperately against the loss of nerve power which kept her there she would have given anything in the world to have left him to have run out of the room with a little shriek out into the streets and squares she knew so well to breathe the air she had known all her life to escape from this unknown emotion she told herself that she hated the man whose will kept her there she was sure of it and yet  i do not understand you she said and i must i really must go cant you see that just now at any rate i dont want to understand she added fighting all the time for her words i want to go please do not keep me here against my will do you understand let me go and i will be grateful to you  somehow the strain seemed suddenly lightened he was only a very ordinary rather doubtful sort of persona harmless but necessary part of interesting things he had moved toward the door which he was holding open for her to pass through  thank you so much she said with genuine relief in her tone i have stayed an unconscionable time and i found your master delightful  you will come again he said softly i want to explain a little further what naudheim was saying i can take you a little further even than he did today  you must come and see me she answered lightly remember that after all the world has conventions  he stepped back on to the doorstep after he had handed her into her carriage she threw herself back amongst the cushions with something that was like a sob of relief she had sensations which she could not analyzea curious feeling of having escaped and yet coupled with it a sense of something new and strange in her life something of which she was a little afraid and yet from which she would not willingly have parted she told herself that she detested the house which she had left detested the thought of that darkened room nevertheless she was forced to look back he was standing in the open doorway from which the butler had discreetly retired and meeting her eyes he bowed once more she tried to smile unconcernedly but failed she looked away with scarcely a return of his greeting  home she told the man drive quickly  almost before her own door she met rochester the sight of him was somehow or other an immense relief to her she fell back again in the world which she knew she stopped the carriage and called to him  come and drive with me a little way she begged i am stifled i want some fresh air i want to talk to you oh come please  rochester took the vacant seat by her side at once  what is it he asked gravely tell me you have had bad news  she shook her head  no she said i am afraidthat is all     chapter xviii  rochesters ultimatum   the park into which they turned was almost deserted pauline stopped the carriage and got out  come and walk with me a little way she said to rochester we will go and sit amongst that wilderness of empty chairs i want to talk i must talk to someone we shall be quite alone there  rochester walked by her side puzzled he had never seen her like this  i suppose i am hysterical she said clutching at his arm for a moment as they passed along the walk there even that does me good its good to feeloh i dont know what im talking about she exclaimed  where have you been this afternoon he asked gravely  to hear that awful man naudheim she answered henry i wish id never been i wish to heaven youd never asked bertrand saton to beauleys  rochesters face grew darker  i wish id wrung the fellows neck the first day i saw him he declared bitterly but after all pauline you dont take this sort of person seriously  i wish i didnt she answered  hes an infernal charlatan rochester declared im convinced of it and i mean to expose him  she shook her head  you can call him what you like she said but there is naudheim behind him there is no one in europe who would dare to call naudheim a charlatan  he is a wonderful man but he is mad rochester said  no he is not mad she said it is we who are mad to listen a little to think a little to play a little with the thoughts he gives us  i know of naudheim only by reputation rochester said and so far as regards saton nothing will convince me that he is not an impostor  she sighed  there may be something of the charlatan in his methods she said but there is something else henry why cant we be content with the things that we know and see and feel  he smiled bitterly  i am he answered i thank god that i have none of that insane desire for probing and dissecting nature to discover things which we are not fit yet to understand if even they do exist its a sort of spiritual vivisection pauline and it can bring nothing but disquiet and unhappiness grant for a moment that naudheim and that even this bounder saton are honest what possible good can it do you or me to hang upon their lips to become their disciples  oh i dont know she answered yet its hideously fascinating henryhideously and the man himselfbertrand saton i cant tell what there is about him i only know  she broke off in the middle of her sentence rochester caught her by the wrist  pauline he said for gods sake dont tell me that that fellow has dared to make love to you  i dont know she answered sometimes i hate the very sight of him sometimes i feel almost as you do and at others well i cant explain it it isnt any use trying  pauline he said you see for yourself the state to which you have been reduced this afternoon tell me is there happiness in being associated with any science or any form of knowledge the study of which upsets you so completely there are better things in life forget this wretched little man and his melodramatic talk  if only i could she murmured  they sat side by side in silence strong man though he was rochester was struggling fiercely with the wave of passionate anger which had swept in upon him for years he had treated this woman as his dearest friend the love which was a part of his life lay deep down in his heart a thing with the seal of silence set upon it zealously treasured in its very voicelessness a splendid oblation to the mans chivalry and now this unmentionable creature this frankenstein of his own creation the boy whom he had pitchforked into life had dared to be guilty of this unspeakable sacrilege it was hard indeed for rochester to maintain his selfcontrol  pauline he said i cannot stand by and see your life wrecked you are too sane too reasonable a woman to become the prey of such a pitiful adventurer wont you listen to me for a moment  indeed i am listening she faltered  give yourself a chance he begged leave england this weektomorrow if you can go right away from here you have friends in rome i heard your cousin ask you not long ago to pay her a visit at her villa on the adriatic start tomorrow and i promise that you will come back a sane woman you will be able to laugh at saton to see through the fellow and to realise what a tissue of shams hes built of you will be able to feel a reasonable interest in anything naudheim has to say just now you are unnerved these men have frightened you believe me that your greatest and most effectual safety lies in flight  a sudden hope lit up her face she turned towards him eagerly she was going to consenthe felt it he was almost conscious of the words trembling upon her lips already his own personal regrets at her absence were beginning to cloud his joy then her whole expression changed something of the look settled upon her features which he had seen when first she had stopped the carriage her lips were parted her eyes distended she looked nervously around as though she were afraid that some one was following them  i cannot do that henry she said in a way it would be a relief but it is impossible i cannot indeed  she led the way to the carriage they walked in absolute silence for nearly a minute he felt that he had lost a great part of his influence over her and he was bitter  tell me why you almost consented he asked abruptly and then changed your mind in your heart you must know that it is for your good  i only know she answered slowly that at first i longed to say yes and now when i come to think of it i see that it is impossible  you are going to allow yourself then to be the prey of these morbid fancies you are going to treat this creature as a human being of your own order you are going to let him work upon your imagination  it is no use she said wearily for the present i cannot talk any more about it i do not understand myself at all  they stood for a moment by the carriage  we shall meet tonight he reminded her  she gave him a doubtful little smile  you are really coming to the wintertons she asked  i have promised he answered caroline has bribed me i am going to take you in to dinner  will you drive home with me now she asked  he shook his head  i have another call to make he said a little grimly  saton was still in the half darkened library sitting with his back turned to the light and his eyes fixed with a curious stare into vacancy when the door opened and rochester entered unannounced saton rose at once to his feet but the interrogative words died away upon his lips rochesters fair sunburnt face was grim with angry purpose he had the air of a man stirred to the very depths he came only a little way into the room and he took up his position with his back to the door  my young friend he said it is not many hours since you and i came to an understanding of a sort i am here to add a few words to it  saton said nothing he stood immovable waiting  whatever your game in life may be rochester continued you can play it for all i care to the end but there is one thing which i forbid i have come here so that you shall understand that i forbid it you can make fools of the whole world you can have them kneeling at your feet to listen to your infernal nonsensethe whole world save one woman i am ashamed to mention her name in your presence but you know whom i mean  satons lips seemed to move for a moment but he still remained silent  very well rochester said there shall be no excuse no misunderstanding the woman with whom i forbid you to have anything whatever to do whom i order you to treat from this time forward as a stranger is pauline marrabel  saton was still in no hurry to speak he leaned a little forward his eyes seemed to burn as though touched with some inward fire  by what right he asked do you come here and dictate to me you are not my father or my guardian i do not recognize your right to speak to me as one having authority  it was i who turned you loose upon the world rochester answered i deserve hanging for it  i should be sorry saton said coldly to deprive you of your deserts  you have learned many things since those days rochester declared you have acquired the knack of glib speech you have become a past master in the arts which go to the ensnaring of overimaginative women you have mixed with quack spiritualists and selfstyled professors of what they term occultism go and practise your arts where you will but remember what i have told you remember the persons name which i have mentioned remember it obey what i have said and you may fool the whole world forget it and i am your enemy understand that  and you saton answered with darkening face understand this from me rochester i do not for a moment admit your right to speak to me in this fashion i admit no obligation to you we are simply man and man in the world together and the words which you have spoken have no weight with me whatever  you defy me rochester asked calmly  if you call that defiance i do saton answered  rochester came a step further into the room  listen my young friend he said you belong to the modern condition of things to the world which has become just a little overcivilized you may call me a boor if you like but i want you to understand this if i fail to unmask you by any other means i shall revert to the primeval way of deciding such differences as lie between you and me the differences which make for hate i can wield a horsewhip with the strongest man living and i am in deadly earnest  the lady whose name you have mentioned saton said softlyis she also your ward you are related to her perhaps  she is the woman i love rochester answered our ways through life may lie apart or fate may bring them together that is not your business or your concern when i tell you that she is the woman i love i mean you to understand that she is the woman whom i will protect against all manner of evil now and always remember that if you disregard my warning in the spirit or in the letter so surely as we two live you will repent it  saton crossed the room with noiseless footsteps he leaned toward the wall and touched an electric bell  very well he said you have come to deliver an ultimatum and i have received it i understand perfectly what you will accept as an act of war there is nothing more to be said i think  nothing rochester answered turning to follow the servant whom satons summons had brought to the door     chapter xix  trouble brewing   saton turned out of bond street and climbed the stairs of a little teashop with the depressed feeling of a man who is expiating an offence which he bitterly repents violet was waiting for him at one of the tables shut off from the main room by a sort of japanese matting hanging from the ceiling he resigned his stick and hat with a sigh to one of the trim waitresses and sat down opposite her  my dear violet he said this is an unexpected pleasure i thought that wednesday was quite one of your busiest days  it is generally she answered to tell you the truth she added leaning across the table i was jolly glad to get away i have a kind of fear bertrand that we are going to be a little too busy  what do you mean he asked sharply  she nodded her head mysteriously  there have been one or two people in in the last few days asking questions which i dont understand she told him one of them i am pretty sure was a detective he didnt get much change out of me she added in a selfsatisfied tone but theres someone got their knife into us you remember the trouble down in the marylebone road when you  dont he interrupted i hate to think of that time  well i tell you i believe there is something of the sort brewing again the woman said ill tell you more about it later on  the waitress brought their tea which violet carefully prepared  two pieces of sugar she said and no cream you see i havent forgotten although it is not often we have tea together now bertrand you are becoming too fashionable i suppose she added with a little frown  you know it isnt that he answered hastily its my work nothing but my work go on with what you were telling me violet  you neednt look so scared she said glancing round to be sure that they were not overheard the only thing is that madame must be told at once and we shall all have to be careful for a little time i shut up shop for the day as soon as i tumbled to the thing  i wonder if this is rochesters doings he muttered  the husband of the lady violet enquired  saton nodded  he is my enemy he said nothing would make him happier than to have the power to strike a blow like this and to identify us with the place in any way  i dont see how they could do that she said meditatively i should be the poor sufferer i suppose and you may be sure i shouldnt be like that other girl who gave you away you are not afraid of that are you bertrand things are different between us we are engaged to be married you do not forget that bertrand  of course i do not he answered  well she said we wont talk about the past you are safe so far as i am concernedfor the present at any rate but madame must know and your friends in charing cross road  we will close the office tomorrow for a little time saton declared its no use running risks like this  the old lady must have made a tidy pile out of it violet declared flourishing an overscented handkerchief if she takes my advice she will go quiet for a little time i can feel trouble when its about and i have felt it the last few days  it is very good of you violet to have sent for me at once he said i know you wont mind if i hurry away it is very important that i see madame  of course she agreed but when will you take me out to dinner tonight or tomorrow night  tomorrow night he promised eager to escape if anything happens that i cant ill let you know  she laid her hand upon his arm as they descended the stairs  bertrand she said if i were you id make it tomorrow night  he called a taximeter cab and drove rapidly to berkeley square in the room where she usually sat he found rachael looking through a pile of foreign newspapers  well she said peering into his face you have bad news i can see that what is it  helga has just sent for me he answered she says that she has had one or two mysterious visitors today and yesterday one of them she feels sure was a detective  huntley has just telephoned up rachael said calmly something of the same sort of thing happened at the office in the charing cross road huntley acted like a man of sense he closed it up at once destroyed all papers and sent dorrington over to paris by the morning train  saton sat down and buried his face in his hands  rachael he said this must stop i cannot bear the anxiety of it it is terrible to feel today that one is stretching out toward the great things and tomorrow that one is finding the money to live by fooling people by charlatanism by roguery think if we were ever connected with these places if even a suspicion of it got about think how narrow our escape was before remember that i have even stood in the prisoners dock and escaped only through your cleverness and an accident it might happen again rachael  it shall not she answered i would go there myself first it is well for you to talk bertrand but you and i are neither of us fond of simple things we must live we must have money  we live extravagantly he said  all my life i have lived extravagantly she answered why should i change now i have but a few years to live i cannot bear small rooms or cheap servants or bad cooking  we have some money left he said come with me into the country we can live there for very little soon my book will be ready then the lectures will begin there will be money enough when people begin to understand  no she said there is only one way i have spoken of it to you before you must marry that foolish girl lois champneyes  what do you know about her he asked looking up startled  i have made inquiries rachael answered it is the usual thing in the countries i know of she will be of age in a short time and she will have one hundred and seventy thousand pounds upon that you can live until our time comes and you can afford to keep this house going  i do not want to marry he said  her hand shot out towards himan accusing hand her eyes flashed fire as she leaned forward gripping the arm of the chair with her other fingers  listen she said i took you from the gutter i saved you from starvation i showed you the way to ease and luxury i taught you things which have set your brain working which shall fashion for you if you dare to follow it the way to greatness i saved your life i planted your feet upon the earth your life is mine your future is mine what is this sacrifice that i demand nothing dont refuse me i warn you bertrand dont refuse me there are limits to my patience as there are limits to my generosity and my affection if you refuse it can be but for one reason and that reason you will not dare to tell me do you refuse answer me now i will have no more evasions  she would not marry me he said i have not seen her for days  where is she rachael demanded  in the country at beauleys he answered the rochesters have all left town yesterday or today and she went with them  then into the country we go she declared it is an opportune time too we shall be out of the way if troubles come from these interfering people i do not ask you again bertrand whether you will or will not marry this girl for the first time i exercise my rights over you i demand that you marry her be as faithless as you like you are as fickle as a man can be and as shallow make love to her for a year and treat her as these englishmen treat their housekeepers if you will but marry her you must it is the money we needthe money what is that  the bell was ringing from a telephone instrument upon the table saton lifted it to his ear  there is a trunk call for you a voice said please hold the line  saton waited soon a familiar voice came  who is that it asked  bertrand saton saton answered  listen the voice said i am huntley i speak from folkestone i am crossing tonight to paris dorrington is already on ahead someone has been employing detectives to track us down it commenced with that letterthe one for which you settled terms yourself you hear  i hear saton answered was it necessary for you too to go  i cannot tell huntley answered all i know is that i have done pretty well the last two years and i am not inclined to figure in the police courts if the thing blows over ill be back in a few weeks every paper of importance has been destroyed i believe that you and madame are perfectly safe at the same time take my tip go slow im off ive only a minute for the boat  saton laid down the receiver on the instrument  if it must be he said turning to rachael i will go down to blackbirds nest tomorrow     chapter xx  first blood   lois came walking down the green path that led to the wood her head a little tilted back to watch the delicate tracery of the green leaves against the sky her thoughts apparently far away suddenly she came to a standstill the color rushed into her cheeks her eyes danced with pleasure saton had come suddenly round the corner and was already within a few feet of her  you she exclaimed really you i had no idea that you had left london  he smiled as he took her hands  london was a desert he said i have finished my work for a few days and i have brought my writing down here  when did you come she asked  last night he answered i was just wondering how i could send a note up to you fortunately i remembered your favorite walk  did you really come to see me she murmured  he laughed softly and bent towards her all her hesitation and mistrust seemed to pass away she lay quietly in his arms with her face upturned to his he kissed her on the lips all the time his eyes were watching the path along which he had come  let us sit down she said at last gently disengaging herself from him there are so many things i want to ask you  and i too he answered i have something to saysomething i cannot keep to myself any longer  he led the way to a fallen tree a little removed from the footpath they were scarcely seated however before he turned his head sharply in the direction from which he had come his whole frame seemed to have become suddenly rigid with an intense effort of listening he raised his finger with a warning gesture  sit still he whispered dont say anything there is someone coming  her hand fell upon his they sat side by side in an almost breathless silence safely screened from observation unless the passersby whoever they might be should be unusually curious  it was pauline and rochester who camepauline in a tailormade gown of dark green clothpauline slim tall and elegant rochester was bending toward her talking earnestly he wore a tweed shooting suit and carried a gun under either arm  you see who it is lois whispered  saton nodded his face had darkened his cheeks were almost livid his eyes followed the two with an expression which terrified the girl who sat by his side  bertrand she whispered why do you look like that  like what he asked without moving his eyes from the spot where those two figures had disappeared  she shivered a little  you looked as though you hated mr rochester you looked angrymore than angry you frightened me  i do hate him saton answered slowly i hate him as he hates me we are enemies  yet you were not looking at him all the time she persisted you looked at pauline too you dont hate her do you  he drew a little breath between his clenched teeth if only this child would hold her peace  no he said i do not hate lady marrabel  is it because he has interfered between us she asked timidly that you dislike mr rochester so much remember that very soon i shall be of age  he has no right to interfere in my concerns at all saton answered evasively hush  the two had halted at a little wooden gate which led into the strip of field dividing the two plantations rochester was looking back along the footpath by which they had come they could hear his voice distinctly  johnson must have got lost he remarked a little impatiently i will leave my second gun here for him it is quite time i took up my place the beaters will be in the wood directly  he leaned one of the guns against the stone wall and with the other under his arm opened the gate for pauline to pass through they crossed the field diagonally and came to a standstill at a spot marked by a tiny flag  all the time saton watched them with fascinated eyes the thoughts were rushing through his brain he turned to lois  dear he said i think that you had better run along home i will come up to the shrubbery after dinner if you think that you can get out  but there is no hurry she whispered cant we sit here and talk for a little time or go further back into the wood i know a most delightful little hidingplace just at the top of the slate pitan old keepers shelter  saton shook his head he avoided looking at her  the beaters are in the other part of the wood already he said very likely they will come this way too if they see us together they will tell mr rochester i dont want him to know that i am here just yet  she rose reluctantly  dear me she said sighing and i thought that we were going to have such a nice long talk  we will have it very soon he whispered a little unsteadily we must dear remember that i have only come down here so that we may see a little more of one another i will arrange it somehow only just now i think that you had better run away home  he kissed her and she turned reluctantly away she stole through the undergrowth back into the green path saton watched her with fixed eyes until she had turned the corner and disappeared then he seemed at once to forget her existence he too rose to his feet and stole gently forward moving very slowly and stooping a little so as to remain out of sight all the time his eyes were fixed upon the gun whose barrel was shining in the sunlight  from the other side of the wood there commenced an intermittent fusilade the shots were drawing nearer and nearer rochester stood waiting his gun held ready pauline had retreated round the corner of the further wood beyond any possible line of fire  saton had reached the gate now and was within reach of the gun and the bag of cartridges which were hanging by a leather belt from the gatepost he turned his head and looked stealthily along the path by which rochester had come there was no one in sight no sound except the twittering of birds overhead and the rustling of the leaves he sank on one knee and his hand closed upon the gun the blood surged to his head there was a singing in his ears he felt his heart thumping as though he were suddenly seized with some illness rochesters figure tall graceful debonair notwithstanding the looseness of his shooting clothes and his somewhat rigid attitude seemed suddenly to loom large and hateful before his eyes he saw nothing else he thought of nothing else it was the man he hated it was the man who understood what he was the worst side of himthe man whom his instincts recognised as his ruthless and dangerous enemy  the rush of a rabbit through the undergrowth startled him so that he very nearly screamed he looked around pallid terrified there was no one in sight no sign of any life save animal and insect life in the wood behind  the stock of the gun came to his shoulder his fingers sought the trigger cautiously he thrust it through the bars of the gate bending down he took a long and deliberate aim the fates seemed to be on his side rochester suddenly stiffened into attention his gun came to his shoulder as with a loud whir a pheasant flew out of the wood before him the two reports rang out almost simultaneously the pheasant dropped to the ground like a stone rochesters arms went up to the skies he gave a little cry and fell over a huddled heap upon the grass  saton with fingers that trembled tore out the exploded cartridge seized another from the bag thrust it in and replaced the gun against the wall his breath was coming in little sobs trees and sky danced before his eyes once he dared to lookonly onceat the spot where rochester was lying his hands were outstretched once he half raised himself and then fell back from round the corner of the wood came pauline saton heard her crya cry of agony it seemed to him he bent low and made his way back into the plantation plunging through the undergrowth until he reached a narrow and little frequented footpath he was deaf to all sounds for the thumping in his ears had become now like a sledgehammer beating upon an anvil he was not sure that he saw anything his feet fled over the ground mechanically only when he reached the borders of the wood and crossed the meadow leading to the main road he drew himself a little more upright he must remember he told himself fiercely he must remember  he paused in the middle of the field and looked back he was out of sight now of the scene of the tragedy nothing was to be seen or heard but the low musical sounds of the late summer afternoonthe beat of a reapingmachine the humming of insects the distant call of a pigeon the faraway bark of a farmhouse dog the shooting had ceased by this time they must all know he reflected he lit a cigarette and inhaled the smoke without the slightest apprehension of what he was doing he took a book from his pocket held it before him and glanced at the misty page of verse then he made his way out on to the highroad sauntering like a man anxious to make the most of the brilliant sunshine the clear air  there was no one in sight anywhere along the white dusty way he crossed the road and opened another gate a few minutes climb a sharp descent and he was safe within the gate of his own abode he looked behind still not a human being in sightno sound no note of alarm in the soft sunlit air he set his teeth and drew a long breath then he closed the gate behind him and choosing the back way entered the house without observation     chapter xxi  afraid   saton wondered afterwards many times at the extraordinary nonchalance with which he faced the remainder of that terrible day he wrote several letters and was aware that he wrote them carefully and well he had his usual evening bath and changed his clothes making perhaps a little more careful toilet even than usual  rachael who was waiting for him when he descended to dinner even remarked upon the lightness of his step  the country suits you bertrand she said it suits you better than it does me you walk like a boy and there is color in your cheeks  the sun he muttered i always tan quickly  where have you been to she asked  i have been walking with miss champneyes he answered  rachael nodded  and your friend at beauleys she asked with a little sneer what if he had seen you eh you are very brave bertrand for he is a big man and you are small i do not think that he loves you eh but what about the girl  a servant entered the room and saton with relief abandoned the conversation she returned to it however the moment they were alone  see here my son she said remember what i have always told you one can do without anything in this world except money we have plenty for the moment it is true but a stroke of illfortune and our income might well vanish now listen bertrand make sure of this girls money she is of age and she will marry you  her guardian would never give his consent saton said  it is not necessary his companion answered i have been to somerset house i have seen the will one hundred thousand pounds she has in her own right unalienable for the rest let her guardian do what he will with it with a hundred thousand pounds you can rest for a while we might even give up  saton struck the table with his clenched fist  be careful he said i hate to hear these things mentioned the windows are open and the walls are thin there might be listeners anywhere  her withered lips drew back into a smile she was not pleasant just then to look upon  i forgot she muttered we are devotees of science now in earnest you are right we must run no risks only remember however careful we are you are always liable toto the same thing that happened before it took a thousand pounds to get you off then  saton rose from his seat impatiently he walked restlessly across the room  dont he exclaimed cant we live without mentioning those things i am nervous tonight hideously nervous he added under his breath  he stood before the open window his face set his eyes riveted upon a spot in the distance where the great white front of beauleys flashed out from amongst the trees its windows had caught the dying sunlight and a flood of fire seemed to be burning along its front the flag floated from the chimneys there was no sign of any disturbance the quiet stillness of evening which rested upon the landscape seemed everywhere undisturbed yet saton as he looked shivered  down in the lane a motorcar rushed by his eyes followed it fascinated it was one of the beauleys cars and inside was seated a tall spare man whitefaced and serious on whose knees rested a black case saton knew in a moment that it was one of the doctors who had been summoned to beauleys by telephone and telegraph from all parts  you are watching the house of your patron she said drily  patron no longer saton exclaimed rolling himself another cigarette we are enemies declared enemiesso far as he is concerned at any rate  you are a fool the woman said he might still have been useful you quarrel with people as though it were worth the trouble to speak angry words is the most foolish thing i know  saton glanced at the clock upon the mantelpiece  i am going out for an hour he said  to beauleys she asked mockingly  somewhere near there he answered good night  he strolled out hatless and with no covering over his thin black dinnercoat he crossed the meadow and climbed the little range of broken rocky hills from which one could see down even into the flowergardens of beauleys he could see there no sign of disturbance save that there were two motorcars before the door slowly he made his way to the lodge gates and passing through approached the house there were many lights burning a certain repressed air of excitement was certainly visible saton longed yet dared not to ask for news from the people at the lodge at any rate the blinds were still up and the doctors there probably the man was alive perhaps even he might recover  he struck off from the drive and followed a narrow path which led at first between two great banks of rhododendrons and finally wound a circuitous way through an old and magnificent shrubbery he reached a path whence he could command a view of the house and where he was himself unseen he looked at his watch he was five minutes late but as yet there was no sign of lois he composed himself to wait watching the birds come home to roost and the insects whom the heat had brought out of the earth crawl away into oblivion the air was sweet with the smell of flowers from a little further afield came the more pungent odor of a fire of weeds the great front of the house ablaze though it was with lights seemed almost deserted no one entered or issued from the hall door  half an hour passed there was no sign of lois then he saw her come very slowlywalking as it seemed to him like one afraid of the ground upon which she trod as she came nearer he saw that her face was ghastly pale her eyes which wandered restlessly to the right and to the left were frightened dilated the thing had been a shock to her of course  he stepped a little way out from the shrubs showing himself cautiously she stopped short at the sight of him  lois he called softly  she looked at him and a sudden wave of terror passed across her face she made no movement towards him he himself was wordless struck dumb by her appearance she gave a little cry what the word was that she uttered he could not tell then suddenly turning round she fled away  he watched her with fascinated eyes watched her feet fly over the lawns watched her without a single backward glance vanish at last through the small side door from which she had first issued he wiped the moisture from his forehead and a little sob broke from his throat the vision of her face was still before him he knew for a certainty what it was that had terrified her she had started to keep her engagement but she was afraid she was afraid of him something that he had done had betrayed him she knew his libertyperhaps his lifewas in this girls hands  he crept out of the shrubbery and staggered down the drive making his way homeward across the hills as swiftly as his uncertain footsteps would take him it was dusk now and he met no one yet his heart beat at every soundthe clanking of a chain attached to the fetlock of a wandering horse the still mournful cry of an owl which floated out from the plantation the clatter of the small stones which his own feet dislodged as he feverishly climbed the rocks above him on the other side of the road towered the hill where he had sat and dreamed as a boy where rochester had come and encouraged him to prate of his ambitions  he looked away from its dark outline with a little groan up on the hillside flashed the lights of blackbirds nest he stretched out his hands and groped onwards     chapter xxii  saton reasserts himself   rochester asked only one question during those few days when he lay between life and death he opened his eyes suddenly and motioned to the doctor to stoop down  who shot me he asked  it was an accident the doctor assured him soothingly  rochester said no more but his lips seemed to curl for a moment into the old disbelieving smile then the struggle began in a week it was over a magnificent constitution and an unshattered nerve triumphed the doctors one by one took their departure their task was over rochester would recover  who shot me  the doctor had seen no reason to keep silence and this question of rochesters had created something like a sensation as it travelled backwards and forwards rochester had been shot in the left side in the middle of a field where no accident of his own causing seemed possible one barrel only of his gun had been fired and to account for that a cock pheasant lay dead within a few feet of him the shootingparty were all old and experienced sportsmen the gun which rochester had left leaning against the gate was discovered exactly as he had left it there loaded in both barrels there was not the ghost of a clue  only lois kept to her room for three days until she could bear it no longer then she walked out a little way toward the woods and met saton he recognised her with a shock he himself especially now it was known that rochester would live had rapidly recovered from the fit of horrors which had seized him on that night it was not so with lois her cheeks were ghastly pale and her eyes beringed she walked like one recovering from a long illness and when she saw saton she screamed  he held out his hand and noticed with swift comprehension her first instinctive withdrawal  bertrand she cried oh bertrand  what do you mean he asked hoarsely  you know what i mean she answered i dont want to touch you but i must or i shall fall let me take your arm we will go and sit down  they sat side by side on the trunk of a fallen tree a small stream rippled by at their feet the meadow which it divided was dotted everywhere with little clumps of large yellow buttercups she sat at a little distance from him and she kept her eyes averted  bertrand she murmured what does it mean tell me what i saw that afternoon you took up the gun was it an accident but no she added it is absurd to ask that  you saw me he exclaimed quickly you believe that you saw me touch that gun  she nodded  i hated to go and leave you there she said i waited about behind those thick blackthorn trees hoping that you might come my way i saw you creep up to the gun i saw you raise it to your shoulder even then i had no idea what you were going to do afterwards i saw the smoke and the flash i heard the report and mr rochesters cry as he fell i saw you slip a fresh cartridge into the gun and go stealing away bertrand i have not slept since tell me was it a nightmare  it was no nightmare he answered i shot him and i wish that he had died  she looked at him with horror  bertrand she faltered you cant mean it  little lois he answered i do you do not understand what hatred is you do not understand all that it may meanall that it may cause he is my enemy that man and i am his it is a duel between us a duel to the death the first blow has been mine and i have failed you will see that it will not be long before he strikes back  but this is horrible she muttered  horrible to you of course he exclaimed hatred is a thing of which you can know nothing and yet there it is people might think that he was my benefactor he gave me money to go out and find my level in the world gave it to me with the bitter cynical adviceadvice that was almost a stipulationthat if i failed i ceased to live i did fail in every honest thing i touched he continued bitterly then i tried a bold experiment it was the last thing offered the last wonderful chance i took it and i won then i returned i paid him back the money which he had lent mei did my best to seem grateful it was of no use he mistrusted me from the first in his own house i was the butt for his scornful speeches i was even bidden to leave i ventured to speak to the woman with whom he is slavishly in love and he came to me like a fury if i had been a hairdresser posing as a duke he could not have been more violent he wanted me to promise never to speak to her againher or you i refused then he declared war and lois there are weak joints in my armor you see i admit it to younever to him when he finds his way there he will thrust that is why i struck first  she shook her head sadly  ah but i do not understand she said he is very stern and very quiet but he is a just man i have never known him to find fault where there was none  there are faults enough in my life saton answered i have never denied it but i have had to fight with my back to the wall i shall win i am not afraid of a thousand mr rochesters i am gathering to my handsno i will not talk to you about that lois i am more anxious about you than mr rochester i am afraid that you will hate me for always now  no she said i cannot do that i cannot hate you but i do not wish to see you any more as long as i live i shall see you kneeling there with your finger upon the trigger of that gun i shall see the flash i shall see him throw up his hands and fall it was hideous  saton passed his hand across his forehead her words had touched his keen imagination the horror of the scene was upon him too once more  dont he beggeddont lois  well she asked  you will not speak of this to anyone  no she answered sadly leaning a little forward with her head resting upon her clasped hands i dont suppose that i shall if he had died it would have been different now that he is going to get well i suppose i shall try to forget  to forget he murmured trying to take her hand  she drew it away with a shiver  no she said that is finished i had to see you i had to talk to you go away please i cannot bear to see you any more it is too terribletoo terrible  a born cajoler of women he forced into play all his powers he whispered a flood of words in her ear his own voice shook his eyes were soft he pleaded as one beside himself loislois whom he had found so sensitive so easily moved so gently affectionateremained like a stone at the end of all his pleadings she simply looked away  do you mind she asked leaving me please please  he got up and went defeat was apparent enough although it was unexpected lois stole back to the housestole back to her room and locked the door  saton walked home across the hills with white face and set eyes he looked neither to the right nor to the left and when he arrived at blackbirds nest he walked straight into the long oldfashioned room on the ground floor which he called his library and where rachael generally sat  she was there crouching over the fire when he entered and looked around with frowning face  bertrand she said i hate this country life even the sunshine mocks there is no warmth in it and the winds are cold i must have warmth i shall stay here no longer  he threw a log on to the fire and turned around  listen he said the girl lois champneyesi have lost my hold of her she knows something about the accident to rochester  bungler the woman muttered go on tell me how you lost your power  i cannot tell he answered i was in an unsettled mood i think that i was a little afraid she spoke of that afternoon it all came back to me i am sure that i was afraid he added passing his hand across his forehead  she leaned toward him and her eyes glittered hard and bright from their parchmentlike setting  bertrand she said you talk like a coward what are you going to do  to bring her here he answered hoarsely she has gone back to beauleys she is passing up through the plantation on her way to the house perhaps at this very moment she wore white and she carried her hat in her hand there were rims under her eyes she walks slowly she is afraida little hysterical you see her  he pointed out of the window the woman nodded  sit down she muttered we shall see  he sank into a low chair with his face turned toward the window no further words passed between them they sat there till the sun sank behind the hills and the dusk began to cast shadows over the land  a servant came and said something about dinner rachael waved her away  in an hour or an hour and a half she said  the shadows grew deeper rachaels face seemed unchanged but saton had grown so pale that his fixed eyes seemed to have become unnaturally large sometimes his lips moved though the sounds which he uttered never resolved themselves into speech at last rachael rose to her feet she pointed out of the window saton gave a little gasp  she is there he asked breathlessly  she comes rachael answered see that you do not lose your power again i am exhausted i am going to rest  she passed out of the room saton went and stood before the low window slowly and with hesitating footsteps lois came up the path lifted the latch of the little gate and stood in the garden close to a tall group of hollyhocks  saton went out to her  you have come to tell me that you are sorry he said  yes she answered  you did not mean what you said  no  come in he whispered  he laid his fingers upon her hand and she followed him into the room she was very pale and she was breathing as though she had been running he passed his arm around her waist  you are not angry with me any longer he whispered in her ear you will kiss me  if you wish she answered  he looked into her eyes for a moment then he took her into his arms  dear lois he whispered you must never be so unkind to me again     chapter xxiii  an unpleasant encounter   rochester and pauline were driving through the country lanes in a small oldfashioned pony carriage westward the clouds were still stained by a brilliant sunset the air was clear and brisk chill with the invigorating freshness of the autumn evening already the stillness had come the stillness which is the herald of night the laborers had deserted the fields the wind had dropped a pleasant smell of burning weeds from a bonfire by the side of the road crept into the air the silence was broken for a moment by the cry of a lonely bird drifting homewards on wings that seemed almost motionless  rochester was quite convalescent now and with the aid of a stick was able to walk almost as far as he chose pauline had remained at beauleys and her presence had divested those last few weeks of all their irksomeness he stole a glance at her as she leaned back in the carriage she was a little pale perhaps and her eyes were thoughtful but the lines of her mouth were soft there was no shadow of unhappiness in her face none of that look which in london had driven him almost to madness  his fingers closed upon hers they were walking uphill and the pony took little guiding  you are sure pauline he asked that you are not bored yet with the country  i am quite sure she answered  something in her tone puzzled him he looked at her again long and fixedly her eyes met his they answered his unspoken question  i suppose she said that i should look happier i have been content i am content still i suppose it is all one ought to expect from life  there are other things he answered but not for us paulinenot yet  life is a very perplexing matter she declared  he shook his head  there is no perplexity about it he declared its riddle is easily enough solved the trouble is that the fetters which bind us are sometimes beyond our power to break  if we were free she murmured you and i know very well whither we should turn and yet henry are you sure are you quite quite sure that there is nothing in life greater even than love  if there is he answered we will go in search of it hand in hand you and i together  yes she echoed simply we will go in search of it but first of all we must find someone to light our torch  he shook the reins a little impatiently but they were not yet at the top of the hill and the pony crawled on undisturbed  dear pauline he said sometimes lately i fancied that you have seemed a little morbid i have lived longer than you i have lived long enough to be sure of one thing  and that is she asked  that all real happiness he said even the everyday forms of content is to be found amongst the simple truths of life love is the greatest of them look at me pauline dont you think that even though we live our lives apart dont you think that to me the world is a different place when you are near  she looked into his face a little wistfully then she let her hand rest on his  you are so steadfast she saidso strong and so certain of yourself forgive me if i seem a little restless one loses ones balance sometimes thinking and thinking and wondering  they were at the top of the hill and the pony paused rochester stepped out  come he said i will take you for a little walk we will leave peter here  he unlocked a gate with a key which he took from his pocket and hand in hand they ascended a steep path which led between a grove of pine trees out once more into the open they crossed a patch of green turf and came to another gate set in a stone wall this also rochester opened a few more yards and they climbed up to the masses of tumbled rock which lay about on the summit of the hill  turn round he said you have seen this view many a time in the daylight you can see it now fading away into nothingness  they stood hand in hand looking downwards mists rose from along the side of the river and stood about in the valleys the lights began to twinkle here and there afar off like some nursery toy they saw a train with its line of white smoke go stealing across the shadowy landscape  rochesters face darkened with a sudden reminiscence  it was here he said that i first saw your friend the charlatan  my friend she murmured  more yours than mine at any rate he answered he sat with his back against that rock and if ever hunger was written into a boys face it was there in his pale cheeks burning in his eyes  he was very poor then she asked  he was very poor rochester answered but it was not hunger for food it was hunger for life that one saw there he had been down at the convalescent home recovering from some illness and the next day he was going back to his workwork which he hated which made him part of a machine you know how many millions there are who live and die like thatwho must always live and die like that they are part of the great system of the world and ninetenths of them are content  you set him free she murmured  i did rochester answered it was a mistake  you cannot tell she said i know that you mistrust him you are very very english dear henry and you have so little sympathy with those things which you do not understandwhich do come perhaps a little near what you call charlatanism still though you may deny it as much as you like there are many many things in the worldthings even in connection with our daily lives which are absolutely wonderfully mysterious there are new things to be learned henry bertrand saton may be a selfdeceiver he may even deserve all the hard things you can say of him but there are cleverer people than you and i who do not think so  dear rochester answered i did not bring you here to talk of bertrand saton to tell you the truth he added i even hate to hear his name upon your lips  there was no time for her to answer from the shadow of the rock against which they leaned he rose with a subtle alertness which seemed somehow a little uncannyas though indeed he had risen from under the ground upon which they stood  i heard my name he said forgive me if i am interrupting you i had no wish to play the eavesdropper  pauline took a quick step backwards even in that tense moment of surprise rochester found himself able to notice the color fading from her cheeks he turned upon the newcomer and there was something like fury in his tone  what the devil are you doing here saton he asked  satons tone was almost apologetic  i did not know he said that i was forbidden to walk upon your lands i am often here and this is my favorite hour  rochester laughed a little harshly  you like to come back he said you like to sit here perhaps and think well i do not envy you you sat here and thought years ago you built a house of dreams here unless you lied you come here now perhaps to compare it with the house of gewgaws which you have built and in which you dwell  saton did not for a moment shrink in his heart he felt that it was one of his inspired moments there was confidence alike in his bearing and in his gentle reply  why not he asked why should you take it for granted that there is so much amiss in my life that i have fallen so far away from those dreams it may not be so he continued remember that the man who lives and comes a little nearer toward knowledge has nothing to be ashamed of it is the man who lives and eats and drinks and sleeps and knows no more when his head presses the pillow at night than when the sun woke him in the morning it is that man who is ignoble you have spoken of the past he added turning face to face with rochester once more i will remind you of your own words the only crime in life is failure if the crash comes and the pieces lie around you swim out to sea too far and sink beneath the waves forever wasnt that your advice not your exact words perhaps but wasnt that what you told the boy who sat here and dreamed  rochester shrugged his shoulders slightly  youth he said may be forgiven much manhood must accept its own responsibilities  saton smiled grimly  always the same he said all the time you play with the truth rochester as though it were a glass ball committed into your keeping and yours alone dont you know that the one inspired period of life is youthyouth before it is sullied with experience youth which knows everything fears nothingyouth which has the eyes of the clairvoyant  rochester frowned  your tongue goes glibly tonight he remarked talk to the shadows my friend lady marrabel and i are going  i did not bid you come saton answered this is my spot and my hour it was you who intruded  the fact that this is my property rochester began gently  is of no consequence saton answered you may buy the earth upon which we stand but you cannot buy the person whose feet shall press it or the thoughts that rise up from it or the words that are breathed from it or the hopes and passions which go trembling from it to the skies go away and jog homeward behind your fat pony but  well sir rochester asked turning suddenly  satons eyes did not meet his they were fixed upon paulines and pauline was as white as death  take her too if you will saton said slowly take her too if she will go  i am going this instant pauline cried with a sudden nervous passion in her tone come henry come away i hate this place come away quickly  rochester caught her hand it was cold as a stone she was pale and she commenced to tremble  take her saton said if she will go take her because you are strong and she is weak lead her by the arm guide her as you will only be sure that you leave nothing with me  he sat down upon the rock and with folded arms looked away from themeven as though they had not existedacross to the world of shadows and vague places rochester passed his arm through paulines and led her down the hill her hands were cold she seemed to lift her feet as though they had been of lead she did not look at him always she looked ahead she moved slowly and heavily when he spoke her lips answered him languidly rochester felt an intense and passionate anger burning in his veins the vague disquiet of an hour ago had settled down into something definite she was his no longer something had come between them even though he might take her into his arms might hold her there and dare anyone in the world to take her from him it was her body only the shadow of herself somethingsome part of her seemed to have flitted away he asked himself with a sudden cold horror whether indeed it had remained by the side of that silent figure blotted out now from sight who sat upon the rocks while the darkness fell about him     chapter xxiv  lois is obedient   lois and her companion stopped on the summit of the hill to look at the rolling background of woods brilliant still with their autumn coloring the west wind had blown her hair into disorder but it had blown also the color back into her cheeks her eyes were bright and her laughter infectious her companion stooped down and passed his arm through hers looking into her face admiringly  lois he said this is the first day i have seen you like your old self i cant tell you how glad i am  she smiled  i wasnt aware maurice she said that i have been very different i have had headaches now and then lately fancy having a headache an afternoon like this she added throwing back her head once more and breathing in the fresh invigorating air  you ought to have seen a doctor her companion declared i told lady mary so the other day  rubbish lois exclaimed lightly  nothing of the sort captain vandermere replied i was beginning to worry about you i almost fancied  well  it almost seemed he continued a little awkwardly as though you had something on your mind you seemed so queer every now and then little girl he added i do hope that if there was anything bothering you youd tell me all about it were old pals you know  she laughednot quite naturally  my dear maurice she said of course there has been nothing of that sort the matter with me what could i have on my mind  no love affairs eh he asked stroking his fair moustache  she shook her head thoughtfully  no she said no love affairs  he tightened his grasp upon her arm he had an idea that he was being very diplomatic indeed and lady mary had begged him to find out whatever was the matter with poor dear lois  well he said i am glad to hear it to tell you the truth i have been very jealous lately  you jealous she exclaimed mockingly  fact i assure you he answered  captain maurice vandermere jealous she repeated looking up at him with dancing eyesabsolutely the most popular bachelor in london and jealous of me too  is that so very wonderful lois he asked we have been pretty good friends you know  she felt his hand upon her arm and she looked away  yes she said we have been friends only we havent seen much of one another the last month or so have we  it hasnt been my fault he declared i really couldnt get leave before although i tried hard i shouldnt have been here now to tell you the truth lois he went on but lady marys been frightening me a bit  about me lois asked  about you he assented  what has she been saying  well nothing definite captain vandermere answered but of course you know shes an awful good pal of mine and she did write me a line or two about you it seems theres some young fellow been about down here whom she isnt very stuck on and she seemed to be afraid  well go on lois said calmly  well that he was making the running with you a bit captain vandermere declared feeling that he was getting into rather deeper waters of course i dont know anything about him and i dont want to say anything against anybody who is a friend of yours but from all that i have heard he didnt seem to me to be the sort of man i fancied for my little friend lois to getwell fond of  so you decided to come down yourself lois continued  i decided to come down and say something which i ought to have said some time ago captain vandermere continued only you see you are really only a child and youve got a lot more money than i have and you are not of age yet so i thought id let it be for a bit but you know im fond of you lois  are you she asked artlessly  you must know that he continued bending over her i wonder  are you aware that we are standing on the top of a hill lois said and that everybody for a good many miles round has a perfectly clear view of us  i dont care where we are he declared i have got to go on now lois will you marry me  is this a proposal she laughed nervously  sounds like it he admitted  she was silent for several moments into her eyes there had come something of that look which had sent lady mary into her room to write to captain vandermere and bid him come without delay the color had gone she seemed suddenly oldertired  oh i dont know she said i think i should like to but i cantno i cant  they began to descend the hill he kept his arm in hers  why not he asked dont you care for me  ii dont know she answered i dont know whether i care for anybody wait please dont speak to me for several moments  their path skirted the side of a ploughed field and then through a little gate they passed into a long straggling plantation directly she was under the shelter of the trees she burst into tears  dont come near me she begged leave me alone for a moment i shall be better directly  he disregarded her bidding to the extent of placing his arm around her waist he made no attempt however to draw her hands away from her face or stop her tears  little girl he said i knew that there was some trouble it is there in your dear innocent little face for anyone to see who cares enough about you to look when you have dried those eyes you must tell me all about it remember that even if you wont have me for a husband we are old enough friends for you to look upon me as an elder brother  she dried her eyes and looked up at him with a hopeless little smile  you are a dear she said and i am very fond of you i dont know whats happened to meat least i do know but i cant tell anyone  is it he asked gravely that you care about this person  oh i dont know she answered i hope not i dont know im sure sometimes i feel that i do and sometimes when i am sane when i am in my right mind i know that i do not maurice she begged help me please help me  his face cleared  ill help you right enough little girl he answered just listen to me im not going to see you throw yourself away upon an outsider just remember that on the other hand im not going to bother you to death here i am by your side and here i mean to stay if thatno i wont call him names he said stopping short in his sentencebut if anyone tries to make you unhappy well i shall have something to say come along lets finish our walk well talk about something else if you like  she drew a little sigh of relief  you are a dear maurice she repeated come along well go down the lane and over the hills home i do feel safe somehow with you she added impulsively you are not going away just yet are you  not for a fortnight at any rate he answered  and you wont leave me alone she beggednot even if i ask to be left alone you seei cant make you understandbut i dont even trust myself  he laughed reassuringly  ill look after you never fear he answered ill be better than a watchdog tell me whats your handicap at golf now we must have a game tomorrow  they walked down the lane talkingin a somewhat subdued manner perhaps but easily enoughupon lighter subjects and then at the corner just as they had passed the entrance to blackbirds nest they came face to face with saton vandermere felt her suddenly creep closer to him as though for protection and from his six feet odd of height he frowned angrily at the young man with his hat in his hand preparing to accost them never was dislike more instinctive and hearty vandermere an ordinarily intelligent but unimaginative englishman of the normally healthy type a sportsman a good fellow and a man of breedingand saton this strange product of strange circumstances externally passable enough but with something about him which seemed even in that clear november sunshine to suggest the footlights  you are quite a stranger miss champneyes saton said taking her unresisting hand in his i hope that you are going in to see the comtesse only this morning she told me that she was finding it appallingly lonely  ii wasnt calling anywhere this afternoon lois said timidly captain vandermere has come down to stay with us for a few days and i was showing him the country this is mr satoncaptain vandermere i dont know whether you remember him  the two men exchanged the briefest of greetings satons was civil enough vandermeres was morose almost discourteous  let me persuade you to change your mind saton said speaking slowly and with his eyes fixed upon lois the comtesse would be so disappointed if she knew that you had passed this way and had not entered  vandermere was conscious that in some way the girl by his side was changed she drew a little away from him  very well she said i shall be pleased to go in and see her you do not mind maurice  not at all he answered if i may be allowed i will come with you  there was a moments silence then saton spokequietly regretfully  i am so sorry he said but the comtesse de vestingesmy adopted mother he explained with a little bowreceives no one she is old and her health is not of the best a visit from miss champneyes always does her good  lois looked up at her companion  perhaps she said you will have a cigarette in the lane  i am sorry to seem inhospitable saton said smoothly if captain vandermere will come up to the house my study is at his service and i can give him some cigarettes which i think he would find passable  thank you vandermere answered a little gruffly ill wait out here remember lois he added turning towards her that we are expected home to play bridge directly after tea  i will not be long she answered  she moved off with saton turning round with a little farewell nod to vandermere as they passed through the gate he took a quick step towards her was it his fancy or was there indeed appeal in the quick glance which she had thrown him then directly afterwards while he hesitated he heard her laugh reluctantly he gave up the idea of following them and swinging himself onto a gate sat watching the two figures climbing the field toward the house     chapter xxv  a last warning   the laugh which checked vandermere in his first intention of following lois and saton up the field was scarcely a mirthful effort saton had bent toward his companion and his tone had been almost threatening  you must not look at anyone like that while i am with you he said you must not look as though you were frightened of me you must seem amused you must laugh  she obeyed it was a poor effort but it sounded natural enough in the distance  come saton continued you are not very kind to me lois you are not very kind to the man whom you are going to marry whom you have said that you love it has been very lonely these last few days lois you have not come to me i have watched for you often  i could not come she answered lady mary has been with me all the time i think that she suspects  surely you are clever enough he answered to outwit a little simpleton like that has rochester been interfering  if he knew that i even spoke to you she answered i think that he would send me away  it is not kind of them he said to be so bitter against me  she shrank from him  if they knew she said if they only knew that i even thought of marrying you oror  saton shrugged his shoulders  ah well he said they know as much as it is well for them to know after all you see no harm has happened to your guardian i saw him today on his way home from hunting he looked strong and well enough tell me lois he continued has he had any visitors from london the last few days i dont mean guestsi mean people to see him on business  not that i know of she answered why  satons face darkened  it is he i am sure he said who is interfering in my concerns never mind lois we will not talk about that dear give me your hand we are engaged you know you should be glad to have these few minutes with me  her fingers which he clasped were like ice he was puzzled at her attitude  a month ago he said softly you did not find it such a hardship to spend a little time alone with me  a month ago she answered i had not seen you on your knees with a gun seen your white face heard the report and seen mr rochester fall i had not seen you steal away through the bracken oh it was terrible you looked like a murderer i shall never never forget it  he laughed softly  these things are fancies he saiddreams you will forget them my dear lois you will forget them very soon  they entered the house and in the hall he drew her into his arms she wrenched herself free and crouched back in the corner with her hands stretched out in front of her face  dont she cried dont if you kiss me i shall go mad cant you see that i dont want to come with you that i dont want to be with you you shall let me go you must let me go  he stood frowning a few feet away to tell the truth he was honestly puzzled at her attitude at last with a little shrug of the shoulders he threw open the door of the sittingroom  rachael he said lois has come to see you for a few minutes  lois went timidly into the room rachael with a shawl around her shoulders was sitting in front of a huge fire she turned her head and held out her long withered hand as usual covered with rings  sit opposite me child let me look at you  lois sat down gazing with fascinated eyes at the woman whose presence she found almost as terrifying as the presence of saton himself  my soni call bertrand my son she said because i have adopted him and because everything i have even my name if he will have itwill be hismy son then tells me that he has not seen you for several days  it is very difficult lois said trembling  why rachael asked  my guardian mr rochester does not allow bertrand to come to the house lois said hesitatingly and lady mary tries not to let me come out alone  rachael nodded her head slowly her eyes glittered in the firelight wrapped in her black shawl she looked like some quaint effigysomething scarcely human  your guardian and his wife she said are foolish ignorant people they do not understand such men as bertrand you will understand him child you will know him better when he is your husband know him better and be proud of him is it not so  ii suppose so lois said  i am glad that you came this afternoon rachael continued bertrand and i have been talking we think it well that you should be married very soon  i am not of age lois said breathlessly  it does not matter rachael declared your guardian can keep back your money but that is of no consequence it will come to you in time and bertrand has plenty himself i am afraid that they might try and tempt you to be faithless to my son you are very young and impressionable and though i do not doubt but that you are fond of him it is not easy to be faithful when you are alone and with such people as mr rochester and lady mary i am going to london in a few days i think it would be well if you went with me bertrand could get a special license and you could be married at once  no she shrieked no no  rachael said nothing her lips moved but no sound came only her eyes flashed unutterable things  upon the somewhat hysterical silence came the sound of satons voicecold decisive  lois he said what my mother has advised would make me very happy will you remember that i wish it will you remember that  yes she faltered  i shall make you a good husband he added coming a little nearer to her sinking on one knee by her side and taking her cold unresisting hands into his i shall make you a good husband and i think that you will be happy we cannot go on like this i only see you now by stealth it must come to an end  yes she faltered  next time we meet he continued i will tell you what plans we have made  she turned her head slowly and looked at him with frightened wideopen eyes  why she asked why do you want me to marry you you do not care for me you do not care for me at all is it because i am rich but youyou are rich yourselves i would offer you my money but you cannot want that  he smiled enigmatically  no he said money is a good thing but we have money ourselves dont you believe lois he added bending towards her that i am fond of you  oh yes she answered if you say so  of course i say so he declared i am very fond of you indeed or i should not want to marry you come i think that you had better say goodbye to my mother now your friend outside will be tired of waiting  she rose to her feet and he led her from the room they walked down the field side by side and lois felt her knees trembling she was white as a sheet and once she was obliged to clutch his arm for support as they neared the gate they saw that vandermere was talking to someone on horseback satons face darkened as he recognised the tall figure his first impulse was to stop but with lois by his side he saw at once that it was impossible with the courage that waits upon the inevitable he opened the gate and passed out into the lane  good afternoon miss champneyes he said holding out his hand it was very good of you to come in and visit the comtesse she is always so glad indeed to see you  the girls fingers lay for a moment icy cold within his then she turned with a little breath of relief to vandermere they walked off together  rochester signalled with his whip to saton to wait for a moment as soon as the other two were out of earshot he leaned down from his saddle  my young friend he said it seems to me that you are wilfully disregarding my warning  i was not aware saton answered that miss champneyes was a prisoner in your house nor do i see how i am to be held responsible for her call upon the comtesse  we will not bandy words rochester said i have no wish to quarrel with you but i want you always to remember the things which i have said lois champneyes is very nearly of age it is true but she remains a child by disposition and temperament as her guardian i want you to understand that i forbid you to continue your friendship or even your acquaintance with her  the quiet contempt of rochesters words stung saton into a moment of fury  what sort of a creature am i then he exclaimed that you should think me unworthy even to speak to your ward or to the women of your household you treat me as though i were a criminal or worse  rochester tapped his riding boot with the end of his whip saton watched him with fascinated eyes there seemed something a little ominous in the action in the sight of that gently moving whip held so firmly in the long sinewy fingers  what you are rochester said leaning a little down from his horse you know and i know let that be enough only remember that there comes a time when threats cease and actions commence and as sure as you and i are met here together this evening saton i tell you that if you offend again in this matter i shall punish you you understand  rochester swung his horse round and cantered down the lane saton stood looking after him with white angry face and clenched hands     chapter xxvi  the duchesss dinner party   the duchess welcomed the little party from beauleys in person and with more than ordinary warmth  i am glad to see you all of course she said but i am really delighted to see you about again henry do tell me now i have heard so many contradictory reports did you shoot yourself or was it one of your guests who did it i dont know how it is but poor ronald always says that the men one asks to shoot nowadays hit everything except the birds  my dear duchess rochester answered i certainly did not shoot myself i have every confidence in my guests and so far as we have been able to ascertain there wasnt another soul in the neighborhood shall we say that i was shot by the act of god there really doesnt seem to be any other explanation  the duchess was not altogether satisfied  tonight i am going to offer you a great privilege she said i am going to give you a chance of finding out the answer to your riddle  rochester looked perplexed and lady mary blandly curious pauline alone seemed as though by instinct to realize what lay beneath their hostesss words her face seemed suddenly to grow tense she shrank backa slight involuntary movement but significant enough under the circumstances  an answer to my riddle rochester remarked smiling really i did not know that i had propounded one  only a moment ago the duchess reminded him you spoke of being shot by the act of god that of course was a form of speech you meant that you did not know who did it perhaps we shall be able to solve that little mystery for you  rochester looked at his hostess as though for a moment he doubted her sanity tall and slim in his immaculate clothes standing before the great wood fire which burned in the open grate he leaned a little forward upon his stick with knitted brows then his eyes caught paulines and something which he was about to say seemed to die away upon his lips  of course you are unbelievers all of you the duchess said calmly but some dayperhaps even tonightyou may become converts did i tell you mary she continued turning away from rochester that i met that extraordinary man naudheim in london he told me so many interesting things and since then i have been reading he introduced me toto one of his most brilliant pupilsa young man he assured me whose insight was more highly developed even than his own of course you understand that in these matters insight and perception take the place almost of brains  my dear duchess rochester interrupted what are you talking about  the new science the duchess answered with a note of triumph in her tone you will learn all about it some day and you cannot begin too soon the young man whom professor naudheim spoke so highly of is dining here tonight curiously enough i found that he was almost a neighbor of both of ours  there was an instants silence pauline who was prepared was now perhaps the calmest of the trio rochesters face was dark with anger  you refer duchess i suppose he said  the duchess left him unceremoniously she took a step or two forward with outstretched hands the butler was announcing  mr saton                                       the dinner was as successful as the duchesss country dinners always were she herself a hostess of renown led the conversation at her end of the table like all women with a new craze she conscientiously did her best to keep it in the background and completely failed before the third course had been removed she was discussing occultism with the bishop of the diocese rochester from her other side listened with a thin smile she turned upon him suddenly  oh i know that youre an unbeliever she said youre one of those people who go through life doubting everything you shant have him for an ally bishop she said because your points of view are entirely different henry here doubts everything from his own existence to the vintage of my champagne you on the other hand she added turning toward her other companion are forced to disbelieve because you feel that any new power or gift that may be granted to us and which we discover for ourselves is opposed of course to your creed  it depends the bishop remarked upon the nature of that power  even in its elementary stages the duchess said there is no doubt that it is a power which can do a great deal for us towards solving the mysteries of existence personally i consider it absolutely and entirely inimical to any form of religious belief  why rochester asked quietly  because the duchess answered all the faith that has been lavished upon religion since the making of the world has been a misapplied force if it had been applied toward developing this new part of ourselves there is no doubt that so many thousands of years could never have passed without our entering the last and greatest chamber in the treasurehouse of knowledge  the bishop being a privileged guest and a cousin of his hostess deliberately turned his back upon her and escaped from the conversation the duchess looked past him towards saton who was sitting a few places down the table  there she exclaimed i have been braver than even you could have been  saton smiled  that sort of courage he remarked is the prerogative of your sex  you have heard what i said she continued dont you agree with me  of course he answered  he hesitated for a moment but the duchess was looking at him she evidently expected him to continue the subject  we are told he said slowly that there is no such thing as waste in the physical worldthat matter simply changes its form i suppose that is true enough and yet a change of form can be for the better or for the worse according to our caprices strictly speaking it is a waste when matter is changed for the worse it is very much like this i think with regard to the subject which you were just then discussing faith from our point of view is a very real and psychical force the faith which has been spent upon religion through all these ages seems to us very much like the tragedy of an unharnessed niagara  the duchess looked around her triumphantly she was chilled a little however by rochesters curling lip  dear hostess he whispered in her ear this sort of conversation is scarcely respectful to the bishop even though he be a relative you can let your young protégé expound his marvelous views after dinner  the duchess shrugged her ample shoulders  i wonder how it is she declared a little peevishly that directly one sets foot in the country one seems to come face to face with the true briton what hypocrites we all are we are broad enough to discuss any subject under the sun in town but we seem to shrink into something between the philistine and the agricultural pedagogue as soon as we sniff the air of the ploughed fields  she rose a little pettishly and motioned to rochester to take her place  five minutes only she said you will find us all over the place the cigarettes and cigars are in the hall you can finish your wine here and come out  is there anything particular rochester asked grimly that we are permitted to talk about  with this crowd she whispered if i forbid politics and agriculture i dont think youll last the five minutes     chapter xxvii  the answer to a riddle   a few of the duchesss guests left earlythose who had to drive a long distance and who had not yet discarded their carriage horses for motorcars afterwards the party seemed to draw into a little circle and it was then that the duchess rising to her feet went over and talked earnestly for a few minutes with saton  some slight thing she begged anything to set these people wondering look at that old stick henry rochester for instance he believes nothingdoesnt want to believe anything give him a shock do  cant you understand duchess saton said how much harm we do to ourselves by any exhibition of the sort you suggest people are at once inclined to look upon the whole thing as a clever trick and go about asking one another how it is done  the duchess was disappointed and inclined to be pettish saton realized it and after a moments hesitation prepared to temporize  if it would amuse you he said and i can find anyone here to help me i daresay we could manage some thought transference all london seems to be going to see those two people at the alhambraor is it the empire you can see the same thing here if you like  the duchess beamed  that would be delightful she said whom would you like to help you  leave me alone for a minute or two saton said i will look around and choose somebody  the duchess stepped back into the circle of her guests  mr saton is going to entertain us in a very wonderful manner she announced  rochester who had been on his way to the billiard room came back  let us stay and see the tricks he remarked to the bishop who had been his companion  the duchess frowned saton shot a sudden glance at rochester a dull angry color burned in his cheeks  stay by all means mr rochester he said we may possibly be able to interest you  there was almost a challenge in his words rochester ignoring them save for his slightly uplifted eyebrows sat down by the side of pauline  the fellows cheek is consummate he muttered  i need saton remarked quietly what i suppose mr rochester would call a confederate i can only see one whom i think would be temperamently suitable will you help me he asked turning suddenly toward pauline  no rochester answered sternly lady marrabel will have nothing to do with your performance  rochester bit his lip the moment he had spoken he felt that he had made a mistake one or two of the guests looked at him curiously the duchess was literally openmouthed saton was smiling in a peculiar manner  in that case he remarked quietly if mr rochester has spoken with authority i fear that i can do nothing  the duchess was very nearly angry  dont be such an idiot henry she said of course pauline will help what is it you want her to do mr saton  nothing at all he answered except to sit in a corner of the room as far from me as possible and answer the questions which i shall ask her if she be able you will do that turning suddenly towards her  of course she will the duchess declared be quiet henry you are a stupid prejudiced person and i wont have you interfere  pauline rose to her feet  i am afraid she said that i can scarcely be of much use but of course i dont mind trying  saton was standing a little away with his elbow leaning upon the mantelpiece  if two of you he said helping himself to a cigarette and deliberately lighting it will take lady marrabel oversay to that oak chair underneath the banistersblindfold her and then leave her really i ought to apologize for what i am going to do everything is so very obvious still if it amuses you  pauline sat by herself the others were all gathered together in the far corner of the great hall saton turned to the bishop  this is only a repetition of the sort of thing which you have doubtless seen he said have you anything in your pocket which you are quite sure that lady marrabel knows nothing of  silently the bishop produced a small and worn greek testament saton opened it at random then he turned suddenly toward the figure of the woman sitting alone in the distance some change had taken place in his manner and in his bearing those who watched him closely were at once aware of it his teeth seemed to have come together the lines of his face to have become tense he leaned a little forward toward pauline  i have something in my hands he said i wonder if you can tell me what it is  there was no answer they listened and watched pauline never spoke already a smile was parting rochesters lips  i think lady marrabel saton said slowly that you can tell me if you will i think that you will tell me i think that you must  something that sounded almost like a halfstifled sob came to them from across the halland then paulines voice  it is a small book she saida testament  go on saton said  a greek testament pauline continued it is open atat the sixth chapter of st mark  saton passed it round the duchess beamed with delight upon everybody saton seemed only modestly surprised at the interest which everyone displayed  we are only doing something now he said which has already been done and proved easy the only trouble is of course that lady marrabel being a stranger to me the effort is a little greater if you will be content with one more test of this sort i will try if you like something differentsomething at any rate which has not been done in a musichall  a gold purse was passed to him with a small monogram inscribed again pauline slowly and even as though against her will described correctly the purse and its contents  saton brushed away the little murmurs of surprise and delight  come he said this is all nothing it reallyas you will all of you know in a few years timecan be done by any one of you who chooses seriously to develop the neglected part of his or her personality i should like to try something else which would be more interesting to you  the duchess turned towards him with clasped hands  cant you she said make her say how mr rochester met with his accident  there was a little thrill amongst everyone saton stood as though absorbed in thought  why not he said softly to himself  rochester laughed hardly  come he said we are getting practical at last let one thing be understood though if our young friend here is really able to solve this little mystery he will not object to my making use of his discovery  by no means saton answered but i warn you that if the person is one unknown to lady marrabel or myself i cannot tell you who it was all that i can do is perhaps to show you something of how the thing was done  it will be most interesting rochester declared  there was a subdued murmur of thrilled voices one or two looked at each other uneasily even the duchess began to feel a little uncomfortable saton was suddenly facing pauline he was standing a little nearer with the fingers of his right hand resting upon the round oak table which stood in the centre of the hall his figure had become absolutely rigid and the color had left his cheeks his voice seemed to them to come from some other person  listen he said bending even a little further toward the woman who was leaning forward now from her chair as though eager or compelled to hear what was being said to her a monthsix weekssome time ago you were with henry rochester a few minutes after his accident he was shotor he shot himself he was shot by design or by misadventure you were the first to find him you came round the corner of the wood and you saw him there lying upon the grass you heard a shot just beforetwo shots you came round the corner of the wood and you saw nothing except the body of henry rochester lying upon the ground  nothing she murmured nothing  there was an intense silence the little group of people were all leaning forward with eyes riveted upon pauline marrabel even rochesters expression had become a little tense  think again saton said there was only a corner of the wood between you and that field when the shot was fired you are walking there now now as the shots are fired bend forward you can see through those trees if you try i think that you do see through them  again he paused again there were a few seconds silencesilence save for the quick breathing of the duchess who was crumpling her lace handkerchief into a little ball in her hands  then paulines voice came to them  there is a gun laid against a gate which leads into the field she saida gun and by its side a bag of cartridges someone has been hiding behind the wall he has the gun in his hands he looks along the path there is no one coming  a woman from the little group of people commenced to sob softly paulines voice ceased someone put a hand over the mouth of the frightened woman  go on saton said  the man has the gun in his hand he goes down on his knees pauline continued the gun is pointed towards mr rochester there is a puff of smoke a report mr rochester has fallen down he is up again then he fallsyes he falls  saton passed his hand across his forehead  go on he said  the man is taking the cartridge from the gun pauline said he slips in another from the bag he has leaned the gun against the gate he is stealing away  saton leaned towards her till he seemed even about to spring  you could not see his face he said  there was no answer two of the women behind were sobbing now a third was lying back half unconscious rochester had risen to his feet the faces of all of them seemed suddenly to reflect a new and nameless terror  saton moved slowly towards pauline he moved unsteadily the perspiration now was standing in thick beads upon his forehead he suddenly realized his risk  you could not see his face he repeated you do not know who it was that fired that gun  i could not see his face she repeated but ii can see it now  you do not recognise it he said and his voice seemed to come tearing from his throat charged with some new and compelling quality you cannot recognise it you do not know whether you have ever seen it before  pauline rose suddenly to her feet her bosom was heaving her face was like a white mask her hands were suddenly thrown high above her head  illustration she swayed for a moment and fell over on her side  it is horrible she shrieked it was you who fired the gunyou  she swayed for a moment and fell over on her side like a dead womanher arms thrown out her limbs inert as though indeed it were death which had stricken her  rochester with a shout of anger sprang towards her sending saton reeling against the table he fell on his knees by her side  bring water some of you idiots he cried out ring the bell and dont let that cursed charlatan escape     chapter xxviii  spoken from the heart   pauline took the card from the hand of her servant and glanced at it at first with the idlest of curiosityafterwards with a fixed and steadfast attention as though she saw in those copperplate letters elegantly traced upon a card of superfine quality something symbolical something of far greater significance than the unexpected name which confronted her  i told you martin she said that i was at home to nobody except those upon the special list  i know it your ladyship the man answered but this gentleman has called every day for a week and i have refused even to bring his name in today he was so very persistent that i thought perhaps it would be better to bring his card  pauline was lying upon a couch she had been unwell for the last two or three weeks nothing seriousnerves she called it a doctor would probably have prescribed for her with a smile pauline knew better than to send for one she knew very well what was the matter she was afraid fear had come upon her like a disease the memory of that one night racked her stillthe memory of that and other things  meanwhile the servant stood before her in an attitude of respectful attention  i will see mr saton she decided at last you can show him in here and remember that until he has gone no one else is to be allowed to enter come yourself only if i ring the bell or when you serve tea  the man bowed and went back to where saton was waiting in the hall  her ladyship is at home sir he announced will you come this way  a certain drawn expression seemed suddenly to vanish from the young mans face he followed the servant almost blithely in a few seconds he was alone with her in the firelit drawingroom the door was closed behind him  pauline was sitting up on the couch for a moment they neither of them spoke she too had been suffering then he thought recognising the signs of illhealth in her colorless cheeks and languid pose  he came slowly across the room and held out his hand she hesitated and shook her head  no she said i do not think that i wish to shake hands with you mr saton i do not understand why you have come here i thought it best to see you and hear what you have to say once and for all  once and for all he repeated  certainly she answered it does not interest me to fence with words between us i think that it is not necessary what do you want with me  you know he answered calmly  she paused for a moment or two she told herself that this was the most transcendental of follies yet it seemed as though there were something electrical in the atmosphere as though something had come into the room unaccountable stimulating terrifying all the languor of the last few days was gone  am i to understand then she said at last speaking in a low tone and with her face averted from him that you have come to offer me some explanation of the events of that night  no he answered  the seconds ticked on she found his taciturnity maddening  your visit had some purpose she asked  i came to see you he answered  i am not well she said hurriedly i am not fit to see people or to talk at all i thought that you must have some special purpose in coming or i should not have received you  you wish to talk then about that night he asked  no she answeredand yet yes  she sat upright she looked him in the eyes  i have not dared to ask even myself this she said but since you are here since you have forced it upon me i shall ask you and you will tell me that night i hadwhat shall i call ita vision i saw you shoot henry rochester now you are here you shall tell me if what i saw was the truth  it was he answered  she drew back shuddering  but why she asked he has never done you any harm  on the contrary saton answered he is my enemy with all my heart and soul i wish him dead  it is terrible she murmured  it is the truth he answered the truth sometimes is terrible that is why people so often evade it listen i was only a boy a sentimental boy when i first knew rochester perhaps he has posed to you as my benefactor certainly he lent me money i tell you now though that upon every penny of that money was a curse whatever i did went wrong however hard i fought i was worsted if i gambled i lost if i played for safety somethingeven though it might be as unexpected as an earthquakecame to wreck my plans it was like playing cards with the devil himself one by one i lost the tricks when i was penniless i had nothing left to think of but the only piece of advice your friend henry rochester gave me when he sent me out into the world the sting of his voice was like a lash creatures of the gutter he called those who had failed and who dared to live on i tell you that until the time came when i looked down into the thames and hesitated whether or no i should take his cynical advice and make an end of myself every action every endeavor and every effort i had made had been honest it was his words and his words entirely which drove me into the other paths  you admit then she began  i admit nothing he answered yet i will tell you this there are things in my life which i loathe and they are there because of rochesters words yet bad though i am he continued bitterly that mans contempt is like a whip to me whenever i see him what in gods name is he because he has ancestors behind him good blood in his veins the tricks of a man of breeding the carriage and voice of a gentleman why in heavens name for these things should he look upon me as something crawling upon the face of the earthsomething to be spurned aside whenever it should cross his path i have lived and spoken falsehoods the greatest men in the world have lived and spoken falsehoods but i am not a charlatan i have mastered the rudiments of a great and mighty new science i am not a trickster i have a claim to live as he has there is a place in the world for me too as well as for him you know what he has told me you know with what he has threatened me he has told me that if he even sees you and me together that if i even dare to find my way into your presence that he will horsewhip me this because he has muscles and i have none yet you ask me why i desire to kill him i have had only one desire in my life stronger than that one thing in my life more intense than my hatred of this man  you are both in the wrong she said henry rochester is a straightliving godfearing man a little narrow in his views and a little violent in his prejudices you are a person such as he would not understand such as he never could understand you and he could never possibly come into sympathy he is wrong when he utters such threats yet you must remember that there is lois he has the right there to say what he will  there is lois yes saton repeated  you wish to marry her dont you she asked  the question seemed to madden him suddenly he threw aside the almost unnatural restraint with which he had spoken and acted since his entrance into the room he rose to his feet he stood before her couch with clenched hands with features working spasmodically as the words poured from his lips  listen he said i have no money i have lived partly upon the woman who adopted me and partly by nefarious means science is great it is fascinating it is the joy of my life but one must live i have tasted luxury i cannot live as a workingman the woman who adopted me is all the time at my elbow telling me that i must marry lois because of her money the child is willing i have been willing  to marry her for her moneyfor her money only pauline exclaimed with scorn trembling in her tone  absolutely for her money only saton answered now you know how poor a thing i am yet i tell you that all men have a bad spot in them i tell you that i am dependent upon that woman for every penny i spend and for the clothes i wear when i tell her that i will not marry lois champneyes she will very likely throw me into the street what is there left for me to do i have tried everything and failed i have no strength i have a cursed taste for the easy ways of life yet this has come to me i will not marry lois champneyes i will break with this woman notwithstanding all i owe to her and i will go away and work once more wherever i can earn enough to keep me and i will tell you why i havent a good quality that i know of i am as selfish as a man can be i am a murderer at heart an actor most of the time but in one thing i am honest i love you pauline marrabel i cant help it it is the curse of my life if you will but it is the joy of it rochester knows it and he hates me i know that rochester loves you and i hate him listen there is a man who believes in mea great man ill go to him ill work ill study ill write ill live the thoughts i want to live ill shape my life along the firm straight lines ill make a better thing of myself if youll wait mind i dont ask you to touch me now if you offered me your hands i wouldnt take them im not fit but there is just this one thing in me i know myself and i know you give me the chance to climb  time seemed to stand still while she looked at him yes he had been honest she saw him stripped of all the glamour of his unusual learning she saw him as he wassmall false a poor creature who having failed on the mountains had been content to crawl through the marshes he seemed in those few moments to be stripped bare to her he was not even a gentleman he wore his manners as he wore his clothes he belonged to her world no more than the servant who had announced him she clenched her fingers it was ignoble that her heart should be beating that the breath should come sobbing through her parted lips he was a creature to be despised  she raised her head and told him so fighting all the while with something greater and stronger which seemed to be tearing at her heart strings  if that is what you came here to say she said please go  he rose at once she saw the anxious light with which his eyes had been filled fade away he turned almost humbly toward the door  you are quite right he said i should not have come i do not often have impulses it is a mistake to listen to them yet i came because it was the one honest desire which i have had since i looked down into the water and turned away  he walked toward the door she stood with her finger pressing the bell he seemed somehow to have lost what little presence he had ever possessed his head was bowed he walked as one feeling for his way in the dark never once did he look round as he stood before the door her lips were suddenly parted a great wave of pity rose up from amongst those other things in her heart she would have called out to him but her butler was already there the door had been opened  she clenched her teeth and resumed her place upon the sofa she heard the front door closed and she found herself watching him through the blind she saw him cross the road very much as he had crossed the roomunseeing stricken she watched him until he crossed the corner of the square her eyes were misty with tears     chapter xxix  the courage of desperation   captain vandermere had a friend from the country and was giving him supper at the savoy he was also pointing out the different people who were worthy of note  that he said pointing to an adjoining table is really one of the most interesting men in london  he looks like an actor his friend remarked  so he may be vandermere answered grimly but his is not the thespian stage he is a lecturer and writer on occultism and in his way i suppose he is amazingly clever  do you mean bertrand saton his friend asked with interest  vandermere nodded  you have heard the fellows name of course he said for the last month or so one seems to meet him everywhere and in all sorts of society the illustrated papers and even the magazines have been full of the fellows photograph women especially seem to regard him as something supernatural look at the way they are hanging upon his words now that is the old duchess of ampthill on his left and the others are all decent enough people of a sort  i gather from your tone his friend remarked that the young man is not a favorite of yours  he is not vandermere answered i dont understand the breed and thats a fact apart from that he has had the confounded impertinence to make love toto a very charming young lady of my acquaintance  he isnt particularly goodlooking the friend remarkedstriking i suppose people would say  he has a sort of unwholesome way of attracting women vandermere remarked look how they all manoeuvre to walk out with him  saton was exercising his rights as lion of the party and leaving early the duchess whispered something in his ear at which he only laughed halfadozen invitations were showered upon him which he accepted conditionally  i never accept invitations he said except with a proviso as a matter of fact i never can tell exactly when i shall want to work and when the feeling for work comes everything else must go it is not always that one is in the right mood  how interesting one of the women sighed  must be like writing poetry only far more exciting another murmured  tell me a girl asked him as he stooped over her fingers to say good night is it really true mr saton that if you liked you could make me do things even against my willthat you could put ideas into my head which i should be forced to carry out  certainly  and you never make use of your power  very seldom he answered that is the chicanery of science it is because people when they have discovered a little are so anxious to exploit their knowledge that they never go any further it is very easy indeed to dominate the will of certain individuals but what we really want to understand before we use our power is the law that governs it good night once more  a wonderful man they sighed one to another as he passed out  i am one of the few the duchess remarked complacently who has seen a real manifestation of his powers it is true she added with a little shudder there was a mistake toward the end the experiment wasnt wholly successful but it was wonderful all the samewonderful                                       saton left the restaurant and entered the small electric brougham which was waiting for him he lit a cigarette and leaned back amongst the cushions musing over the events of the evening with a complacent smile the last few weeks seemed to have wrought some subtle change in the man his face was at once stronger and weaker more determined and yet in a sense less trustworthy his manner had gained in assertion his bearing in confidence there was an air of resolve about him as though he knew exactly where he was goinghow far and in what direction and with it all he had aged there were lines under his eyes and his face was wornat times almost haggard  he let himself into the little house in berkeley square with his latchkey and turned at once into rachaels room she was sitting over the fire in a brilliant red dressinggown her head elaborately coiffured her fingers and neck brilliant with jewels yet when she turned her head one saw a change age had laid its grip upon her at last her voice had lost its decision her hands trembled in her lap  you are late bertrand she saidvery late  not so very he answered i have been supping at the savoy with the duchess of ampthill and some friends  she looked at him searchingly looked at him from head to foot noted the trim exactness of his evening attire and his enamel links and waistcoat buttons the air of confidence with which he crossed the room to mix himself a whiskey and soda it was she who had been like that a few months ago and he the timid one they seemed to have changed places  bertrand she said you frighten me you go so far nowadays  why not he answered  huntley has been here tonight she went on he tells me that you have opened even another place and that all the old ones are going he tells me that the offices are hard at work too  business is good remarked saton drily  i thought that we were going quietly for a time she said it was you who were so terrified at the risk do you imagine that the danger is over  my dear rachael he answered coming over to her i have come to the conclusion that i was overtimid there is no success in life to be won without daring money we must have and these places are like a gold mine to us if things go wrong we must take our chance i am content in the meantime for all our sakes it suits me to be in evidence everywhere the papers publish my portrait the society journals record my name people point me out at the theatres and at the restaurants this is not vanitythis is business i am giving a lecture the week after next and every seat is already taken i am going to say some daring things afterwards i am going to naudheim for a month when i come back i shall give another lecture after that perhaps these places will not be necessary any more but who can tell money we must have money all the time science is great but men and women must live  she looked at him with a grim smile  you amuse me she said are you really the halfstarved boy who flung himself at my horses heads in the bois  i am what the fates have made of that boy  she shook her head  you are going too fast she said you terrify me what about lois  lois is of age in six weeks he replied on the day she is of age i shall go to rochester and demand her hand he will refuse of course i shall marry her at once  why not now rachael asked why wait a day the money will come later  i will tell you why saton answered because i have ambitions and because it would do them harm if people believed that i had exercised any sort of influence to make that girl marry me against her guardians wishes i do use my influence as it is although he added frowning i find it harder every day she walked with me in the park this morning she came to tea with me the day before  what do you mean when you say that you find it harder rachael asked  i mean that i have lost some of my hold over her he answered it is the sort of thing which is likely to happen at any time she has very weak receptive currents it is like trying to drive water with a sieve  you must not fail she muttered i am nervous these days i would rather you were married to lois and her money was in the bank and that these places were closed i start when the bell rings huntley himself said that you were rash  huntley is a fool saton answered let me help you upstairs rachael  he passed his arm around her affectionately and kissed her when they parted for the night then he came down to his little room and sat for a time at his desk piled with books and works of reference he brooded gloomily for several moments over what rachael had been saying a knock at the door made him start it was only a servant come to see to the fire but his hand had darted out toward a certain drawer of his desk when the servant had retired he opened it for a minute and looked in a small shining revolver lay there and a box of cartridges  your idea my friend rochester he muttered to himself     chapter xxx  a surprising request   the duchess of ampthill was giving a great dinnerparty at her house in grosvenor square she had found several new prodigies and one of them was performing in a most satisfactory manner he sat at her left hand and though unlike saton he had at first been shy the continual encouragement of his hostess had eventually produced the desired result his name was chalmers and he was the nephew of a bishop he had taken a double first at oxford and now announced his intention of embracing literature as a profession he wore glasses and he was still very young  there is no doubt at all he said in answer to a remark from the duchess that london has reached just that stage in her development as a city of human beings which was so fatal to some of her predecessors in preeminence some of those ancient cities of which there exists today only the name the blood in her arteries is no longer robust already the signs of decay are plentiful  i wonder rochester inquired what you consider your evidences are for such a statement to a poor outsider like myself for instance london seems to have all the outward signs of an amazingly prosperousone might almost say a splendidly progressive city  chalmers smiled it was a smile he had cultivated when contradicted at the union and he knew its weight  from a similar point of view he said as yours mr rochester rome and athens nineveh and those more ancient cities presented the same appearance of prosperity yet if you ask for signs there are surely many to be seen i am anxious he continued gazing around him with an air of bland enjoyment to avoid anything in the nature of an epigram there is nothing so unconvincing so stultifying to ones statements as to express them epigrammatically people at once give you credit for an attempt at intellectual gymnastics which takes no regard to the truth i will not therefore weary you with a diatribe upon the condition of that heterogeneous mass which is known today as society i will simply point out to you one of the portents which has inevitably heralded disaster i mean the restless searching everywhere for new things and new emotions our friend opposite he said bowing to saton will forgive me if i instance the almost passionate interest in this new science which he is making brave efforts to give to the world a lecture today from mr bertrand saton would fill any hall in london and why simply because the people know that he will speak to them of new things look at this man father cresswell there is no building in this great city which would hold the crowds who flock to his meetings and why simply because he has adopted a new tonebecause in place of the old methods he stands in his pulpit with a lash and wields it like a russian executioner  lady mary interrupted him suddenly from her place a little way down the table  oh i dont agree with you she said indeed i think you are wrong the reason why people go to hear father cresswell is not because he has anything new to say or any new way of saying it the real reason is because he has the gift of showing them the truth you can be told things very often and receive a great many warnings but you take no notice there is something wrong about the method of delivering them it is not the lash which father cresswell uses but it is his extraordinary gift of impressing one with the truth of what he says that has had such an effect upon everyone  rochester looked across at his wife curiously it was almost the first time that he had ever heard her speak upon a serious subject now he came to think of it he remembered that she had been spending much of her time lately listening to this wonderful enthusiast was he really great enough to have influenced so light a creature he wondered certainly there was something changed in her he had noticed it during the last few daysan odd sort of nervousness a greater kindness of speech an unaccustomed gravity her remark set him thinking  chalmers leaned forward and bowed to lady mary again the shadow of a tolerant smile rested upon his lips  very well lady mary he said i will accept the truth of what you say yet a few decades ago who cared about religion or hearing the truth it is simply because the men and women of society have exhausted every means of selfgratification that in a sort of unwholesome reaction they turn towards the things as far as possible removed from those with which they are surfeited but i will leave father cresswell alone i will ask you whether it is not the bizarre the grotesque in art which today wins most favor i will turn to the making of booksi avoid the term literatureand i will ask you whether it is not the extravagant the impossible the deformed in style and matter which is most eagerly read the simplest things in life should convince one the novelists hero is no longer the fine handsome young fellow of twenty years ago he is something between forty and fifty if not deformed at least decrepit with dissipations and with the gift of fascination whatever that may mean in place of the simpler attributes of a few decades ago and the heroinethere is no more bookmuslin and innocence she has as a rule green eyes she is middleaged and if she has not been married before she has had her affairs everything obvious in life from politics to muttonchops is absolutely barred by anyone with any pretensions to intellect today  one wonders rochester murmured how in the course of your long life mr chalmers you have been able to see so far and truthfully into the heart of things  chalmers bowed  mr rochester he said it is the newcomer in life as in many other things who sees most of the game  the conversation drifted away rochester was reminded of it only when driving home that night with his wife again as they took their places in the electric brougham he was conscious of something changed not only in the woman herself but in her demeanor towards him  do you mind he asked soon after they started just dropping me at the club it is scarcely out of your way and i feel that i need a whiskey and soda and a game of billiards to take the taste of that young mans talk out of my mouth what a sickly brood of chickens the duchess does encourage to be sure  i wonder if youd mind not going to the club tonight henry lady mary asked quietly  he turned toward her in surprise  why certainly not he answered have we to go on anywhere  she shook her head  no she said only i feel id like to talk to you for a little time if you dont mind its nothing very much she continued nervously twisting her handkerchief between her fingers  ill come home with pleasure rochester interrupted dont look so scared he added patting the back of her hand gently you know very well if there is any little trouble i shall be delighted to help you out  she did not remove her hand but she looked out of the window what she wanted to say seemed harder than ever and after all was it worth while it would mean giving up a very agreeable side to life it would meanher thoughts suddenly changed their course once more she was sitting upon that very uncomfortable bench in the great city hall once more she felt that curious new sensation some answering vibration in her heart to the wonderful passionate words which were bringing tears to the eyes not only of the women but of the men by whom she was surrounded no it was not an art thisa trick no acting was great enough to have touched the hearts of all this time and sinhardened multitude it was the truthsimply the truth  it isnt exactly a little thing henry ill tell you about it when we get home                                       no it was no little thing rochester thought to himself as he stood upon the hearthrug of her boudoir and listened to the woman who sat on the end of the sofa a few feet away as she talked to him sometimes her eyes were raised to hiseyes whose color seemed more beautiful because of the tears in them sometimes her head was almost buried in her hands but she talked all the timean odd disconnected sort of monologue half confession half appeal there was little in it which seemed of any great moment and yet to rochester it was as though he were face to face with a tragedy this woman was asking him much  i know so well she said what a useless frivolous miserable sort of life mine has been and i know so well that i havent made the least attempt henry to be a good wife to you that wasnt altogether my fault was it she asked pleadingly do tell me that  it was not your fault at all he answered gravely it was part of our arrangement  i am afraid she said that it was a very unholy a very wicked arrangement only you see i was badly brought up and it seemed to me so natural such an excellent way of providing a good time for myself to marry you and to owe you nothing except one thing henry you will believe this i know i have flirted very badly and i have had many of those little loveaffairs which every woman i know indulges insilly little affairs just to pass away the time and to make one believe that one is living but i have never really cared for anybody and these little follies although i suppose they are such a waste of emotion and truthfulness and real feeling havent amounted to very much henry you know what i mean it is so difficult to say but you believe that  i believe it from my soul he answered  you see she went on it seemed to me all right because there was no one to point out how foolish and silly it was to play ones way through life as though it were a nursery and we children and to forget that we were grownup and that we were getting older with the years you have been quite content without me henry she asked looking up at him wistfully  yes i have been content he admitted looking away from her looking out of the room i have been content after a fashion  ours was such a marriage of convenience she went on and you were so very plainspoken about it henry i feel somehow as though i were breaking a compact when i turn round and ask you whether it is not possible that we might be perhaps some day a little more to one another you know why i am almost afraid to say this it has not been with you as it has been with me i have always felt that she has been therepauline  she was tearing little bits from the lace of her handkerchief her eyes sought his fearfully  dont think when i say that she continued that i say it with any idea of blaming you you told me that you loved pauline when we were engaged and of course she was married then and one did not expectit never seemed likely that she might be free and now she is free lady mary went on with a little break in her voice and i am here your wife and i am afraid that you love her still so much that what i am saying to you must sound very very unwelcome tell me henry is that so  rochester was touched it was impossible not to feel the sincerity of her words he sank on one knee and took her hands in his  mary he said this is all so surprising i did not expect it we have lived so long and gone our own ways and you have seemed until just lately so utterly content that i quite forgot that anywhere in this butterfly little body there might be such a thing as a soul will you give me time dear  all the time you ask for she answered oh i know that i am asking a great deal but you see i am not a very strong person and if i give up everything else i do want someone to lean on just a little you are very strong henry she added softly  he took her face between his hands and he kissed her without passion yet kindly even tenderly  my dear he said i must think this thing out at any rate we might start by seeing a little more of one another  yes she answered shyly i should like that  i will drive you down to ranelagh tomorrow he said alone and we will have lunch there  i shall love it she answered good night  she kissed him timidly and flitted away into her room with a little backward glance and a wave of the hand rochester stood where she had left him watching the place where she had disappeared with the look in his eyes of a man who sees a ghost     chapter xxxi  between love and duty   rochesters hansom set him down in cadogan street just as a new and very handsome motorcar moved slowly away from the door his face darkened as he recognised saton leaning back inside and he ignored the others somewhat exaggerated and half ironical greeting  lady marrabel is at home he asked the butler who knew him well  the man hesitated  she will see you no doubt sir he remarked we had our orders that she was not at home this afternoon  the gentleman who has just left rochester began  mr saton the butler interrupted he has been with lady marrabel for some time  rochester found himself face to face with pauline but it was a somewhat grim smile with which he welcomed her  still fascinated i see by the new science my dear pauline he said i met your professor outside he has a fine new motorcar i imagine that after all he has discovered the way to extract money from science  pauline shrugged her shoulders  those are matters which do not concern me she saidi might add do not interest me you are the only man i know who disputes mr satons position and you are wrong he is wonderfully marvelously gifted  rochester bowed slightly  perhaps he said i judge the man and not his attainments  you are very provincial she declared but come dont let us quarrel you did not come here to talk about mr saton  no rochester answered i had something else to say to you  his tone excited her curiosity she looked at him more closely and realized that he had indeed come upon some mission  well she said what has happened is it  she broke off in her sentence rochester stood quite still as though passionately anxious to understand the meaning of that interrupted thought  it is about mary he said  yes pauline whispered go on go on please  it is something quite unexpected rochester said slowlysomething which i can assure you that her conduct has never at any time in any way suggested  she wants to leave you pauline asked breathlessly  on the contrary rochester said she wants what she has never asked for or expectedsomething in fact which was not in our marriage bond she has been going to this man father cresswells meetings she is talking about our duty about making the best of one another  pauline was amazed certainly no thought of this kind had ever entered into her head  do you mean she said that mary wants to give up her silly little flirtations and turn serious  that is exactly what she says rochester answered i dont believe she has the least idea that what she proposes comes so near to tragedy  what have you answered pauline asked  we have established a probationary period he said we have agreed to see a little more of one another i drove her down to ranelagh yesterday afternoon and we are going to dine together tonight what am i to do pauline i have come to ask you we must decide it together you and i  she leaned a little forward in her chair her hands were clasped together her eyes were fixed on vacancy  it is a thunderbolt she murmured  it is amazing  you must go back to her  rochester drew a little breath between his teeth  do you know what this means he asked  yes i know she answered and yet it is inevitable what have you and i to look forward to sometimes i think that it is weakness to see so much of one another  i am afraid rochester said slowly that i would sooner have you for my dear friend than be married to any woman who ever lived  i wonder she said softly i wonder you yourself she continued have always held that there is a certain vulgarity a certain loss of fine feeling in the consummation of any attachment the very barrier between us makes our intercourse seem sweeter and more desirable  and yet he declared leaning a little toward her there are times when nature will be heardwhen one realizes the great call  you are right she answered softly that is the terrible part of it all you and i may never listen to it we have to close our ears to beat our hands and hide when the time comes  and is it worth while i wonder he asked what do we gain  she held out her hand  dont henry she saiddont especially now be thankful rather that there has been nothing in our great friendship which need keep you from your duty  you mean that he asked hoarsely  you know that i mean it she answered you know that it must be  he rose to his feet and walked to the window he remained there standing alone for several minutes when he came back something had gone from his face he moved heavily he had the air of an older man  pauline he said you send me away easily let me tell you one of the hard thoughts i have in my mindone of the things that has tortured me i have fanciedi may be wrongbut i have fancied that during the last few months you have been slipping away from me i have felt it somehow there has been nothing tangible and yet i have felt it answer me honestly is this true is what i have told you after all something of a relief  she answered him volubly almost hysterically her manner was absolutely foreign he listened to her protestations almost in bewilderment  it is not true henry you cannot mean what you are saying i have always been the same i am the same now what could alter me you dont believe that anything could alter me  or any person he asked  or any person she repeated hastily go through the list of our acquaintances if you will have i ever shown any partiality for anyone you cannot honestly believe that i have not been faithful to our unwritten compact  sometimes he said slowly i have had a horrible fear pauline i want you to be kind to me this has been a blow i cannot easily get over it let me tell you this one of the reasonsthe great reasonwhy i fear and dread this coming change is because it may leave you more susceptible to the influence of that person  you mean mr saton she said  i do rochester answered perhaps i ought not to have mentioned his name perhaps i ought not to have said anything about it but there the whole thing is if i thought that any part of your interest in the mans scientific attainments had become diverted to the man himself i should feel inclined to take him by the neck and throw him into the serpentine  she said nothing her face had become very still almost expressionless rochester felt his heart turn cold  pauline he said before i go you will have to tell me that what i fear could not come to pass perhaps you think that i insult you in suggesting it this young man may be clever but he is not of our worldyours and mine he is a poseur with borrowed manners flamboyant a quack medicine man of the market place he isnt a gentleman or anything like one i am not really afraid pauline and yet i need reassurance  you have nothing to fear she answered quietly i am sorry henry but i cannot discuss mr saton with you yet dont think i am blind i know that there is truth in all you say sometimes little things about him set my very teeth on edge  rochester drew a sigh of relief  so long as you realize this he said so long as you understand i have no fear  pauline looked away with a queer little smile upon her lips how little a man understood even the woman whom he cared for  henry she said i can only do this i can give you my hands and i can wish you happiness go on with your experimenti gather that for the moment it is only an experiment  that is all he answered  when it is decided one way or the other she continued you must come and tell me please go away now i want to be alone  rochester kissed her hands and passed out into the street he had a curious and depressing conviction that he was about to commence a new chapter of his life     chapter xxxii  at the edge of the precipice   naudheims disapproval was very marked and evident he scoffed at the great bowl of pink roses which stood upon the writingtable he pushed scornfully on one side the elegantly shaped inkstand with its burden of pens the blottingpad with its silver edges the piles of creamlaid foolscap most of all he looked with scornful disapprobation at his young host  saton was attired for his morning walk in the park during the last few weeksor months perhapsa touch of foppishness had crept into his dressa fondness for gray silk ties a flower in his buttonhole white linen gaiters drawn carefully over his patent boots certainly the contrast between this scrupulously dressed young man and naudheim bordered upon the absurd naudheim was shabby unbrushed unkempt his collar was frayed he wore no tie the seams of his long black frockcoat had been parted and inked over and parted again he wore carpet slippers and untidy socks there were stains upon his waistcoat  from underneath his shaggy gray eyebrows he shot a contemptuous glance at his host  my young friend he said you are growing too fine i cannot work here  nonsense saton answered a little uneasily you can sweep all those things off the writingtable if they seem too elaborate for you and pitch the flowers out of the window if you like  bah naudheim answered it is the atmosphere i smell it everywhere this is not the house for thoughts this is not the house wherein one can build my young friend you have fallen away you are like all the others you listen to the tin music  i think saton answered that the work which i have done should be my answer to you we are not all made alike if i find it easier to breathe in an atmosphere such as this then that is the atmosphere which i should choose we do our best work amidst congenial surroundings you in your den and i in my library can give of our best  naudheim shook his head  you are a fool he said as for your work it is clever fatally clever when i read what you sent me last month and saw how clever it was i knew that you were falling away that is why i came now i have come i understand listen the secrets of science are won only by those who seek them like children who in the time of trouble flee to their mothers arms never a mistress in the worlds history has asked more from man than she has asked or has had more to give she asks your life your thoughts your passionsevery breath of your body must be a breath of desire for her and her alone you think that you can strut about the world a talking doll pay court to women listen to the voices that praise you smirk your way through the days and all the time climb my young friend no i tell you no dont interrupt me i am going to speak my say and go  go saton repeated impossible i am willing to work i will work now i simply thought that as the morning was so fine we might walk for a little time in the sunshine but that is nothing  naudheim shook his head  not one word do i speak of those things that are precious to me in this house he declared i tell you that its atmosphere would choke the life out of every thought that was ever conceived you may blind others even yourself young man he went on but i know you are a renegade you would serve two mistresses i am going  you shall not saton declared this is absurd come he added trying to draw his arm through his visitors we will go into another room if this one annoys you  naudheim stepped back he thrust saton away contemptuously he was the taller of the two by some inches and his eyes flashed with scorn as he turned toward the door  i leave this house at once he said i was a fool to come but i am not such a fool as you bertrand saton dont write or come near me again until your sham house and your sham life are in ruins and you yourself in the wilderness i may take you to my heart again then i cannot tell but today i loathe you you are a creature of no accounta foolish dazzled moth dont dare to ring your bells i need no flunkeys to show me the way to the door  naudheim strode out as a prophet of sterner days might have cast the dust of a pagan dancing hall from his feet saton for a moment was staggered his composure left him he walked aimlessly up and down the room swinging his gloves in his hand and muttering to himself  then rachael came in she walked with the help of two sticks she seemed gaunter and thinner than ever yet her eyes had lost little of their fire although they seemed set deeper in the caverns of her face  naudheim has gone she said what is wrong bertrand  naudheim is impossible saton answered he came in here to work this morning looked around the room and began to storm he objected to the flowers to the writingtable to me he has shaken the dust of us off his feet and gone back to his wretched cabin in switzerland  she leaned on her sticks and looked at him  on the face of the earth she said there does not breathe a fool like you  satons expression hardened  you too he exclaimed well go on  cant you understand the woman exclaimed her voice shaking that we are on the verge of a precipice do you read the papers there were questions asked last night in the house about what they called these fortunetelling establishments yet everything goes on without a changeby your orders i am told oh you fool huntley knows that he is being spied upon in bond street yesterday alone three detectives called at different times the thing cant go on the money that we should save ready to escape at the end you spend living like this and the girl loisyou are letting her slip out of your fingers  my dear rachael he answered in the first place there is not a thread of evidence to connect you or me with any one of these places or with huntleys office in the second place i am not letting lois slip out of my fingers she will be of age in three weeks time and on her birthday i am going to take her away from rochester whatever means i have to use and i am going to marry her at once you think that i am reckless well one must live remember that i am young and you are old i have no place in the world except the place i make for myself i cannot live in a pigsty amongst the snows like naudheim i cannot find the whole elixir of life in thoughts and solitude as he does there are other thingsother things for men of my age  you sail too near the wind you are reckless  perhaps i am he answered life in ten years time may very well become a stranger place to those who are alive and who have been taught the truth but life even as we know it today is strange enough rachael have you ever loved anyone  the woman seemed to become nerveless she sank into a chair  of the past i do not speak she saidi choose never to speak  he took up his hat  no he remarked one sees easily enough that there are things in your past rachael sometimes the memory may burn you see i am living through those days now the fire has hold of me and not all the knowledge i have won not all the dim coming secrets from before the face of which some day i will tear aside the veil not all the experiences through which i and i alone have passed can help me today so perhaps he added turning toward the door i am a little reckless  rachael let him depart without uttering a word she turned in her chair to watch him cross the square he was drawing on his light kid gloves his silk hat was a mirror of elegance his goldheaded stick was thrust at exactly the right angle under his arm he swaggered a littlea new accomplishment and he had the air of one who is well aware that he graces the ground he treads upon  the woman looked away from him and with a slow painful movement her head drooped a little until it reached her hands a slight shiver seemed to pass through her body then she was still very still indeed it seemed to her that she could see the end     chapter xxxiii  you do not believe in me   saton deliberately turned into the park and sauntered along under the trees in the wake of a throng of fashionable promenaders he exchanged greetings with many acquaintances and here and there he stopped to say a few words he noted as usual and with a recurrence of his constant discontent the extraordinary difference in the demeanor of the women and the men of his acquaintance the former gracious and smiling accepted him without reservation their murmured words and smiles were even more than gracious on the other hand there was scarcely a man whose manner did not denote a certain tolerance not unmixed with contempt as though indeed they were willing to accept the fact that he was of their acquaintance but desired at the same time to emphasize the fact that he was outside the freemasonry of their classa freak whom they acknowledged on sufferance as they might have done a wonderful liontamer or a musichall singer or a steeplejack he knew very well that there was not one of them who accepted his qualifications notwithstanding the approval of their womankind and the knowledge stung him bitterly  presently he came face to face with lois walking with vandermere his face darkened for a moment he had expressed his desire that she should see as little of this young man as possible and here they were not only walking together but laughing and talking with all the easy naturalness of old acquaintanceship  saton drew a little breath of anger through his teeth as he paused and waited for them he recognised the terms of intimacy upon which they were he recognised that between them there was something which had never existed between lois and himself something which made their friendship a natural and significant thing it was the freemasonry of class again the magic ring against which he had torn his fingers in vain  they saw him the whole expression of the girls face changed all the animation seemed to leave her manner for a moment she clung instinctively to her companion afterwards she looked at him no more she came to saton at once and held out her hand without any show of reluctance yet wholly without spontaneity it was as though she was obeying orders from a superior  only this morning he said the comtesse was speaking of you lois she was so sorry that you had not been to see her lately  i will come this afternoon lois said quietly  vandermere who had frowned heavily at the sound of her christian name upon satons lips could scarcely conceal his anger at her promise  i have never had the pleasure he said of meeting the comtesse perhaps i might be permitted to accompany miss champneyes  you are very kind saton answered i am sorry but the comtesse is beginning to feel her age and she receives scarcely anyone i am afraid that the days are past when she would care to make new acquaintances  in any case vandermere said turning to his companion werent we going to hurlingham this afternoon  we were she said doubtfully but i think  she looked towards saton his face was inexpressive but she seemed to read there something which prompted her words  i think that we must put off hurlingham if you do not mind she said to vandermere i ought to go and see the comtesse  it is very kind of you saton said slowly she will i am sure be glad to see you  vandermere turned aside for a moment to exchange greetings with some acquaintances  lois saton said in a low tone you know i have told you that i do not like to see you so much with captain vandermere  i cannot help it she answered he is always at the house he is a great friend of mr rochesters besides she added raising her eyes to his i like being with him  you must consider also my likes and dislikes saton said think how hard it is for me to see you so very little  oh you dont care lois exclaimed tremulously you know very well that you dont care it is all pretence this why do you do it why do you make me so unhappy  no lois he answered it is not pretence i do care for you and in a very few weeks i am coming to fetch you away to make you my wife you will be glad then he went on you will be quite happy  vandermere turned back towards them he had heard nothing of their conversation but he saw that lois was white and he had hard work to speak calmly  come he said to lois i think we had better go on good morning mr saton  saton stood aside to let them pass he knew very well that lois would have stayed with him had he bidden it but he made no attempt to induce her to do so  till this afternoon he said taking off his hat with a little flourish  hang that fellow vandermere muttered as he looked at lois and saw the change in her why do you let him talk to you dear you dont like him i am sure that you do not why do you allow him to worry you  i think lois answered that i do like him oh i must like him maurice  yes he answered  dont let us talk about him he has gone away now come with me to the other end of the park let us hurry  saton walked on until he saw a certain mauve parasol raised a little over one of the seats a moment afterwards hat in hand he was standing before pauline  has he come she asked as he bent over her fingers  satons face clouded  yes he answered he came last night to tell you the truth he has just gone away in a temper i do not know whether he will return to the house or not  why she asked quickly  saton laughed to cover his annoyance  he does not approve of the luxury of my surroundings he answered he declined to write at my desk or to sit in my room  i dont wonder at it she answered you know how he worships simplicity  simplicity saton exclaimed you should see the place where he writes himself there is no carpet upon the floor a block of wood for a writingtable a penny bottle of ink and a gnawed and bitten penholder only an inch or two long  pauline nodded  i can understand it she said i can understand too how your rooms would affect him you should have thought of that if he has gone away altogether how will you be able to finish your work  i must do without him saton answered  pauline looked at him critically dispassionately  i do not believe that you can do without him she said you are losing your hold upon your work i have noticed it for weeks dont you think that you are frittering away a great deal of your time and thoughts dont you think that the very small things of life things that are not worth counting have absorbed a good deal of your attention lately  he was annoyed and yet flattered that she should speak to him so intimately  it may be so he admitted and yet do you know why i have chosen to mix a little more with my fellows  no she answered i do not know why  it is because i must he said lowering his tone it is because i must see something of you  the lace of her parasol drooped a little her face was hidden now and her voice seemed to come from a long way off  that is very foolish she said in the first place if my opinion of you is worth anything i tell you frankly that i would rather see you with inkstained fingers and worn clothes climbing your way up toward the truth working and thinking in an atmosphere which was not befouled with all the small and petty things of life it seems to me that since it amused you to play the young man of fashion you have lost your touchsome portion of it at any rateupon the greater things  saton was very angry now he was only indifferently successful in his attempt to conceal the fact  you too he muttered well we shall see naudheim has brains and he has worked for many years he had worked indeed for many years when the glimmerings of this thing first came to me he could help me if he would but if he will not i can do it alone  i wonder  you do not believe in me he declared  no she answered i do not believe in younot altogether  rochester and his wife drove down the park saton followed her eyes noticing her slight start and gazed after them with brooding face  rochester is becoming quite a devoted husband he remarked with a sneer  quite she answered they spend most of their time together now  and lady mary i understand he went on has reformed yesterday she was opening the new wing of a hospital and the day before she was speaking at a girls friendly society meeting its an odd little place the world or rather this one particular corner of it  she rose with a little shrug of the shoulders and held out her hand  i must go she said i am lunching early  may i walk a little way with you he begged  she hesitated after all perhaps it was a phase of snobbery to dislike being seen with himsomething of that same feeling which she had never failed to remark in him  if you please she answered i am going to take a taximeter at the park gates  i will walk with you as far as there he said  he tried to talk to her on ordinary topics but he felt at once a disadvantage he knew so little of the people the little round of life in which she lived before they reached the gates they had relapsed into silence  it is foolish of me he said as he called a taximeter to come here simply in the hope of seeing you to beg for a few words and to go away more miserable than ever  she shrugged her shoulders  it is certainly very foolish she admitted  i dont see why he protested you should disapprove of me so utterly  i do not disapprove she told him i have not the right i have not the desire to have the right only since you will have me tell you i am interested in your work i like to talk about it to hear you talk when you are enthusiastic it does not amuse me to see you come down to the level of these others who while their morning away doing nothing you are not at home amongst them you have no place there when you come to me as a young man in society you bore me  she stepped into the taximeter and drove away with a farewell nod abrupt although not altogether unkindly yet as she looked behind a few seconds later her face was very much softerher eyes were almost regretful  it may hurt him she said to herself but it is very good that he should hear the truth     chapter xxxiv  a womans tongue   the man was harmless enough to all appearancesomething less than middleaged pale and with stubbly brown moustache he was dressed in blue serge clothes and a bowler hat a little ancient at the brim neither his appearance nor his manner was remarkable for any particular intelligence yet the girl who looked him over was at once suspicious  what can i do for you she asked a little curtly  he pointed to the crystal upon the table and held out his hand  i want my fortune told he said  violet shook her head  i do not attempt to read fortunes she said and i do not in any case see gentlemen here at all i do not understand how the boy could have shown you up  it wasnt the boys fault the visitor answered i was very keen on coming and i gave him the slip do make an exception for once wont you he went on i know my hand is very easy to read i had it read once and nearly everything came true  again she shook her head  i cannot do anything for you sir she said  the man protested  but you call yourself a professional palmist he said and you add crystal gazing to your announcement i have seen it being carried along on regent street  it is quite true violet said that i sometimes try to amuse ladies but i make no serious attempt to tell fortunes and as i said before i do not even receive gentlemen here at all i am sorry that you have had your visit for nothing  he rose to his feet with a shrug of the shoulders there was nothing to be done but to accept defeat and then at the moment of defeat something happened which more than reconciled him to his wasted visit the door was opened abruptly and saton entered  he realized the situation or its possibilities in an instant his bow to violet was the bow of a stranger  you are engaged he said i will come again i am sorry that your boy did not tell me  this gentleman came under a misapprehension violet answered i am sorry but the same thing applies to you i do not receive gentlemen here  saton bowed  i am sorry he said  the pageboy for whom violet had rung opened the door the first comer passed out with obvious reluctance the moment that the door was closed violet turned towards saton with a little exclamation  well she said of all the idiots i ever knew havent i told you time after time that this place is infested with detectives we get them here every day or so trying to trap us women as well as men and yet you walk in as though the place belonged to you the one thing they are so anxious to find out is who is running this show  i was a fool to come violet saton admitted and i am going at once you think then that he was a detective  i am sure of it she answered i was sure of it from the moment he came in  i will go saton said  did you come to see me she asked with a momentary softening in her tone  saton nodded  it must be another time he said i will not stop now or that man below will suspect  when will our next evening be bertrand she begged following him to the door  ill send you a telegram he answeredperhaps tomorrow  saton descended the stairs quickly on the threshold of the door he paused with the apparent object of lighting a cigarette his eyes travelled up and down the street looking into a shopwindow a few yards away was the man whom he had found with violet  he strolled slowly along the pavement and accosted him  i beg your pardon he said please dont think me impertinent but i am really curious to know whether that young woman was honest or not she refused to read my hand or look into the crystal for me simply because i was a man did she treat you in just the same way  the detective smiled  yes he said she was very much on her guard indeed declined to have anything to do with me  well said saton i only went in for a joke ill try one of the others theres a wonderful lady in oxford street somewhere they tell me with the biggest black eyes in london good day sir  saton walked off and entered a neighboring teashop from there he telephoned to violet who a few minutes later appeared  sit down and have some tea he said i want to talk to you  its almost time isnt it she asked reproachfully  never mind about that just now he said you can guess a little how things are those questions in the house upset the home secretary and i am quite convinced that they have made up their minds at scotland yard to go for us you are sure that you have been careful  absolutely she answered i have not once to man or woman pretended to tell their fortune i tell them that the whole thing is a joke that i will look into the crystal for them if they wish it or read their hands but i do not profess to tell their fortunes what i see i will tell them it may interest them or it may not if it does i ask them to give me something as a present of course i see that they always do that but you are quite right bertrand every one of our shows is being watched besides that fellow this afternoon i had two detectives yesterday and a woman whom i am doubtful about who keeps on coming  three weeks longer saton remarked half to himself perhaps it isnt worth while perhaps it would be better to close up now  only three weeks violet asked eagerly bertrand what are you going to do then what is going to become of me  saton patted her on the hand  i will tell you a little later on he said everything will be arranged all right the only thing i am wondering about is whether it wouldnt be better to close up at once  theyve got a big piece of business on at the office she remarked  saton frowned  i know it he answered its a dangerous piece of business too its blackmail pure and simple i wonder huntley dare tackle it it might mean five years penal servitude for him  hed give you away before he went to penal servitude violet remarked you may make yourself jolly sure of that  saton passed his hand across his forehead  phew he said how stuffy this place is violet i wish youd go round to huntley and talk to him of course he gets a big percentage on the returns and that makes him anxious to squeeze everyone but i dont want any risks were nearly out of the wood i dont want to be trapped now and ive an enemy violeta pretty dangerous enemy too i fancy that most of this activity at scotland yard and thereabouts lately is due to him  ill go she said drawing on her gloves shall i telephone to you  he nodded  telephone me at home he said tell dorrington or huntleywhichever you seethat the affair must be closed upeither dropped or settled the risk is too great my other work is becoming more and more important every day i ought not to be mixed up with this sort of thing at all violet  why are you she asked  money he answered one must have money one can do nothing without money it isnt that you or any of the other places make such an amazing lot its from dorrington of course that the biggest draws come still on the whole its a good income  and youre going to give it all up she remarked  he nodded  i darent go on he said weve reached about the limit  how are you going to live then she asked curiously youre not the sort of man to go back to poverty  saton considered for a moment after all perhaps it would pay him best to be straightforward with this girl he would tell her the truth if she were disagreeable about it he could always swear that he had been joking  violet he said i will tell you what i am going to do it does not sound very praiseworthy but you must remember that my work my real hard work means a great deal to me and for its sake i am willing to put up with a good deal of misunderstanding i am going to ask you to break off our engagement i am going to marry a young lady who has a great deal of money  violet sat perfectly still in her chair for several seconds she did not utter a syllable her lips were a little parted the color seemed suddenly drawn from her face and her eyes narrowed one realized then the pernicious effect of cosmetics her blackened eyebrows were painfully apparent the little patch of rouge was easily discernible against the pallor of her powdered skin she was suddenly ugly saton looking at her was amazed that he could ever have brought himself to touch her lips  ah she remarked i hadnt thought of that you want to marry some one else eh  saton nodded  it isnt that i want to he declared only as you know i must have money i cant marry you without it can i violet we should only be miserable you understand that  yes i understand she answered  she was turning one of her rings round looking down at her hands with downcast head  youre upset violet he said soothingly im sorry you see i cant help myself dont you  oh i suppose so she answered who is the young lady  a miss lois champneyes saton said she is a ward of a mr henry rochester who has been my enemy all along it is he i believe who has stirred up these detectives to keep watching us  henry rochester she repeated yes i remember the name he lives at the great house near blackbirds nest  saton nodded  he showed you the way to my cottage once there he reminded her well im glad ive told you violet i hope you understand exactly how much it means its rachaels doings of course and i darent go against her  no i suppose not she answered  they parted in the street saton called a taximeter and drove off violet walked slowly down bond street as she passed the corner of piccadilly she was suddenly aware that the man who had visited her that afternoon was watching her from the other side of the street she hesitated for a moment and then standing still deliberately beckoned him over  you are a detective are you not she asked as he approached hat in hand  he smiled  you are a very clever young lady he remarked  i dont want any compliments she answered did you come to my show this afternoon hoping just to catch me tripping or are you engaged in a larger quest altogether  in a larger quest he answered i want some information and if you can give it me i can promise that you will be remarkably well paid  and the information she asked  i want he said slowly to be able to connect the young man who came in and pretended to be a stranger and who has just been having tea with youi mean mr bertrand satoni want to connect him with your establishment and also with a little office where some very strange business has been transacted during the last few months you know where i mean what do you say shall we have a talk  she walked by his side along piccadilly  we may as well she said well go into the café royal and sit down     chapter xxxv  on lois birthday   lois is late this morning vandermere remarked looking up at the clock  and on her birthday too lady mary declared young people nowadays are so blasé look at all those presents on the table for her and here the breakfast gong has rung twice and there is no sign of her  vandermere turned to his host  you havent heard anything about that fellow saton he asked you dont know whether he is in the neighborhood or not  i have not heard rochester answered to tell you the truth if he has as much sense as i believe he has he is probably on his way to the continent by now  i have an idea somehow vandermere continued that lois is afraid hell turn up today  if lois is afraid rochester remarked let me tell you in confidence vandermere that i dont think you need be  my dear girl lady mary exclaimed looking toward the staircase we were just going in to breakfast without you and on your birthday too  lois came slowly down the broad stairs into the hall it was impossible to ignore the fact that she was pale and that she walked as one in fear her eyes were sunken and spoke of a sleepless night her manner was almost furtive she scarcely glanced even at the little pile of packages which stood upon the table  how nice of you all to wait she said good morning everybody  good morning and many happy returns to you lady mary called out will you look at your presents now or after breakfast  i think after breakfast she said are there any letters  they are on the table rochester said  she glanced them through eagerly when she had come to the last one she drew a little breath of relief a tinge of color came into her cheeks  you dear people she exclaimed impulsively i know i am going to have ever such nice things to thank you for may i be a child and put off looking at them until after breakfast do you mind all of you  of course not vandermere answered we want you to tell us how you would like to spend the day  i would like to ridea long way away she declared breathlessly or the motorcari shouldnt mind that i should like to go as far away as ever we can and stay away until it is dark could we start directly after breakfast  rochester smiled  you can have the car so far as i am concerned he said i have to go over to melton to sit on the bench and your aunt and i are lunching with the delameres afterwards but if you can put up with vandermere as an escort  ill try she answered dear maurice do order the car for halfanhours time will you  he laughed  why this wild rush he inquired  i dont know she answered it is just a feeling perhaps i want to get away a long way off very soon i cant explain dont ask me to explain any of you you are sure those are all the letters  certain rochester answered and lois he added looking up remember this you speak and look this morning like one who has fears i repeat it you have absolutely nothing to fear i am your guardian still although you are of age and i promise you that nothing harmful nothing threatening shall come near you  she drew a little sigh she did not make him any answer at all and yet in a sense it was clear that his words had brought her some comfort  dont expect us back till dinnertime she declared i am going to sit behind with maurice and be bored to death but i am going to be out of doors till it is dark i wish you did not bore me so maurice she added smiling up at him  i wont today anyhow he answered because if i talk at all i am going to talk about yourself  as the day wore on lois seemed to lose the depression which had come over her during the early morning by luncheon she was laughing and chattering talking over her presents soon when they were speeding on the road again she felt her hand suddenly held  lois her companion said this is your birthday and you are a free woman free to give yourself to whom you will it should be the happiest day of your life wont you make it the happiest day of mine  oh if only i could she answered with a sudden return of her old nervousness maurice if only i dared  he laughed scornfully  dear lois he said you are impressionable and you have let yourself become the victim of some very foolish fancies you are a free agent i tell you this now and i tell you the truth you are a free agent free to give your love where you will free to give yourself to whom you choose and i come to you first on your birthday lois you know that i love you give yourself to me little girl and never anything harmful shall come near you i swear it on my honor lois  she drew a little sigh of content and her arm stole shyly up to his shoulder in a moment she was in his arms  dont be angry with me maurice she sobbed if i am a little strange just at first i am afraidi cant tell you what ofbut i am afraid  he talked to her reassuringly holding her handsmost of the time in fact for the country was a sparsely populated one with his arm around her waist and then suddenly she seemed to lose her newfound content her cheeks were suddenly white she looked everywhere restlessly about  what is the matter dear he asked anxiously  i thought that i heard something she exclaimed what is the time  four oclock he answered looking at his watch  please tell the man to go back straight back home she said i am tired i must get back please maurice  he gave the chauffeur instructions through the speakingtube the car swung round and they sped on their way through the quiet lanes  dear lois he said something has come over you your hands are cold and you have drawn yourself away now please be honest and tell me all about it if you have fears all i can say is that you may dismiss them you are safe now that you have given yourself to me as safe as anyone in the world could be  oh if i could believe it she whispered but she did not turn her head her eyes sought his no longer they were fixed steadfastly on the road in front  you must believe it he declared laughing i can assure you that i am strong enough to hold you now that i have the right if any troubles or worries come they are mine to deal with see we will not mince words if that little reptile dares to crawl near you ill set my foot upon his neck by god i will  she took no notice of his speech except to slowly shake her head it seemed as though she had not heard him by and bye he left off talking there was nothing he could say to bring back the color to her cheeks or the light to her eyes or the confidence to her tone something had happenedhe could not tell whatbut for the moment she was gone from him the little hands which his still clasped were as cold as ice it seemed to him that they were unwilling prisoners once when he would have passed his arm around her waist she even shuddered and drew away  the car rushed on its way turned into the great avenue and drew up in front of beauleys lois stepped out quickly and went on ahead in the hall several people were standing and amongst them bertrand saton  vandermeres face was dark as a thundercloud when his eyes fell upon the young mancarefully almost foppishly dressed standing upon the hearthrug in front of the open fire rochester was there with pauline and lady mary was seated behind the teatray there was a little chorus as the two entered lois went straight to saton who held out his hands  dear lois he said softly i could not keep away today i have been waiting for you waiting for nearly an hour  i know she answered i came as soon as i knew     chapter xxxvi  the charlatan unmasked   there seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group handinhand saton after his first speech and after lois had given him her hands had turned a little defiantly toward rochester who remained however unmoved his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece his face almost expressionless vandermere too stood on one side and held his peace though the effort with which he did so was a visible one lady mary looked anxiously towards them pauline had shrunk back as though something in the situation terrified her  even saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm the courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence it was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him  still retaining lois hand he turned toward rochester  you have forbidden me to enter your house or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age mr rochester he said one of your conditions i have obeyed with regard to the other i have done as i thought fit however today she is her own mistress she has consented to be my wife i do not need to ask for your consent or approval if you are not willing that she should be married from your roof i can take her at once to the comtesse who is prepared to receive her  a very pleasant little arrangement rochester said speaking for the first time i am afraid however that you will have to alter your plans  i do not admit your right to interfere in them saton answered if you continue your opposition to my marriage with your ward i shall take her away with me this afternoon  rochester shook his head  i think not he answered  then we shall see saton declared lois come with me it does not matter about your hat your things can be sent on afterwards come  she would have followed him towards the door but rochester leaning over touched the bell and almost at once two men stepped into the hall one saton remembered in an instant it was the man whom he had found with violetthe man who was there to have his fortune told the other was a stranger but there was something in his demeanor in the very cut of his clothes which seemed to denote his profession  saton was suddenly pale he realized in a moment that it was not intended that he should leave the room he looked toward rochester as though for an explanation  my young friend rochester said when you leave this place you will leave it unless i change my mind in the company of those friends of mine whom you see there i dont want to terrify you unnecessarily these gentlemen are detectives but they are in my employ they have nothing to do with scotland yard i can assure you however that there need not be ten minutes delay in the issuing of a warrant for your arrest  my arrest saton gasped what do you mean  rochester sighed  ah he said why should you force me for explanations ask yourself once before you have stood in the dock on the charge of being connected with certain enterprises designed to wheedle their pocketmoney from overcredulous ladies you got off by a fluke but you did not learn your lesson this time getting off will not be quite so easy for you seem to have added to your former profession one which an english jury seldom lets pass unpunished i am in a position to prove bertrand saton that the offices in charing cross road conducted under the name of jacobson  company and which are nothing more nor less than the headquarters of an iniquitous blackmailing system are inspired and conducted by you and that the profits are the means by which you live a more despicable profession the world has never known there are a sheaf of cases against you i will remind you of one my wifelady mary hereleft a private letter in the rooms of a madame helga the letter was passed on at once to the blackmailing branch of your extremely interesting business and the sum of i think five hundred pounds was paid for its recovery you yourself were personally responsible for this little arrangement and there are many others if all the poor women whom you have robbed rochester continued had had the common sense of my wife and brought the matter to their husbands you would probably have been a guest of his majesty some time ago  such fear as had at first drawn the color from satons cheeks and filled his eyes with terror passed quickly away he stood upright his head thrown back a faint smile upon his lips he had some appearance even of manhood  mr rochester he said i deny your charges i have no connection with the fortunetelling establishments to which you have alluded i know nothing of the blackmailing transactions you speak of you have been my enemy my hopeless and unforgiving enemy i am not afraid of you if this is your great blow strike let me be arrested i will answer everything afterwards you and i will have our reckoning lois he added turning to her you do not believesay that you do not believe these things  idonotbelievethembertrand she answered slowly  you will come with me  iwillcomewithyou she echoed  by god sir she shant cried vandermere take your hands off her sir or you shall learn how mountebanks like yourself should be treated  saton struck him full in the face so that losing for a moment his balance upon the slippery floor vandermere nearly fell in a moment he recovered himself however there was a struggle which did not last halfadozen seconds he lifted saton off his feet and shook him till it seemed as though his limbs were cracking then he threw him away  rochester stepped forward to interfere  enough of this vandermere he said sternly remember that the fellows career is over he may try to bluff it out but he is done for i have proofs enough to send him to prison a dozen times over  saton rose slowly to his feet unconsciously his fingers straightened his tie he knew very well that lifeor rather the things which life meant for himwas over he had only one desirethe desire of the born poseurto extricate himself from his present position with something which might at any rate seem like dignity  do i understand he asked rochester that my departure from this house is forbidden  rochester shook his head  no he answered for what you are for the ignoble creature that you have become i accept a certain amount of responsibility for that reason i bid you go go where you will so long as your name or your presence never trouble us again let this be the last time that any one of us hears the name of bertrand saton i give you that chance find for yourself an honest place in the world if you can wherever you will so that it be not in this country go  saton turned toward the door with a little shrug of the shoulders  you need have no fear he said the country into which i go is one in which you will never be overanxious to travel  he passed out amidst a silence which seemed a little curious when one considered the emotions which he left behind lois pale face seemed all aglow with a sort of desperate thankfulness already she was in vandermeres arms and then the silence was broken by a womans sobbing they all turned towards her it was pauline who had suddenly broken down her face buried in her hands her whole frame shaking with passion  rochester moved towards her but she thrust him aside  you are a brute she declareda brute  she staggered across the room towards the door by which saton had departed before she could reach it however they heard the crunching of wheels as his car swept by the front on its way down the avenue                                       rochester pushed open the black gate which led from the road into the plantation at the back of the hill and they passed through and commenced the last short climb no word passed between them the silence of the evening was broken only by the faint sobbing of the wind in the treetops and the breaking of dried twigs under their feet they were both listening intentlythey scarcely knew for what the faraway rumble of a train the barking of a dog the scurrying of a rabbit across the paththese sounds came and passednothing else   they neared the edge of the plantation there was only a short climb now and a gray stone wall rochester passed his arm through his companions her breath was coming in little sobs  we shall be there in a moment pauline he said it is only a fancy of mine perhaps he is not here after all but at any rate we shall know  she said nothing she seemed to be bracing herself for that last effort now they could see the bare rocky outline of the summit of the hill a few steps more and they would pass through the gate and then the sound came the sound which somehow they had dreaded sharp and crisp through the twilight air came the report of a revolver they even fancied that they heard a little moan come travelling down the hillside  rochester stopped short  we are too late he said pauline you had better stay here i will go on and find him  she shook her head  i am coming she said it is my faultit is my fault  he held out his hand  pauline he said it may not be a fit sight for you sit here if you can do any good i will call to you  she brushed him aside and began to run with her slight start she outdistanced him and when he scrambled up to the top she was already on her knees kneeling down over the crouching form  he is not dead she cried quick tell me where the wound is  rochester stooped down on the other side and saton opened his eyes slowly  i am a bungler as usual he said  rochester opened his coat carefully  he has shot himself in the shoulder he said to pauline it is not serious  saton pointed to the rock  lift me up a little he said i want to sit there with my back to it carefully  rochester did as he was bid then he took his handkerchief and tried to staunch the blood  i dont know why you came saton falteredyou especially he added to rochester havent you had all the triumph you wanted couldnt you have left me alone to spend this last hour my own way i wanted to learn how to die without fear or any regret here i can do it because it is easier here to realize that failure such as mine is death  we came to try and save you said rochester quietly  to save you pauline sobbed oh bertrand i am sorryi am very very sorry  he looked at her in slow surprise  that is kind of you he said it is kind of you to care you know now what sort of a creature i am you know that he was rightthis man i meanwhen he warned you against me when he told you that i was something rotten something not worth your notice give me the revolver again  rochester thrust it in his pocket shaking his head  my young friend i think not he said listen i have no more to say about the past i am prepared to accept my share of the responsibility of it you are still young there is still time for you to weave fresh dreams to live a new life make another start no dont be afraid that im going to offer you my help there was a curse upon that but nevertheless make your start it isnt i who wish it it ispauline  saton looked at her wonderingly  she doesnt care he said she knows now that i am really a charlatan and i neednt have been he added with a sudden fury it was only that cursed taste for luxury which seemed somehow or other to creep into my blood which made me so dependent upon money naudheim was right naudheim was right if only i had stayed with him if only i had believed in him  it is not too late she whispered stooping low over him be a man bertrand take up your work where you left it and have done with the other things this slipping away over the edge slipping into eternity is the trick of cowards for my sake bertrand  he half closed his eyes rochester was busy still with his shoulder and the pain made him faint  go back to naudheim she whispered start life from the very bottom rung if he will have it so dont be afraid of failure keep your hands tight upon the ladder and your eyes turned toward heaven oh you can climb if you will bertrand you can climb i am sure dont look down dont pause be satisfied with nothing less than the great things for my sake bertrand my thoughts will follow you my heart will be with you promise  i promise he murmured  his head sank back he was half unconscious  we will stay with him for a moment rochester whispered as soon as he comes to i will carry him down to the car  in a moment or two he opened his eyes his lips moved but he was half delirious  anything but failure he muttered to himself with a little groan death if you willa touch of the finger a stroke too far to seaward oh death is easy enough death is easy and failure is hard  her lips touched his forehead  dont believe it dear she whispered there is no real failure if only the spirit is brave the dead things are there to help you climb they are rungs in the ladder boulders for your feet  he leaned a little forward it seemed as though he recognised something familiar amongst the treetops or down in the mistclad valleys  naudheim he cried hoarsely i shall go to naudheim     epilogue  the man   about halfway up where the sleighs stopped lady mary gave in pauline and rochester went forward on foot and with a guide in front below them was a wonderful unseen world unseen except when the snow for a moment ceased to fall and they caught vague aweinspiring glimpses of ravines and precipices treeclad gorges reaching down a dizzy height to the valley below above them was a plateau black with pine trees higher still the invisible mountain tops  it is only a few hundred yards further rochester said holding his companion by the arm what a country though i wonder if it ever stops snowing  it is wonderful she murmured wonderful  and then as though in some strange relation to his words the storm of whirling snowflakes suddenly ceased the thin veil passed away from overhead like gossamer they saw a clear sky they saw even the gleam of reflected sunshine and as the mist lifted the country above and beyond unrolled itself in one grand and splendid transformation scene woods above woods snowclad peaks all glittering with their burden of icicles and snow and above a white chaos where the mountainpeak struck the clouds  they paused for a moment breathless  it is like naudheim himself she declared this is the land he spoke of this is the place to which he climbed it is wonderful  come rochester said we must be up before the darkness  slowly they made their way along the mountain road which their guide in front was doing all he could to make smooth for them and then at the corner they found a log hut to which their guide pointed triumphantly  it is there he exclaimedthere where they live the two madmen beyond you see is the village of the woodhewers  rochester nodded they struggled a few steps upwards and then paused to look with wonder at the scene below the one log cabin before which they were now standing had been built alone barely a hundred yards away across the ravine were twenty or thirty similar ones from the roofs of which the smoke went curling upwards it seemed for a moment as though they had climbed above the world of noisesclimbed into the land of eternal silence before they had had time however to frame the thought they heard the crashing of timber across the ravine and a great tree fell inwards a sound like distant thunder rose and swelled at every moment  it is the machinery their guide told them the trees fall and are stripped of their boughs then they go down the ravine there and along the slide all the way to the river see them all the way like a great worm day and night month by monththere is never a minute when a tree does not fall  again they heard the crashing and another tree fell they heard the rumble of the slide in the forest the peculiar scent of fresh sap seemed like a perfume in the air then suddenly the snow began to fall again they could not see across the ravine  the guide knocked at the door and opened it rochester and pauline passed in  there was something almost familiar about the little scene it was in many respects so entirely as she had always imagined it naudheim coatless collarless with open waistcoat twisted braces and unkempt hair was striding up and down the room banging his hands against his side dictating to the younger man who sat before the rude pine table  so we arrive they heard his harsh eager tones so we arrive at the evolution of that consciousness which may justly be termed eternalthe consciousness which has become subject to these primary and irresistible laws the understanding of which has baffled for so many ages the students of every country so we come  naudheim broke off in the middle of his sentence a rush of cold air had swept into the room he thrust forward an angry inquiring countenance toward the visitors the young man sprang to his feet  pauline he exclaimed  he recognised rochester and stepped back with a momentary touch of his old passionate repugnance not unmixed with fear he recovered himself however almost immediately rochester gazed at him in amazement it would have been hard indeed to have recognised the bertrand saton of the old days in the robust and bearded man who stood there now with his eyes fixed upon pauline his cheeks were weatherbeaten but brown with health he wore a short unkempt beard a flannel shirt with collar but no tie tweed clothes which might indeed have come at one time or another from saville row but were now spent with age and worn out of all shape  paulines heart leaped with joy her eyes were wet it had been worth while then he had found salvation  we hadnt the least right to come of course she began recognising that speech alone could dissolve that strange silence and discomposure which seemed to have fallen upon all of them mr rochester and lady mary and i are going to st moritz and i persuaded them to stay over here and see whether we couldnt rout you out what a wonderful place she exclaimed  it is a wonderful place madam naudheim exclaimed glowering at them with darkening face it is wonderful because we are many thousands of feet up from that rotten stinking little life that cauldron of souls into which my young friend here had very nearly pitched his own little offering  it was we who sent him to you pauline said gently  so long as you have not come to fetch him away naudheim muttered  pauline shook her head  we have come she said because we care for him because we were anxious to know whether he had come to his own we will go away the moment you send us  you will have some tea naudheim growled a little more graciously saton man be hospitable it is goats milk and none too sweet at that and i wont answer for the butter  saton spoke little pauline was content to watch him they drank tea out of thick china cups but over their conversation there was always a certain reserve naudheim listened and watched like a mother jealous of strangers who might rob her of her young after tea however he disappeared from the room for a few moments and rochester walked toward the window  it is very good of you to come pauline saton said i shall work all the better for this little glimpse of you  will the work she asked softly never be done  he shook his head  why should it one passes from field to field and our lives are not long enough nor our brains great enough to reach the place where we may call halt  do you mean she asked that you will live here all your days  why not he answered i have tried other things and you know what they made of me if i live here till i am as old as naudheim i shall only be suffering a just penance  but you are young she murmured there are things in the world worth having there is a life there worth living solitude such as this is the greatest panacea the world could offer for all you have been through but it is not meant to last we want you back again bertrand  his eyes were suddenly on fire he shrank a little away from her  dont he begged dont pauline i am living my punishment here and i have borne it without once looking back dont make it harder  i do not wish to make it harder she declared and yet i meant what i said it is not right that you should spend all your days here it is not right for your own sake it is not right  she held out her hands to him suddenly  it is not right for mine she whispered  rochester stepped outside again the snow had ceased in the forest he could hear the whirl of machinery and the crashing of the falling timber he stood for a moment with clenched hands with unseeing eyes with ears in which was ringing still the memory of that low passionate cry and then the fit passed he looked down to the little halfway house where he had left his wife he fancied he could see someone waving a white handkerchief from the platform of pine logs it was all so right after all so right and natural he began to descend alone  saton brought her down about an hour later their faces told all that there was to say  bertrand is going to stay here for another year pauline said answering lady marys unspoken question the first part of his work with naudheim will be finished then and we think he will have earned a vacation  saton held out his hands to rochester  mr rochester he said i have never asked you to forgive me for all the hard things i have said and thought of you for my ingratitude andfor other things  dont speak of them rochester interrupted  i wont saton continued quickly i cant that chapter of my life is buried i cannot bear to think of it even now i cannot bear to come in contact with anything which reminds me of it  rochester took his hand and grasped it heartily  dont be morbid about it he said every man should have at least two chances in life you had your first and it was a rank failure that was because you had unnatural help and bad advice the second time i am glad to see that you have succeeded you have done this on your own you have proved that the real man is the present man  saton drew pauline towards him with a gesture which was almost reverent  i think that pauline knows he said i hope so  early in the morning their sleigh rattled off saton stood outside the cottage waving his hand naudheim was by his side his arm resting gently upon the young mans shoulder a fine snow was falling around them the air was clean and purethe air of heaven there was no sound to break the deep stillness but the tinkle of the sleighbells and behind the rhythmic humming of the machinery and the crashing of the falling trees  naudheim is a great master rochester said  pauline smiled through her tears  bertrand isnt such a very bad pupil                           the end     e phillips
