townlet like woodhouse with a population of ten thousand people and three generations behind it this space of three generations argues a certain wellestablished society the old county has fled from the sight of so much disembowelled coal to flourish on mineral rights in regions still idyllic remains one great and inaccessible magnate the local coal owner three generations old and clambering on the bottom step of the county kicking off the mass below rule him out  a well established society in woodhouse full of fine shades ranging from the dark of coaldust to grit of stonemason and sawdust of timbermerchant through the lustre of lard and butter and meat to the perfume of the chemist and the disinfectant of the doctor on to the serene goldtarnish of bankmanagers cashiers for the firm clergymen and suchlike as far as the automobile refulgence of the generalmanager of all the collieries here the ne plus ultra the general manager lives in the shrubberied seclusion of the socalled manor the genuine hall abandoned by the county has been taken over as offices by the firm  here we are then a vast substratum of colliers a thick sprinkling of tradespeople intermingled with small employers of labour and diversified by elementary schoolmasters and nonconformist clergy a higher layer of bankmanagers rich millers and welltodo ironmasters episcopal clergy and the managers of collieries then the rich and sticky cherry of the local coalowner glistening over all  such the complicated social system of a small industrial town in the midlands of england in this year of grace 1920 but let us go back a little such it was in the last calm year of plenty 1913  a calm year of plenty but one chronic and dreary malady that of the odd women why in the name of all prosperity should every class but the lowest in such a society hang overburdened with dead sea fruit of odd women unmarried unmarriageable women called old maids why is it that every tradesman every schoolmaster every bankmanager and every clergyman produces one two three or more old maids do the middleclasses particularly the lower middleclasses give birth to more girls than boys or do the lower middleclass men assiduously climb up or down in marriage thus leaving their true partners stranded or are middleclass women very squeamish in their choice of husbands  however it be it is a tragedy or perhaps it is not  perhaps these unmarried women of the middleclasses are the famous sexlessworkers of our antindustrial society of which we hear so much perhaps all they lack is an occupation in short a job but perhaps we might hear their own opinion before we lay the law down  in woodhouse there was a terrible crop of old maids among the nobs the tradespeople and the clergy the whole town of women colliers wives and all held its breath as it saw a chance of one of these daughters of comfort and woe getting off they flocked to the welltodo weddings with an intoxication of relief for let classjealousy be what it may a woman hates to see another woman left stalely on the shelf without a chance they all wanted the middleclass girls to find husbands every one wanted it including the girls themselves hence the dismalness  now james houghton had only one child his daughter alvina surely alvina houghton  but let us retreat to the early eighties when alvina was a baby or even further back to the palmy days of james houghton in his palmy days james houghton was crême de la crême of woodhouse society the house of houghton had always been welltodo tradespeople we must admit but after a few generations of affluence tradespeople acquire a distinct cachet now james houghton at the age of twentyeight inherited a splendid business in manchester goods in woodhouse he was a tall thin elegant young man with sidewhiskers genuinely refined somewhat in the bulwer style he had a taste for elegant conversation and elegant literature and elegant christianity a tall thin brittle young man rather fluttering in his manner full of facile ideas and with a beautiful speaking voice most beautiful withal of course a tradesman he courted a small dark woman older than himself daughter of a derbyshire squire he expected to get at least ten thousand pounds with her in which he was disappointed for he got only eight hundred being of a romanticcommercial nature he never forgave her but always treated her with the most elegant courtesy to seehim peel and prepare an apple for her was an exquisite sight but that peeled and quartered apple was her portion this elegant adam of commerce gave eve her own back nicely cored and had no more to do with her meanwhile alvina was born  before all this however before his marriage james houghton had built manchester house it was a vast square buildingvast that is for woodhousestanding on the main street and highroad of the small but growing town the lower front consisted of two fine shops one for manchester goods one for silk and woollens this was james houghtons commercial poem  for james houghton was a dreamer and something of a poet commercial be it understood he liked the novels of george macdonald and the fantasies of that author extremely he wove one continual fantasy for himself a fantasy of commerce he dreamed of silks and poplins luscious in texture and of unforeseen exquisiteness he dreamed of carriages of the county arrested before his windows of exquisite women ruffling charmed entranced to his counter and charming entrancing he served them his lovely fabrics which only he and they could sufficiently appreciate his fame spread until alexandra princess of wales and elizabeth empress of austria the two bestdressed women in europe floated down from heaven to the shop in woodhouse and sallied forth to show what could be done by purchasing from james houghton  we cannot say why james houghton failed to become the liberty or the snelgrove of his day perhaps he had too much imagination be that as it may in those early days when he brought his wife to her new home his window on the manchester side was a foam and a mayblossom of muslins and prints his window on the london side was an autumn evening of silks and rich fabrics what wife could fail to be dazzled but she poor darling from her stone hall in stony derbyshire was a little bit repulsed by the mans dancing in front of his stock like david before the ark  the home to which he brought her was a monument in the great bedroom over the shop he had his furniture built built of solid mahogany oh too too solid no doubt he hopped or skipped himself with satisfaction into the monstrous matrimonial bed it could only be mounted by means of a stool and chair but the poor secluded little woman older than he must have climbed up with a heavy heart to lie and face the gloomy bastille of mahogany the great cupboard opposite or to turn wearily sideways to the great cheval mirror which performed a perpetual and hideous bow before her grace such furniture it could never be removed from the room  the little child was born in the second year and then james houghton decamped to a small halffurnished bedroom at the other end of the house where he slept on a rough board and played the anchorite for the rest of his days his wife was left alone with her baby and the builtin furniture she developed heart disease as a result of nervous repressions  but like a butterfly james fluttered over his fabrics he was a tyrant to his shopgirls no french marquis in a dickens novel could have been more elegant and raffiné and heartless the girls detested him and yet his curious refinement and enthusiasm bore them away they submitted to him the shop attracted much curiosity but the poorspirited woodhouse people were weak buyers they wearied james houghton with their demand for common zephyrs for red flannel which they would scallop with black worsted for black alpacas and bombazines and merinos he fluffed out his silkstriped muslins his india cottonprints but the natives shied off as if he had offered them the poisoned robes of herakles  there was a sale these sales contributed a good deal to mrs houghtons nervous heartdisease they brought the first signs of wear and tear into the face of james houghton at first of course he merely marked down with discretion his lessexpensive stock of prints and muslins nunsveilings and muslin delaines with a few fancy braidings and trimmings in guimp or bronze to enliven the affair and woodhouse bought cautiously  after the sale however james houghton felt himself at liberty to plunge into an orgy of new stock he flitted with a tense look on his face to manchester after which huge bundles bales and boxes arrived in woodhouse and were dumped on the pavement of the shop friday evening came and with it a revelation in houghtons window the first piqués the first strangelywoven and honeycombed toilet covers and bed quilts the first frillcaps and aprons for maidservants a wonder in white that was how james advertised it a wonder in white who knows but that he had been reading wilkie collins famous novel  as the nine days of the wonderinwhite passed and receded james disappeared in the direction of london a few fridays later he came out with his winter touch weird and wonderful winter coats for ladieseverything james handled was for ladies he scorned the coarser sex weird and wonderful winter coats for ladies of thick black pockmarked cloth stood and flourished their bearfur cuffs in the background while tippets boas muffs and winterfancies coquetted in front of the windowspace fridaynight crowds gathered outside the gaslamps shone their brightest james houghton hovered in the background like an author on his first night in the theatre the result was a sensation ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass it was a sensation but what sensation in the breasts of the crowd wonder admiration fear and ridicule let us stress the word fear the inhabitants of woodhouse were afraid lest james houghton should impose his standards upon them his goods were in excellent taste but his customers were in as bad taste as possible they stood outside and pointed giggled and jeered poor james like an author on his first night saw his work fall more than flat  but still he believed in his own excellence and quite justly what he failed to perceive was that the crowd hated excellence woodhouse wanted a gently graduated progress in mediocrity a mediocrity so stale and flat that it fell outside the imagination of any sensitive mortal woodhouse wanted a series of vulgar little thrills as one tawdry mediocrity was imported from nottingham or birmingham to take the place of some tawdry mediocrity which nottingham and birmingham had already discarded that woodhouse as a very condition of its own being hated any approach to originality or real taste this james houghton could never learn he thought he had not been clever enough when he had been far far too clever already he always thought that dame fortune was a capricious and fastidious dame a sort of elizabeth of austria or alexandra princess of wales elegant beyond his grasp whereas dame fortune even in london or vienna let alone in woodhouse was a vulgar woman of the middle and lower middleclass ready to put her heavy foot on anything that was not vulgar machinemade and appropriate to the herd when he saw his delicate originalities as well as his faint flourishes of drapers fantasy squashed flat under the calm and solid foot of vulgar dame fortune he fell into fits of depression bordering on mysticism and talked to his wife in a vague way of higher influences and the angel israfel she poor lady was thoroughly scared by israfel and completely unhooked by the vagaries of james  at lastwe hurry down the slope of james misfortunesthe real days of houghtons great sales began houghtons great bargain events were really events after some years of hanging on he let go splendidly he marked down his prints his chintzes his dimities and his veilings with a grand and lavish hand bang went his blue pencil through 311 and nobly he subscribed 1034 prices fell like nuts a lofty oneandeleven rolled down to sixthree 16 magically shrank into 434d whilst good solid prints exposed themselves at 334d per yard  now this was really an opportunity moreover the goods having become a little stale during their years of ineffectuality were beginning to approximate to the public taste and besides good sound stuff it was no matter what the pattern and so the little woodhouse girls went to school in petties and drawers made of material which james had destined for fair summer dresses petties and drawers of which the little woodhouse girls were ashamed for all that for if they should chance to turn up their little skirts be sure they would raise a chorus among their companions yahhh yerve got houghtons threpny draws on  all this time james houghton walked on air he still saw the fata morgana snatching his fabrics round her lovely form and pointing him to wealth untold true he became also superintendent of the sunday school but whether this was an act of vanity or whether it was an attempt to establish an entente cordiale with higher powers who shall judge  meanwhile his wife became more and more an invalid the little alvina was a pretty growing child woodhouse was really impressed by the sight of mrs houghton small pale and withheld taking a walk with her dainty little girl so fresh in an ermine tippet and a muff mrs houghton in shiny black bearsfur the child in the white and spotted ermine passing silent and shadowy down the street made an impression which the people did not forget  but mrs houghton had pains at her heart if during her walk she saw two little boys having a scrimmage she had to run to them with pence and entreaty leaving them dumfounded whilst she leaned blue at the lips against a wall if she saw a carter crack his whip over the ears of the horse as the horse laboured uphill she had to cover her eyes and avert her face and all her strength left her  so she stayed more and more in her room and the child was given to the charge of a governess miss frost was a handsome vigorous young woman of about thirty years of age with greywhite hair and goldrimmed spectacles the white hair was not at all tragical it was a family trait  miss frost mattered more than any one else to alvina houghton during the first long twentyfive years of the girls life the governess was a strong generous woman a musician by nature she had a sweet voice and sang in the choir of the chapel and took the first class of girls in the sundayschool of which james houghton was superintendent she disliked and rather despised james houghton saw in him elements of a hypocrite detested his airy and gracious selfishness his lack of human feeling and most of all his fairy fantasy as james went further into life he became a dreamer sad indeed that he died before the days of freud he enjoyed the most wonderful and fairylike dreams which he could describe perfectly in charming delicate language at such times his beautifully modulated voice all but sang his grey eyes gleamed fiercely under his bushy hairy eyebrows his pale face with its sidewhiskers had a strange lueur his long thin hands fluttered occasionally he had become meagre in figure his skimpy but genteel coat would be buttoned over his breast as he recounted his dreamadventures adventures that were half edgar allan poe half andersen with touches of vathek and lord byron and george macdonald perhaps more than a touch of the last ladies were always struck by these accounts but miss frost never felt so strongly moved to impatience as when she was within hearing  for twenty years she and james houghton treated each other with a courteous distance sometimes she broke into open impatience with him sometimes he answered her tartly indeed indeed oh indeed well well im sorry you find it so as if the injury consisted in her finding it so then he would flit away to the conservative club with a fleet light hurried step as if pressed by fate at the club he played chessat which he was excellentand conversed then he flitted back at halfpast twelve to dinner  the whole morale of the house rested immediately on miss frost she saw her line in the first year she must defend the little alvina whom she loved as her own and the nervous petulant heartstricken woman the mother from the vagaries of james not that james had any vices he did not drink or smoke was abstemious and clean as an anchorite and never lowered his fine tone but still the two unprotected ones must be sheltered from him miss frost imperceptibly took into her hands the reins of the domestic government her rule was quiet strong and generous she was not seeking her own way she was steering the poor domestic ship of manchester house illuminating its dark rooms with her own sure radiant presence her silverwhite hair and her pale heavy reposeful face seemed to give off a certain radiance she seemed to give weight ballast and repose to the staggering and bewildered home she controlled the maid and suggested the mealsmeals which james ate without knowing what he ate she brought in flowers and books and very rarely a visitor visitors were out of place in the dark sombreness of manchester house her flowers charmed the petulant invalid her books she sometimes discussed with the airy james after which discussions she was invariably filled with exasperation and impatience whilst james invariably retired to the shop and was heard raising his musical voice which the workgirls hated to one or other of the workgirls  james certainly had an irritating way of speaking of a book he talked of incidents and effects and suggestions as if the whole thing had just been a sensationalæsthetic attribute to himself not a grain of human feeling in the man said miss frost flushing pink with exasperation she herself invariably took the human line  meanwhile the shops began to take on a hopeless and frowsy look after ten years sales spring sales summer sales autumn sales winter sales james began to give up the drapery dream he himself could not bear any more to put the heavy pockholed black cloth coat with wild bear cuffs and collar on to the stand he had marked it down from five guineas to one guinea and then oh ignoble day to tenandsix he nearly kissed the gipsy woman with a basket of tin saucepanlids when at last she bought it for five shillings at the end of one of his winter sales but even she in spite of the bitter sleety day would not put the coat on in the shop she carried it over her arm down to the miners arms and later with a shock that really hurt him james peeping birdlike out of his shop door saw her sitting driving a dirty ragandbone cart with a greenwhite mouldy pony and flourishing her arms like some wild and hairydecorated squaw for the long bearfur wet with sleet seemed like a chevaux de frise of long porcupine quills round her forearms and her neck yet such good such wonderful material james eyed it for one moment and then fled like a rabbit to the stove in his back regions  the higher powers did not seem to fulfil the terms of treaty which james hoped for he began to back out from the entente the sunday school was a great trial to him instead of being carried away by his grace and eloquence the nasty louts of colliery boys and girls openly banged their feet and made deafening noises when he tried to speak he said many acid and withering things as he stood there on the rostrum but what is the good of saying acid things to those little fiends and gallbladders the colliery children the situation was saved by miss frosts sweeping together all the big girls under her surveillance and by her organizing that the tall and handsome blacksmith who taught the lower boys should extend his influence over the upper boys his influence was more than effectual it consisted in gripping any recalcitrant boy just above the knee and jesting with him in a jocular manner in the dialect the blacksmiths hand was all a blacksmiths hand need be and his dialect was as broad as could be wished between the grip and the homely idiom no boy could endure without squealing so the sunday school paid more attention to james whose prayers were beautiful but then one of the boys a protegé of miss frost having been left for half an hour in the obscure room with mrs houghton gave away the secret of the blacksmiths grip which secret so haunted the poor lady that it marked a stage in the increase of her malady and made sunday afternoon a nightmare to her and then james houghton resented something in the coarse scotch manner of the minister of that day so that the superintendency of the sunday school came to an end  at the same time solomon had to divide his baby that is he let the london side of his shop to w h johnson the tailor and haberdasher a parvenu little fellow whose english would not bear analysis bitter as it was it had to be carpenters and joiners appeared and the premises were completely severed from her room in the shadows at the back the invalid heard the hammering and sawing and suffered w h johnson came out with a spickandspan window and had his wife a shrewd quiet woman and his daughter a handsome loud girl to help him on friday evenings men flocked ineven women buying their husbands a sixpencehalfpenny tie they could have bought a tie for fourthree from james houghton but no they would rather give sixpencehalfpenny for wh johnsons fresh but rubbishy stuff and james who had tried to rise to another successful sale saw the streams pass into the other doorway and heard the heavy feet on the hollow boards of the other shop his shop no more  after this cut at his pride and integrity he lay in retirement for a while mystically inclined probably he would have come to swedenborg had not his clipt wings spread for a new flight he hit upon the brilliant idea of working up his derelict fabrics into readymades not mens clothes oh no womens or rather ladies ladies tailoring said the new announcement  james houghton was happy once more a zigzag wooden stairway was rigged up the high back of manchester house in the great lofts sewingmachines of various patterns and movements were installed a manageress was advertised for and workgirls were hired so a new phase of life started at halfpast six in the morning there was a clatter of feet and of girls excited tongues along the backyard and up the wooden stairway outside the back wall the poor invalid heard every clack and every vibration she could never get over her nervous apprehension of an invasion every morning alike she felt an invasion of some enemy was breaking in on her and all day long the low steady rumble of sewingmachines overhead seemed like the low drumming of a bombardment upon her weak heart to make matters worse james houghton decided that he must have his sewingmachines driven by some extrahuman force he installed another plant of machineryacetylene or some such contrivancewhich was intended to drive all the little machines from one big belt hence a further throbbing and shaking in the upper regions truly terrible to endure but fortunately or unfortunately the acetylene plant was not a success girls got their thumbs pierced and sewing machines absolutely refused to stop sewing once they had started and absolutely refused to start once they had stopped so that after a while one loft was reserved for disused and rusty but expensive engines  dame fortune who had refused to be taken by fine fabrics and fancy trimmings was just as reluctant to be captured by readymades again the good dame was thoroughly lower middleclass james houghton designed robes now robes were the mode perhaps it was alexandra princess of wales who gave glory to the slim glovefitting princess robe be that as it may james houghton designed robes his workgirls a race even more callous than shopgirls proclaimed the fact that james tried on his own inventions upon his own elegant thin person before the privacy of his own cheval mirror and even if he did why not miss frost hearing this legend looked sideways at the enthusiast  let us remark in time that miss frost had already ceased to draw any maintenance from james houghton far from it she herself contributed to the upkeep of the domestic hearth and board she had fully decided never to leave her two charges she knew that a governess was an impossible item in manchester house as things went and so she trudged the country giving music lessons to the daughters of tradesmen and of colliers who boasted pianofortes she even taught heavyhanded but dauntless colliers who were seized with a passion to play miles she trudged on her round from village to village a whitehaired woman with a long quick stride a strong figure and a quick handsome smile when once her face awoke behind her goldrimmed glasses like many shortsighted people she had a certain intent look of one who goes her own way  the miners knew her and entertained the highest respect and admiration for her as they streamed in a grimy stream home from pit they diverged like some magic dark river from off the pavement into the horseway to give her room as she approached and the men who knew her well enough to salute her by calling her name miss frost giving it the proper intonation of salute were fussy men indeed shes a lady if ever there was one they said and they meant it hearing her name poor miss frost would flash a smile and a nod from behind her spectacles but whose black face she smiled to she never or rarely knew if she did chance to get an inkling then gladly she called in reply mr lamb or mr calladine in her way she was a proud woman for she was regarded with cordial respect touched with veneration by at least a thousand colliers and by perhaps as many colliers wives that is something for any woman  miss frost charged fifteen shillings for thirteen weeks lessons two lessons a week and at that she was considered rather dear she was supposed to be making money what money she made went chiefly to support the houghton household in the meanwhile she drilled alvina thoroughly in theory and pianoforte practice for alvina was naturally musical and besides this she imparted to the girl the elements of a young ladys education including the drawing of flowers in watercolour and the translation of a lamartine poem  now incredible as it may seem fate threw another prop to the falling house of houghton in the person of the manageress of the workgirls miss pinnegar james houghton complained of fortune yet to what other man would fortune have sent two such women as miss frost and miss pinnegar gratis yet there they were and doubtful if james was ever grateful for their presence  if miss frost saved him from heaven knows what domestic débâcle and horror miss pinnegar saved him from the workhouse let us not mince matters for a dozen years miss frost supported the heartstricken nervous invalid clariss houghton for more than twenty years she cherished tended and protected the young alvina shielding the child alike from a neurotic mother and a father such as james for nearly twenty years she saw that food was set on the table and clean sheets were spread on the beds and all the time remained virtually in the position of an outsider without one grain of established authority  and then to find miss pinnegar in her way miss pinnegar was very different from miss frost she was a rather short stout mousecoloured creepy kind of woman with a high colour in her cheeks and dun close hair like a cap it was evident she was not a lady her grammar was not without reproach she had pale grey eyes and a padding step and a soft voice and almost purplish cheeks mrs houghton miss frost and alvina did not like her they suffered her unwillingly  but from the first she had a curious ascendancy over james houghton one would have expected his æsthetic eye to be offended but no doubt it was her voice her soft near sure voice which seemed almost like a secret touch upon her hearer now many of her hearers disliked being secretly touched as it were beneath their clothing miss frost abhorred it so did mrs houghton miss frosts voice was clear and straight as a bellnote open as the day yet alvina though in loyalty she adhered to her beloved miss frost did not really mind the quiet suggestive power of miss pinnegar for miss pinnegar was not vulgarly insinuating on the contrary the things she said were rather clumsy and downright it was only that she seemed to weigh what she said secretly before she said it and then she approached as if she would slip it into her hearers consciousness without his being aware of it she seemed to slide her speeches unnoticed into ones ears so that one accepted them without the slightest challenge that was just her manner of approach in her own way she was as loyal and unselfish as miss frost there are such poles of opposition between honesties and loyalties  miss pinnegar had the second class of girls in the sunday school and she took second subservient place in manchester house by force of nature miss frost took first place only when miss pinnegar spoke to mr houghtonnay the very way she addressed herself to himwhat do you think mr houghtonthen there seemed to be assumed an immediacy of correspondence between the two and an unquestioned priority in their unison his and hers which was a cruel thorn in miss frosts outspoken breast this sort of secret intimacy and secret exulting in having really the chief power was most repugnant to the whitehaired woman not that there was in fact any secrecy or any form of unwarranted correspondence between james houghton and miss pinnegar far from it each of them would have found any suggestion of such a possibility repulsive in the extreme it was simply an implicit correspondence between their two psyches an immediacy of understanding which preceded all expression tacit wireless  miss pinnegar lived in so that the household consisted of the invalid who mostly sat in her black dress with a white lace collar fastened by a twisted gold brooch in her own dim room doing nothing nervous and heartsuffering then james and the thin young alvina who adhered to her beloved miss frost and then these two strange women miss pinnegar never lifted up her voice in household affairs she seemed by her silence to admit her own inadequacy in culture and intellect when topics of interest were being discussed only coming out now and then with defiant platitudes and truismsfor almost defiantly she took the commonplace vulgarian point of view yet after everything she would turn with her quiet triumphant assurance to james houghton and start on some point of business soft assured ascendant the others shut their ears  now miss pinnegar had to get her footing slowly she had to let james run the gamut of his creations each friday night new wonders robes and ladies suitsthe phrase was very newgarnished the window of houghtons shop it was one of the sights of the place houghtons window on friday night young or old no individual certainly no female left woodhouse without spending an excited and usually hilarious ten minutes on the pavement under the window muffled shrieks of young damsels who had just got their first view guffaws of sympathetic youths continued giggling and expostulation and eh but what price the umbrella skirt my girl and youd like to marry me in that my boywhat not halfor else eh now if youd seen me in that youd have fallen in love with me at first sight shouldnt youwith a probable answer i should have fallen over myself making haste to get awayloud guffawsall this was the regular friday nights entertainment in woodhouse james houghtons shop was regarded as a weekly comic issue his piqué costumes with glass buttons and sort of steeltrimming collars and cuffs were immortal  but why once more drag it out miss pinnegar served in the shop on friday nights she stood by her man sometimes when the shrieks grew loudest she came to the shop door and looked with her pale grey eyes at the ridiculous mob of lasses in tamoshanters and youths half buried in caps and she imposed a silence they edged away  meanwhile miss pinnegar pursued the sober and even tenor of her own way whilst james lashed out to use the local phrase in robes and suits miss pinnegar steadily ground away producing strong indestructible shirts and singlets for the colliers sound serviceable aprons for the colliers wives good print dresses for servants and so on she executed no flights of fancy she had her goods made to suit her people and so underneath the foam and froth of james creative adventure flowed a slow but steady stream of output and income the women of woodhouse came at last to depend on miss pinnegar growing lads in the pit reduce their garments to shreds with amazing expedition ill go to miss pinnegar for thy shirts this time my lad said the harassed mothers and see if theyll stand thee it was almost like a threat but it served manchester house  james bought very little stock in these days just remnants and pieces for his immortal robes it was miss pinnegar who saw the travellers and ordered the unions and calicoes and grey flannel james hovered round and said the last word of course but what was his last word but an echo of miss pinnegars penultimate he was not interested in unions and twills  his own stock remained on hand time like a slow whirlpool churned it over into sight and out of sight like a mass of dead seaweed in a backwash there was a regular series of sales fortnightly the display of creations fell off the new entertainment was the fridaynights sale james would attack some portion of his stock make a wild jumble of it spend a delirious wednesday and thursday marking down and then open on friday afternoon in the evening there was a crush a good moiré underskirt for oneandeleventhree was not to be neglected and a handsome stringlace collarette for sixthree would iron out and be worth at least threeandsix that was how it went it would nearly all of it iron out into something really nice poor james crumpled stock his fine semitransparent face flushed pink his eyes flashed as he took in the sixpences and handed back knots of tape or packets of pins for the notorious farthings what matter if the farthing change had originally cost him a halfpenny his shop was crowded with women peeping and pawing and turning things over and commenting in loud unfeeling tones for there were still many comic items once for example he suddenly heaped up piles of hats trimmed and untrimmed the weirdest sauciest most screaming shapes woodhouse enjoyed itself that night  and all the time in her quiet polite thinkthemore fashion miss pinnegar waited on the people showing them considerable forbearance and just a tinge of contempt she became very tired those eveningsher hair under its invisible hairnet became flatter her cheeks hung down purplish and mottled but while james stood she stood the people did not like her yet she influenced them and the stock slowly wilted withered some was scrapped the shop seemed to have digested some of its indigestible contents  james accumulated sixpences in a miserly fashion luckily for her workgirls miss pinnegar took her own orders and received payments for her own productions some of her regular customers paid her a shilling a weekor less but it made a small steady income she reserved her own modest share paid the expenses of her department and left the residue to james  james had accumulated sixpences and made a little space in his shop he had desisted from creations time now for a new flight he decided it was better to be a manufacturer than a tradesman his shop already only half its original size was again too big it might be split once more rents had risen in woodhouse why not cut off another shop from his premises  no sooner said than done in came the architect with whom he had played many a game of chess best said the architect take off one goodsized shop rather than halve the premises james would be left a little cramped a little tight with only onethird of his present space but as we age we dwindle  more hammering and alterations and james found himself cooped in a long long narrow shop very dark at the back with a high oblong window and a door that came in at a pinched corner next door to him was a cheerful new grocer of the cheap and florid type the new grocer whistled just like the ivy and shouted boisterously to his shopboy in his doorway protruding on james sensitive vision was a pyramid of sixpencehalfpenny tins of salmon red shiny tins with pink halved salmons depicted and another yellow pyramid of fourpencehalfpenny tins of pineapple bacon dangled in pale rolls almost over james doorway whilst straw and paper redolent of cheese lard and stale eggs filtered through the threshold  this was coming down in the world with a vengeance but what james lost downstairs he tried to recover upstairs heaven knows what he would have done but for miss pinnegar she kept her own workrooms against him with a soft heavy silent tenacity that would have beaten stronger men than james but his strength lay in his pliability he rummaged in the empty lofts and among the discarded machinery he rigged up the engines afresh bought two new machines and started an elastic department making elastic for garters and for hatchins  he was immensely proud of his first cards of elastic and saw dame fortune this time fast in his yielding hands but becoming used to disillusionment he almost welcomed it within six months he realized that every inch of elastic cost him exactly sixty per cent more than he could sell it for and so he scrapped his new department luckily he sold one machine and even gained two pounds on it  after this he made one last effort this was hosiery webbing which could be cut up and made into asyetunheardof garments miss pinnegar kept her thumb on this enterprise so that it was not much more than abortive and then james left her alone  meanwhile the shop slowly churned its oddments every thursday afternoon james sorted out tangles of bits and bobs antique garments and occasional finds with these he trimmed his window so that it looked like a historical museum rather soiled and scrappy indoors he made baskets of assortments threepenny sixpenny ninepenny and shilling baskets rather like a bran pie in which everything was a plum and then on friday evening thin and alert he hovered behind the counter his coat shabbily buttoned over his narrow chest his face agitated he had shaved his sidewhiskers so that they only grew becomingly as low as his ears his rather large grey moustache was brushed off his mouth his hair gone very thin was brushed frail and floating over his baldness but still a gentleman still courteous with a charming voice he suggested the possibilities of a pad of green parrots tailfeathers or of a few yards of pinkpearl trimming or of old chenille fringe the women would pinch the thick exquisite old chenille fringe delicate and faded curious to feel its softness but they wouldnt give threepence for it tapes ribbons braids buttons feathers jabots bussels appliqués fringes jettrimmings bugletrimmings bundles of old coloured machinelace many bundles of strange cord in all colours for oldfashioned braidpatterning ribbons with hms birkenhead for boys sailor capseverything that nobody wanted did the women turn over and over till they chanced on a find and james quick eyes watched the slow surge of his flotsam as the pot boiled but did not boil away wonderful that he did not think of the days when these bits and bobs were new treasures but he did not  and at his side miss pinnegar quietly took orders for shirts discussed and agreed made measurements and received instalments  the shop was now only opened on friday afternoons and evenings so every day twice a day james was seen dithering bareheaded and hastily down the street as if pressed by fate to the conservative club and twice a day he was seen as hastily returning to his meals he was becoming an old man his daughter was a young woman but in his own mind he was just the same and his daughter was a little child his wife a young invalid whom he must charm by some few delicate attentionssuch as the peeled apple  at the club he got into more mischief he met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway the brickfield was called klondyke james had now a new direction to run in down hill towards bagthorpe to klondyke big pennydaisies grew in tufts on the brink of the yellow clay at klondyke yellow eggsandbacon spread their midsummer mats of flower james came home with clay smeared all over him discoursing brilliantly on grit and paste and presses and kilns and stamps he carried home a rough and pinkish brick and gloated over it it was a hard brick it was a nonporous brick it was an ugly brick painfully heavy and parchedlooking  this time he was sure dame fortune would rise like persephone out of the earth he was all the more sure because other men of the town were in with him at this venture sound moneyed grocers and plumbers they were all going to become rich  klondyke lasted a year and a half and was not so bad for in the end all things considered james had lost not more than five per cent of his money in fact all things considered he was about square and yet he felt klondyke as the greatest blow of all miss pinnegar would have aided and abetted him in another scheme if it would but have cheered him even miss frost was nice with him but to no purpose in the year after klondyke he became an old man he seemed to have lost all his feathers he acquired a plucked tottering look  yet he roused up after a coalstrike throttlehapenny put new life into him during a coalstrike the miners themselves began digging in the fields just near the houses for the surface coal they found a plentiful seam of drossy yellowish coal behind the methodist new connection chapel the seam was opened in the side of a bank and approached by a footrill a sloping shaft down which the men walked when the strike was over two or three miners still remained working the soft drossy coal which they sold for eightandsixpence a tonor sixpence a hundredweight but a mining population scorned such dirt as they called it  james houghton however was seized with a desire to work the connection meadow seam as he called it he gathered two miner partnershe trotted endlessly up to the field he talked as he had never talked before with inumerable colliers everybody he met he stopped to talk connection meadow  and so at last he sank a shaft sixty feet deep rigged up a corrugatediron enginehouse with a windingengine and lowered his men one at a time down the shaft in a big bucket the whole affair was ricketty amateurish and twopenny the name connection meadow was forgotten within three months everybody knew the place as throttlehapenny what said a collier to his wife have we got no coal youd better get a bit from throttlehapenny nay replied the wife im sure i shant im sure i shant burn that muck and smother myself with white ash  it was in the early throttlehapenny days that mrs houghton died james houghton cried and put a black band on his sunday silk hat but he was too feverishly busy at throttlehapenny selling his hundredweights of ashpit fodder as the natives called it to realize anything else  he had three men and two boys working his pit besides a superannuated old man driving the winding engine and in spite of all jeering he flourished shabby old coalcarts rambled up behind the new connection and filled from the pitbank the coal improved a little in quality it was cheap and it was handy james could sell at last fifty or sixty tons a week for the stuff was easy getting and now at last he was actually handling money he saw millions ahead  this went on for more than a year a year after the death of mrs houghton miss frost became ill and suddenly died again james houghton cried and trembled but it was throttlehapenny that made him tremble he trembled in all his limbs at the touch of success he saw himself making noble provision for his only daughter  but alasit is wearying to repeat the same thing over and over first the board of trade began to make difficulties then there was a fault in the seam then the roof of throttlehapenny was so loose and soft james could not afford timber to hold it up in short when his daughter alvina was about twentyseven years old throttlehapenny closed down there was a sale of poor machinery and james houghton came home to the dark gloomy houseto miss pinnegar and alvina  it was a pinched dreary house james seemed down for the last time but miss pinnegar persuaded him to take the shop again on friday evening for the rest faded and peaked he hurried shadowily down to the club     chapter ii  the rise of alvina houghton   the heroine of this story is alvina houghton if we leave her out of the first chapter of her own story it is because during the first twentyfive years of her life she really was left out of count or so overshadowed as to be negligible she and her mother were the phantom passengers in the ship of james houghtons fortunes  in manchester house every voice lowered its tone and so from the first alvina spoke with a quiet refined almost convent voice she was a thin child with delicate limbs and face and wide greyblue ironic eyes even as a small girl she had that odd ironic tilt of the eyelids which gave her a look as if she were hanging back in mockery if she were she was quite unaware of it for under miss frosts care she received no education in irony or mockery miss frost was straightforward goodhumoured and a little earnest consequently alvina or vina as she was called understood only the explicit mode of goodhumoured straightforwardness  it was doubtful which shadow was greater over the child that of manchester house gloomy and a little sinister or that of miss frost benevolent and protective sufficient that the girl herself worshipped miss frost or believed she did  alvina never went to school she had her lessons from her beloved governess she worked at the piano she took her walks and for social life she went to the congregational chapel and to the functions connected with the chapel while she was little she went to sunday school twice and to chapel once on sundays then occasionally there was a magic lantern or a penny reading to which miss frost accompanied her as she grew older she entered the choir at chapel she attended christian endeavour and psa and the literary society on monday evenings chapel provided her with a whole social activity in the course of which she met certain groups of people made certain friends found opportunity for strolls into the country and jaunts to the local entertainments over and above this every thursday evening she went to the subscription library to change the weeks supply of books and there again she met friends and acquaintances it is hard to overestimate the value of church or chapelbut particularly chapelas a social institution in places like woodhouse the congregational chapel provided alvina with a whole outer life lacking which she would have been poor indeed she was not particularly religious by inclination perhaps her fathers beautiful prayers put her off so she neither questioned nor accepted but just let be  she grew up a slim girl rather distinguished in appearance with a slender face a fine slightly arched nose and beautiful greyblue eyes over which the lids tilted with a very odd sardonic tilt the sardonic quality was however quite in abeyance she was ladylike not vehement at all in the street her walk had a delicate lingering motion her face looked still in conversation she had rather a quick hurried manner with intervals of wellbred repose and attention her voice was like her fathers flexible and curiously attractive  sometimes however she would have fits of boisterous hilarity not quite natural with a strange note half pathetic half jeering her father tended to a supercilious sneering tone in vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering this made miss frost uneasy she would watch the girls strange face that could take on a gargoyle look she would see the eyes rolling strangely under sardonic eyelids and then miss frost would feel that never never had she known anything so utterly alien and incomprehensible and unsympathetic as her own beloved vina for twenty years the strong protective governess reared and tended her lamb her dove only to see the lamb open a wolfs mouth to hear the dove utter the wild cackle of a daw or a magpie a strange sound of derision at such times miss frosts heart went cold within her she dared not realize and she chid and checked her ward restored her to the usual impulsive affectionate demureness then she dismissed the whole matter it was just an accidental aberration on the girls part from her own true nature miss frost taught alvina thoroughly the qualities of her own true nature and alvina believed what she was taught she remained for twenty years the demure refined creature of her governess desire but there was an odd derisive look at the back of her eyes a look of old knowledge and deliberate derision she herself was unconscious of it but it was there and this it was perhaps that scared away the young men  alvina reached the age of twentythree and it looked as if she were destined to join the ranks of the old maids so many of whom found cold comfort in the chapel for she had no suitors true there were extraordinarily few young men of her classfor whatever her condition she had certain breeding and inherent culturein woodhouse the young men of the same social standing as herself were in some curious way outsiders to her knowing nothing yet her ancient sapience went deep deeper than woodhouse could fathom the young men did not like her for it they did not like the tilt of her eyelids  miss frost with anxious foreseeing persuaded the girl to take over some pupils to teach them the piano the work was distasteful to alvina she was not a good teacher she persevered in an offhand way somewhat indifferent albeit dutiful  when she was twentythree years old alvina met a man called graham he was an australian who had been in edinburgh taking his medical degree before going back to australia he came to spend some months practising with old dr fordham in woodhousedr fordham being in some way connected with his mother  alexander graham called to see mrs houghton mrs houghton did not like him she said he was creepy he was a man of medium height dark in colouring with very dark eyes and a body which seemed to move inside his clothing he was amiable and polite laughed often showing his teeth it was his teeth which miss frost could not stand she seemed to see a strong mouthful of cruel compact teeth she declared he had dark blood in his veins that he was not a man to be trusted and that never never would he make any womans life happy  yet in spite of all alvina was attracted by him the two would stay together in the parlour laughing and talking by the hour what they could find to talk about was a mystery yet there they were laughing and chatting with a running insinuating sound through it all which made miss frost pace up and down unable to bear herself  the man was always running in when miss frost was out he contrived to meet alvina in the evening to take a walk with her he went a long walk with her one night and wanted to make love to her but her upbringing was too strong for her  oh no she said we are only friends  he knew her upbringing was too strong for him also  were more than friends he said were more than friends  i dont think so she said  yes we are he insisted trying to put his arm round her waist  oh dont she cried let us go home  and then he burst out with wild and thick protestations of love which thrilled her and repelled her slightly  anyhow i must tell miss frost she said  yes yes he answered yes yes let us be engaged at once  as they passed under the lamps he saw her face lifted the eyes shining the delicate nostrils dilated as of one who scents battle and laughs to herself she seemed to laugh with a certain proud sinister recklessness his hands trembled with desire  so they were engaged he bought her a ring an emerald set in tiny diamonds miss frost looked grave and silent but would not openly deny her approval  you like him dont you you dont dislike him alvina insisted  i dont dislike him replied miss frost how can i he is a perfect stranger to me  and with this alvina subtly contented herself her father treated the young man with suave attention punctuated by fits of jerky hostility and jealousy her mother merely sighed and took sal volatile  to tell the truth alvina herself was a little repelled by the mans lovemaking she found him fascinating but a trifle repulsive and she was not sure whether she hated the repulsive element or whether she rather gloried in it she kept her look of arch halfderisive recklessness which was so unbearably painful to miss frost and so exciting to the dark little man it was a strange look in a refined really virgin girloddly sinister and her voice had a curious bronzelike resonance that acted straight on the nerves of her hearers unpleasantly on most english nerves but like fire on the different susceptibilities of the young manthe darkie as people called him  but after all he had only six weeks in england before sailing to sydney he suggested that he and alvina should marry before he sailed miss frost would not hear of it he must see his people first she said  so the time passed and he sailed alvina missed him missed the extreme excitement of him rather than the human being he was miss frost set to work to regain her influence over her ward to remove that arch reckless almost lewd look from the girls face it was a question of heart against sensuality miss frost tried and tried to wake again the girls loving heartwhich loving heart was certainly not occupied by that man it was a hard task an anxious bitter task miss frost had set herself  but at last she succeeded alvina seemed to thaw the hard shining of her eyes softened again to a sort of demureness and tenderness the influence of the man was revoked the girl was left uninhabited empty and uneasy  she was due to follow her alexander in three months time to sydney came letters from him en routeand then a cablegram from australia he had arrived alvina should have been preparing her trousseau to follow but owing to her change of heart she lingered indecisive  do you love him dear said miss frost with emphasis knitting her thick passionate earnest eyebrows do you love him sufficiently thats the point  the way miss frost put the question implied that alvina did not and could not love himbecause miss frost could not alvina lifted her large blue eyes confused halftender towards her governess half shining with unconscious derision  i dont really know she said laughing hurriedly i dont really  miss frost scrutinized her and replied with a meaningful  well  to miss frost it was clear as daylight to alvina not so in her periods of lucidity when she saw as clear as daylight also she certainly did not love the little man she felt him a terrible outsider an inferior to tell the truth she wondered how he could have the slightest attraction for her in fact she could not understand it at all she was as free of him as if he had never existed the square green emerald on her finger was almost nonsensical she was quite quite sure of herself  and then most irritating a complete volte face in her feelings the clearasdaylight mood disappeared as daylight is bound to disappear she found herself in a night where the little man loomed large terribly large potent and magical while miss frost had dwindled to nothingness at such times she wished with all her force that she could travel like a cablegram to australia she felt it was the only way she felt the dark passionate receptivity of alexander overwhelmed her enveloped her even from the antipodes she felt herself going distractedshe felt she was going out of her mind for she could not act  her mother and miss frost were fixed in one line her father said  well of course youll do as you think best theres a great risk in going so fara great risk you would be entirely unprotected  i dont mind being unprotected said alvina perversely  because you dont understand what it means said her father  he looked at her quickly perhaps he understood her better than the others  personally said miss pinnegar speaking of alexander i dont care for him but every one has their own taste  alvina felt she was being overborne and that she was letting herself be overborne she was half relieved she seemed to nestle into the wellknown surety of woodhouse the other unknown had frightened her  miss frost now took a definite line  i feel you dont love him dear im almost sure you dont so now you have to choose your mother dreads your goingshe dreads it i am certain you would never see her again she says she cant bear itshe cant bear the thought of you out there with alexander it makes her shudder she suffers dreadfully you know so you will have to choose dear you will have to choose for the best  alvina was made stubborn by pressure she herself had come fully to believe that she did not love him she was quite sure she did not love him but out of a certain perversity she wanted to go  came his letter from sydney and one from his parents to her and one to her parents all seemed straightforwardnot very cordial but sufficiently over alexanders letter miss frost shed bitter tears to her it seemed so shallow and heartless with terms of endearment stuck in like exclamation marks he semed to have no thought no feeling for the girl herself all he wanted was to hurry her out there he did not even mention the grief of her parting from her english parents and friends not a word just a rush to get her out there winding up with and now dear i shall not be myself till i see you here in sydneyyour everloving alexander a selfish sensual creature who would forget the dear little vina in three months if she did not turn up and who would neglect her in six months if she did probably miss frost was right  alvina knew the tears she was costing all round she went upstairs and looked at his photographhis dark and impertinent muzzle who was he after all she did not know him with cold eyes she looked at him and found him repugnant  she went across to her governesss room and found miss frost in a strange mood of trepidation  dont trust me dear dont trust what i say poor miss frost ejaculated hurriedly even wildly dont notice what i have said act for yourself dear act for yourself entirely i am sure i am wrong in trying to influence you i know i am wrong it is wrong and foolish of me act just for yourself dearthe rest doesnt matter the rest doesnt matter dont take any notice of what i have said i know i am wrong  for the first time in her life alvina saw her beloved governess flustered the beautiful white hair looking a little draggled the grey nearsighted eyes so deep and kind behind the goldrimmed glasses now distracted and scared alvina immediately burst into tears and flung herself into the arms of miss frost miss frost also cried as if her heart would break catching her indrawn breath with a strange sound of anguish forlornness the terrible crying of a woman with a loving heart whose heart has never been able to relax alvina was hushed in a second she became the elder of the two the terrible poignancy of the woman of fiftytwo who now at last had broken down silenced the girl of twentythree and roused all her passionate tenderness the terrible sound of never now never nowit is too late which seemed to ring in the curious indrawn cries of the elder woman filled the girl with a deep wisdom she knew the same would ring in her mothers dying cry married or unmarried it was the samethe same anguish realized in all its pain after the age of fiftythe loss in never having been able to relax to submit  alvina felt very strong and rich in the fact of her youth for her it was not too late for miss frost it was for ever too late  i dont want to go dear said alvina to the elder woman i know i dont care for him he is nothing to me  miss frost became gradually silent and turned aside her face after this there was a hush in the house alvina announced her intention of breaking off her engagement her mother kissed her and cried and said with the selfishness of an invalid  i couldnt have parted with you i couldnt whilst the father said  i think you are wise vina i have thought a lot about it  so alvina packed up his ring and his letters and little presents and posted them over the seas she was relieved really as if she had escaped some very trying ordeal for some days she went about happily in pure relief she loved everybody she was charming and sunny and gentle with everybody particularly with miss frost whom she loved with a deep tender rather sore love poor miss frost seemed to have lost a part of her confidence to have taken on a new wistfulness a new silence and remoteness it was as if she found her busy contact with life a strain now perhaps she was getting old perhaps her proud heart had given way  alvina had kept a little photograph of the man she would often go and look at it loveno it was not love it was something more primitive still it was curiosity deep radical burning curiosity how she looked and looked at his dark impertinentseeming face a flicker of derision came into her eyes yet still she looked  in the same manner she would look into the faces of the young men of woodhouse but she never found there what she found in her photograph they all seemed like blank sheets of paper in comparison there was a curious pale surfacelook in the faces of the young men of woodhouse or if there was some underneath suggestive power it was a little abject or humiliating inferior common they were all either blank or common     chapter iii  the maternity nurse   of course alvina made everybody pay for her mood of submission and sweetness in a months time she was quite intolerable  i cant stay here all my life she declared stretching her eyes in a way that irritated the other inmates of manchester house extremely i know i cant i cant bear it i simply cant bear it and theres an end of it i cant i tell you i cant bear it im buried alivesimply buried alive and its more than i can stand it is really  there was an odd clang like a taunt in her voice she was trying them all  but what do you want dear asked miss frost knitting her dark brows in agitation  i want to go away said alvina bluntly  miss frost gave a slight gesture with her right hand of helpless impatience it was so characteristic that alvina almost laughed  but where do you want to go asked miss frost  i dont know i dont care said alvina anywhere if i can get out of woodhouse  do you wish you had gone to australia put in miss pinnegar  no i dont wish i had gone to australia retorted alvina with a rude laugh australia isnt the only other place besides woodhouse  miss pinnegar was naturally offended but the curious insolence which sometimes came out in the girl was inherited direct from her father  you see dear said miss frost agitated if you knew what you wanted it would be easier to see the way  i want to be a nurse rapped out alvina  miss frost stood still with the stillness of a middleaged disapproving woman and looked at her charge she believed that alvina was just speaking at random yet she dared not check her in her present mood  alvina was indeed speaking at random she had never thought of being a nursethe idea had never entered her head if it had she would certainly never have entertained it but she had heard alexander speak of nurse this and sister that and so she had rapped out her declaration and having rapped it out she prepared herself to stick to it nothing like leaping before you look  a nurse repeated miss frost but do you feel yourself fitted to be a nurse do you think you could bear it  yes im sure i could retorted alvina i want to be a maternity nurse she looked strangely even outrageously at her governess i want to be a maternity nurse then i shouldnt have to attend operations and she laughed quickly  miss frosts right hand beat like a wounded bird it was reminiscent of the way she beat time insistently when she was giving music lessons sitting close beside her pupils at the piano now it beat without time or reason alvina smiled brightly and cruelly  whatever put such an idea into your head vina asked poor miss frost  i dont know said alvina still more archly and brightly  of course you dont mean it dear said miss frost quailing  yes i do why should i say it if i dont  miss frost would have done anything to escape the arch bright cruel eyes of her charge  then we must think about it she said numbly and she went away  alvina floated off to her room and sat by the window looking down on the street the bright arch look was still on her face but her heart was sore she wanted to cry and fling herself on the breast of her darling but she couldnt no for her life she couldnt some little devil sat in her breast and kept her smiling archly  somewhat to her amazement he sat steadily on for days and days every minute she expected him to go every minute she expected to break down to burst into tears and tenderness and reconciliation but noshe did not break down she persisted they all waited for the old loving vina to be herself again but the new and recalcitrant vina still shone hard she found a copy of the lancet and saw an advertisement of a home in islington where maternity nurses would be fully trained and equipped in six months time the fee was sixty guineas alvina declared her intention of departing to this training home she had two hundred pounds of her own bequeathed by her grandfather  in manchester house they were all horrifiednot moved with grief this time but shocked it seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take which it was and which in her curious perverseness alvina must have intended it to be mrs houghton assumed a remote air of silence as if she did not hear any more did not belong she lapsed far away she was really very weak miss pinnegar said well really if she wants to do it why she might as well try and as often with miss pinnegar this speech seemed to contain a veiled threat  a maternity nurse said james houghton a maternity nurse what exactly do you mean by a maternity nurse  a trained midwife said miss pinnegar curtly thats it isnt it it is as far as i can see a trained midwife  yes of course said alvina brightly  but stammered james houghton pushing his spectacles up on to his forehead and making his long fleece of painfully thin hair uncover his baldness i cant understand that any young girl of anyany upbringing any upbringing whatever should want to choose such asuch anoccupation i cant understand it  cant you said alvina brightly  oh well if she does said miss pinnegar cryptically  miss frost said very little but she had serious confidential talks with dr fordham dr fordham didnt approve certainly he didntbut neither did he see any great harm in it at that time it was rather the thing for young ladies to enter the nursing profession if their hopes had been blighted or checked in another direction and so enquiries were made enquiries were made  the upshot was that alvina was to go to islington for her six months training there was a great bustle preparing her nursing outfit instead of a trousseau nurses uniforms in fine blueandwhite stripe with great white aprons instead of a wreath of orange blossom a rather chic nurses bonnet of blue silk and for a trailing veil a blue silk fall  well and good alvina expected to become frightened as the time drew near but no she wasnt a bit frightened miss frost watched her narrowly would there not be a return of the old tender sensitive shrinking vinathe exquisitely sensitive and nervous loving girl no astounding as it may seem there was no return of such a creature alvina remained bright and ready the halfhilarious clang remained in her voice taunting she kissed them all goodbye brightly and sprightlily and off she set she wasnt nervous  she came to st pancras she got her cab she drove off to her destinationand as she drove she looked out of the window horrid vast stony dilapidated crumblystuccoed streets and squares of islington grey grey greyer by far than woodhouse and interminable how exceedingly sordid and disgusting but instead of being repelled and heartbroken alvina enjoyed it she felt her trunk rumble on the top of the cab and still she looked out on the ghastly dilapidated flat facades of islington and still she smiled brightly as if there were some charm in it all perhaps for her there was a charm in it all perhaps it acted like a tonic on the little devil in her breast perhaps if she had seen tufts of snowdropsit was februaryand yewhedges and cottage windows she would have broken down as it was she just enjoyed it she enjoyed glimpsing in through uncurtained windows into sordid rooms where human beings moved as if sordidly unaware she enjoyed the smell of a toasted bloater rather burnt so common so indescribably common and she detested bloaters because of the hairy feel of the spines in her mouth but to smell them like this to know that she was in the region of penny beefsteaks gave her a perverse pleasure  the cab stopped at a yellow house at the corner of a square where some shabby bare trees were flecked with bits of blown paper bits of paper and refuse cluttered inside the round railings of each tree she went up some dirtyyellowish steps and rang the patients bell because she knew she ought not to ring the tradesmens a servant not exactly dirty but unattractive let her into a hall painted a dull drab and floored with cocoamatting otherwise bare then up bare stairs to a room where a stout pale common woman with two warts on her face was drinking tea it was three oclock this was the matron the matron soon deposited her in a bedroom not very small but bare and hard and dustyseeming and there left her alvina sat down on her chair looked at her box opposite her looked round the uninviting room and smiled to herself then she rose and went to the window a very dirty window looking down into a sort of well of an area with other wells ranging along and straight opposite like a reflection another solid range of backpremises with iron stairways and horrid little doors and washing and little w cs and people creeping up and down like vermin alvina shivered a little but still smiled then slowly she began to take off her hat she put it down on the drabpainted chest of drawers  presently the servant came in with a tray set it down lit a naked gasjet which roared faintly and drew down a crackly darkgreen blind which showed a tendency to fly back again alertly to the ceiling  thank you said alvina and the girl departed  then miss houghton drank her black tea and ate her bread and margarine  surely enough books have been written about heroines in similar circumstances there is no need to go into the details of alvinas six months in islington  the food was objectionableyet alvina got fat on it the air was filthyand yet never had her colour been so warm and fresh her skin so soft her companions were almost without exception vulgar and coarseyet never had she got on so well with women of her own ageor older than herself she was ready with a laugh and a word and though she was unable to venture on indecencies herself yet she had an amazing faculty for looking knowing and indecent beyond words rolling her eyes and pitching her eyebrows in a certain wayoh it was quite sufficient for her companions and yet if they had ever actually demanded a dirty story or a really open indecency from her she would have been floored  but she enjoyed it amazing how she enjoyed it she did not care how revolting and indecent these nurses wereshe put on a look as if she were in with it all and it all passed off as easy as winking she swung her haunches and arched her eyes with the best of them and they behaved as if she were exactly one of themselves and yet with the curious cold tact of women they left her alone one and all in private just ignored her  it is truly incredible how alvina became blooming and bouncing at this time nothing shocked her nothing upset her she was always ready with her hard nurses laugh and her nurses quips no one was better than she at doubleentendres no one could better give the nurses leer she had it all in a fortnight and never once did she feel anything but exhilarated and in full swing it seemed to her she had not a moments time to brood or reflect about thingsshe was too much in the swing every moment in the swing living or active in full swing when she got into bed she went to sleep when she awoke it was morning and she got up as soon as she was up and dressed she had somebody to answer something to say something to do time passed like an express trainand she seemed to have known no other life than this  not far away was a lyingin hospital a dreadful place it was there she had to go right off and help with cases there she had to attend lectures and demonstrations there she met the doctors and students well a pretty lot they were one way and another when she had put on flesh and become pink and bouncing she was just their sort just their very ticket her voice had the right twang her eyes the right roll her haunches the right swing she seemed altogether just the ticket and yet she wasnt  it would be useless to say she was not shocked she was profoundly and awfully shocked her whole state was perhaps largely the result of shock a sort of playacting based on hysteria but the dreadful things she saw in the lyingin hospital and afterwards went deep and finished her youth and her tutelage for ever how many infernos deeper than miss frost could ever know did she not travel the inferno of the human animal the human organism in its convulsions the human social beast in its abjection and its degradation  for in her latter half she had to visit the slum cases and such cases a woman lying on a bare filthy floor a few old coats thrown over her and vermin crawling everywhere in spite of sanitary inspectors but what did the woman the sufferer herself care she ground her teeth and screamed and yelled with pains in her calm periods she lay stupid and indifferentor she cursed a little but abject stupid indifference was the bottom of it all abject brutal indifference to everythingyes everything just a piece of female functioning no more  alvina was supposed to receive a certain fee for these cases she attended in their homes a small proportion of her fee she kept for herself the rest she handed over to the home that was the agreement she received her grudged fee callously threatened and exacted it when it was not forthcoming haif they didnt have to pay you at all these slumpeople they would treat you with more contempt than if you were one of themselves it was one of the hardest lessons alvina had to learnto bully these people in their own hovels into some sort of obedience to her commands and some sort of respect for her presence she had to fight tooth and nail for this end and in a week she was as hard and callous to them as they to her and so her work was well done she did not hate them there they were they had a certain life and you had to take them at their own worth in their own way what else if one should be gentle one was gentle the difficulty did not lie there the difficulty lay in being sufficiently rough and hard that was the trouble it cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough glad she would have been to be allowed to treat them quietly and gently with consideration but pahit was not their line they wanted to be callous and if you were not callous to match they made a fool of you and prevented your doing your work  was alvina her own real self all this time the mighty question arises upon us what is ones own real self it certainly is not what we think we are and ought to be alvina had been bred to think of herself as a delicate tender chaste creature with unselfish inclinations and a pure high mind well so she was in the moreorless exhausted part of herself but highmindedness had really come to an end with james houghton had really reached the point not only of pathetic but of dry and antihuman repulsive quixotry in alvina highmindedness was already stretched beyond the breaking point being a woman of some flexibility of temper wrought through generations to a fine pliant hardness she flew back she went right back on highmindedness did she thereby betray it  we think not if we turn over the head of the penny and look at the tail we dont thereby deny or betray the head we do but adjust it to its own complement and so with highmindedness it is but one side of the medalthe crowned reverse on the obverse the three legs still go kicking the softfooted spin of the universe the dolphin flirts and the crab leers  so alvina spun her medal and her medal came down tails heads or tails heads for generations then tails see the poetic justice  now alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate or rather being sufficiently a woman she didnt decide anything she was her own fate she went through her training experiences like another being she was not herself said everybody when she came home to woodhouse at easter in her bonnet and cloak everybody was simply knocked out imagine that this frail pallid diffident girl so ladylike was now a rather fat warmcoloured young woman strapping and stronglooking and with a certain bounce imagine her mothers startled almost expiring  why vina dear  vina laughed she knew how they were all feeling  at least it agrees with your health said her father sarcastically to which miss pinnegar answered  well thats a good deal  but miss frost said nothing the first day only the second day at breakfast as alvina ate rather rapidly and rather well the whitehaired woman said quietly with a tinge of cold contempt  how changed you are dear  am i laughed alvina oh not really and she gave the arch look with her eyes which made miss frost shudder  inwardly miss frost shuddered and abstained from questioning alvina was always speaking of the doctors doctor young and doctor headley and doctor james she spoke of theatres and musichalls with these young men and the jolly good time she had with them and her bluegrey eyes seemed to have become harder and greyer lighter somehow in her wistfulness and her tender pathos alvinas eyes would deepen their blue so beautiful and now in her floridity they were bright and arch and lightgrey the deep tender flowery blue was gone for ever they were luminous and crystalline like the eyes of a changeling  miss frost shuddered and abstained from question she wanted she needed to ask of her charge alvina have you betrayed yourself with any of these young men but coldly her heart abstained from askingor even from seriously thinking she left the matter untouched for the moment she was already too much shocked  certainly alvina represented the young doctors as very nice but rather fast young fellows my word you have to have your wits about you with them imagine such a speech from a girl tenderly nurtured a speech uttered in her own home and accompanied by a florid laugh which would lead a chaste generous woman like miss frost to imaginewell she merely abstained from imagining anything she had that strength of mind she never for one moment attempted to answer the question to herself as to whether alvina had betrayed herself with any of these young doctors or not the question remained stated but completely unansweredcoldly awaiting its answer only when miss frost kissed alvina goodbye at the station tears came to her eyes and she said hurriedly in a low voice  remember we are all praying for you dear  no dont do that cried alvina involuntarily without knowing what she said  and then the train moved out and she saw her darling standing there on the station the pale wellmodelled face looking out from behind the goldrimmed spectacles wistfully the strong rather stout figure standing very still and unchangeable under its coat and skirt of dark purple the white hair glistening under the folded dark hat alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage she loved her darling she would love her through eternity she knew she was rightamply and beautifully right her darling her beloved miss frost eternally and gloriously right  and yetand yetit was a right which was fulfilled there were other rights there was another side to the medal purity and highmindednessthe beautiful but unbearable tyranny the beautiful unbearable tyranny of miss frost it was time now for miss frost to die it was time for that perfected flower to be gathered to immortality a lovely immortel but an obstruction to other purple and carmine blossoms which were in bud on the stem a lovely edelweissbut time it was gathered into eternity blackpurple and red anemones were due real adonis blood and strange individual orchids spotted and fantastic time for miss frost to die she alvina who loved her as no one else would ever love her with that love which goes to the core of the universe knew that it was time for her darling to be folded oh so gently and softly into immortality mortality was busy with the day after her day it was time for miss frost to die as alvina sat motionless in the train running from woodhouse to tibshelf it decided itself in her  she was glad to be back in islington among all the horrors of her confinement cases the doctors she knew hailed her on the whole these young men had not any too deep respect for the nurses as a whole why drag in respect human functions were too obviously established to make any great fuss about and so the doctors put their arms round alvinas waist because she was plump and they kissed her face because the skin was soft and she laughed and squirmed a little so that they felt all the more her warmth and softness under their arms pressure  its no use you know she said laughing rather breathless but looking into their eyes with a curious definite look of unchangeable resistance this only piqued them  whats no use they asked  she shook her head slightly  it isnt any use your behaving like that with me she said with the same challenging definiteness finality a flat negative  whore you telling they said  for she did not at all forbid them to behave like that not in the least she almost encouraged them she laughed and arched her eyes and flirted but her backbone became only the stronger and firmer soft and supple as she was her backbone never yielded for an instant it could not she had to confess that she liked the young doctors they were alert their faces were clean and brightlooking she liked the sort of intimacy with them when they kissed her and wrestled with her in the empty laboratories or corridorsoften in the intervals of most critical and appalling cases she liked their arm round her waist the kisses as she reached back her face straining away the sometimes desperate struggles they took unpardonable liberties they pinched her haunches and attacked her in unheardof ways sometimes her blood really came up in the fight and she felt as if with her hands she could tear any man any male creature limb from limb a superhuman voltaic force filled her for a moment she surged in massive inhuman female strength the men always wilted and invariably when they wilted she touched them with a sudden gentle touch pitying so that she always remained friends with them when her curious amazonic power left her again and she was just a mere woman she made shy eyes at them once more and treated them with the inevitable femaletomale homage  the men liked her they cocked their eyes at her when she was not looking and wondered at her they wondered over her they had been beaten by her every one of them but they did not openly know it they looked at her as if she were woman itself some creature not quite personal what they noticed all of them was the way her brown hair looped over her ears there was something chaste and noble and warlike about it the remote quality which hung about her in the midst of her intimacies and her frequencies nothing high or lofty but something given to the struggle and as yet invincible in the struggle made them seek her out  they felt safe with her they knew she would not let them down she would not intrigue into marriage or try and make use of them in any way she didnt care about them and so because of her isolate selfsufficiency in the fray her wild overweening backbone they were ready to attend on her and serve her headley in particular hoped he might overcome her he was a wellbuilt fellow with sandy hair and a pugnacious face the battlespirit was really roused in him and he heartily liked the woman if he could have overcome her he would have been mad to marry her  with him she summoned up all her mettle she had never to be off her guard for a single minute the treacherous suddenness of his attackfor he was treachery itselfhad to be met by the voltaic suddenness of her resistance and counterattack it was nothing less than magical the way the soft slumbering body of the woman could leap in one jet into terrible overwhelming voltaic force something strange and massive at the first treacherous touch of the mans determined hand his strength was so different from hersquick muscular lambent but hers was deep and heaving like the strange heaving of an earthquake or the heave of a bull as it rises from earth and by sheer nonhuman power electric and paralysing she could overcome the brawny redheaded fellow  he was nearly a match for her but she did not like him the two were enemiesand good acquaintances they were more or less matched but as he found himself continually foiled he became sulky like a bear with a sore head and then she avoided him  she really liked young and james much better james was a quick slender darkhaired fellow a gentleman who was always trying to catch her out with his quickness she liked his fine slim limbs and his exaggerated generosity he would ask her out to ridiculously expensive suppers and send her sweets and flowers fabulously recherché he was always immaculately welldressed  of course as a lady and a nurse he said to her you are two sorts of women in one  but she was not impressed by his wisdom  she was most strongly inclined to young he was a plump young man of middle height with those blue eyes of a little boy which are so knowing particularly of a womans secrets it is a strange thing that these childish men have such a deep halfperverse knowledge of the other sex young was certainly innocent as far as acts went yet his hair was going thin at the crown already  he also played with herbeing a doctor and she a nurse who encouraged it he too touched her and kissed her and did not rouse her to contest for his touch and his kiss had that nearness of a little boys which nearly melted her she could almost have succumbed to him if it had not been that with him there was no question of succumbing she would have had to take him between her hands and caress and cajole him like a cherub into a fall and though she would have like to do so yet that inflexible stiffness of her backbone prevented her she could not do as she liked there was an inflexible fate within her which shaped her ends  sometimes she wondered to herself over her own virginity was it worth much after all behaving as she did did she care about it anyhow didnt she rather despise it to sin in thought was as bad as to sin in act if the thought was the same as the act how much more was her behaviour equivalent to a whole committal she wished she were wholly committed she wished she had gone the whole length  but sophistry and wishing did her no good there she was still isolate and still there was that in her which would preserve her intact sophistry and deliberate intention notwithstanding her time was up she was returning to woodhouse virgin as she had left it in a measure she felt herself beaten why who knows but so it was she felt herself beaten condemned to go back to what she was before fate had been too strong for her and her desires fate which was not an external association of forces but which was integral in her own nature her own inscrutable nature was her fate sore against her will  it was august when she came home in her nurses uniform she was beaten by fate as far as chastity and virginity went but she came home with high material hopes here was james houghtons own daughter she had an affluent future ahead of her a fullyqualified maternity nurse she was going to bring all the babies of the district easily and triumphantly into the world she was going to charge the regulation fee of two guineas a case and even on a modest estimate of ten babies a month she would have twenty guineas for welltodo mothers she would charge from three to five guineas at this calculation she would make an easy three hundred a year without slaving either she would be independent she could laugh every one in the face  she bounced back into woodhouse to make her fortune     chapter iv  two women die   it goes without saying that alvina houghton did not make her fortune as a maternity nurse being her fathers daughter we might almost expect that she did not make a penny but she didjust a few pence she had exactly four casesand then no more  the reason is obvious who in woodhouse was going to afford a twoguinea nurse for a confinement and who who was going to engage alvina houghton even if they were ready to stretch their pursestrings after all they all knew her as miss houghton with a stress on the miss and they could not conceive of her as nurse houghton besides there seemed something positively indecent in technically engaging one who was so much part of themselves they all preferred either a simple midwife or a nurse procured out of the unknown by the doctor  if alvina wanted to make her fortuneor even her livingshe should have gone to a strange town she was so advised by every one she knew but she never for one moment reflected on the advice she had become a maternity nurse in order to practise in woodhouse just as james houghton had purchased his elegancies to sell in woodhouse and father and daughter alike calmly expected woodhouse demand to rise to their supply so both alike were defeated in their expectations  for a little while alvina flaunted about in her nurses uniform then she left it off and as she left it off she lost her bounce her colour and her flesh gradually she shrank back to the old slim reticent pallor with eyes a little too large for her face and now it seemed her face was a little too long a little gaunt and in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy shabby and altogether she looked older she looked more than her age which was only twentyfour years here was the old alvina come back rather battered and deteriorated apparently there was even a tiny touch of the trollops in her dowdinessso the shrewdeyed collierwives decided but she was a lady still and unbeaten undeniably she was a lady and that was rather irritating to the welltodo and florid daughter of wh johnson next door but one undeniably a lady and undeniably unmastered this last was irritating to the goodnatured but easycoming young men in the chapel choir where she resumed her seat these young men had the good nature of dogs that wag their tails and expect to be patted and alvina did not pat them to be sure a pat from such a shabbilyblackkidgloved hand would not have been so flatteringshe need not imagine it the way she hung back and looked at them the young men as knowing as if she were a prostitute and yet with the wellbred indifference of a ladywell it was almost offensive  as a matter of fact alvina was detached for the time being from her interest in young men manchester house had settled down on her like a doom there was the quartered shop through which one had to worm ones encumbered way in the gloomunless one liked to go miles round a back street to the yard entry there was james houghton faintly powdered with coaldust flitting back and forth in a fever of nervous frenzy to throttlehapennyso carried away that he never saw his daughter at all the first time he came in after her return and when she reminded him of her presence with herhello fatherhe merely glancied hurriedly at her as if vexed with her interruption and said  well alvina youre back youre back to find us busy and he went off into his ecstasy again  mrs houghton was now very weak and so nervous in her weakness that she could not bear the slightest sound her greatest horror was lest her husband should come into the room on his entry she became blue at the lips immediately so he had to hurry out again at last he stayed away only hurriedly asking each time he came into the house how is mrs houghton ha then off into uninterrupted throttlehapenny ecstasy once more  when alvina went up to her mothers room on her return all the poor invalid could do was to tremble into tears and cry faintly  child you look dreadful it isnt you  this from the pathetic little figure in the bed had struck alvina like a blow  why not mother she asked  but for her mother she had to remove her nurses uniform and at the same time she had to constitute herself nurse miss frost and a woman who came in and the servant had been nursing the invalid between them miss frost was worn and rather heavy her old buoyancy and brightness was gone she had become irritable also she was very glad that alvina had returned to take this responsibility of nursing off her shoulders for her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away  alvina said nothing but settled down to her task she was quiet and technical with her mother the two loved one another with a curious impersonal love which had not a single word to exchange an almost afterdeath love in these days mrs houghton never talkedunless to fret a little so alvina sat for many hours in the lofty sombre bedroom looking out silently on the street or hurriedly rising to attend the sick woman for continually came the fretful murmur  vina  to sit stillwho knows the long discipline of it nowadays as our mothers and grandmothers knew to sit still for days months and yearsperforce to sit still with some dignity of tranquil bearing alvina was oldfashioned she had the old womanly faculty for sitting quiet and collectednot indeed for a lifetime but for long spells together and so it was during these months nursing her mother she attended constantly on the invalid she did a good deal of work about the house she took her walks and occupied her place in the choir on sunday mornings and yet from august to january she seemed to be seated in her chair in the bedroom sometimes reading but mostly quite still her hands quietly in her lap her mind subdued by musing she did not even think not even remember even such activity would have made her presence too disturbing in the room she sat quite still with all her activities in abeyanceexcept that strange willtopassivity which was by no means a relaxation but a severe deep souldiscipline  for the moment there was a sense of prosperityor probable prosperity in the house and there was an abundance of throttlehapenny coal it was dirty ashy stuff the lower bars of the grate were constantly blanked in with white powdery ash which it was fatal to try to poke away for if you poked and poked you raised white cumulus clouds of ash and you were left at last with a few darkening and sulphurous embers but even so by continuous application you could keep the room moderately warm without feeling you were consuming the houses meat and drink in the grate which was one blessing  the days the months darkened past and alvina returned to her old thinness and pallor her forearms were thin they rested very still in her lap there was a ladylike stillness about them as she took her walk in her lingering yet watchful fashion she saw everything yet she passed without attracting any attention  early in the year her mother died her father came and wept selfconscious tears miss frost cried a little painfully and alvina cried also she did not quite know why or wherefore her poor mother alvina had the oldfashioned wisdom to let be and not to think after all it was not for her to reconstruct her parents lives she came after them her day was not their day their life was not hers returning upchannel to rediscover their course was quite another matter from flowing downstream into the unknown as they had done thirty years before this supercilious and impertinent exploration of the generation gone by by the present generation is nothing to our credit as a matter of fact no generation repeats the mistakes of the generation ahead any more than any river repeats its course so the young need not be so proud of their superiority over the old the young generation glibly makes its own mistakes and how detestable these new mistakes are why only the future will be able to tell us but be sure they are quite as detestable quite as full of lies and hypocrisy as any of the mistakes of our parents there is no such thing as absolute wisdom  wisdom has reference only to the past the future remains for ever an infinite field for mistakes you cant know beforehand  so alvina refrained from pondering on her mothers life and fate whatever the fate of the mother the fate of the daughter will be otherwise that is organically inevitable the business of the daughter is with her own fate not with her mothers  miss frost however meditated bitterly on the fate of the poor dead woman bitterly she brooded on the lot of woman here was clariss houghton married and a motherand dead what a life who was responsible james houghton what ought james houghton to have done differently everything in short he should have been somebody else and not himself which is the reductio ad absurdum of idealism the universe should be something else and not what it is so the nonsense of idealistic conclusion the cat should not catch the mouse the mouse should not nibble holes in the tablecloth and so on and so on in the house that jack built  but miss frost sat by the dead in grief and despair this was the end of another womans life such an end poor clariss guilty james  yet why why was james more guilty than clariss is the only aim and end of a mans life to make some woman or parcel of women happy why why should anybody expect to be made happy and develop heartdisease if she isnt surely clariss heartdisease was a more emphatic sign of obstinate selfimportance than ever james shopwindows were she expected to be made happy every woman in europe and america expects it on her own head then if she is made unhappy for her expectation is arrogant and impertinent the beall and endall of life doesnt lie in feminine happinessor in any happiness happiness is a sort of soaptablethe wont be happy till he gets it and when hes got it the precious baby itll cost him his eyes and his stomach could anything be more puerile than a mankind howling because it isnt happy like a baby in the bath  poor clariss however was deadand if she had developed heartdisease because she wasnt happy well she had died of her own heartdisease poor thing wherein lies every moral that mankind can wish to draw  miss frost wept in anguish and saw nothing but another woman betrayed to sorrow and a slow death sorrow and a slow death because a man had married her miss frost wept also for herself for her own sorrow and slow death sorrow and slow death because a man had not married her wretched man what is he to do with these exigeant and nevertobesatisfied women our mothers pined because our fathers drank and were rakes our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate who is this sphinx this woman where is the oedipus that will solve her riddle of happiness and then strangle heronly to marry his own mother  in the months that followed her mothers death alvina went on the same in abeyance she took over the housekeeping and received one or two overflow pupils from miss frost young girls to whom she gave lessons in the dark drawingroom of manchester house she was busychiefly with housekeeping there seemed a great deal to put in order after her mothers death  she sorted all her mothers clothesexpensive oldfashioned clothes hardly worn what was to be done with them she gave them away without consulting anybody she kept a few private things she inherited a few pieces of jewellery remarkable how little trace her mother lefthardly a trace  she decided to move into the big monumental bedroom in front of the house she liked space she liked the windows she was strictly mistress too so she took her place her mothers little sittingroom was cold and disused  then alvina went through all the linen there was still abundance and it was all sound james had had such large ideas of setting up house in the beginning and now he begrudged the household expenses begrudged the very soap and candles and even would have liked to introduce margarine instead of butter this last degradation the women refused but james was above food  the old alvina seemed completely herself again she was quiet dutiful affectionate she appealed in her old childish way to miss frost and miss frost called her dear with all the old protective gentleness but there was a difference underneath her appearance of appeal alvina was almost coldly independent she did what she thought she would the old manner of intimacy persisted between her and her darling and perhaps neither of them knew that the intimacy itself had gone but it had there was no spontaneous interchange between them it was a kind of deadlock each knew the great love she felt for the other but now it was a love static inoperative the warm flow did not run any more yet each would have died for the other would have done anything to spare the other hurt  miss frost was becoming tired dragged looking she would sink into a chair as if she wished never to rise againnever to make the effort and alvina quickly would attend on her bring her tea and take away her music try to make everything smooth and continually the young woman exhorted the elder to work less to give up her pupils but miss frost answered quickly nervously  when i dont work i shant live  but why came the long query from alvina and in her expostulation there was a touch of mockery for such a creed  miss frost did not answer her face took on a greyish tinge  in these days alvina struck up an odd friendship with miss pinnegar after so many years of opposition she felt herself more in sympathy with miss pinnegarit was so easy to get on with her she left so much unsaid what was left unsaid mattered more to alvina now than anything that was expressed she began to hate outspokenness and direct speakingforth of the whole mind it nauseated her she wanted tacit admission of difference not open wholehearted communication and miss pinnegar made this admission all along she never made you feel for an instant that she was one with you she was never even near she kept quietly on her own ground and left you on yours and across the space came her quiet commonplacesbut fraught with space  with miss frost all was openness explicit and downright not that miss frost trespassed she was far more wellbred than miss pinnegar but her very breeding had that protestant northern quality which assumes that we have all the same high standards really and all the same divine nature intrinsically it is a fine assumption but willynilly it sickened alvina at this time  she preferred miss pinnegar and admired miss pinnegars humble wisdom with a new admiration the two were talking of dr headley who they read in the newspaper had disgraced himself finally  i suppose said miss pinnegar it takes his sort to make all sorts  such bits of homely wisdom were like relief from cramp and pain to alvina it takes his sort to make all sorts it took her sort too and it took her fathers sortas well as her mothers and miss frosts it took every sort to make all sorts why have standards and a regulation pattern why have a human criterion theres the point why in the name of all the free heavens have human criteria why simply for bullying and narrowness  alvina felt at her ease with miss pinnegar the two women talked away to one another in their quiet moments and slipped apart like conspirators when miss frost came in as if there was something to be ashamed of if there was heaven knows what it might have been for their talk was ordinary enough but alvina liked to be with miss pinnegar in the kitchen miss pinnegar wasnt competent and masterful like miss frost she was ordinary and uninspired with quiet unobserved movements but she was deep and there was some secret satisfaction in her very quality of secrecy  so the days and weeks and months slipped by and alvina was hidden like a mole in the dark chambers of manchester house busy with cooking and cleaning and arranging getting the house in her own order and attending to her pupils she took her walk in the afternoon once and only once she went to throttlehapenny and seized with sudden curiosity insisted on being wound down in the iron bucket to the little workings underneath everything was quite tidy in the short gangways down below timbered and in sound order the miners were competent enough but water dripped dismally in places and there was a stale feeling in the air  her father accompanied her pointed her to the seam of yellowflecked coal the shale and the bind the direction of the trend he had already an airyfairy kind of knowledge of the whole affair and seemed like some not quite trustworthy conjuror who had conjured it all up by sleight of hand in the background the miners stood grey and ghostly in the candlelight and seemed to listen sardonically one of them facile in his subordinate way as james in his authoritative kept chiming in  ay thats the road it goes miss huffenyis yoll see th roof theer bellies down a bits loose no you dunna get th puddin stones i this pits not deep enough eh they come down on you plumb as if th roof had laid its egg on you ay it runs a bit thin down heresix inches you see th beds soft its a sort o claybind its not clunch such as you get deeper oh its easy workinyou dont have to knock your guts out theres no need for shots miss huffenwe bring it downyou see here and he stooped pointing to a shallow shelving excavation which he was making under the coal the working was low you must stoop all the time the roof and the timbered sides of the way seemed to press on you it was as if she were in her tomb for ever like the dead and everlasting egyptians she was frightened but fascinated the collier kept on talking to her stretching his bare greyblack hairy arm across her vision and pointing with his knotted hand the thickwicked tallow candles guttered and smelled there was a thickness in the air a sense of dark fluid presence in the thick atmosphere the dark fluid viscous voice of the collier making a broadvowelled clapping sound in her ear he seemed to linger near her as if he knewas if he knewwhat something for ever unknowable and inadmissible something that belonged purely to the underground to the slaves who work underground knowledge humiliated subjected but ponderous and inevitable and still his voice went on clapping in her ear and still his presence edged near her and seemed to impinge on hera smallish semigrotesque greyobscure figure with a naked brandished forearm not human a creature of the subterranean world melted out like a bat fluid she felt herself melting out also to become a mere vocal ghost a presence in the thick atmosphere her lungs felt thick and slow her mind dissolved she felt she could cling like a bat in the long swoon of the crannied underworld darkness cling like a bat and sway for ever swooning in the draughts of the darkness  when she was up on the earth again she blinked and peered at the world in amazement what a pretty luminous place it was carved in substantial luminosity what a strange and lovely place bubbling iridescentgolden on the surface of the underworld iridescent goldencould anything be more fascinating like lovely glancing surface on fluid pitch but a velvet surface a velvet surface of golden light velvetpile of gold and pale luminosity and strange beautiful elevations of houses and trees and depressions of fields and roads all golden and floating like atmospheric majolica never had the common ugliness of woodhouse seemed so entrancing she thought she had never seen such beautya lovely luminous majolica living and palpitating the glossy svelte worldsurface the exquisite face of all the darkness it was like a vision perhaps gnomes and subterranean workers enslaved in the era of light see with such eyes perhaps that is why they are absolutely blind to conventional ugliness for truly nothing could be more hideous than woodhouse as the miners had built it and disposed it and yet the very cabbagestumps and rotten fences of the gardens the very backyards were instinct with magic molten as they seemed with the bubblingup of the underdarkness bubbling up of majolica weight and luminosity quite ignorant of the sky heavy and satisfying  slaves of the underworld she watched the swing of the grey colliers along the pavement with a new fascination hypnotized by a new vision slavesthe underground trolls and ironworkers magic mischievous and enslaved of the ancient stories but tallthe miners seemed to her to loom tall and grey in their enslaved magic slaves who would cause the superimposed dayorder to fall not because individually they wanted to but because collectively something bubbled up in them the force of darkness which had no master and no control it would bubble and stir in them as earthquakes stir the earth it would be simply disastrous because it had no master there was no dark master in the world the puerile world went on crying out for a new jesus another saviour from the sky another heavenly superman when what was wanted was a dark master from the underworld  so they streamed past her home from workgrey from head to foot distorted in shape cramped with curious faces that came out pallid from under their dirt their walk was heavyfooted and slurring their bearing stiff and grotesque a stream they wereyet they seemed to her to loom like strange valid figures of fairylore unrealized and as yet unexperienced the miners the ironworkers those who fashion the stuff of the underworld  as it always comes to its children the nostalgia of the repulsive heavyfooted midlands came over her again even whilst she was there in the midst the curious dark inexplicable and yet insatiable cravingas if for an earthquake to feel the earth heave and shudder and shatter the world from beneath to go down in the débâcle  and so in spite of everything poverty dowdiness obscurity and nothingness she was content to stay in abeyance at home for the time true she was filled with the same old slow dreadful craving of the midlands a craving insatiable and inexplicable but the very craving kept her still for at this time she did not translate it into a desire or need for love at the back of her mind somewhere was the fixed idea the fixed intention of finding love a man but as yet at this period the idea was in abeyance it did not act the craving that possessed her as it possesses everybody in a greater or less degree in those parts sustained her darkly and unconsciously  a hot summer waned into autumn the long bewildering days drew in the transient nights only a few breaths of shadow between noon and noon deepened and strengthened a restlessness came over everybody there was another short strike among the miners james houghton like an excited beetle scurried to and fro feeling he was making his fortune never had woodhouse been so thronged on fridays with purchasers and moneyspenders the place seemed surcharged with life  autumn lasted beautiful till end of october and then suddenly cold rain endless cold rain and darkness heavy wet ponderous through the wind and rain it was a toil to move poor miss frost who had seemed almost to blossom again in the long hot days regaining a free cheerfulness that amounted almost to liveliness and who even caused a sort of scandal by her intimacy with a rather handsome but common stranger an insurance agent who had come into the place with a good unused tenor voicenow she wilted again she had given the rather florid young man tea in her room and had laboured away at his fine metallic voice correcting him and teaching him and laughing with him and spending really a remarkable number of hours alone with him in her room in woodhousefor she had given up tramping the country and had hired a musicroom in a quiet street where she gave her lessons and the young man had hung round and had never wanted to go away they would prolong their têteàtête and their singing on till ten oclock at night and miss frost would return to manchester house flushed and handsome and a little shy while the young man who was common took on a new boldness in the streets he had auburn hair high colouring and a rather challenging bearing he took on a new boldness his own estimate of himself rose considerably with miss frost and his trained voice to justify him he was a little insolent and condescending to the natives who disliked him for their lives they could not imagine what miss frost could find in him they began even to dislike her and a pretty scandal was started about the pair in the pleasant room where miss frost had her piano her books and her flowers the scandal was as unjust as most scandals are yet truly all that summer and autumn miss frost had a new and slightly aggressive cheerfulness and humour and manchester house saw little of her comparatively  and then at the end of september the young man was removed by his insurance company to another district and at the end of october set in the most abominable and unbearable weather deluges of rain and north winds cutting the tender summerunfolded people to pieces miss frost wilted at once a silence came over her she shuddered when she had to leave the fire she went in the morning to her room and stayed there all the day in a hot close atmosphere shuddering when her pupils brought the outside weather with them to her  she was always subject to bronchitis in november she had a bad bronchitis cold then suddenly one morning she could not get up alvina went in and found her semiconscious  the girl was almost mad she flew to the rescue she despatched her father instantly for the doctor she heaped the sticks in the bedroom grate and made a bright fire she brough hot milk and brandy  thank you dear thank you its a bronchial cold whispered miss frost hurriedly trying to sip the milk she could not she didnt want it  ive sent for the doctor said alvina in her cool voice wherein none the less there rang the old hesitancy of sheer love  miss frost lifted her eyes  theres no need she said and she smiled winsomely at alvina  it was pneumonia useless to talk of the distracted anguish of alvina during the next two days she was so swift and sensitive in her nursing she seemed to have second sight she talked to nobody in her silence her soul was alone with the soul of her darling the long semiconsciousness and the tearing pain of pneumonia the anguished sickness  but sometimes the grey eyes would open and smile with delicate winsomeness at alvina and alvina smiled back with a cheery answering winsomeness but that costs something  on the evening of the second day miss frost got her hand from under the bedclothes and laid it on alvinas hand alvina leaned down to her  everything is for you my love whispered miss frost looking with strange eyes on alvinas face  dont talk miss frost moaned alvina  everything is for you murmured the sick womanexcept and she enumerated some tiny legacies which showed her generous thoughtful nature  yes i shall remember said alvina beyond tears now  miss frost smiled with her old bright wonderful look that had a touch of queenliness in it  kiss me dear she whispered  alvina kissed her and could not suppress the whimpering of her toomuch grief  the night passed slowly sometimes the grey eyes of the sick woman rested dark dilated haggard on alvinas face with a heavy almost accusing look sinister then they closed again and sometimes they looked pathetic with a mute stricken appeal then again they closedonly to open again tense with pain alvina wiped her bloodphlegmed lips  in the morning she diedlay there haggard deathsmeared with her lovely white hair smeared also and disorderly she who had been so beautiful and clean always  alvina knew deathwhich is untellable she knew that her darling carried away a portion of her own soul into death  but she was alone and the agony of being alone the agony of grief passionate passionate grief for her darling who was torn into deaththe agony of selfreproach regret the agony of remembrance the agony of the looks of the dying woman winsome and sinisterly accusing and pathetically despairingly appealingprobe after probe of mortal agony which throughout eternity would never lose its power to pierce to the quick  alvina seemed to keep strangely calm and aloof all the days after the death only when she was alone she suffered till she felt her heart really broke  i shall never feel anything any more she said in her abrupt way to miss frosts friend another woman of over fifty  nonsense child expostulated mrs lawson gently  i shant i shall never have a heart to feel anything any more said alvina with a strange distraught roll of the eyes  not like this child but youll feel other things  i havent the heart persisted alvina  not yet said mrs lawson gently you cant expectbut timetime brings back  oh wellbut i dont believe it said alvina  people thought her rather hard to one of her gossips miss pinnegar confessed  i thought shed have felt it more she cared more for her than she did for her own motherand her mother knew it mrs houghton complained bitterly sometimes that she had no love they were everything to one another miss frost and alvina i should have thought shed have felt it more but you never know a good thing if she doesnt really  miss pinnegar herself did not care one little bit that miss frost was dead she did not feel herself implicated  the nearest relatives came down and everything was settled the will was found just a brief line on a piece of notepaper expressing a wish that alvina should have everything alvina herself told the verbal requests all was quietly fulfilled  as it might well be for there was nothing to leave just sixtythree pounds in the bankno more then the clothes piano books and music miss frosts brother had these latter at his own request the books and music and the piano alvina inherited the few simple trinkets and about fortyfive pounds in money  poor miss frost cried mrs lawson weeping rather bitterlyshe saved nothing for herself you can see why she never wanted to grow old so that she couldnt work you can see its a shame its a shame one of the best women that ever trod earth  manchester house settled down to its deeper silence its darker gloom miss frost was irreparably gone with her the reality went out of the house it seemed to be silently waiting to disappear and alvina and miss pinnegar might move about and talk in vain they could never remove the sense of waiting to finish it was all just waiting to finish and the three james and alvina and miss pinnegar waited lingering through the months for the house to come to an end with miss frost its spirit passed away it was no more dark emptyfeeling it seemed all the time like a house just before a sale     chapter v  the beau   throttlehapenny worked fitfully through the winter and in the spring broke down by this time james houghton had a pathetic childish look which touched the hearts of alvina and miss pinnegar they began to treat him with a certain feminine indulgence as he fluttered round agitated and bewildered he was like a bird that has flown into a room and is exhausted enfeebled by its attempts to fly through the false freedom of the windowglass sometimes he would sit moping in a corner with his head under his wing but miss pinnegar chased him forth like the stealthy cat she was chased him up to the workroom to consider some detail of work chased him into the shop to turn over the old débris of the stock at one time he showed the alarming symptom of brooding over his wifes death miss pinnegar was thoroughly scared but she was not inventive it was left to alvina to suggest why doesnt father let the shop and some of the house  let the shop let the last inch of frontage on the street james thought of it let the shop permit the name of houghton to disappear from the list of tradesmen withdraw disappear become a nameless nobody occupying obscure premises  he thought about it and thinking about it became so indignant at the thought that he pulled his scattered energies together within his frail frame and then he came out with the most original of all his schemes manchester house was to be fitted up as a boardinghouse for the better classes and was to make a fortune catering for the needs of these gentry who had now nowhere to go yes manchester house should be fitted up as a sort of quiet family hotel for the better classes the shop should be turned into an elegant hallentrance carpeted with a hallporter and a wide plateglass door roundarched in the round arch of which the words manchester house should appear large and distinguished making an arch also whilst underneath more refined and smaller should show the words private hotel james was to be proprietor and secretary keeping the books and attending to correspondence miss pinnegar was to be manageress superintending the servants and directing the house whilst alvina was to occupy the equivocal position of hostess she was to shake hands with the guests she was to play the piano and she was to nurse the sick for in the prospectus james would include trained nurse always on the premises  why cried miss pinnegar for once brutally and angrily hostile to him youll make it sound like a private lunatic asylum  will you explain why answered james tartly  for himself he was enraptured with the scheme he began to tot up ideas and expenses there would be the handsome entrance and hall there would be an extension of the kitchen and scullery there would be an installing of new hotwater and sanitary arrangements there would be a light liftarrangment from the kitchen there would be a handsome glazed balcony or loggia or terrace on the first floor at the back over the whole length of the backyard this loggia would give a wonderful outlook to the southwest and the west in the immediate foreground to be sure would be the yard of the liverystables and the rather slummy dwellings of the colliers sloping downhill but these could be easily overlooked for the eye would instinctively wander across the green and shallow valley to the long upslope opposite showing the manor set in its clump of trees and farms and haystacks pleasantly dotted and moderately far off coalmines with twinkling headstocks and narrow railwaylines crossing the arable fields and heaps of burning slag the balcony or covered terracejames settled down at last to the word terracewas to be one of the features of the house the feature it was to be fitted up as a sort of elegant lounging restaurant elegant teas at twoandsix per head and elegant suppers at five shillings without wine were to be served here  as a teetotaller and a man of ascetic views james in his first shallow moments before he thought about it assumed that his house should be entirely nonalcoholic a temperance house already he winced we all know what a provincial temperance hotel is besides there is magic in the sound of wine wines served the legend attracted him immenselyas a teetotaller it had a mysterious hypnotic influence he must have wines he knew nothing about them but alfred swayn from the liquor vaults would put him in the running in five minutes  it was most curious to see miss pinnegar turtle up at the mention of this scheme when first it was disclosed to her her colour came up like a turkeys in a flush of indignant anger  its ridiculous its just ridiculous she blurted bridling and ducking her head and turning aside like an indignant turkey  ridiculous why will you explain why retorted james turtling also  its absolutely ridiculous she repeated unable to do more than splutter  well well see said james rising to superiority  and again he began to dart absorbedly about like a bird building a nest miss pinnegar watched him with a sort of sullen fury she went to the shop door to peep out after him she saw him slip into the liquor vaults and she came back to announce to alvina  hes taken to drink  drink said alvina  thats what it is said miss pinnegar vindictively drink  alvina sank down and laughed till she was weak it all seemed really too funny to hertoo funny  i cant see what it is to laugh at said miss pinnegar disgracefulits disgraceful but im not going to stop to be made a fool of i shall be no manageress i tell you its absolutely ridiculous who does he think will come to the place hes out of his mindand its drink thats what it is going into the liquor vaults at ten oclock in the morning thats where he gets his ideasout of whiskeyor brandy but hes not going to make a fool of me  oh dear sighed alvina laughing herself into composure and a little weariness i know its perfectly ridiculous we shall have to stop him  ive said all i can say blurted miss pinnegar  as soon as james came in to a meal the two women attacked him  but father said alvina therell be nobody to come  plenty of peopleplenty of people said her father look at the shakespeares head in knarborough  knarborough is this knarborough blurted miss pinnegar where are the business men here where are the foreigners coming here for business wheres our lacetrade and our stockingtrade  there are business men said james and there are ladies  who retorted miss pinnegar is going to give halfacrown for a tea they expect tea and breadandbutter for fourpence and cake for sixpence and apricots or pineapple for ninepence and hamandtongue for a shilling and fried ham and eggs and jam and cake as much as they can eat for oneandtwo if they expect a knifeandfork tea for a shilling what are you going to give them for halfacrown  i know what i shall offer said james and we may make it two shillings through his mind flitted the idea of 11112but he rejected it you dont realize that im catering for a higher class of custom  but there isnt any higher class in woodhouse father said alvina unable to restrain a laugh  if you create a supply you create a demand he retorted  but how can you create a supply of better class people asked alvina mockingly  james took on his refined abstracted look as if he were preoccupied on higher planes it was the look of an obstinate little boy who poses on the side of the angelsor so the women saw it  miss pinnegar was prepared to combat him now by sheer weight of opposition she would pitch her dead negative will obstinately against him she would not speak to him she would not observe his presence she was stone deaf and stone blind there was no james this nettled him and she miscalculated him he merely took another circuit and rose another flight higher on the spiral of his spiritual egotism he believed himself finely and sacredly in the right that he was frustrated by lower beings above whom it was his duty to rise to soar so he soared to serene heights and his private hotel seemed a celestial injunction an erection on a higher plane  he saw the architect and then with his plans and schemes he saw the builder and contractor the builder gave an estimate of six or seven hundredbut james had better see the plumber and fitter who was going to instal the new hot water and sanitary system james was a little dashed he had calculated much less having only a few hundred pounds in possession after throttlehapenny he was prepared to mortgage manchester house if he could keep in hand a sufficent sum of money for the running of his establishment for a year he knew he would have to sacrifice miss pinnegars workroom he knew and he feared miss pinnegars violent and unmitigated hostility stillhis obstinate spirit rosehe was quite prepared to risk everything on this last throw  miss allsop daughter of the builder called to see alvina the allsops were great chapel people and cassie allsop was one of the old maids she was thin and nipped and wistful looking about fortytwo years old in private she was tyrannously exacting with the servants and spiteful rather mean with her motherless nieces but in public she had this nipped wistful look  alvina was surprised by this visit when she found miss allsop at the back door all her inherent hostility awoke  oh is it you miss allsop will you come in  they sat in the middle room the common living room of the house  i called said miss allsop coming to the point at once and speaking in her sundayschoolteacher voice to ask you if you know about this private hotel scheme of your fathers  yes said alvina  oh you do well we wondered mr houghton came to father about the building alterations yesterday theyll be awfully expensive  will they said alvina making big mocking eyes  yes very what do you think of the scheme  iwell alvina hesitated then broke into a laugh to tell the truth i havent thought much about it at all  well i think you should said miss allsop severely fathers sure it wont payand it will cost i dont know how much it is bound to be a dead loss and your fathers getting on youll be left stranded in the world without a penny to bless yourself with i think its an awful outlook for you  do you said alvina  here she was with a bang planked upon the shelf among the old maids  oh i do sincerely i should do all i could to prevent him if i were you  miss allsop took her departure alvina felt herself jolted in her mood an old maid along with cassie allsopand james houghton fooling about with the last bit of money mortgaging manchester house up to the hilt alvina sank in a kind of weary mortification in which her peculiar obstinacy persisted devilishly and spitefully oh well so be it said her spirit vindictively let the meagre mean despicable fate fulfil itself her old anger against her father arose again  arthur witham the plumber came in with james houghton to examine the house arthur witham was also one of the chapel menas had been his common interfering uneducated father before him the father had left each of his sons a fair little sum of money which arthur the eldest had already increased tenfold he was sly and slow and uneducated also and spoke with a broad accent but he was not badlooking a tight fellow with big blue eyes who aspired to keep his hs in the right place and would have been a gentleman if he could  against her usual habit alvina joined the plumber and her father in the scullery arthur witham saluted her with some respect she liked his blue eyes and tight figure he was keen and sly in business very watchful and slow to commit himself now he poked and peered and crept under the sink alvina watched him half disappearshe handed him a candleand she laughed to herself seeing his tight wellshaped hindquarters protruding from under the sink like the wrong end of a dog from a kennel he was keen after money was arthurand bossy creeping slyly after his own selfimportance and power he wanted powerand he would creep quietly after it till he got it as much as he was capable of his hs were a barbedwire fence and entanglement preventing his unlimited progress  he emerged from under the sink and they went to the kitchen and afterwards upstairs alvina followed them persistently but a little aloof and silent when the tour of inspection was almost over she said innocently  wont it cost a great deal  arthur witham slowly shook his head then he looked at her she smiled rather archly into his eyes  it wont be done for nothing he said looking at her again  we can go into that later said james leading off the plumber  good morning miss houghton said arthur witham  good morning mr witham replied alvina brightly  but she lingered in the background and as arthur witham was going she heard him say well ill work it out mr houghton ill work it out and let you know tonight ill get the figures by tonight  the younger mans tone was a little offhand just a little supercilious with her father she thought jamess star was setting  in the afternoon directly after dinner alvina went out she entered the shop where sheets of lead and tins of paint and putty stood about varied by sheets of glass and fancy paper lottie witham arthurs wife appeared she was a woman of thirtyfive a bit of a shrew with social ambitions and no children  is mr witham in said alvina  mrs witham eyed her  ill see she answered and she left the shop  presently arthur entered in his shirtsleeves rather attractivelooking  i dont know what youll think of me and what ive come for said alvina with hurried amiability arthur lifted his blue eyes to her and mrs witham appeared in the background in the inner doorway  why what is it said arthur stolidly  make it as dear as you can for father said alvina laughing nervously  arthurs blue eyes rested on her face mrs witham advanced into the shop  why whats that for asked lottie witham shrewdly  alvina turned to the woman  dont say anything she said but we dont want father to go on with this scheme its bound to fail and miss pinnegar and i cant have anything to do with it anyway i shall go away  its bound to fail said arthur witham stolidly  and father has no money im sure said alvina  lottie witham eyed the thin nervous face of alvina for some reason she liked her and of course alvina was considered a lady in woodhouse that was what it had come to with jamess declining fortunes she was merely considered a lady the consideration was no longer indisputable  shall you come in a minute said lottie witham lifting the flap of the counter it was a rare and bold stroke on mrs withams part alvinas immediate instinct was to refuse but she liked arthur witham in his shirt sleeves  welli must be back in a minute she said as she entered the embrasure of the counter she felt as if she were really venturing on new ground she was led into the new drawingroom done in new peacockandbronze brocade furniture with gilt and brass and white walls this was the withams new house and lottie was proud of it the two women had a short confidential chat arthur lingered in the doorway a while then went away  alvina did not really like lottie witham yet the other woman was sharp and shrewd in the uptake and for some reason she fancied alvina so she was invited to tea at manchester house  after this so many difficulties rose up in james houghtons way that he was worried almost out of his life his two women left him alone outside difficulties multiplied on him till he abandoned his schemehe was simply driven out of it by untoward circumstances  lottie witham came to tea and was shown over manchester house she had no opinion at all of manchester housewouldnt hang a cat in such a gloomy hole still she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority  oh my goodness she exclaimed as she stood in alvinas bedroom and looked at the enormous furniture the lofty tableland of the bed  oh my goodness i wouldnt sleep in that for a trifle by myself arent you frightened out of your life even if i had arthur at one side of me i should be that frightened on the other side i shouldnt know what to do do you sleep here by yourself  yes said alvina laughing i havent got an arthur even for one side  oh my word youd want a husband on both sides in that bed said lottie witham  alvina was asked back to teaon wednesday afternoon closing day arthur was there to teavery ill at ease and feeling as if his hands were swollen alvina got on better with his wife who watched closely to learn from her guest the secret of repose the indefinable repose and inevitability of a ladyeven of a lady who is nervous and agitatedthis was the problem which occupied lotties shrewd and active but lowerclass mind she even did not resent alvinas laughing attempts to draw out the clumsy arthur because alvina was a lady and her tactics must be studied  alvina really liked arthur and thought a good deal about himheaven knows why he and lottie were quite happy together and he was absorbed in his petty ambitions in his limited way he was invincibly ambitious he would end by making a sufficient fortune and by being a town councillor and a jp but beyond woodhouse he did not exist why then should alvina be attracted by him perhaps because of his closeness and his secret determinedness  when she met him in the street she would stop himthough he was always busyand make him exchange a few words with her and when she had tea at his house she would try to rouse his attention but though he looked at her steadily with his blue eyes from under his long lashes still she knew he looked at her objectively he never conceived any connection with her whatsoever  it was lottie who had a scheming mind in the family of three brothers there was onenot black sheep but white there was one who was climbing out to be a gentleman this was albert the second brother he had been a schoolteacher in woodhouse had gone out to south africa and occupied a post in a sort of grammar school in one of the cities of cape colony he had accumulated some money to add to his patrimony now he was in england at oxford where he would take his belated degree when he had got his degree he would return to south africa to become head of his school at seven hundred a year  albert was thirtytwo years old and unmarried lottie was determined he should take back to the cape a suitable wife presumably alvina he spent his vacations in woodhouseand he was only in his first year at oxford well now what could be more suitablea young man at oxford a young lady in woodhouse lottie told alvina all about him and alvina was quite excited to meet him she imagined him a taller more fascinating educated arthur  for the fear of being an old maid the fear of her own virginity was really gaining on alvina there was a terrible sombre futility nothingness in manchester house she was twentysix years old her life was utterly barren now miss frost had gone she was shabby and penniless a mere household drudge for james begrudged even a girl to help in the kitchen she was looking faded and worn panic the terrible and deadly panic which overcomes so many unmarried women at about the age of thirty was beginning to overcome her she would not care about marriage if even she had a lover but some sort of terror hunted her to the search of a lover she would become loose she would become a prostitute she said to herself rather than die off like cassie allsop and the rest wither slowly and ignominiously and hideously on the tree she would rather kill herself  but it needs a certain natural gift to become a loose woman or a prostitute if you havent got the qualities which attract loose men what are you to do supposing it isnt in your nature to attract loose and promiscuous men why then you cant be a prostitute if you try your head off nor even a loose woman since willing wont do it it requires a second party to come to an agreement  therefore all alvinas desperate and profligate schemes and ideas fell to nought before the inexorable in her nature and the inexorable in her nature was highly exclusive and selective an inevitable negation of looseness or prostitution hence men were afraid of herof her power once they had committed themselves she would involve and lead a man on she would destroy him rather than not get of him what she wanted and what she wanted was something serious and risky not mere marriageoh dear no but a profound and dangerous interrelationship as well ask the paddlers in the small surf of passion to plunge themselves into the heaving gulf of midocean bah with their trousers turned up to their knees it was enough for them to wet their toes in the dangerous sea they were having nothing to do with such desperate nereids as alvina  she had cast her mind on arthur truly ridiculous but there was something compact and energetic and wilful about him that she magnified tenfold and so obtained imaginatively an attractive lover she brooded her days shabbily away in manchester house busy with housework drudgery since the collapse of throttlehapenny james houghton had become so stingy that it was like an inflammation in him a silver sixpence had a pale and celestial radiance which he could not forego a nebulous whiteness which made him feel he had heaven in his hold how then could he let it go even a brown penny seemed alive and pulsing with mysterious blood potent magical he loved the flock of his busy pennies in the shop as if they had been divine bees bringing him sustenance from the infinite but the pennies he saw dribbling away in household expenses troubled him acutely as if they were live things leaving his fold it was a constant struggle to get from him enough money for necessities  and so the household diet became meagre in the extreme the coal was eked out inch by inch and when alvina must have her boots mended she must draw on her own little stock of money for james houghton had the impudence to make her an allowance of two shillings a week she was very angry yet her anger was of that dangerous halfironical sort which wears away its subject and has no outward effect a feeling of halfbitter mockery kept her going in the ponderous rather sordid nullity of manchester house she became shadowy and absorbed absorbed in nothing in particular yet absorbed she was always more or less busy and certainly there was always something to be done whether she did it or not  the shop was opened once a week on friday evenings james houghton prowled round the warehouses in knarborough and picked up job lots of stuff with which he replenished his shabby window but his heart was not in the business mere tenacity made him hover on with it  in midsummer albert witham came to woodhouse and alvina was invited to tea she was very much excited all the time imagining albert a taller finer arthur she had abstained from actually fixing her mind upon this latter little man picture her disappointment when she found albert quite unattractive he was tall and thin and brittle with a pale rather dry flattish face and with curious pale eyes his impression was one of uncanny flatness something like a lemon sole curiously flat and fishlike he was one might have imagined his backbone to be spread like the backbone of a sole or a plaice his teeth were sound but rather large and yellowish and flat a most curious person  he spoke in a slightly mouthing way not well bred in spite of oxford there was a distinct woodhouse twang he would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever yet he was not ordinary really an odd fish quite interesting if one could get over the feeling that one was looking at him through the glass wall of an aquarium that most horrifying of all boundaries between two worlds in an aquarium fish seem to come smiling broadly to the doorway and there to stand talking to one in a mouthing fashion awful to behold for one hears no sound from all their mouthing and staring conversation now although albert witham had a good strong voice which rang like water among rocks in her ear still she seemed never to hear a word he was saying he smiled down at her and fixed her and swayed his head and said quite original things really for he was a genuine odd fish and yet she seemed to hear no sound no word from him nothing came to her perhaps as a matter of fact fish do actually pronounce streams of watery words to which we with our aerialresonant ears are deaf for ever  the odd thing was that this odd fish seemed from the very first to imagine she had accepted him as a follower and he was quite prepared to follow nay from the very first moment he was smiling on her with a sort of complacent delightcompassionate one might almost sayas if there was a full understanding between them if only she could have got into the right state of mind she would really rather have liked him he smiled at her and said really interesting things between his big teeth there was something rather nice about him but we must repeat it was as if the glass wall of an aquarium divided them  alvina looked at arthur arthur was short and darkhaired and nicely coloured but now his brother was there he too seemed to have a dumb aqueous silence fishlike and aloof about him he seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element strange it all was like alice in wonderland alvina understood now lotties strained sort of thinness a haggard sinewy seaweedy look the poor thing was all the time swimming for her life  for alvina it was a most curious teaparty she listened and smiled and made vague answers to albert who leaned his broad thin brittle shoulders towards her lottie seemed rather shadowily to preside but it was arthur who came out into communication and now uttering his rather broadmouthed speeches she seemed to hear in him a quieter subtler edition of his father his father had been a little terrifically loudvoiced hardskinned man amazingly uneducated and amazingly bullying who had tyrannized for many years over the sunday school children during morning service he had been an oddlooking creature with round grey whiskers to alvina always a creature never a man an atrocious leprechaun from under the chapel floor and how he used to dig the children in the back with his horrible iron thumb if the poor things happened to whisper or nod in chapel  these were his childrenmost curious chips of the old block who ever would have believed she would have been taking tea with them  why dont you have a bicycle and go out on it arthur was saying  but i cant ride said alvina  youd learn in a couple of lessons theres nothing in riding a bicycle  i dont believe i ever should laughed alvina  you dont mean to say youre nervous said arthur rudely and sneeringly  i am she persisted  you neednt be nervous with me smiled albert broadly with his odd genuine gallantry ill hold you on  but i havent got a bicycle said alvina feeling she was slowly colouring to a deep uneasy blush  you can have mine to learn on said lottie albert will look after it  theres your chance said arthur rudely take it while youve got it  now alvina did not want to learn to ride a bicycle the two miss carlins two more old maids had made themselves ridiculous for ever by becoming twin cycle fiends and the horrible energetic strain of peddling a bicycle over miles and miles of highway did not attract alvina at all she was completely indifferent to sightseeing and scouring about she liked taking a walk in her lingering indifferent fashion but rushing about in any way was hateful to her and then to be taught to ride a bicycle by albert witham her very soul stood still  yes said albert beaming down at her from his strange pale eyes come on when will you have your first lesson  oh cried alvina in confusion i cant promise i havent time really  time exclaimed arthur rudely but what do you do wi yourself all day  i have to keep house she said looking at him archly  house you can put a chain round its neck and tie it up he retorted  albert laughed showing all his teeth  im sure you find plenty to do with everything on your hands said lottie to alvina  i do said alvina by evening im quite tiredthough you maynt believe it since you say i do nothing she added laughing confusedly to arthur  but he hardheaded little fortunemaker replied  you have a girl to help you dont you  albert however was beaming at her sympathetically  you have too much to do indoors he said it would do you good to get a bit of exercise out of doors come down to the coach road tomorrow afternoon and let me give you a lesson go on  now the coachroad was a level drive between beautiful parklike grassstretches down in the valley it was a delightful place for learning to ride a bicycle but open in full view of all the world alvina would have died of shame she began to laugh nervously and hurriedly at the very thought  no i cant i really cant thanks awfully she said  cant you really said albert oh well well say another day shall we  when i feel i can she said  yes when you feel like it replied albert  thats more it said arthur its not the time its the nervousness again albert beamed at her sympathetically and said  oh ill hold you you neednt be afraid  but im not afraid she said  you wont say you are interposed arthur womens faults mustnt be owned up to  alvina was beginning to feel quite dazed their mechanical overbearing way was something she was unaccustomed to it was like the jaws of a pair of insentient iron pincers she rose saying she must go  albert rose also and reached for his straw hat with its coloured band  ill stroll up with you if you dont mind he said and he took his place at her side along the knarborough road where everybody turned to look for of course he had a sort of fame in woodhouse she went with him laughing and chatting but she did not feel at all comfortable he seemed so pleased only he was not pleased with her he was pleased with himself on her account inordinately pleased with himself in his world as in a fishs there was but his own swimming self and if he chanced to have something swimming alongside and doing him credit why so much the more complacently he smiled  he walked stiff and erect with his head pressed rather back so that he always seemed to be advancing from the head and shoulders in a flat kind of advance horizontal he did not seem to be walking with his whole body his manner was oddly gallant with a gallantry that completely missed the individual in the woman circled round her and flew home gratified to his own hive the way he raised his hat the way he inclined and smiled flatly even rather excitedly as he talked was all a little discomforting and comical  he left her at the shop door saying  i shall see you again i hope  oh yes she replied rattling the door anxiously for it was locked she heard her fathers step at last tripping down the shop  goodevening mr houghton said albert suavely and with a certain confidence as james peered out  oh goodevening said james letting alvina pass and shutting the door in alberts face  who was that he asked her sharply  albert witham she replied  what has he got to do with you said james shrewishly  nothing i hope  she fled into the obscurity of manchester house out of the grey summer evening the withams threw her off her pivot and made her feel she was not herself she felt she didnt know she couldnt feel she was just scattered and decentralized and she was rather afraid of the witham brothers she might be their victim she intended to avoid them  the following days she saw albert in his norfolk jacket and flannel trousers and his straw hat strolling past several times and looking in through the shop door and up at the upper windows but she hid herself thoroughly when she went out it was by the back way so she avoided him  but on sunday evening there he sat rather stiff and brittle in the old withams pew his head pressed a little back so that his face and neck seemed slightly flattened he wore very low turndown starched collars that showed all his neck and he kept looking up at her during the serviceshe sat in the choirloftgazing up at her with apparently lovelorn eyes and a faint intimate smilethe sort of jesaistout look of a private swain arthur also occasionally cast a judicious eye on her as if she were a chimney that needed repairing and he must estimate the cost and whether it was worth it  sure enough as she came out through the narrow choir gate into knarborough road there was albert stepping forward like a policeman and saluting her and smiling down on her  i dont know if im presuming he said in a mock deferential way that showed he didnt imagine he could presume  oh not at all said alvina airily he smiled with assurance  you havent got any engagement then for this evening he said  no she replied simply  we might take a walk what do you think he said glancing down the road in either direction  what after all was she to think all the girls were pairing off with the boys for the afterchapel stroll and spoon  i dont mind she said but i cant go far ive got to be in at nine  which way shall we go he said  he steered off turned downhill through the common gardens and proposed to take her the notveryoriginal walk up flints lane and along the railway linethe colliery railway that isthen back up the marlpool road a sort of circle she agreed  they did not find a great deal to talk about she questioned him about his plans and about the cape but save for bare outlines which he gave readily enough he was rather close  what do you do on sunday nights as a rule he asked her  oh i have a walk with lucy graingeror i go down to hallamsor go home she answered  you dont go walks with the fellows then  father would never have it she replied  what will he say now he asked with selfsatisfaction  goodness knows she laughed  goodness usually does he answered archly  when they came to the rather stumbly railway he said  wont you take my armoffering her the said member  oh im all right she said thanks  go on he said pressing a little nearer to her and offering his arm theres nothing against it is there  oh its not that she said  and feeling in a false position she took his arm rather unwillingly he drew a little nearer to her and walked with a slight prance  we get on better dont we he said giving her hand the tiniest squeeze with his arm against his side  much she replied with a laugh  then he lowered his voice oddly  its many a day since i was on this railroad he said  is this one of your old walks she asked malicious  yes ive been it once or twicewith girls that are all married now  didnt you want to marry she asked  oh i dont know i may have done but it never came off somehow ive sometimes thought it never would come off  why  i dont know exactly it didnt seem to you know perhaps neither of us was properly inclined  i should think so she said  and yet he admitted slyly i should like to marry to this she did not answer  shouldnt you he continued  when i meet the right man she laughed  thats it he said there thats just it and you havent met him his voice seemed smiling with a sort of triumph as if he had caught her out  wellonce i thought i hadwhen i was engaged to alexander  but you found you were mistaken he insisted  no mother was so ill at the time  theres always something to consider he said  she kept on wondering what she should do if he wanted to kiss her the mere incongruity of such a desire on his part formed a problem luckily for this evening he formulated no desire but left her in the shopdoor soon after nine with the request  i shall see you in the week shant i  im not sure i cant promise now she said hurriedly goodnight  what she felt chiefly about him was a decentralized perplexity very much akin to no feeling at all  who do you think took me for a walk miss pinnegar she said laughing to her confidante  i cant imagine replied miss pinnegar eyeing her  you never would imagine said alvina albert witham  albert witham exclaimed miss pinnegar standing quite motionless  it may well take your breath away said alvina  no its not that hurriedly expostulated miss pinnegar well well i declare and then on a new note well hes very eligible i think  most eligible replied alvina  yes he is insisted miss pinnegar i think its very good  whats very good asked alvina  miss pinnegar hesitated she looked at alvina she reconsidered  of course hes not the man i should have imagined for you but  you think hell do said alvina  why not said miss pinnegar why shouldnt he doif you like him  ah cried alvina sinking on the sofa with a laugh thats it  of course you couldnt have anything to do with him if you dont care for him pronounced miss pinnegar  albert continued to hang around he did not make any direct attack for a few days suddenly one evening he appeared at the back door with a bunch of white stocks in his hand his face lit up with a sudden odd smile when she opened the doora broad palegleaming remarkable smile  lottie wanted to know if youd come to tea tomorrow he said straight out looking at her with the pale light in his eyes that smiled palely right into her eyes but did not see her at all he was waiting on the doorstep to come in  will you come in said alvina father is in  yes i dont mind he said pleased he mounted the steps still holding his bunch of white stocks  james houghton screwed round in his chair and peered over his spectacles to see who was coming  father said alvina you know mr witham dont you  james houghton half rose he still peered over his glasses at the intruder  welli do by sight how do you do  he held out his frail hand  albert held back with the flowers in his own hand and giving his broad pleased palegleaming smile from father to daughter he said  what am i to do with these will you accept them miss houghton he stared at her with shining pallid smiling eyes  are they for me she said with false brightness thank you  james houghton looked over the top of his spectacles searchingly at the flowers as if they had been a bunch of white and sharptoothed ferrets then he looked as suspiciously at the hand which albert at last extended to him he shook it slightly and said  take a seat  im afraid im disturbing you in your reading said albert still having the drawn excited smile on his face  well said james houghton the light is fading  alvina came in with the flowers in a jar she set them on the table  havent they a lovely scent she said  do you think so he replied again with the excited smile there was a pause albert rather embarrassed reached forward saying  may i see what youre reading and he turned over the book tommy and grizel oh yes what do you think of it  well said james i am only in the beginning  i think its interesting myself said albert as a study of a man who cant get away from himself you meet a lot of people like that what i wonder is why they find it such a drawback  find what a drawback asked james  not being able to get away from themselves that selfconsciousness it hampers them and interferes with their power of action now i wonder why selfconsciousness should hinder a man in his action why does it cause misgiving i think im selfconscious but i dont think i have so many misgivings i dont see that theyre necessary  certainly i think tommy is a weak character i believe hes a despicable character said james  no i dont know so much about that said albert i shouldnt say weak exactly hes only weak in one direction no what i wonder is why he feels guilty if you feel selfconscious theres no need to feel guilty about it is there  he stared with his strange smiling stare at james  i shouldnt say so replied james but if a man never knows his own mind he certainly cant be much of a man  i dont see it replied albert whats the matter is that he feels guilty for not knowing his own mind thats the unnecessary part the guilty feeling  albert seemed insistent on this point which had no particular interest for james  where weve got to make a change said albert is in the feeling that other people have a right to tell us what we ought to feel and do nobody knows what another man ought to feel every man has his own special feelings and his own right to them thats where it is with education you ought not to want all your children to feel alike their natures are all different and so they should all feel different about practically everything  there would be no end to the confusion said james  there neednt be any confusion to speak of you agree to a number of rules and conventions and laws for social purposes but in private you feel just as you do feel without occasion for trying to feel something else  i dont know said james there are certain feelings common to humanity such as love and honour and truth  would you call them feelings said albert i should say what is common is the idea the idea is common to humanity once youve put it into words but the feeling varies with every man the same idea represents a different kind of feeling in every different individual it seems to me thats what weve got to recognize if were going to do anything with education we dont want to produce mass feelings dont you agree  poor james was too bewildered to know whether to agree or not to agree  shall we have a light alvina he said to his daughter  alvina lit the incandescent gasjet that hung in the middle of the room the hard white light showed her somewhat haggardlooking as she reached up to it but albert watched her smiling abstractedly it seemed as if his words came off him without affecting him at all he did not think about what he was feeling and he did not feel what he was thinking about and therefore she hardly heard what he said yet she believed he was clever  it was evident albert was quite blissfully happy in his own way sitting there at the end of the sofa not far from the fire and talking animatedly the uncomfortable thing was that though he talked in the direction of his interlocutor he did not speak to him merely said his words towards him james however was such an airy feather himself he did not remark this but only felt a little selfimportant at sustaining such a subtle conversation with a man from oxford alvina who never expected to be interested in clever conversations after a long experience of her father found her expectation justified again she was not interested  the man was quite nicely dressed in the regulation tweed jacket and flannel trousers and brown shoes he was even rather smart judging from his yellow socks and yellowandbrown tie miss pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in  goodevening she said just a trifle condescendingly as she shook hands how do you find woodhouse after being away so long her way of speaking was so quiet as if she hardly spoke aloud  well he answered i find it the same in many ways  you wouldnt like to settle here again  i dont think i should it feels a little cramped you know after a new country but it has its attractions here he smiled meaningful  yes said miss pinnegar i suppose the old connections count for something  they do oh decidedly they do theres no associations like the old ones he smiled flatly as he looked towards alvina  you find it so do you returned miss pinnegar you dont find that the new connections make up for the old  not altogether they dont theres something missing again he looked towards alvina but she did not answer his look  well said miss pinnegar im glad we still count for something in spite of the greater attractions how long have you in england  another year just a year this time next year i expect i shall be sailing back to the cape he smiled as if in anticipation yet it was hard to believe that it mattered to himor that anything mattered  and is oxford agreeable to you she asked  oh yes i keep myself busy  what are your subjects asked james  english and history but i do mental science for my own interest  alvina had taken up a piece of sewing she sat under the light brooding a little what had all this to do with her the man talked on and beamed in her direction and she felt a little important but moved or touchednot the least in the world  she wondered if any one would ask him to supperbread and cheese and currantloaf and water was all that offered no one asked him and at last he rose  show mr witham out through the shop alvina said miss pinnegar  alvina piloted the man through the long dark encumbered way of the shop at the door he said  youve never said whether youre coming to tea on thursday  i dont think i can said alvina  he seemed rather taken aback  why he said what stops you  ive so much to do  he smiled slowly and satirically  wont it keep he said  no really i cant come on thursdaythank you so much goodnight she gave him her hand and turned quickly into the shop closing the door he remained standing in the porch staring at the closed door then lifting his lip he turned away  well said miss pinnegar decidedly as alvina reentered you can say what you likebut i think hes very pleasant very pleasant  extremely intelligent said james houghton shifting in his chair  i was awfully bored said alvina  they both looked at her irritated  after this she really did what she could to avoid him when she saw him sauntering down the street in all his leisure a sort of anger possessed her on sunday she slipped down from the choir into the chapel and out through the main entrance whilst he awaited her at the small exit and by good luck when he called one evening in the week she was out she returned down the yard and there through the uncurtained window she saw him sitting awaiting her without a thought she turned on her heel and fled away she did not come in till he had gone  how late you are said miss pinnegar mr witham was here till ten minutes ago  yes laughed alvina i came down the yard and saw him so i went back till hed gone  miss pinnegar looked at her in displeasure  i suppose you know your own mind she said  how do you explain such behaviour said her father pettishly  i didnt want to meet him she said  the next evening was saturday alvina had inherited miss frosts task of attending to the chapel flowers once a quarter she had been round the gardens of her friends and gathered the scarlet and hot yellow and purple flowers of august asters red stocks tall japanese sunflowers coreopsis geraniums with these in her basket she slipped out towards evening to the chapel she knew mr calladine the caretaker would not lock up till she had been  the moment she got inside the chapelit was a big airy pleasant buildingshe heard hammering from the organloft and saw the flicker of a candle some workman busy before sunday she shut the baize door behind her and hurried across to the vestry for vases then out to the tap for water all was warm and still  it was full early evening the yellow light streamed through the side windows the big stainedglass window at the end was deep and full of glowing colour in which the yellows and reds were richest above in the organloft the hammering continued she arranged her flowers in many vases till the communion table was like the window a tangle of strong yellow and crimson and purple and bronzegreen she tried to keep the effect light and kaleidoscopic an interplay of tossed pieces of strong hot colour vibrating and lightly intermingled it was very gorgeous for a communion table but the day of white lilies was over  suddenly there was a terrific crash and bang and tumble up in the organloft followed by a cursing  are you hurt called alvina looking up into space the candle had disappeared  but there was no reply feeling curious she went out of the chapel to the stairs in the side porch and ran up to the organ she went round the sideand there she saw a man in his shirtsleeves sitting crouched in the obscurity on the floor between the organ and the wall of the back while a collapsed pair of steps lay between her and him it was too dark to see who it was  that rotten pair of steps came down with me said the infuriated voice of arthur witham and about broke my leg  alvina advanced towards him picking her way over the steps he was sitting nursing his leg  is it bad she asked stooping towards him  in the shadow he lifted up his face it was pale and his eyes were savage with anger her face was near his  it is bad he said furious because of the shock the shock had thrown him off his balance  let me see she said  he removed his hands from clasping his shin some distance above the ankle she put her fingers over the bone over his stocking to feel if there was any fracture immediately her fingers were wet with blood then he did a curious thing with both his hands he pressed her hand down over his wounded leg pressed it with all his might as if her hand were a plaster for some moments he sat pressing her hand over his broken shin completely oblivious as some people are when they have had a shock and a hurt intense on one point of consciousness only and for the rest unconscious  then he began to come to himself the pain modified itself he could not bear the sudden acute hurt to his shin that was one of his sensitive unbearable parts  the bone isnt broken she said professionally but youd better get the stocking out of it  without a thought he pulled his trouserleg higher and rolled down his stocking extremely gingerly and sick with pain  can you show a light he said  she found the candle and she knew where matches always rested on a little ledge of the organ so she brought him a light whilst he examined his broken shin the blood was flowing but not so much it was a nasty cut bruise swelling and looking very painful he sat looking at it absorbedly bent over it in the candlelight  its not so very bad when the pain goes off she said noticing the black hairs of his shin wed better tie it up have you got a handkerchief  its in my jacket he said  she looked round for his jacket he annoyed her a little by being completely oblivious of her she got his handkerchief and wiped her fingers on it then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound  shall i tie it up then she said  but he did not answer he sat still nursing his leg looking at his hurt while the blood slowly trickled down the wet hairs towards his ankle there was nothing to do but wait for him  shall i tie it up then she repeated at length a little impatient so he put his leg a little forward  she looked at the wound and wiped it a little then she folded the pad of her own handkerchief and laid it over the hurt and again he did the same thing he took her hand as if it were a plaster and applied it to his wound pressing it cautiously but firmly down she was rather angry he took no notice of her at all and she waiting seemed to go into a dream a sleep her arm trembled a little stretched out and fixed she seemed to lose count under the firm compression he imposed on her it was as if the pressure on her hand pressed her into oblivion  tie it up he said briskly  and she obedient began to tie the bandage with numb fingers he seemed to have taken the use out of her  when she had finished he scrambled to his feet looked at the organ which he was repairing and looked at the collapsed pair of steps  a rotten pair of things to have to put a mans life in danger he said towards the steps then stubbornly he rigged them up again and stared again at his interrupted job  you wont go on will you she asked  its got to be done sunday tomorrow he said if youd hold them steps a minute there isnt more than a minutes fixing to do its all done but fixing  hadnt you better leave it she said  would you mind holding the steps so that they dont let me down again he said then he took the candle and hobbled stubbornly and angrily up again with spanner and hammer for some minutes he worked tapping and readjusting whilst she held the ricketty steps and stared at him from below the shapeless bulk of his trousers strange the differenceshe could not help thinking itbetween the vulnerable hairy and somehow childish leg of the real man and the shapeless form of these workmens trousers the kernel the man himselfseemed so tenderthe covering so stiff and insentient  and was he not going to speak to hernot one human word of recognition men are the most curious and unreal creatures after all he had made use of her think how he had pressed her hand gently but firmly down down over his bruise how he had taken the virtue out of her till she felt all weak and dim and after that was he going to relapse into his tough and ugly workmans hide and treat her as if she were a pair of steps which might let him down or hold him up as might be  as she stood clinging to the steps she felt weak and a little hysterical she wanted to summon her strength to have her own back from him after all he had taken the virtue from her he might have the grace to say thank you and treat her as if she were a human being  at last he left off tinkering and looked round  have you finished she said  yes he answered crossly  and taking the candle he began to clamber down when he got to the bottom he crouched over his leg and felt the bandage  that gives you what for he said as if it were her fault  is the bandage holding she said  i think so he answered churlishly  arent you going to make sure she said  oh its all right he said turning aside and taking up his tools ill make my way home  so will i she answered  she took the candle and went a little in front he hurried into his coat and gathered his tools anxious to get away she faced him holding the candle  look at my hand she said holding it out it was smeared with blood as was the cuff of her dressa blackandwhite striped cotton dress  is it hurt he said  no but look at it look here she showed the bloodstains on her dress  itll wash out he said frightened of her  yes so it will but for the present its there dont you think you ought to thank me  he recoiled a little  yes he said im very much obliged  you ought to be more than that she said  he did not answer but looked her up and down  well be going down he said we sll have folks talking  suddenly she began to laugh it seemed so comical what a position the candle shook as she laughed what a man answering her like a little automaton seriously quite seriously he said it to herwe sll have folks talking she laughed in a breathless hurried way as they tramped downstairs  at the bottom of the stairs calladine the caretaker met them he was a tall thin man with a black moustacheabout fifty years old  have you done for tonight all of you he said grinning in echo to alvinas still fluttering laughter  thats a nice rotten pair of steps youve got up there for a deathtrap said arthur angrily come down on top of me and im lucky i havent got my leg broken it is near enough  come down with you did they said calladine goodhumouredly i never knowed em come down wi me  you ought to then my legs as near broke as it can be  what have you hurt yourself  i should think i have look here and he began to pull up his trouser leg but alvina had given the candle to calladine and fled she had a last view of arthur stooping over his precious leg while calladine stooped his length and held down the candle  when she got home she took off her dress and washed herself hard and washed the stained sleeve thoroughly thoroughly and threw away the wash water and rinsed the washbowls with fresh water scrupulously then she dressed herself in her black dress once more did her hair and went downstairs  but she could not sewand she could not settle down it was saturday evening and her father had opened the shop miss pinnegar had gone to knarborough she would be back at nine oclock alvina set about to make a mock woodcock or a mock something or other with cheese and an egg and bits of toast her eyes were dilated and as if amused mocking her face quivered a little with irony that was not all enjoyable  im glad youve come said alvina as miss pinnegar entered the suppers just done ill ask father if hell close the shop  of course james would not close the shop though he was merely wasting light he nipped in to eat his supper and started out again with a mouthful the moment he heard the ping of the bell he kept his customers chatting as long as he could his love for conversation had degenerated into a spasmodic passion for chatter  alvina looked across at miss pinnegar as the two sat at the meagre suppertable her eyes were dilated and arched with a mocking almost satanic look  ive made up my mind about albert witham said alvina miss pinnegar looked at her  which way she asked demurely but a little sharp  its all off said alvina breaking into a nervous laugh  why what has happened  nothing has happened i cant stand him  whysuddenly said miss pinnegar  its not sudden laughed alvina not at all i cant stand him i never could and i wont try there isnt that plain and she went off into her hurried laugh partly at herself partly at arthur partly at albert partly at miss pinnegar  oh well if youre so sure said miss pinnegar rather bitingly  i am quite sure said alvina im quite certain  cocksure people are often most mistaken said miss pinnegar  id rather have my own mistakes than somebody elses rights said alvina  then dont expect anybody to pay for your mistakes said miss pinnegar  it would be all the same if i did said alvina  when she lay in bed she stared at the light of the streetlamp on the wall she was thinking busily but heaven knows what she was thinking she had sharpened the edge of her temper she was waiting till tomorrow she was waiting till she saw albert witham she wanted to finish off with him she was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him she stared for many hours at the light of the streetlamp and there was a narrowed look in her eyes  the next day she did not go to morning service but stayed at home to cook the dinner in the evening she sat in her place in the choir in the withams pew sat lottie and albertno arthur albert kept glancing up alvina could not bear the sight of himshe simply could not bear the sight of him yet in her low sweet voice she sang the alto to the hymns right to the vesper      lord keep us safe this night     secure from all our fears     may angels guard us while we sleep     till morning light appears  as she sang her alto and as the soft and emotional harmony of the vesper swelled luxuriously through the chapel she was peeping over her folded hands at lotties hat she could not bear lotties hats there was something aggressive and vulgar about them and she simply detested the look of the back of alberts head as he too stooped to the vesper prayer it looked mean and rather common she remembered arthur had the same look bending to prayer therewhy had she not seen it before that petty vulgar little look how could she have thought twice of arthur she had made a fool of herself as usual him and his little leg she grimaced round the chapel waiting for people to bob up their heads and take their departure  at the gate albert was waiting for her he came forward lifting his hat with a smiling and familiar good evening  good evening she murmured  its ages since ive seen you he said and ive looked out for you everywhere  it was raining a little she put up her umbrella  youll take a little stroll the rain isnt much he said  no thank you she said i must go home  why whats your hurry walk as far as beeby bridge go on  no thank you  hows that what makes you refuse  i dont want to  he paused and looked down at her the cold and supercilious look of anger a little spiteful came into his face  do you mean because of the rain he said  no i hope you dont mind but i dont want to take any more walks i dont mean anything by them  oh as for that he said taking the words out of her mouth why should you mean anything by them he smiled down on her  she looked him straight in the face  but id rather not take any more walks thank younone at all she said looking him full in the eyes  you wouldnt he replied stiffening  yes im quite sure she said  as sure as all that are you he said with a sneering grimace he stood eyeing her insolently up and down  goodnight she said his sneering made her furious putting her umbrella between him and her she walked off  goodnight then he replied unseen by her but his voice was sneering and impotent  she went home quivering but her soul was burning with satisfaction she had shaken them off  later she wondered if she had been unkind to him but it was doneand done for ever vogue la galère     chapter vi  houghtons last endeavour   the trouble with her ship was that it would not sail it rode waterlogged in the rotting port of home all very well to have wild reckless moods of irony and independence if you have to pay for them by withering dustily on the shelf  alvina fell again into humility and fear she began to show symptoms of her mothers heart trouble for day followed day month followed month season after season went by and she grubbed away like a housemaid in manchester house she hurried round doing the shopping she sang in the choir on sundays she attended the various chapel events she went out to visit friends and laughed and talked and played games but all the time what was there actually in her life not much she was withering towards oldmaiddom already in her twentyeighth year she spent her days grubbing in the house whilst her father became an elderly frail man still too lively in mind and spirit miss pinnegar began to grow grey and elderly too money became scarcer and scarcer there was a black day ahead when her father would die and the home be broken up and she would have to tackle life as a worker  there lay the only alternative in work she might slave her days away teaching the piano as miss frost had done she might find a subordinate post as nurse she might sit in the cashdesk of some shop some work of some sort would be found for her and she would sink into the routine of her job as did so many women and grow old and die chattering and fluttering she would have what is called her independence but seriously faced with that treasure and without the option of refusing it strange how hideous she found it  worka job more even than she rebelled against the withams did she rebel against a job albert witham was distasteful to heror rather he was not exactly distasteful he was chiefly incongruous she could never get over the feeling that he was mouthing and smiling at her through the glass wall of an aquarium he being on the watery side whether she would ever be able to take to his strange and dishuman element who knows anyway it would be some sort of an adventure better than a job she rebelled with all her backbone against the word job even the substitutes employment or work were detestable unbearable emphatically she did not want to work for a wage it was too humiliating could anything be more infra dig than the performing of a set of special actions day in day out for a lifetime in order to receive some shillings every seventh day shameful a condition of shame the most vulgar sordid and humiliating of all forms of slavery so mechanical far better be a slave outright in contact with all the whims and impulses of a human being than serve some mechanical routine of modern work  she trembled with anger impotence and fear for months the thought of albert was a torment to her she might have married him he would have been strange a strange fish but were it not better to take the strange leap over into his element than to condemn oneself to the routine of a job he would have been curious and dishuman but after all it would have been an experience in a way she liked him there was something odd and integral about him which she liked he was not a liar in his own line he was honest and direct then he would take her to south africa a whole new milieu and perhaps she would have children she shivered a little no not his children he seemed so curiously coldblooded and yet why not why not his curious pale half coldblooded children like little fishes of her own why not everything was possible and even desirable once one could see the strangeness of it once she could plunge through the wall of the aquarium once she could kiss him  therefore miss pinnegars quiet harping on the string was unbearable  i cant understand that you disliked mr witham so much said miss pinnegar  we never can understand those things said alvina i cant understand why i dislike tapioca and arrowrootbut i do  thats different said miss pinnegar shortly  its no more easy to understand said alvina  because theres no need to understand it said miss pinnegar  and is there need to understand the other  certainly i can see nothing wrong with him said miss pinnegar  alvina went away in silence this was in the first months after she had given albert his dismissal he was at oxford againwould not return to woodhouse till christmas between her and the woodhouse withams there was a decided coldness they never looked at her nownor she at them  none the less as christmas drew near alvina worked up her feelings perhaps she would be reconciled to him she would slip across and smile to him she would take the plunge once and for alland kiss him and marry him and bear the little halffishes his children she worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation  but when she saw him the first evening sitting stiff and staring flatly in front of him in chapel staring away from everything in the world at heaven knows whatjust as fishes starethen his dishumanness came over her again like an arrest and arrested all her flights of fancy he stared flatly in front of him and flatly set a wall of oblivion between him and her she trembled and let be  after christmas however she had nothing at all to think forward to and it was then she seemed to shrink she seemed positively to shrink  you never spoke to mr witham miss pinnegar asked  he never spoke to me replied alvina  he raised his hat to me  you ought to have married him miss pinnegar said alvina he would have been right for you and she laughed rather mockingly  there is no need to make provision for me said miss pinnegar  and after this she was a long time before she forgave alvina and was really friendly again perhaps she would never have forgiven her if she had not found her weeping rather bitterly in her mothers abandoned sittingroom  now so far the story of alvina is commonplace enough it is more or less the story of thousands of girls they all find work it is the ordinary solution of everything and if we were dealing with an ordinary girl we should have to carry on mildly and dully down the long years of employment or at the best marriage with some dull schoolteacher or officeclerk  but we protest that alvina is not ordinary ordinary people ordinary fates but extraordinary people extraordinary fates or else no fate at all the alltoonepattern modern system is too much for most extraordinary individuals it just kills them off or throws them disused aside  there have been enough stories about ordinary people i should think the duke of clarence must even have found malmsey nauseating when he choked and went purple and was really asphyxiated in a butt of it and ordinary people are no malmsey just ordinary tapwater and we have been drenched and deluged and so nearly drowned in perpetual floods of ordinariness that tapwater tends to become a really hateful fluid to us we loathe its outofthetap tastelessness we detest ordinary people we are in peril of our lives from them and in peril of our souls too for they would damn us one and all to the ordinary every individual should by nature have his extraordinary points but nowadays you may look for them with a microscope they are so worndown by the regular machinefriction of our average and mechanical days  there was no hope for alvina in the ordinary if help came it would have to come from the extraordinary hence the extreme peril of her case hence the bitter fear and humiliation she felt as she drudged shabbily on in manchester house hiding herself as much as possible from public view men can suck the heady juice of exalted selfimportance from the bitter weed of failurefailures are usually the most conceited of men even as was james houghton but to a woman failure is another matter for her it means failure to live failure to establish her own life on the face of the earth and this is humiliating the ultimate humiliation  and so the slow years crept round and the completed coil of each one was a further heavy strangling noose alvina had passed her twentysixth twentyseventh twentyeighth and even her twentyninth year she was in her thirtieth it ought to be a laughing matter but it isnt            ach schon zwanzig           ach schon zwanzig        immer noch durchs leben tanz ich         jeder jeder will mich küssen        mir das leben zu versüssen            ach schon dreissig           ach schon

brown the grey hairs were already showing true enough she still preferred to be thought of as a girl and the slowfooted years so heavy in passing were so imperceptibly numerous in their accumulation  but we are not going to follow our song to its fatal and dreary conclusion presumably the ordinary oldmaid heroine nowadays is destined to die in her fifties she is not allowed to be the longliver of the bygone novels let the song suffice her  james houghton had still another kick in him he had one last scheme up his sleeve looking out on a changing world it was the popular novelties which had the last fascination for him the skating rink like another charybdis had all but entangled him in its swirl as he pushed painfully off from the rocks of throttlehapenny but he had escaped and for almost three years had lain obscurely in port like a frail and finished bark selling the last of his bits and bobs and making little splashes in warehouseoddments miss pinnegar thought he had really gone quiet  but alas at that degenerated and shabby downatheel club he met another tempter a plump man who had been in the musichall line as a sort of agent this man had catered for the little shows of little towns he had been in america out west doing shows there he had trailed his way back to england where he had left his wife and daughter but he did not resume his family life wherever he was his wife was a hundred miles away now he found himself more or less stranded in woodhouse he had nearly fixed himself up with a musichall in the potteriesas manager he had allbut got such another place at ickley in derbyshire he had forced his way through the industrial and mining townlets prospecting for any sort of musichall or show from which he could get a picking and now in very low water he found himself at woodhouse  woodhouse had a cinema already a famous empire runup by jordan the sly builder and decorator who had got on so surprisingly in jamess younger days jordan was an obscure and illiterate nobody and now he had a motor car and looked at the tottering james with sardonic contempt from under his heavy heavylidded dark eyes he was rather stout frail in health but silent and insuperable was a w jordan  i missed a chance there said james fluttering i missed a rare chance there i ought to have been first with a cinema  he admitted as much to mr may the stranger who was looking for some sort of managing job mr may who also was plump and who could hold his tongue but whose pink fat face and lightblue eyes had a loud look for all that put the speech in his pipe and smoked it not that he smoked a pipe always cigarettes but he seized on jamess admission as something to be made the most of  now mr mays mind though quick was pedestrian not winged he had come to woodhouse not to look at jordans empire but at the temporary wooden structure that stood in the old cattle marketwrights cinematograph and variety theatre wrights was not a superior show like the woodhouse empire yet it was always packed with colliers and worklasses but unfortunately there was no chance of mr mays getting a finger in the cattle market pie wrights was a family affair mr and mrs wright and a son and two daughters with their husbands a tight old lockup family concern yet it was the kind of show that appealed to mr may pictures between the turns the cinematograph was but an item in the program amidst the more thrilling incidentsto mr mayof conjurors popular songs fiveminute farces performing birds and comics mr may was too human to believe that a show should consist entirely of the dithering eyeache of a film  he was becoming really depressed by his failure to find any opening he had his family to keepand though his honesty was of the variety sort he had a heavy conscience in the direction of his wife and daughter having been so long in america he had acquired american qualities one of which was this heavy sort of private innocence coupled with complacent and natural unscrupulousness in matters of business a man of some odd sensitiveness in material things he liked to have his clothes neat and spick his linen immaculate his face cleanshaved like a cherub but alas his clothes were now oldfashioned so that their rather expensive smartness was detrimental to his chances in spite of their scrupulous look of having come almost new out of the bandbox that morning his rather small felt hats still curved jauntily over his full pink face but his eyes looked lugubrious as if he felt he had not deserved so much bad luck and there were bilious lines beneath them  so mr may in his room in the moon and stars which was the best inn in woodhousehe must have a good hötellugubriously considered his position woodhouse offered little or nothing he must go to alfreton and would he find anything there ah where where in this hateful world was there refuge for a man saddled with responsibilities who wanted to do his best and was given no opportunity mr may had travelled in his pullman car and gone straight to the best hotel in the town like any other american with moneyin america he had done it smart too and now in this grubby pennypicking england he saw his boots being worndown at the heel and was afraid of being stranded without cash even for a railway ticket if he had to clear out without paying his hotel billwell that was the worlds fault he had to live but he must perforce keep enough in hand for a ticket to birmingham he always said his wife was in london and he always walked down to lumley to post his letters he was full of evasions  so again he walked down to lumley to post his letters and he looked at lumley and he found it a damn godforsaken hell of a hole it was a long straggle of a dusty road down in the valley with a palegrey dust and spatter from the pottery and big chimneys bellying forth black smoke right by the road then there was a short crossway up which one saw the iron foundry a black and rusty place a little further on was the railway junction and beyond that more houses stretching to hathersedge where the stocking factories were busy compared with lumley woodhouse whose church could be seen sticking up proudly and vulgarly on an eminence above trees and meadowslopes was an idyllic heaven  mr may turned in to the derby hotel to have a small whiskey and of course he entered into conversation  you seem somewhat quiet at lumley he said in his odd refinedshowmans voice have you nothing at all in the way of amusement  they all go up to woodhouse else to hathersedge  but couldnt you support some place of your ownsome rival to wrights variety  ayappenif somebody started it  and so it was that james was inoculated with the idea of starting a cinema on the virgin soil of lumley to the women he said not a word but on the very first morning that mr may broached the subject he became a new man he fluttered like a boy he fluttered as if he had just grown wings  let us go down said mr may and look at a site you pledge yourself to nothingyou dont compromise yourself you merely have a site in your mind  and so it came to pass that next morning this oddly assorted couple went down to lumley together james was very shabby in his black coat and dark grey trousers and his cheap grey cap he bent forward as he walked and still nipped along hurriedly as if pursued by fate his face was thin and still handsome odd that his cheap cap by incongruity made him look more a gentleman but it did as he walked he glanced alertly hither and thither and saluted everybody  by his side somewhat tight and tubby with his chest out and his head back went the prim figure of mr may reminding one of a consequential bird of the smaller species his plumbagogrey suit fitted exactlysave that it was perhaps a little tight the jacket and waistcoat were bound with silk braid of exactly the same shade as the cloth his soft collar immaculately fresh had a dark stripe like his shirt his boots were black with grey suède uppers but a little down at heel his darkgrey hat was jaunty altogether he looked very spruce though a little behind the fashions very pink faced though his blue eyes were bilious beneath very much on the spot although the spot was the wrong one  they discoursed amiably as they went james bending forward mr may bending back mr may took the refined manoftheworld tone  of course he saidhe used the two words very often and pronounced the second rather mincingly to rhyme with sauce of course said mr may its a disgusting placedisgusting i never was in a worse in all the cauce of my travels but thenthat isnt the point  he spread his plump hands from his immaculate shirtcuffs  no it isnt decidedly it isnt thats beside the point altogether what we want began james  is an audienceof cauce and we have it virgin soil  yes decidedly untouched an unspoiled market  an unspoiled market reiterated mr may in full confirmation though with a faint flicker of a smile how very fortunate for us  properly handled said james properly handled  why yesof cauce why shouldnt we handle it properly  oh we shall manage that we shall manage that came the quick slightly husky voice of james  of cauce we shall why bless my life if we cant manage an audience in lumley what can we do  we have a guide in the matter of their taste said james we can see what wrights are doingand jordansand we can go to hathersedge and knarborough and alfretonbeforehand that is  why certainlyif you think its necessary ill do all that for you and ill interview the managers and the performers themselvesas if i were a journalist dont you see ive done a fair amount of journalism and nothing easier than to get cards from various newspapers  yes thats a good suggestion said james as if you were going to write an account in the newspapersexcellent  and so simple you pick up just all the information you require  decidedlydecidedly said james  and so behold our two heroes sniffing round the sordid backs and wasted meadows and marshy places of lumley they found one barren patch where two caravans were standing a woman was peeling potatoes sitting on the bottom step of her caravan a halfcaste girl came up with a large paleblue enamelled jug of water in the background were two booths covered up with coloured canvas hammering was heard inside  goodmorning said mr may stopping before the woman tisnt fair time is it  no its no fair said the woman  i see youre just on your own getting on all right  fair said the woman  only fair sorry goodmorning  mr mays quick eye roving round had seen a negro stoop from under the canvas that covered one booth the negro was thin and looked young but rather frail and limped his face was very like that of the young negro in watteaus drawingpathetic wistful northbitten in an instant mr may had taken all in the man was the womans husbandthey were acclimatized in these regions the booth where he had been hammering was a hoopla the other would be a cocoanutshy feeling the instant american dislike for the presence of a negro mr may moved off with james  they found out that the woman was a lumley woman that she had two children that the negro was a most quiet and respectable chap but that the family kept to itself and didnt mix up with lumley  i should think so said mr may a little disgusted even at the suggestion  then he proceeded to find out how long they had stood on this groundthree monthshow long they would remainonly another week then they were moving off to alfreton fairwho was the owner of the pitchmr bows the butcher ah and what was the ground used for oh it was building land but the foundation wasnt very good  the very thing arent we fortunate cried mr may perking up the moment they were in the street but this cheerfulness and brisk perkiness was a great strain on him he missed his eleven oclock whiskey terriblyterriblyhis pickmeup and he darent confess it to james who he knew was tt so he dragged his weary and hollow way up to woodhouse and sank with a long oh of nervous exhaustion in the private bar of the moon and stars he wrinkled his short nose the smell of the place was distasteful to him the disgusting beer that the colliers drank ohhe was so tired he sank back with his whiskey and stared blankly dismally in front of him beneath his eyes he looked more bilious still he felt thoroughly out of luck and petulant  none the less he sallied out with all his old bright perkiness the next time he had to meet james he hadnt yet broached the question of costs when would he be able to get an advance from james he must hurry the matter forward he brushed his crisp curly brown hair carefully before the mirror how grey he was at the temples no wonder dear me with such a life he was in his shirtsleeves his waistcoat with its grey satin back fitted him tightly he had filled outbut he hadnt developed a corporation not at all he looked at himself sideways and feared dismally he was thinner he was one of those men who carry themselves in a birdie fashion so that their tail sticks out a little behind jauntily how wonderfully the satin of his waistcoat had worn he looked at his shirtcuffs they were going luckily when he had had the shirts made he had secured enough material for the renewing of cuffs and neckbands he put on his coat from which he had flicked the faintest suspicion of dust and again settled himself to go out and meet james on the question of an advance he simply must have an advance  he didnt get it that day none the less the next morning he was ringing for his tea at six oclock and before ten he had already flitted to lumley and back he had already had a word with mr bows about that pitch and overcoming all his repugnance a word with the quiet frail sad negro about alfreton fair and the chance of buying some sort of collapsible building for his cinematograph  with all this news he met jamesnot at the shabby club but in the deserted readingroom of the socalled artizans hallwhere never an artizan entered but only men of jamess class here they took the chessboard and pretended to start a game but their conversation was rapid and secretive  mr may disclosed all his discoveries and then he said tentatively  hadnt we better think about the financial part now if were going to look round for an erectioncurious that he always called it an erectionwe shall have to know what we are going to spend  yesyes well said james vaguely nervously giving a glance at mr may whilst mr may abstractedly fingered his black knight  you see at the moment said mr may i have no funds that i can represent in cash i have no doubt a little laterif we need iti can find a few hundreds many things are duenumbers of things but it is so difficult to collect ones dues particularly from america he lifted his blue eyes to james houghton of course we can delay for some time until i get my supplies or i can act just as your manageryou can employ me  he watched jamess face james looked down at the chessboard he was fluttering with excitement he did not want a partner he wanted to be in this all by himself he hated partners  you will agree to be manager at a fixed salary said james hurriedly and huskily his fine fingers slowly rubbing each other along the sides  why yes willingly if youll give me the option of becoming your partner upon terms of mutual agreement later on  james did not quite like this  what terms are you thinking of he asked  well it doesnt matter for the moment suppose for the moment i enter an engagement as your manager at a salary let us say ofof what do you think  so much a week said james pointedly  hadnt we better make it monthly  the two men looked at one another  with a months notice on either hand continued mr may  how much said james avaricious  mr may studied his own nicely kept hands  well i dont see how i can do it under twenty pounds a month of course its ridiculously low in america i never accepted less than three hundred dollars a month and that was my poorest and lowest but of cauce englands not americamores the pity  but james was shaking his head in a vibrating movement  impossible he replied shrewdly impossible twenty pounds a month impossible i couldnt do it i couldnt think of it  then name a figure say what you can think of retorted mr may rather annoyed by this shrewd shaking head of a doddering provincial and by his own sudden collapse into mean subordination  i cant make it more than ten pounds a month said james sharply  what screamed mr may what am i to live on what is my wife to live on  ive got to make it pay said james if ive got to make it pay i must keep down expenses at the beginning  noon the contrary you must be prepared to spend something at the beginning if you go in a pinchandscrape fashion in the beginning you will get nowhere at all ten pounds a month why its impossible ten pounds a month but how am i to live  jamess head still vibrated in a negative fashion and the two men came to no agreement that morning mr may went home more sick and weary than ever and took his whiskey more biliously but james was lit with the light of battle  poor mr may had to gather together his wits and his sprightliness for his next meeting he had decided he must make a percentage in other ways he schemed in all known ways he would accept the ten poundsbut really did ever you hear of anything so ridiculous in your life ten poundsdirty old screw dirty screwing old woman he would accept the ten pounds but he would get his own back  he flitted down once more to the negro to ask him of a certain wooden showhouse with section sides and roof an old travelling theatre which stood closed on selverhay common and might probably be sold he pressed across once more to mr bows he wrote various letters and drew up certain notes and the next morning by eight oclock he was on his way to selverhay walking poor man the long and uninteresting seven miles on his small and rather tightshod feet through country that had been once beautiful but was now scrubbled all over with mining villages on and on up heavy hills and down others asking his way from uncouth clowns till at last he came to the common which wasnt a common at all but a sort of village more depressing than usual naked high exposed to heaven and to full barren view  there he saw the theatrebooth it was old and sordidlooking painted darkred and dishevelled with narrow tattered announcements the grass was growing high up the wooden sides if only it wasnt rotten he crouched and probed and pierced with his penknife till a countrypoliceman in a high helmet like a jug saw him got off his bicycle and came stealthily across the grass wheeling the same bicycle and startled poor mr may almost into apoplexy by demanding behind him in a loud voice  whatre you after  mr may rose up with flushed face and swollen neckveins holding his penknife in his hand  oh he said goodmorning he settled his waistcoat and glanced over the tall lanky constable and the glittering bicycle i was taking a look at this old erection with a view to buying it im afraid its going rotten from the bottom  shouldnt wonder said the policeman suspiciously watching mr may shut the pocket knife  im afraid that makes it useless for my purpose said mr may  the policeman did not deign to answer  could you tell me where i can find out about it anyway mr may used his most affable man of the world manner but the policeman continued to stare him up and down as if he were some marvellous specimen unknown on the normal honest earth  what find out said the constable  about being able to buy it said mr may a little testily it was with great difficulty he preserved his mantoman openness and brightness  they arent here said the constable  oh indeed where are they and who are they  the policeman eyed him more suspiciously than ever  cowlards their name an they live in offerton when they arent travelling  cowlardthank you mr may took out his pocketbook cowlardis that right and the address please  i dunno th street but you can find out from the three bells thats missis sister  the three bellsthank you offerton did you say  yes  offertonwheres that  about eight mile  reallyand how do you get there  you can walkor go by train  oh there is a station  station the policeman looked at him as if he were either a criminal or a fool  yes there is a station there  aybiggest next to chesterfield  suddenly it dawned on mr may  ohh he said you mean alfreton  alfreton yes the policeman was now convinced the man was a wrongun but fortunately he was not a pushing constable he did not want to rise in the policescale thought himself safest at the bottom  and which is the way to the station here asked mr may  do yer want pinxon or bullill  pinxon or bullill  theres two said the policeman  for selverhay asked mr may  yes thems the two  and which is the best  depends what trains is runnin sometimes yer have to wait an hour or two  you dont know the trains do you  theres one in th afternoonbut i dont know if itd be gone by the time you get down  to where  bullill  oh bullill well perhaps ill try could you tell me the way  when after an hours painful walk mr may came to bullwell station and found there was no train till six in the evening he felt he was earning every penny he would ever get from mr houghton  the first intelligence which miss pinnegar and alvina gathered of the coming adventure was given them when james announced that he had let the shop to marsden the grocer next door marsden had agreed to take over jamess premises at the same rent as that of the premises he already occupied and moreover to do all alterations and put in all fixtures himself this was a grand scoop for james not a penny was it going to cost him and the rent was clear profit  but when cried miss pinnegar  he takes possession on the first of october  wellits a good idea the shop isnt worth while said miss pinnegar  certainly it isnt said james rubbing his hands a sign that he was rarely excited and pleased  and youll just retire and live quietly said miss pinnegar  i shall see said james and with those fatal words he wafted away to find mr may  james was now nearly seventy years old yet he nipped about like a leaf in the wind only it was a frail leaf  fathers got something going said alvina in a warning voice  i believe he has said miss pinnegar pensively i wonder what it is now  i cant imagine laughed alvina but ill bet its something awfulelse hed have told us  yes said miss pinnegar slowly most likely he would i wonder what it can be  i havent an idea said alvina  both women were so retired they had heard nothing of jamess little trips down to lumley so they watched like cats for their mans return at dinnertime  miss pinnegar saw him coming along talking excitedly to mr may who all in grey with his chest perkily stuck out like a robin was looking rather pinker than usual having come to an agreement he had ventured on whiskey and soda in honour and james had actually taken a glass of port  alvina miss pinnegar called discreetly down the shop alvina quick  alvina flew down to peep round the corner of the shop window there stood the two men mr may like a perky pinkfaced grey bird standing cocking his head in attention to james houghton and occasionally catching james by the lapel of his coat in a vain desire to get a word in whilst jamess head nodded and his face simply wagged with excited speech as he skipped from foot to foot and shifted round his listener  who ever can that commonlooking man be said miss pinnegar her heart going down to her boots  i cant imagine said alvina laughing at the comic sight  dont you think hes dreadful said the poor elderly woman  perfectly impossible did ever you see such a pink face  and the braid binding said miss pinnegar in indignation  father might almost have sold him the suit said alvina  let us hope he hasnt sold your father thats all said miss pinnegar  the two men had moved a few steps further towards home and the women prepared to flee indoors of course it was frightfully wrong to be standing peeping in the high street at all but who could consider the proprieties now  theyve stopped again said miss pinnegar recalling alvina  the two men were having a few more excited words their voices just audible  i do wonder who he can be murmured miss pinnegar miserably  in the theatrical line im sure declared alvina  do you think so said miss pinnegar cant be cant be  he couldnt be anything else dont you think  oh i cant believe it i cant  but now mr may had laid his detaining hand on jamess arm and now he was shaking his employer by the hand and now james in his cheap little cap was smiling a formal farewell and mr may with a graceful wave of his greysuèdegloved hand was turning back to the moon and stars strutting whilst james was running home on tiptoe in his natural hurry  alvina hastily retreated but miss pinnegar stood it out james started as he nipped into the shop entrance and found her confronting him  ohmiss pinnegar he said and made to slip by her  who was that man she asked sharply as if james were a child whom she could endure no more  eh i beg your pardon said james starting back  who was that man  eh which man  james was a little deaf and a little husky  the man miss pinnegar turned to the door there that man  james also came to the door and peered out as if he expected to see a sight the sight of mr mays tight and perky back the jaunty little hat and the grey suède hands retreating quite surprised him he was angry at being introduced to the sight  oh he said thats my manager and he turned hastily down the shop asking for his dinner  miss pinnegar stood for some moments in pure oblivion in the shop entrance her consciousness left her when she recovered she felt she was on the brink of hysteria and collapse but she hardened herself once more though the effort cost her a year of her life she had never collapsed she had never fallen into hysteria  she gathered herself together though bent a little as from a blow and closing the shop door followed james to the living room like the inevitable he was eating his dinner and seemed oblivious of her entry there was a smell of irish stew  what manager said miss pinnegar short silent and inevitable in the doorway  but james was in one of his abstractions his trances  what manager persisted miss pinnegar  but he still bent unknowing over his plate and gobbled his irish stew  mr houghton said miss pinnegar in a sudden changed voice she had gone a livid yellow colour and she gave a queer sharp little rap on the table with her hand  james started he looked up bewildered as one startled out of sleep  eh he said gaping eh  answer me said miss pinnegar what manager  manager eh manager what manager  she advanced a little nearer menacing in her black dress james shrank  what manager he reechoed my manager the manager of my cinema  miss pinnegar looked at him and looked at him and did not speak in that moment all the anger which was due to him from all womanhood was silently discharged at him like a black bolt of silent electricity but miss pinnegar the engine of wrath felt she would burst  cinema cinema do you mean to tell me but she was really suffocated the vessels of her heart and breast were bursting she had to lean her hand on the table  it was a terrible moment she looked ghastly and terrible with her masklike face and her stony eyes and her bluish lips some fearful thunderbolt seemed to fall james withered and was still there was silence for minutes a suspension  and in those minutes she finished with him she finished with him for ever when she had sufficiently recovered she went to her chair and sat down before her plate and in a while she began to eat as if she were alone  poor alvina for whom this had been a dreadful and uncalledfor moment had looked from one to another and had also dropped her head to her plate james too with bent head had forgotten to eat miss pinnegar ate very slowly alone  dont you want your dinner alvina she said at length  not as much as i did said alvina  why not said miss pinnegar she sounded short almost like miss frost oddly like miss frost  alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically  i always think said miss pinnegar irish stew is more tasty with a bit of swede in it  so do i really said alvina but swedes arent come yet  oh didnt we have some on tuesday  no they were yellow turnipsbut they werent swedes  well then yellow turnip i like a little yellow turnip said miss pinnegar  i might have put some in if id known said alvina  yes we will another time said miss pinnegar  not another word about the cinema not another breath as soon as james had eaten his plum tart he ran away  what can he have been doing said alvina when he had gone  buying a cinema showand that man we saw is his manager its quite simple  but what are we going to do with a cinema show said alvina  its what is he going to do it doesnt concern me its no concern of mine i shall not lend him anything i shall not think about it it will be the same to me as if there were no cinema which is all i have to say announced miss pinnegar  but hes gone and done it said alvina  then let him go through with it its no affair of mine after all your fathers affairs dont concern me it would be impertinent of me to introduce myself into them  they dont concern me very much said alvina  youre different youre his daughter hes no connection of mine im glad to say i pity your mother  oh but he was always alike said alvina  thats where it is said miss pinnegar  there was something fatal about her feelings once they had gone cold they would never warm up again as well try to warm up a frozen mouse it only putrifies  but poor miss pinnegar after this looked older and seemed to get a little roundbacked and the things she said reminded alvina so often of miss frost  james fluttered into conversation with his daughter the next evening after miss pinnegar had retired  i told you i had bought a cinematograph building said james we are negotiating for the machinery now the dynamo and so on  but where is it to be asked alvina  down at lumley ill take you and show you the site tomorrow the buildingit is a framesection travelling theatrewill arrive on thursdaynext thursday  but who is in with you father  i am quite alonequite alone said james houghton i have found an excellent manager who knows the whole business thoroughlya mr may very nice man very nice man  rather short and dressed in grey  yes and i have been thinkingif miss pinnegar will take the cash and issue tickets if she will take over the ticketoffice and you will play the piano and if mr may learns the control of the machinehe is having lessons now and if i am the indoors attendant we shant need any more staff  miss pinnegar wont take the cash father  why not why not  i cant say why not but she wont do anythingand if i were you i wouldnt ask her  there was a pause  oh well said james huffy she isnt indispensable  and alvina was to play the piano here was a blow for her she hurried off to her bedroom to laugh and cry at once she just saw herself at that piano banging off the merry widow waltz and in tender moments the rosary time after time the rosary while the pictures flickered and the audience gave shouts and some grubby boy called chotlet penny a bar chotlet penny a bar chotlet penny a bar away she banged at another tune  what a sight for the gods she burst out laughing and at the same time she thought of her mother and miss frost and she cried as if her heart would break and then all kinds of comic and incongruous tunes came into her head she imagined herself dressing up with most priceless variations linger longer lucy for example she began to spin imaginary harmonies and variations in her head upon the theme of linger longer lucy         linger longer lucy linger longer loo         how i love to linger longer linger long o you         listen while i sing love promise youll be true         and linger longer longer linger linger longer loo  all the tunes that used to make miss frost so angry all the dream waltzes and maidens prayers and the awful songs            for in spooneyooney island            is there any one cares for me            in spooneyooney island            why surely there ought to be  poor miss frost alvina imagined herself leading a chorus of collier louts in a bad atmosphere of woodbines and oranges during the intervals when the pictures had collapsed         howd you like to spoon with me         howd you like to spoon with me                                        why rather          underneath the oaktree nice and shady         calling me your tootseywootsey lady         howd you like to hug and squeeze                                        just try me          dandle me upon your knee         calling me your little loveydovey         howd you like to spoon with me                                        ohhgo on  alvina worked herself into quite a fever with her imaginings  in the morning she told miss pinnegar  yes said miss pinnegar you see me issuing tickets dont you yeswell im afraid he will have to do that part himself and youre going to play the piano its a disgrace its a disgrace its a disgrace its a mercy miss frost and your mother are dead hes lost every bit of shameevery bitif he ever had anywhich i doubt very much well all i can say im glad i am not concerned and im sorry for you for being his daughter im heart sorry for you i am well wellno sense of shameno sense of shame  and miss pinnegar padded out of the room  alvina walked down to lumley and was shown the site and was introduced to mr may he bowed to her in his best american fashion and treated her with admirable american deference  dont you think he said to her its an admirable scheme  wonderful she replied  of cauce he said the erection will be a merely temporary one of cauce it wont be anything to look at just an old wooden travelling theatre but thenall we need is to make a start  and you are going to work the film she asked  yes he said with pride i spend every evening with the operator at marshs in knarborough very interesting i find itvery interesting indeed and you are going to play the piano he said perking his head on one side and looking at her archly  so father says she answered  but what do you say queried mr may  i suppose i dont have any say  oh but surely surely you wont do it if you dont wish to that would never do cant we hire some young fellow and he turned to mr houghton with a note of query  alvina can play as well as anybody in woodhouse said james we mustnt add to our expenses and wages in particular  but surely miss houghton will have her wage the labourer is worthy of his hire surely even of her hire to put it in the feminine and for the same wage you could get some unimportant fellow with strong wrists im afraid it will tire miss houghton to death  i dont think so said james i dont think so many of the turns she will not need to accompany  well if it comes to that said mr may i can accompany some of them myself when im not operating the film im not an expert pianistbut i can play a little you know and he trilled his fingers up and down an imaginary keyboard in front of alvina cocking his eye at her smiling a little archly  im sure he continued i can accompany anything except a man juggling dinnerplatesand then id be afraid of making him drop the plates but songsoh songs con molto espressione  and again he trilled the imaginary keyboard and smiled his rather fat cheeks at alvina  she began to like him there was something a little dainty about him when you knew him betterreally rather fastidious a showman true enough blatant too but fastidiously so  he came fairly frequently to manchester house after this miss pinnegar was rather stiff with him and he did not like her but he was very happy sitting chatting têteàtête with alvina  where is your wife said alvina to him  my wife oh dont speak of her he said comically shes in london  why not speak of her asked alvina  oh every reason for not speaking of her we dont get on at all well she and i  what a pity said alvina  dreadful pity but what are you to do he laughed comically then he became grave no he said shes an impossible person  i see said alvina  im sure you dont see said mr may dont and here he laid his hand on alvinas armdont run away with the idea that shes immoral youd never make a greater mistake oh dear me no moralitys her strongest point live on three lettuce leaves and give the rest to the char thats her oh dreadful times we had in those first years we only lived together for three years but dear me how awful it was  why  there was no pleasing the woman she wouldnt eat if i said to her what shall we have for supper grace as sure as anything shed answer oh i shall take a bath when i go to bedthat will be my supper she was one of these advanced vegetarian women dont you know  how extraordinary said alvina  extraordinary i should think so extraordinary hard lines on me and she wouldnt let me eat either she followed me to the kitchen in a fury while i cooked for myself why imagine i prepared a dish of champignons oh most beautiful champignons beautifuland i put them on the stove to fry in butter beautiful young champignons im hanged if she didnt go into the kitchen while my back was turned and pour a pint of old carrotwater into the pan i was furious imaginebeautiful fresh young champignons  fresh mushrooms said alvina  mushroomsmost beautiful things in the world oh dont you think so and he rolled his eyes oddly to heaven  they are good said alvina  i should say so and swampedswamped with her dirty old carrot water oh i was so angry and all she could say was well i didnt want to waste it didnt want to waste her old carrot water and so ruined my champignons can you imagine such a person  it must have been trying  i should think it was i lost weight i lost i dont know how many pounds the first year i was married to that woman she hated me to eat why one of her great accusations against me at the last was when she said ive looked round the larder she said to me and seen it was quite empty and i thought to myself now he cant cook a supper and then you did there what do you think of that the spite of it and then you did  what did she expect you to live on asked alvina  nibble a lettuce leaf with her and drink water from the tapand then elevate myself with a bernard shaw pamphlet that was the sort of woman she was all it gave me was gas in the stomach  so overbearing said alvina  oh he turned his eyes to heaven and spread his hands i didnt believe my senses i didnt know such people existed and her friends oh the dreadful friends she hadthese fabians oh their eugenics they wanted to examine my private morals for eugenic reasons oh you cant imagine such a state worse than the spanish inquisition and i stood it for three years how i stood it i dont know  now dont you see her  never i never let her know where i am but i support her of cauce  and your daughter  oh shes the dearest child in the world i saw her at a friends when i came back from america dearest little thing in the world but of cauce suspicious of me treats me as if she didnt know me  what a pity  ohunbearable he spread his plump manicured hands on one finger of which was a green intaglio ring  how old is your daughter  fourteen  what is her name  gemma she was born in rome where i was managing for miss maud callum the danseuse  curious the intimacy mr may established with alvina at once but it was all purely verbal descriptive he made no physical advances on the contrary he was like a dovegrey disconsolate bird pecking the crumbs of alvinas sympathy and cocking his eye all the time to watch that she did not advance one step towards him if he had seen the least sign of comingonness in her he would have fluttered off in a great dither nothing horrified him more than a woman who was comingon towards him it horrified him it exasperated him it made him hate the whole tribe of women horrific twolegged cats without whiskers if he had been a bird his innate horror of a cat would have been such he liked the angel and particularly the angelmother in woman ohthat he worshipped but comingonness  so he never wanted to be seen outofdoors with alvina if he met her in the street he bowed and passed on bowed very deep and reverential indeed but passed on with his little back a little more strutty and assertive than ever decidedly he turned his back on her in public  but miss pinnegar a regular old grey dangerous shepuss eyed him from the corner of her pale eye as he turned tail  so unmanly she murmured in his dress in his way in everythingso unmanly  if i was you alvina she said i shouldnt see so much of mr may in the drawingroom people will talk  i should almost feel flattered laughed alvina  what do you mean snapped miss pinnegar  none the less mr may was dependable in matters of business he was up at halfpast five in the morning and by seven was well on his way he sailed like a stiff little ship before a steady breeze hither and thither out of woodhouse and back again and across from side to side sharp and snappy he was on the spot he trussed himself up when he was angry or displeased and sharp snipsnap came his words rather like scissors  but how is it he attacked arthur withamthat the gas isnt connected with the main yet it was to be ready yesterday  weve had to wait for the fixings for them brackets said arthur  had to wait for fixings but didnt you know a fortnight ago that youd want the fixings  i thought we should have some as would do  oh you thought so really kind of you to think so and have you just thought about those that are coming or have you made sure  arthur looked at him sullenly he hated him but mr mays sharp touch was not to be foiled  i hope youll go further than thinking said mr may thinking seems such a slow process and when do you expect the fittings  tomorrow  what another day another day still but youre strangely indifferent to time in your line of business oh tomorrow imagine it two days late already and then tomorrow well i hope by tomorrow you mean wednesday and not tomorrows tomorrow or some other absurd and fanciful date that youve just thought about but now do have the thing finished by tomorrow here he laid his hand cajoling on arthurs arm you promise me it will all be ready by tomorrow dont you  yes ill do it if anybody could do it  dont say if anybody could do it say it shall be done  it shall if i can possibly manage it  ohvery well then mind you manage itand thank you very much i shall be most obliged if it is done  arthur was annoyed but he was kept to the scratch and so early in october the place was ready and woodhouse was plastered with placards announcing houghtons pleasure palace poor mr may could not but see an irony in the palace part of the phrase we can guarantee the pleasure he said but personally i feel i cant take the responsibility for the palace  but james to use the vulgar expression was in his eyeholes  oh fathers in his eyeholes said alvina to mr may  oh said mr may puzzled and concerned  but it merely meant that james was having the time of his life he was drawing out announcements first was a batch of vermilion strips with the mystic script in big black letters houghtons picture palace underneath which quite small opens at lumley on october 7th at 630 pm everywhere you went these vermilion and black bars sprang from the wall at you then there were other notices in delicate paleblue and pale red like a genuine theatre notice giving full programs and beneath these a broadletter notice announced in green letters on a yellow ground final and ultimate clearance sale at houghtons knarborough road on friday september 30th come and buy without price  james was in his eyeholes he collected all his odds and ends from every corner of manchester house he sorted them in heaps and marked the heaps in his own mind and then he let go he pasted up notices all over the window and all over the shop take what you want and pay what you like  he and miss pinnegar kept shop the women flocked in they turned things over it nearly killed james to take the prices they offered but take them he did but he exacted that they should buy one article at a time one piece at a time if you dont mind he said when they came up with their threeapenny handfuls it was not till later in the evening that he relaxed this rule  well by eleven oclock he had cleared out a good dealreally a very great dealand many women had bought what they didnt want at their own figure feverish but content james shut the shop for the last time next day by eleven he had removed all his belongings the door that connected the house with the shop was screwed up fast the grocer strolled in and looked round his bare extension took the key from james and immediately set his boy to paste a new notice in the window tearing down all jamess announcements poor james had to run round down knarborough road and down wellington street as far as the livery stable then down long narrow passages before he could get into his own house from his own shop  but he did not mind every hour brought the first performance of his pleasure palace nearer he was satisfied with mr may he had to admit that he was satisfied with mr may the palace stood firm at lastoh it was so ricketty when it arrivedand it glowed with a new coat all over of darkred paint like oxblood it was tittivated up with a touch of lavender and yellow round the door and round the decorated wooden eaving it had a new wooden slope up to the doorsand inside a new wooden floor with redvelvet seats in front before the curtain and old chapelpews behind the collier youths recognized the pews  hey these eres the pews out of the old primitive chapel  sorry ah wen come ter hear t parson  theme for endless jokes and the pleasure palace was christened in some lucky stroke houghtons endeavour a reference to that particular chapel effort called the christian endeavour where alvina and miss pinnegar both figured  wheer art off sorry  lumley  houghtons endeavour  ah  rotten  so when one laconic young collier accosted another but we anticipate  mr may had worked hard to get a program for the first week his pictures were the human bird which turned out to be a skiing film from norway purely descriptive the pancake a humorous film and then his grand serial the silent grip and then for turns his first item was miss poppy traherne a lady in innumerable petticoats who could whirl herself into anything you like from an arum lily in green stockings to a rainbow and a catherine wheel and a cupandsaucer marvellous was miss poppy traherne the next turn was the baxter brothers who ran up and down each others backs and up and down each others front and stood on each others heads and on their own heads and perched for a moment on each others shoulders as if each of them was a flight of stairs with a landing and the three of them were three flights three storeys up the top flight continually running down and becoming the bottom flight while the middle flight collapsed and became a horizontal corridor  alvina had to open the performance by playing an overture called welcome all a ridiculous piece she was excited and unhappy on the monday morning there was a rehearsal mr may conducting she played welcome all and then took the thumbed sheets which miss poppy traherne carried with her miss poppy was rather exacting as she whirled her skirts she kept saying a little faster pleasea little slowerin a rather haughty official voice that was somewhat muffled by the swim of her drapery can you give it expression she cried as she got the arum lily in full blow and there was a sound of real ecstasy in her tones but why she should have called stronger stronger as she came into being as a cup and saucer alvina could not imagine unless miss poppy was fancying herself a strong cup of tea  however she subsided into her mere self panted frantically and then in a hoarse voice demanded if she was in the bare front of the show she scorned to count welcome all mr may said yes she was the first item whereupon she began to raise a dust mr houghton said hurriedly interposing that he meant to make a little opening speech miss poppy eyed him as if he were a cuckooclock and she had to wait till hed finished cuckooing then she said  thats not every night theres six nights to a week james was properly snubbed it ended by mr may metamorphizing himself into a pug dog he said he had got the costoom in his bag and doing a lumpofsugar scene with one of the baxter brothers as a brief first item miss poppys professional virginity was thus saved from outrage  at the back of the stage there was halfayard of curtain screening the two dressingrooms ladies and gents in her spare time alvina sat in the ladies dressing room or in its lower doorway for there was not room right inside she watched the ladies making upshe gave some slight assistance she saw the mens feet in their shabby pumps on the other side of the curtain and she heard the mens gruff voices often a slangy conversation was carried on through the curtainfor most of the turns were acquainted with each other very affable before each others faces very sniffy behind each others backs  poor alvina was in a state of bewilderment she was extremely niceoh much too nice with the female turns they treated her with a sort of offhand friendliness and they snubbed and patronized her and were a little spiteful with her because mr may treated her with attention and deference she felt bewildered a little excited and as if she was not herself  the first evening actually came her father had produced a pink crêpe de chine blouse and a backcomb massed with brilliantsboth of which she refused to wear she stuck to her black blouse and black shirt and her simple hairdressing mr may said of cauce she wasnt intended to attract attention to herself miss pinnegar actually walked down the hill with her and began to cry when she saw the oxblood red erection with its gasflares in front it was the first time she had seen it she went on with alvina to the little stage door at the back and up the steps into the scrap of dressingroom but she fled out again from the sight of miss poppy in her yellow hair and green knickers with greenlace frills poor miss pinnegar she stood outside on the trodden grass behind the band of hope and really cried luckily she had put a veil on  she went valiantly round to the front entrance and climbed the steps the crowd was just coming there was jamess face peeping inside the little ticketwindow  one he said officially pushing out the ticket and then he recognized her oh he said youre not going to pay  yes i am she said and she left her fourpence and jamess coppery grimy fingers scooped it in as the youth behind miss pinnegar shoved her forward  arf way down fourpenny said the man at the door poking her in the direction of mr may who wanted to put her in the red velvet but she marched down one of the pews and took her seat  the place was crowded with a whooping whistling excited audience the curtain was down james had let it out to his fellow tradesmen and it represented a patchwork of local adverts there was a fat porker and a fat porkpie and the pig was saying you all know where to find me inside the crust at frank churchills knarborough road woodhouse round about the name of w h johnson floated a bowler hat a collarandnecktie a pair of braces and an umbrella and so on and so on it all made you feel very homely but miss pinnegar was sadly hot and squeezed in her pew  time came and the colliers began to drum their feet it was exactly the excited crowded audience mr may wanted he darted out to drive james round in front of the curtain but james fascinated by raking in the money so fast could not be shifted from the paybox and the two men nearly had a fight at last mr may was seen shooing james like a scuffled chicken down the side gangway and on to the stage  james before the illuminated curtain of local adverts bowing and beginning and not making a single word audible the crowd quieted itself the eloquence flowed on the crowd was sick of james and began to shuffle come down come down hissed mr may frantically from in front but james did not move he would flow on all night mr may waved excitedly at alvina who sat obscurely at the piano and darted on to the stage he raised his voice and drowned james james ceased to wave his pennyblackened hands alvina struck up welcome all as loudly and emphatically as she could  and all the time miss pinnegar sat like a sphinxlike a sphinx what she thought she did not know herself but stolidly she stared at james and anxiously she glanced sideways at the pounding alvina she knew alvina had to pound until she received the cue that mr may was fitted in his pugdog costoom  a twitch of the curtain alvina wound up her final flourish the curtain rose and  well really said miss pinnegar out loud  there was mr may as a pug dog begging too lifelike and too impossible the audience shouted alvina sat with her hands in her lap the pug was a great success  curtain a few bars of toreadorand then miss poppys sheets of music soft music miss poppy was on the ground under a green scarf and so the accumulating dilation on to the whirling climax of the perfect arum lily sudden curtain and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers of all blossoms the arum the arum lily is most mystical and portentous  now a crash and rumble from alvinas piano this is the storm from whence the rainbow emerges up goes the curtainmiss poppy twirling till her skirts lift as in a breeze rise up and become a rainbow above her now darkened legs the footlights are all but extinguished miss poppy is all but extinguished also  the rainbow is not so moving as the arum lily but the catherine wheel done at the last moment on one leg and then an amazing leap into the air backwards again brings down the house  miss poppy herself sets all store on her cup and saucer but the audience vulgar as ever cannot quite see it  and so alvina slips away with miss poppys musicsheets while mr may sits down like a professional at the piano and makes things fly for the upanddownstairs baxter bros meanwhile alvinas pale face hovering like a ghost in the side darkness as it were under the stage  the lamps go out gurglings and kissingsand then the dither on the screen the human bird in awful shivery letters its not a very good machine and mr may is not a very good operator audience distinctly critical lights upan chotlet penny a bar chotlet penny a bar even as in alvinas dreamand then the pancakeso the first half over lights up for the interval  miss pinnegar sighed and folded her hands she looked neither to right nor to left in spite of herself in spite of outraged shame and decency she was excited but she felt such excitement was not wholesome in vain the boy most pertinently yelled chotlet at her she looked neither to right nor left but when she saw alvina nodding to her with a quick smile from the side gangway under the stage she almost burst into tears it was too much for her all at once and alvina looked almost indecently excited as she slipped across in front of the audience to the piano to play the seductive dream waltz she looked almost fussy like her father james needless to say flittered and hurried hither and thither around the audience and the stage like a wagtail on the brink of a pool  the second half consisted of a comic drama acted by two baxter bros disguised as women and miss poppy disguised as a manwith a couple of locals thrown in to do the guardsman and the count this went very well the winding up was the first instalment of the silent grip  when lights went up and alvina solemnly struck god save our gracious king the audience was on its feet and not very quiet evidently hissing with excitement like doughnuts in the pan even when the pan is taken off the fire mr houghton thanked them for their courtesy and attention and hopedand nobody took the slightest notice  miss pinnegar stayed last waiting for alvina and alvina in her excitement waited for mr may and her father  mr may fairly pranced into the empty hall  well he said shutting both his fists and flourishing them in miss pinnegars face how did it go  i think it went very well she said  very well i should think so indeed it went like a house on fire what didnt it and he laughed a high excited little laugh  james was counting pennies for his life in the cashplace and dropping them into a gladstone bag the others had to wait for him at last he locked his bag  well said mr may done well  fairly well said james huskily excited fairly well  only fairly ohh and mr may suddenly picked up the bag james turned as if he would snatch it from him well feel that for fairly well said mr may handing the bag to alvina  goodness she cried handing it to miss pinnegar  would you believe it said miss pinnegar relinquishing it to james but she spoke coldly aloof  mr may turned off the gas at the meter came talking through the darkness of the empty theatre picking his way with a flashlight  cest le premier pas qui coute he said in a sort of american french as he locked the doors and put the key in his pocket james tripped silently alongside bowed under the weight of his gladstone bag of pennies  how much have we taken father asked alvina gaily  i havent counted he snapped  when he got home he hurried upstairs to his bare chamber he swept his table clear and then in an expert fashion he seized handfuls of coin and piled them in little columns on his board there was an army of fat pennies a dozen to a column along the back rows and rows of fat brown rankandfile in front of these rows of slim halfpence like an advanceguard and commanding all a stout column of halfcrowns a few stoutish and important florinfigures like general and colonels then quite a file of shillings like so many captains and a little cloud of silvery lieutenant sixpences right at the end like a frail drummer boy a thin stick of threepenny pieces  there they all were burly dragoons of stout pennies heavy and holding their ground with a screen of halfpenny light infantry officered by the immovable halfcrown general who in his turn was flanked by all his staff of florin colonels and shilling captains from whom lightly moved the nimble sixpenny lieutenants all ignoring the wan frail joey of the threepennybits  time after time james ran his almighty eye over his army he loved them he loved to feel that his table was pressed down that it groaned under their weight he loved to see the pence like innumerable pillars of cloud standing waiting to lead on into wildernesses of unopened resource while the silver as pillars of light should guide the way down the long night of fortune their weight sank sensually into his muscle and gave him gratification the dark redness of bronze like fullblooded fleas seemed alive and pulsing the silver was magic as if winged     chapter vii  natchakeetawara   mr may and alvina became almost inseparable and woodhouse buzzed with scandal woodhouse could not believe that mr may was absolutely final in his horror of any sort of comingonness in a woman it could not believe that he was only so fond of alvina because she was like a sister to him poor lonely harassed soul that he was a pure sister who really hadnt any body for although mr may was rather fond in an epicurean way of his own body yet other peoples bodies rather made him shudder so that his grand utterance on alvina was shes not physical shes mental  he even explained to her one day how it was in his naïve fashion  there are two kinds of friendships he said physical and mental the physical is a thing of the moment of cauce you quite like the individual you remain quite nice with them and so onto keep the thing as decent as possible it is quite decent so long as you keep it so but it is a thing of the moment which you know it may last a week or two or a month or two but you know from the beginning it is going to endquite finallyquite soon you take it for what it is but its so different with the mental friendships they are lasting they are eternalif anything human he said yuman ever is eternal ever can be eternal he pressed his hands together in an odd cherubic manner he was quite sincere if man ever can be quite sincere  alvina was quite content to be one of his mental and eternal friends or rather friendshipssince she existed in abstractu as far as he was concerned for she did not find him at all physically moving physically he was not there he was oddly an absentee but his naïveté roused the serpents tooth of her bitter irony  and your wife she said to him  oh my wife dreadful thought there i made the great mistake of trying to find the two in one person and didnt i fall between two stools oh dear didnt i oh i fell between the two stools beautifully beautifully and thenshe nearly set the stools on top of me i thought i should never get up again when i was physical she was mentalbernard shaw and cold baths for supperand when i was mental she was physical and threw her arms round my neck in the morning mark you always in the morning when i was on the alert for business yes invariably what do you think of it could the devil himself have invented anything more trying oh dear me dont mention it oh what a time i had wonder im alive yes really although you smile  alvina did more than smile she laughed outright and yet she remained good friends with the odd little man  he bought himself a new smart overcoat that fitted his figure and a new velour hat and she even noticed one day when he was curling himself up cosily on the sofa that he had pale blue silk underwear and purple silk suspenders she wondered where he got them and how he afforded them but there they were  james seemed for the time being wrapt in his undertakingparticularly in the takings part of it he seemed for the time being contentedor nearly so nearly so certainly there was money coming in but then he had to pay off all he had borrowed to buy his erection and its furnishings and a bulk of pennies sublimated into a very small £sd account at the bank  the endeavour was successfulyes it was successful but not overwhelmingly so on wet nights woodhouse did not care to trail down to lumley and then lumley was one of those depressed negative spots on the face of the earth which have no pull at all in that region of sharp hills with fine hillbrows and shallow rather dreary canalvalleys it was the places on the hillbrows like woodhouse and hathersedge and rapton which flourished while the dreary places down along the canals existed only for workplaces not for life and pleasure it was just like james to have planted his endeavour down in the stagnant dust and rust of potteries and foundries where no illusion could bloom  he had dreamed of crowded houses every night and of raised prices but there was no probability of his being able to raise his prices he had to figure lower than the woodhouse empire he was secondrate from the start his hope now lay in the tramway which was being built from knarborough away through the countrya black country indeedthrough woodhouse and lumley and hathersedge to rapton when once this tramwaysystem was working he would have a supply of youths and lasses always on tap as it were so he spread his rainbow wings towards the future and began to say  when weve got the trams i shall buy a new machine and finer lenses and i shall extend my premises  mr may did not talk business to alvina he was terribly secretive with respect to business but he said to her once in the early year following their opening  well how do you think were doing miss houghton  were not doing any better than we did at first i think she said  no he answered no thats true thats perfectly true but why they seem to like the programs  i think they do said alvina i think they like them when theyre there but isnt it funny they dont seem to want to come to them i know they always talk as if we were secondrate and they only come because they cant get to the empire or up to hathersedge were a stopgap i know we are  mr may looked down in the mouth he cocked his blue eyes at her miserable and frightened failure began to frighten him abjectly  why do you think that is he said  i dont believe they like the turns she said  but look how they applaud them look how pleased they are  i know i know they like them once theyre there and they see them but they dont come again they crowd the empireand the empire is only pictures now and its much cheaper to run  he watched her dismally  i cant believe they want nothing but pictures i cant believe they want everything in the flat he said coaxing and miserable he himself was not interested in the film his interest was still the human interest in living performers and their living feats why he continued they are ever so much more excited after a good turn than after any film  i know they are said alvina but i dont believe they want to be excited in that way  in what way asked mr may plaintively  by the things which the artistes do i believe theyre jealous  oh nonsense exploded mr may starting as if he had been shot then he laid his hand on her arm but forgive my rudeness i dont mean it of cauce but do you mean to say that these collier louts and factory girls are jealous of the things the artistes do because they could never do them themselves  im sure they are said alvina  but i cant believe it said mr may pouting up his mouth and smiling at her as if she were a whimsical child what a low opinion you have of human nature  have i laughed alvina ive never reckoned it up but im sure that these common people here are jealous if anybody does anything or has anything they cant have themselves  i cant believe it protested mr may could they be so silly and then why arent they jealous of the extraordinary things which are done on the film  because they dont see the fleshandblood people im sure thats it the film is only pictures like pictures in the daily mirror and pictures dont have any feelings apart from their own feelings i mean the feelings of the people who watch them pictures dont have any life except in the people who watch them and thats why they like them because they make them feel that they are everything  the pictures make the colliers and lasses feel that they themselves are everything but how they identify themselves with the heroes and heroines on the screen  yesthey take it all to themselvesand there isnt anything except themselves i know its like that its because they can spread themselves over a film and they cant over a living performer theyre up against the performer himself and they hate it  mr may watched her long and dismally  i cant believe people are like thatsane people he said why to me the whole joy is in the living personality the curious personality of the artiste thats what i enjoy so much  i know but thats where youre different from them  but am i  yes youre not as up to the mark as they are  not up to the mark what do you mean do you mean they are more intelligent  no but theyre more modern you like things which arent yourself but they dont they hate to admire anything that they cant take to themselves they hate anything that isnt themselves and thats why they like pictures its all themselves to them all the time  he still puzzled  you know i dont follow you he said a little mocking as if she were making a fool of herself  because you dont know them you dont know the common people you dont know how conceited they are  he watched her a long time  and you think we ought to cut out the variety and give nothing but pictures like the empire he said  i believe it takes best she said  and costs less he answered but then its so dull oh my word its so dull i dont think i could bear it  and our pictures arent good enough she said we should have to get a new machine and pay for the expensive films our pictures do shake and our films are rather ragged  but then surely theyre good enough he said  that was how matters stood the endeavour paid its way and made just a margin of profitno more spring went on to summer and then there was a very shadowy margin of profit but james was not at all daunted he was waiting now for the trams and building up hopes since he could not build in bricks and mortar  the navvies were busy in troops along the knarborough road and down lumley hill alvina became quite used to them as she went down the hill soon after six oclock in the evening she met them trooping home and some of them she liked there was an outlawed look about them as they swung along the pavementsome of them and there was a certain lurking set of the head which rather frightened her because it fascinated her there was one tall young fellow with a red face and fair hair who looked as if he had fronted the seas and the arctic sun he looked at her they knew each other quite well in passing and he would glance at perky mr may alvina tried to fathom what the young fellows look meant she wondered what he thought of mr may  she was surprised to hear mr mays opinion of the navvy  hes a handsome young man now exclaimed her companion one evening as the navvies passed and all three turned round to find all three turning round alvina laughed and made eyes at that moment she would cheerfully have gone along with the navvy she was getting so tired of mr mays quiet prance  on the whole alvina enjoyed the cinema and the life it brought her she accepted it and she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing she was déclassée she had lost her class altogether the other daughters of respectable tradesmen avoided her now or spoke to her only from a distance she was supposed to be carrying on with mr may  alvina did not care she rather liked it she liked being déclassée she liked feeling an outsider at last she seemed to stand on her own ground she laughed to herself as she went back and forth from woodhouse to lumley between manchester house and the pleasure palace she laughed when she saw her fathers theatrenotices plastered about she laughed when she saw his thrilling announcements in the woodhouse weekly she laughed when she knew that all the woodhouse youths recognized her and looked on her as one of their  inferior entertainers she was off the map and she liked it  for after all she got a good deal of fun out of it there was not only the continual activity there were the artistes every week she met a new set of starsthree or four as a rule she rehearsed with them on monday afternoons and she saw them every evening and twice a week at matinees james now gave two performances each eveningand he always had some audience so that alvina had opportunity to come into contact with all the odd people of the inferior stage she found they were very much of a type a little frowsy a little fleabitten as a rule indifferent to ordinary morality and philosophical even if irritable they were often very irritable and they had always a certain fund of callous philosophy alvina did not like themyou were not supposed really to get deeply emotional over them but she found it amusing to see them all and know them all it was so different from woodhouse where everything was priced and ticketed these people were nomads they didnt care a straw who you were or who you werent they had a most irritable professional vanity and that was all it was most odd to watch them they werent very squeamish if the young gentlemen liked to peep round the curtain when the young lady was in her knickers oh well she rather roundly told them off perhaps but nobody minded the fact that ladies wore knickers and black silk stockings thrilled nobody any more than greasepaint or false moustaches thrilled it was all part of the stockintrade as for immoralitywell what did it amount to not a great deal most of the men cared far more about a drop of whiskey than about any more carnal vice and most of the girls were good pals with each other men were only there to act with even if the act was a private lovefarce of an improper description whats the odds you couldnt get excited about it not as a rule  mr may usually took rooms for the artistes in a house down in lumley when any one particular was coming he would go to a rather betterclass widow in woodhouse he never let alvina take any part in the making of these arrangements except with the widow in woodhouse who had long ago been a servant at manchester house and even now came in to do cleaning  odd eccentric people they were these entertainers most of them had a streak of imagination and most of them drank most of them were middleaged most of them had an abstracted manner in ordinary life they seemed left aside somehow odd extraneous creatures often a little depressed feeling life slip away from them the cinema was killing them  alvina had quite a serious flirtation with a man who played a flute and piccolo he was about fifty years old still handsome and growing stout when sober he was completely reserved when rather drunk he talked charmingly and amusinglyoh most charmingly alvina quite loved him but alas how he drank but what a charm he had he went and she saw him no more  the usual rather americanlooking cleanshaven slightly pasty young man left alvina quite cold though he had an amiable and truly chivalrous galanterie he was quite likeable but so unattractive alvina was more fascinated by the odd fish like the lady who did marvellous things with six ferrets or the jap who was tattooed all over and had the most amazing strong wrists so that he could throw down any collier with one turn of the hand queer cuts thesebut just a little bit beyond her she watched them rather from a distance she wished she could jump across the distance particularly with the jap who was almost quite naked but clothed with the most exquisite tattooing never would she forget the eagle that flew with terrible spread wings between his shoulders or the strange mazy pattern that netted the roundness of his buttocks he was not very large but nicely shaped and with no hair on his smooth tattooed body he was almost blue in colourthat is his tattooing was blue with pickings of brilliant vermilion as for instance round the nipples and in a strange red serpentsjaws over the navel a serpent went round his loins and haunches he told her how many times he had had bloodpoisoning during the process of his tattooing he was a queer blackeyed creature with a look of silence and toadlike lewdness he frightened her but when he was dressed in common clothes and was just a cheap shoddylooking european jap he was more frightening still for his facehe was not tattooed above a certain ring low on his neckwas yellow and flat and basking with one eye open like some ageold serpent she felt he was smiling horribly all the time lewd unthinkable a strange sight he was in woodhouse on a sunny morning a shabbylooking bit of riffraff of the east rather down at the heel who could have imagined the terrible eagle of his shoulders the serpent of his loins his supple magic skin  the summer passed again and autumn winter was a better time for james houghton the trams moreover would begin to run in january  he wanted to arrange a good program for the week when the trams started a long time ahead mr may prepared it the one item was the natchakeetawara troupe the natchakeetawara troupe consisted of five persons madame rochard and four young men they were a strictly red indian troupe but one of the young men the german swiss was a famous yodeller and another the french swiss was a good comic with a french accent whilst madame and the german did a screaming twoperson farce their great turn of course was the natchakeetawara red indian scene  the natchakeetawaras were due in the third week in january arriving from the potteries on the sunday evening when alvina came in from chapel that sunday evening she found her widow mrs rollings seated in the living room talking with james who had an anxious look since opening the pleasure palace james was less regular at chapel and moreover he was getting old and shaky and sunday was the one evening he might spend in peace add that on this particular black sunday night it was sleeting dismally outside and james had already a bit of a cough and we shall see that he did right to stay at home  mrs rollings sat nursing a bottle she was to go to the chemist for some coughcure because madame had got a bad cold the chemist was gone to chapelhe wouldnt open till eight  madame and the four young men had arrived at about six madame said mrs rollings was a little fat woman and she was complaining all the time that she had got a cold on her chest laying her hand on her chest and trying her breathing and going heeeer herr to see if she could breathe properly she mrs rollings had suggested that madame should put her feet in hot mustard and water but madame said she must have something to clear her chest the four young men were four nice civil young fellows they evidently liked madame madame had insisted on cooking the chops for the young men she herself had eaten one but she laid her hand on her chest when she swallowed one of the young men had gone out to get her some brandy and he had come back with halfadozen large bottles of bass as well  mr houghton was very much concerned over madames cold he asked the same questions again and again to try and make sure how bad it was but mrs rollings didnt seem quite to know james wrinkled his brow supposing madame could not take her part he was most anxious  do you think you might go across with mrs rollings and see how this woman is alvina he said to his daughter  i should think youll never turn alvina out on such a night said miss pinnegar and besides it isnt right where is mr may its his business to go  oh returned alvina i dont mind going wait a minute ill see if we havent got some of those pastilles for burning if its very bad i can make one of those plasters mother used  and she ran upstairs she was curious to see what madame and her four young men were like  with mrs rollings she called at the chemists back door and then they hurried through the sleet to the widows dwelling it was not far as they went up the entry they heard the sound of voices but in the kitchen all was quiet the voices came from the front room  mrs rollings tapped  come in said a rather sharp voice alvina entered on the widows heels  ive brought you the cough stuff said the widow and miss huffns come as well to see how you was  four young men were sitting round the table in their shirtsleeves with bottles of bass there was much cigarette smoke by the fire which was burning brightly sat a plump pale woman with dark bright eyes and finelydrawn eyebrows she might be any age between forty and fifty there were grey threads in her tidy black hair she was neatly dressed in a wellmade black dress with a small lace collar there was a slight look of selfcommiseration on her face she had a cigarette between her drooped fingers  she rose as if with difficulty and held out her plump hand on which four or five rings showed she had dropped the cigarette unnoticed into the hearth  how do you do she said i didnt catch your name madames voice was a little plaintive and plangent now like a bronze reed mournfully vibrating  alvina houghton said alvina  daughter of him as owns the theeetter where youre goin to act interposed the widow  oh yes yes i see miss houghton i didnt know how it was said hufftonyes miss houghton ive got a bad cold on my chest laying her plump hand with the rings on her plump bosom but let me introduce you to my young men a wave of the plump hand whose forefinger was very slightly cigarettestained towards the table  the four young men had risen and stood looking at alvina and madame the room was small rather bare with horsehair and whitecrochet antimacassars and a linoleum floor the table also was covered with a brightlypatterned american oilcloth shiny but clean a naked gasjet hung over it for furniture there were just chairs armchairs table and a horsehair antimacassared sofa yet the little room seemed very fullfull of people young men with smart waistcoats and ties but without coats  that is max said madame i shall tell you only their names and not their family names because that is easier for you  in the meantime max had bowed he was a tall swiss with almond eyes and a flattish face and a rather stiff ramrod figure  and that is louis louis bowed gracefully he was a swiss frenchman moderately tall with prominent cheekbones and a wing of glossy black hair falling on his temple  and that is géoffroigeoffrey geoffrey made his bowa broadshouldered watchful taciturn man from alpine france  and that is francescofrank francesco gave a faint curl of his lip half smile as he saluted her involuntarily in a military fashion he was dark rather tall and loose with yellowtawny eyes he was an italian from the south madame gave another look at him he doesnt like his english name of frank you will see he pulls a face no he doesnt like it we call him ciccio also but ciccio was dropping his head sheepishly with the same faint smile on his face half grimace and stooping to his chair wanting to sit down  these are my family of young men said madame we are drawn from three races though only ciccio is not of our mountains will you please to sit down  they all took their chairs there was a pause  my young men drink a little beer after their horrible journey as a rule i do not like them to drink but tonight they have a little beer i do not take any myself because i am afraid of inflaming myself she laid her hand on her breast and took long uneasy breaths i feel it i feel it here she patted her breast it makes me afraid for tomorrow will you perhaps take a glass of beer ciccio ask for another glass ciccio at the end of the table did not rise but looked round at alvina as if he presumed there would be no need for him to move the odd supercilious curl of the lip persisted madame glared at him but he turned the handsome side of his cheek towards her with the faintest flicker of a sneer  no thank you i never take beer said alvina hurriedly  no never oh madame folded her hands but her black eyes still darted venom at ciccio the rest of the young men fingered their glasses and put their cigarettes to their lips and blew the smoke down their noses uncomfortably  madame closed her eyes and leaned back a moment then her face looked transparent and pallid there were dark rings under her eyes the beautifullybrushed hair shone dark like black glass above her ears she was obviously unwell the young men looked at her and muttered to one another  im afraid your cold is rather bad said alvina will you let me take your temperature  madame started and looked frightened  oh i dont think you should trouble to do that she said  max the tall highlycoloured swiss turned to her saying  yes you must have your temperature taken and then we sll know shant we i had a hundred and five when we were in redruth  alvina had taken the thermometer from her pocket ciccio meanwhile muttered something in frenchevidently something rudemeant for max  what shall i do if i cant work tomorrow moaned madame seeing alvina hold up the thermometer towards the light max what shall we do  you will stay in bed and we must do the white prisoner scene said max rather staccato and official  ciccio curled his lip and put his head aside alvina went across to madame with the thermometer madame lifted her plump hand and fended off alvina while she made her last declaration  nevernever have i missed my work for a single day for ten years never if i am going to lie abandoned i had better die at once  lie abandoned said max you know you wont do no such thing what are you talking about  take the thermometer said geoffrey roughly but with feeling  tomorrow see you will be well quite certain said louis madame mournfully shook her head opened her mouth and sat back with closed eyes and the stump of the thermometer comically protruding from a corner of her lips meanwhile alvina took her plump white wrist and felt her pulse  we can practise began geoffrey  sh said max holding up his finger and looking anxiously at alvina and madame who still leaned back with the stump of the thermometer jauntily perking up from her pursed mouth while her face was rather ghastly  max and louis watched anxiously geoffrey sat blowing the smoke down his nose while ciccio callously lit another cigarette striking a match on his bootheel and puffing from under the tip of his rather long nose then he took the cigarette from his mouth turned his head slowly spat on the floor and rubbed his foot on his spit max flapped his eyelids and looked all disdain murmuring something about ein schmutziges italienisches volk whilst louis refusing either to see or to hear framed the word chien on his lips  then quick as lightning both turned their attention again to madame  her temperature was a hundred and two  youd better go to bed said alvina have you eaten anything  one little mouthful said madame plaintively  max sat looking pale and stricken louis had hurried forward to take madames hand he kissed it quickly then turned aside his head because of the tears in his eyes geoffrey gulped beer in large throatfuls and ciccio with his head bent was watching from under his eyebrows  ill run round for the doctor said alvina  dont dont do that my dear dont you go and do that im likely to a temperature  liable to a temperature murmured louis pathetically  ill go to bed said madame obediently rising  wait a bit ill see if theres a fire in the bedroom said alvina  oh my dear you are too good open the door for her ciccio  ciccio reached across at the door but was too late max had hastened to usher alvina out madame sank back in her chair  never for ten years she was wailing quoi faire ah quoi faire que ferezvous mes pauvres sans votre kishwégin que vaisje faire mourir dans un tel pays la bonne demoisellela bonne demoiselleelle a du coeur elle pourrait aussi être belle sil y avait un peu plus de chair max liebster schau ich sehr elend aus ach oh jeh oh jeh  ach nein madame ach nein nicht so furchtbar elend said max  manca il cuore solamente al ciccio moaned madame che natura povera senza sentimentoniente di bello ahimé che amico che ragazzo duro aspero  trova said ciccio with a curl of the lip he looked as he dropped his long beautiful lashes as if he might weep for all that if he were not bound to be misbehaving just now  so madame moaned in four languages as she posed pallid in her armchair usually she spoke in french only with her young men but this was an extra occasion  la pauvre kishwégin murmured madame elle va finir au monde elle passela pauvre kishwégin  kishwégin was madames red indian name the name under which she danced her squaws firedance  now that she knew she was ill madame seemed to become more ill her breath came in little pants she had a pain in her side a feverish flush seemed to mount her cheek the young men were all extremely uncomfortable louis did not conceal his tears only ciccio kept the thin smile on his lips and added to madames annoyance and pain  alvina came down to take her to bed the young men all rose and kissed madames hand as she went out her poor jewelled hand that was faintly perfumed with eau de cologne she spoke an appropriate goodnight to each of them  goodnight my faithful max i trust myself to you goodnight louis the tender heart goodnight valiant geoffrey ah ciccio do not add to the weight of my heart be good braves all be brothers in one accord one little prayer for poor kishwégin goodnight  after which valediction she slowly climbed the stairs putting her hand on her knee at each step with the effort  nono she said to max who would have followed to her assistance do not come up nono  her bedroom was tidy and proper  tonight she moaned i shant be able to see that the boys rooms are well in order they are not to be trusted no they need an overseeing eye especially ciccio especially ciccio  she sank down by the fire and began to undo her dress  you must let me help you said alvina you know i have been a nurse  ah you are too kind too kind dear young lady i am a lonely old woman i am not used to attentions best leave me  let me help you said alvina  alas ahimé who would have thought kishwégin would need help i danced last night with the boys in the theatre in leek and tonight i am put to bed inwhat is the name of this place dearit seems i dont remember it  woodhouse said alvina  woodhouse woodhouse is there not something called woodlouse i believe ugh horrible why is it horrible  alvina quickly undressed the plump trim little woman she seemed so soft alvina could not imagine how she could be a dancer on the stage strenuous but madames softness could flash into wild energy sudden convulsive power like a cuttlefish alvina brushed out the long black hair and plaited it lightly then she got madame into bed  ah sighed madame the good bed the good bed but coldit is so cold would you hang up my dress dear and fold my stockings  alvina quickly folded and put aside the dainty underclothing queer dainty woman was madame even to her wonderful threaded blackandgold garters  my poor boysno kishwégin tomorrow you dont think i need see a priest dear a priest said madame her teeth chattering  priest oh no youll be better when we can get you warm i think its only a chill mrs rollings is warming a blanket  alvina ran downstairs max opened the sittingroom door and stood watching at the sound of footsteps his rather bony fists were clenched beneath his loose shirtcuffs his eyebrows tragically lifted  is she much ill he asked  i dont know but i dont think so do you mind heating the blanket while mrs rollings makes thin gruel  max and louis stood heating blankets louis trousers were cut rather tight at the waist and gave him a female look max was straight and stiff mrs rollings asked geoffrey to fill the coalscuttles and carry one upstairs geoffrey obediently went out with a lantern to the coalshed afterwards he was to carry up the horsehair armchair  i must go home for some things said alvina to ciccio will you come and carry them for me  he started up and with one movement threw away his cigarette he did not look at alvina his beautiful lashes seemed to screen his eyes he was fairly tall but loosely built for an italian with slightly sloping shoulders alvina noticed the brown slender mediterranean hand as he put his fingers to his lips it was a hand such as she did not know prehensile and tender and dusky with an odd graceful slouch he went into the passage and reached for his coat  he did not say a word but held aloof as he walked with alvina  im sorry for madame said alvina as she hurried rather breathless through the night she does think for you men  but ciccio vouchsafed no answer and walked with his hands in the pockets of his waterproof wincing from the weather  im afraid she will never be able to dance tomorrow said alvina  you think she wont be able he said  im almost sure she wont  after which he said nothing and alvina also kept silence till they came to the black dark passage and encumbered yard at the back of the house  i dont think you can see at all she said its this way she groped for him in the dark and met his groping hand  this way she said  it was curious how light his fingers were in their claspalmost like a childs touch so they came under the light from the window of the sittingroom  alvina hurried indoors and the young man followed  i shall have to stay with madame tonight she explained hurriedly shes feverish but she may throw it off if we can get her into a sweat and alvina ran upstairs collecting things necessary ciccio stood back near the door and answered all miss pinnegars entreaties to come to the fire with a shake of the head and a slight smile of the lips bashful and stupid  but do come and warm yourself before you go out again said miss pinnegar looking at the man as he drooped his head in the distance he still shook dissent but opened his mouth at last  it makes it colder after he said showing his teeth in a slight stupid smile  oh well if you think so said miss pinnegar nettled she couldnt make heads or tails of him and didnt try  when they got back madame was lightheaded and talking excitedly of her dance her young men the three young men were terrified they had got the blankets scorching hot alvina smeared the plasters and applied them to madames side where the pain was what a whiteskinned soft plump child she seemed her pain meant a touch of pleurisy for sure the men hovered outside the door alvina wrapped the poor patient in the hot blankets got a few spoonfuls of hot gruel and whiskey down her throat fastened her down in bed lowered the light and banished the men from the stairs then she sat down to watch madame chafed moaned murmured feverishly alvina soothed her and put her hands in bed and at last the poor dear became quiet her brow was faintly moist she fell into a quiet sleep perspiring freely alvina watched her still soothed her when she suddenly started and began to break out of the bedclothes quieted her pressed her gently firmly down folded her tight and made her submit to the perspiration against which in convulsive starts she fought and strove crying that she was suffocating she was too hot too hot  lie still lie still said alvina you must keep warm  poor madame moaned how she hated seething in the bath of her own perspiration her wilful nature rebelled strongly she would have thrown aside her coverings and gasped into the cold air if alvina had not pressed her down with that soft inevitable pressure  so the hours passed till about one oclock when the perspiration became less profuse and the patient was really better really quieter then alvina went downstairs for a moment she saw the light still burning in the front room tapping she entered there sat max by the fire a picture of misery with louis opposite him nodding asleep after his tears on the sofa geoffrey snored lightly while ciccio sat with his head on the table his arms spread out dead asleep again she noticed the tender dusky mediterranean hands the slender wrists slender for a man naturally loose and muscular  havent you gone to bed whispered alvina why  louis started awake max the only stubborn watcher shook his head lugubriously  but shes better whispered alvina shes perspired shes better shes sleeping naturally  max stared with round sleepwhitened owlish eyes pessimistic and sceptical  yes persisted alvina come and look at her but dont wake her whatever you do  max took off his slippers and rose to his tall height louis like a scared chicken followed each man held his slippers in his hand they noiselessly entered and peeped stealthily over the heaped bedclothes madame was lying looking a little flushed and very girlish sleeping lightly with a strand of black hair stuck to her cheek and her lips lightly parted  max watched her for some moments then suddenly he straightened himself pushed back his brown hair that was brushed up in the german fashion and crossed himself dropping his knee as before an altar crossed himself and dropped his knee once more and then a third time crossed himself and inclined before the altar then he straightened himself again and turned aside  louis also crossed himself his tears burst out he bowed and took the edge of a blanket to his lips kissing it reverently then he covered his face with his hand  meanwhile madame slept lightly and innocently on  alvina turned to go max silently followed leading louis by the arm when they got downstairs max and louis threw themselves in each others arms and kissed each other on either cheek gravely in continental fashion  she is better said max gravely in french  thanks to god replied louis  alvina witnessed all this with some amazement the men did not heed her max went over and shook geoffrey louis put his hand on ciccios shoulder the sleepers were difficult to wake the wakers shook the sleeping but in vain at last geoffrey began to stir but in vain louis lifted ciccios shoulders from the table the head and the hands dropped inert the long black lashes lay motionless the rather long fine greek nose drew the same light breaths the mouth remained shut strange fine black hair he had close as fur animal and naked frailseeming tawny hands there was a silver ring on one hand  alvina suddenly seized one of the inert hands that slid on the tablecloth as louis shook the young mans shoulders tight she pressed the hand ciccio opened his tawnyyellowish eyes that seemed to have been put in with a dirty finger as the saying goes owing to the sootiness of the lashes and brows he was quite drunk with his first sleep and saw nothing  wake up said alvina laughing pressing his hand again  he lifted his head once more suddenly clasped her hand his eyes came to consciousness his hand relaxed he recognized her and he sat back in his chair turning his face aside and lowering his lashes  get up great beast louis was saying softly in french pushing him as oxdrivers sometimes push their oxen ciccio staggered to his feet  she is better they told him we are going to bed  they took their candles and trooped off upstairs each one bowing to alvina as he passed max solemnly louis gallant the other two dumb and sleepy they occupied the two attic chambers  alvina carried up the loose bed from the sofa and slept on the floor before the fire in madames room  madame slept well and long rousing and stirring and settling off again it was eight oclock before she asked her first question alvina was already up  ohalorsthen i am better i am quite well i can dance today  i dont think today said alvina but perhaps tomorrow  no today said madame i can dance today because i am quite well i am kishwégin  you are better but you must lie still today yes reallyyou will find you are weak when you try to stand  madame watched alvinas thin face with sullen eyes  you are an englishwoman severe and materialist she said  alvina started and looked round at her with wide blue eyes  why she said there was a wan pathetic look about her a sort of heroism which madame detested but which now she found touching  come said madame stretching out her plump jewelled hand come i am an ungrateful woman come they are not good for you the people i see it come to me  alvina went slowly to madame and took the outstretched hand madame kissed her hand then drew her down and kissed her on either cheek gravely as the young men had kissed each other  you have been good to kishwégin and kishwégin has a heart that remembers there miss houghton i shall do what you tell me kishwégin obeys you and madame patted alvinas hand and nodded her head sagely  shall i take your temperature said alvina  yes my dear you shall you shall bid me and i shall obey  so madame lay back on her pillow submissively pursing the thermometer between her lips and watching alvina with black eyes  its all right said alvina as she looked at the thermometer normal  normal reechoed madames rather guttural voice good well then when shall i dance  alvina turned and looked at her  i think truly said alvina it shouldnt be before thursday or friday  thursday repeated madame you say thursday there was a note of strong rebellion in her voice  youll be so weak youve only just escaped pleurisy i can only say what i truly think cant i  ah you englishwomen said madame watching with black eyes i think you like to have your own way in all things to have your own way and over all people you are so good to have your own way yes you good englishwomen thursday very well it shall be thursday till thursday then kishwégin does not exist  and she subsided already rather weak upon her pillow again when she had taken her tea and was washed and her room was tidied she summoned the young men alvina had warned max that she wanted madame to be kept as quiet as possible this day  as soon as the first of the four appeared in his shirtsleeves and his slippers in the doorway madame said  ah there you are my young men come in come in it is not kishwégin addresses you kishwégin does not exist till thursday as the english demoiselle makes it she held out her hand faintly perfumed with eau de colognethe whole room smelled of eau de cologneand max stooped his brittle spine and kissed it she touched his cheek gently with her other hand  my faithful max my support  louis came smiling with a bunch of violets and pinky anemones he laid them down on the bed before her and took her hand bowing and kissing it reverently  you are better dear madame he said smiling long at her  better yes gentle louis and better for thy flowers chivalric heart she put the violets and anemones to her face with both hands and then gently laid them aside to extend her hand to geoffrey  the good geoffrey will do his best while there is no kishwégin she said as he stooped to her salute  bien sûr madame  ciccio a button off thy shirtcuff where is my needle she looked round the room as ciccio kissed her hand  did you want anything said alvina who had not followed the french  my needle to sew on this button it is there in the silk bag  i will do it said alvina  thank you  while alvina sewed on the button madame spoke to her young men principally to max they were to obey max she said for he was their eldest brother this afternoon they would practise well the scene of the white prisoner very carefully they must practise and they must find some one who would play the young squawfor in this scene she had practically nothing to do the young squaw but just sit and stand miss houghtonbut ah miss houghton must play the piano she could not take the part of the young squaw some other then  while the interview was going on mr may arrived full of concern  shant we have the procession he cried  ah the procession cried madame  the natchakeetawara troupe upon request would signalize its entry into any town by a procession the young men were dressed as indian braves and headed by kishwégin they rode on horseback through the main streets ciccio who was the crack horseman having served a very wellknown horsey marchese in an italian cavalry regiment did a bit of show riding  mr may was very keen on the procession he had the horses in readiness the morning was faintly sunny after the sleet and bad weather and now he arrived to find madame in bed and the young men holding council with her  how very unfortunate cried mr may how very unfortunate  dreadful dreadful wailed madame from the bed  but cant we do anything  yesyou can do the white prisoner scenethe young men can do that if you find a dummy squaw ah i think i must get up after all  alvina saw the look of fret and exhaustion in madames face  wont you all go downstairs now said alvina mr max knows what you must do  and she shooed the five men out of the bedroom  i must get up i wont dance i will be a dummy but i must be there it is too dreeadful too dreeadful wailed madame  dont take any notice of them they can manage by themselves men are such babies let them carry it through by themselves  childrenthey are all children wailed madame all children and so what will they do without their old gouvernante my poor braves what will they do without kishwégin it is too dreadful too dreeadful yes the poor mr mayso disappointed  then let him be disappointed cried alvina as she forcibly tucked up madame and made her lie still  you are hard you are a hard englishwoman all alike all alike madame subsided fretfully and weakly alvina moved softly about and in a few minutes madame was sleeping again  alvina went downstairs mr may was listening to max who was telling in german all about the white prisoner scene mr may had spent his boyhood in a german school he cocked his head on one side and laying his hand on maxs arm entertained him in odd german the others were silent ciccio made no pretence of listening but smoked and stared at his own feet louis and geoffrey half understood so louis nodded with a look of deep comprehension whilst geoffrey uttered short snappy jajadocheben rather irrelevant  ill be the squaw cried mr may in english breaking off and turning round to the company he perked up his head in an odd parrotlike fashion ill be the squaw whats her name kishwégin ill be kishwégin and he bridled and beamed selfconsciously  the two tall swiss looked down on him faintly smiling ciccio sitting with his arms on his knees on the sofa screwed round his head and watched the phenomenon of mr may with inscrutable expressionless attention  let us go said mr may bubbling with new importance let us go and rehearse this morning and let us do the procession this afternoon when the colliers are just coming home there what isnt that exactly the idea well will you be ready at once now  he looked excitedly at the young men they nodded with slow gravity as if they were already braves and they turned to put on their boots soon they were all trooping down to lumley mr may prancing like a little circuspony beside alvina the four young men rolling ahead  what do you think of it cried mr may weve saved the situationwhat dont you think so dont you think we can congratulate ourselves  they found mr houghton fussing about in the theatre he was on tenterhooks of agitation knowing madame was ill  max gave a brilliant display of yodelling  but i must explain to them cried mr may i must explain to them what yodel means  and turning to the empty theatre he began stretching forth his hand  in the high alps of switzerland where eternal snows and glaciers reign over luscious meadows full of flowers if you should chance to awaken as i have done in some lonely wooden farm amid the mountain pastures youeryoulet me seeif younoif you should chance to spend the night in some lonely wooden farm amid the upland pastures dawn will awake you with a wild inhuman song you will open your eyes to the first gleam of icy eternal sunbeams your ears will be ringing with weird singing that has no words and no meaning but sounds as if some wild and icy god were warbling to himself as he wandered among the peaks of dawn you look forth across the flowers to the blue snow and you see far off a small figure of a man moving among the grass it is a peasant singing his mountain song warbling like some creature that lifted up its voice on the edge of the eternal snows before the human race began  during this oration james houghton sat with his chin in his hand devoured with bitter jealousy measuring mr mays eloquence and then he started as max tall and handsome now in tyrolese costume white shirt and green square braces short trousers of chamois leather stitched with green and red firmplanted naked knees naked ankles and heavy shoes warbled his native yodel strains a piercing and disturbing sound he was flushed erect keen tempered and fierce and mountainous there was a fierce icy passion in the man alvina began to understand madames subjection to him  louis and geoffrey did a farce dialogue two foreigners at the same moment spying a purse in the street struggling with each other and protesting they wanted to take it to the policeman ciccio who stood solid and ridiculous mr houghton nodded slowly and gravely as if to give his measured approval  then all retired to dress for the great scene alvina practised the music madame carried with her if madame found a good pianist she welcomed the accompaniment if not she dispensed with it  am i all right said a smirking voice  and there was kishwégin dusky coy with long black hair and a short chamois dress gaiters and moccasins and bare arms so coy and so smirking alvina burst out laughing  but shant i do protested mr may hurt  yes youre wonderful said alvina choking but i must laugh  but why tell me why asked mr may anxiously is it my appearance you laugh at or is it only me if its me i dont mind but if its my appearance tell me so  here an appalling figure of ciccio in warpaint strolled on to the stage he was naked to the waist wore scalpfringed trousers was duskyredskinned had long black hair and eagles feathersonly two feathersand a face wonderfully and terribly painted with white red yellow and black lines he was evidently pleased with himself his curious soft slouch and curious way of lifting his lip from his white teeth in a sort of smile was very convincing  you havent got the girdle he said touching mr mays plump waistand some flowers in your hair  mr may here gave a sharp cry and a jump a bear on its hind legs slow shambling rolling its loose shoulders was stretching a paw towards him the bear dropped heavily on four paws again and a laugh came from its muzzle  you wont have to dance said geoffrey out of the bear  come and put in the flowers said mr may anxiously to alvina  in the dressingroom the dividingcurtain was drawn max in deerskin trousers but with unpainted torso looked very white and strange as he put the last touches of warpaint on louis face he glanced round at alvina then went on with his work there was a sort of nobility about his erect white form and stifflycarried head the semiluminous brown hair he seemed curiously superior  alvina adjusted the maidenly mr may louis arose a brave like ciccio in warpaint even more hideous max slipped on a tattered huntingshirt and cartridge belt his face was a little darkened he was the white prisoner  they arranged the scenery while alvina watched it was soon done a back cloth of treetrunks and dark forest a wigwam a fire and a cradle hanging from a pole as they worked alvina tried in vain to dissociate the two braves from their warpaint the lines were drawn so cleverly that the grimace of ferocity was fixed and horrible so that even in the quiet work of sceneshifting louis stiffish female grace seemed full of latent cruelty whilst ciccios more muscular slouch made her feel she would not trust him for one single moment awful things men were savage cruel underneath their civilization  the scene had its beauty it began with kishwégin alone at the door of the wigwam cooking listening giving an occasional push to the hanging cradle and if only madame were taking the part crooning an indian cradlesong enter the brave louis with his white prisoner max who has his hands bound to his side kishwégin gravely salutes her husbandthe bound prisoner is seated by the firekishwégin serves food and asks permission to feed the prisoner the brave louis hearing a sound starts up with his bow and arrow there is a dumb scene of sympathy between kishwégin and the prisonerthe prisoner wants his bonds cut reenter the brave louishe is angry with kishwéginenter the brave ciccio hauling a bear apparently dead kishwégin examines the bear ciccio examines the prisoner ciccio tortures the prisoner makes him stand makes him caper unwillingly kishwégin swings the cradle the prisoner is tripped upfalls and cannot rise he lies near the fallen bear kishwégin carries food to ciccio the two braves converse in dumb show kishwégin swings the cradle and croons the men rise once more and bend over the prisoner as they do so there is a muffled roar the bear is sitting up louis swings round and at the same moment the bear strikes him down ciccio springs forward and stabs the bear then closes with it kishwégin runs and cuts the prisoners bonds he rises and stands trying to lift his numbed and powerless arms while the bear slowly crushes ciccio and kishwégin kneels over her husband the bear drops ciccio lifeless and turns to kishwégin at that moment max manages to kill the bearhe takes kishwégin by the hand and kneels with her beside the dead louis  it was wonderful how well the men played their different parts but mr may was a little too frisky as kishwégin however it would do  ciccio got dressed as soon as possible to go and look at the horses hired for the afternoon procession alvina accompanied him mr may and the others were busy  you know i think its quite wonderful your scene she said to ciccio  he turned and looked down at her his yellow duskyset eyes rested on her goodnaturedly without seeing her his lip curled in a selfconscious contemptuous sort of smile  not without madame he said with the slow halfsneering stupid smile without madame he lifted his shoulders and spread his hands and tilted his browsfools play you know  no said alvina i think mr may is good considering what does madame do she asked a little jealously  do he looked down at her with the same long halfsardonic look of his yellow eyes like a cat looking casually at a bird which flutters past and again he made his shrugging motion she does it all really the othersthey are nothingwhat they are madame has made them and now they think theyve done it all you see you see thats it  but how has madame made it all thought it out you mean  thought it out yes and then done it you should see her danceah you should see her dance round the bear when i bring him in ah a beautiful thing you know she claps her hand and ciccio stood still in the street with his hat cocked a little on one side rather commonlooking and he smiled along his fine nose at alvina and he clapped his hands lightly and he tilted his eyebrows and his eyelids as if facially he were imitating a dance and all the time his lips smiled stupidly as he gave a little assertive shake of his head finishing there came a great yell of laughter from the opposite pavement where a gang of pottery lasses in aprons all spattered with grey clay and hair and boots and skin spattered with pallid spots had stood to watch the girls opposite shrieked again for all the world like a gang of grey baboons ciccio turned round and looked at them with a sneer along his nose they yelled the louder and he was horribly uncomfortable walking there beside alvina with his rather small and effeminatelyshod feet  how stupid they are said alvina ive got used to them  they should be he lifted his hand with a sharp vicious movementsmacked he concluded lowering his hand again  who is going to do it said alvina  he gave a neapolitan grimace and twiddled the fingers of one hand outspread in the air as if to say there you are youve got to thank the fools whove failed to do it  why do you all love madame so much alvina asked  how love he said making a little grimace we like herwe love heras if she were a mother you say love he raised his shoulders slightly with a shrug and all the time he looked down at alvina from under his dusky eyelashes as if watching her sideways and his mouth had the peculiar stupid selfconscious halfjeering smile alvina was a little bit annoyed but she felt that a great instinctive goodnaturedness came out of him he was selfconscious and constrained knowing she did not follow his language of gesture for him it was not yet quite natural to express himself in speech gesture and grimace were instantaneous and spoke worlds of things if you would but accept them  but certainly he was stupid in her sense of the word she could hear mr mays verdict of him like a child you know just as charming and just as tiresome and just as stupid  where is your home she asked him  in italy she felt a fool  which part she insisted  naples he said looking down at her sideways searchingly  it must be lovely she said  ha he threw his head on one side and spread out his hands as if to saywhat do you want if you dont find naples lovely  i should like to see it but i shouldnt like to die she said  what  they say see naples and die she laughed  he opened his mouth and understood then he smiled at her directly  you know what that means he said cutely it means see naples and die afterwards dont die before youve seen it he smiled with a knowing smile  i see i see she cried i never thought of that  he was pleased with her surprise and amusement  ah naples he said she is lovely he spread his hand across the air in front of himthe seaand posilippoand sorrentoand capriahh youve never been out of england  no she said i should love to go  he looked down into her eyes it was his instinct to say at once he would take her  youve seen nothingnothing he said to her  but if naples is so lovely how could you leave it she asked  what  she repeated her question for answer he looked at her held out his hand and rubbing the ball of his thumb across the tips of his fingers said with a fine handsome smile  pennies money you cant earn money in naples ah naples is beautiful but she is poor you live in the sun and you earn fourteen fifteen pence a day  not enough she said  he put his head on one side and tilted his brows as if to say what are you to do and the smile on his mouth was sad fine and charming there was an indefinable air of sadness or wistfulness about him something so robust and fragile at the same time that she was drawn in a strange way  but youll go back she said  where  to italy to naples  yes i shall go back to italy he said as if unwilling to commit himself but perhaps i shant go back to naples  never  ah never i dont say never i shall go to naples to see my mothers sister but i shant go to live  have you a mother and father  i no i have a brother and two sistersin america parents none they are dead  and you wander about the world she said  he looked at her and made a slight sad gesture indifferent also  but you have madame for a mother she said  he made another gesture this time pressed down the corners of his mouth as if he didnt like it then he turned with the slow fine smile  does a man want two mothers eh he said as if he posed a conundrum  i shouldnt think so laughed alvina  he glanced at her to see what she meant what she understood  my mother is dead see he said frenchwomenfrenchwomenthey have their babies till they are a hundred  what do you mean said alvina laughing  a frenchman is a little man when hes seven years oldand if his mother comes he is a little baby boy when hes seventy do you know that  i didnt know it said alvina  but nowyou do he said lurching round a corner with her  they had come to the stables three of the horses were there including the thoroughbred ciccio was going to ride he stood and examined the beasts critically then he spoke to them with strange sounds patted them stroked them down felt them slid his hand down them over them under them and felt their legs  then he looked up from stooping there under the horses with a long slow look of his yellow eyes at alvina she felt unconsciously flattered his long yellow look lingered holding her eyes she wondered what he was thinking yet he never spoke he turned again to the horses they seemed to understand him to prick up alert  this is mine he said with his hand on the neck of the old thoroughbred it was a bay with a white blaze  i think hes nice she said he seems so sensitive  in england he answered suddenly horses live a long time because they dont livenever alivesee in england railwayengines are alive and horses go on wheels he smiled into her eyes as if she understood she was a trifle nervous as he smiled at her from out of the stable so yelloweyed and halfmysterious derisive her impulse was to turn and go away from the stable but a deeper impulse made her smile into his face as she said to him  they like you to touch them  who his eyes kept hers curious how dark they seemed with only a yellow ring of pupil he was looking right into her beyond her usual self impersonal  the horses she said she was afraid of his long catlike look yet she felt convinced of his ultimate goodnature he seemed to her to be the only passionately goodnatured man she had ever seen she watched him vaguely with strange vague trust implicit belief in him in himin what  that afternoon the colliers trooping home in the winter afternoon were rejoiced with a spectacle kishwégin in her deerskin fringed gaiters and fringed frock of deerskin her long hair down her back and with marvellous cloths and trappings on her steed riding astride on a tall white horse followed by max in chieftains robes and chieftains long headdress of dyed feathers then by the others in warpaint and feathers and brilliant navajo blankets they carried bows and spears ciccio was without his blanket naked to the waist in warpaint and brandishing a long spear he dashed up from the rear saluted the chieftain with his arm and his spear on high as he swept past suddenly drew up his rearing steed and trotted slowly back again making his horse perform its paces he was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback  crowds of excited shouting children ran chattering along the pavements the colliers as they tramped grey and heavy in an intermittent stream uphill from the low grey west stood on the pavement in wonder as the cavalcade approached and passed jingling the silver bells of its trappings vibrating the wonderful colours of the barred blankets and saddle cloths the scarlet wool of the accoutrements the bright tips of feathers women shrieked as ciccio in his warpaint wheeled near the pavement children screamed and ran the colliers shouted ciccio smiled in his terrifying warpaint brandished his spear and trotted softly like a flower on its stem round to the procession  miss pinnegar and alvina and james houghton had come round into knarborough road to watch it was a great moment looking along the road they saw all the shopkeepers at their doors the pavements eager and then in the distance the white horse jingling its trappings of scarlet hair and bells with the dusky kishwégin sitting on the saddleblanket of brilliant lurid stripes sitting impassive and all dusky above that intermittent flashing of colour then the chieftain darkfaced erect easy swathed in a white blanket with scarlet and black stripes and all his strange crest of white tipdyed feathers swaying down his back as he came nearer one saw the wolfskin and the brilliant moccasins against the black sides of his horse louis and goeffrey followed lurid horrid in the face wearing blankets with stroke after stroke of blazing colour upon their duskiness and sitting stern holding their spears lastly ciccio on his bay horse with a green seat flickering hither and thither in the rear his feathers swaying his horse sweating his face ghastlily smiling in its warpaint so they advanced down the grey pallor of knarborough road in the late wintry afternoon somewhere the sun was setting and far overhead was a flush of orange  well i never murmured miss pinnegar well i never  the strange savageness of the striped navajo blankets seemed to her unsettling advancing down knarborough road she examined kishwégin curiously  can you believe that thats mr mayhes exactly like a girl well wellit makes you wonder what is and what isnt but arent they good what most striking exactly like indians you cant believe your eyes my word what a terrifying race they here she uttered a scream and ran back clutching the wall as ciccio swept past brushing her with his horses tail and actually swinging his spear so as to touch alvina and james houghton lightly with the butt of it james too started with a cry the mob at the corner screamed but alvina caught the slow mischievous smile as the painted horror showed his teeth in passing she was able to flash back an excited laugh she felt his yellowtawny eyes linger on her in that one second as if negligently  i call that too much miss pinnegar was crying thoroughly upset now that was unnecessary why it was enough to scare one to death besides its dangerous it ought to be put a stop to i dont believe in letting these showpeople have liberties  the cavalcade was slowly passing with its uneasy horses and its flare of striped colour and its silent riders ciccio was trotting softly back on his green saddlecloth suave as velvet his dusky naked torso beautiful  eh youd think hed get his death the women in the crowd were saying  a proper savage one that makes your blood run cold  ay an a man for all that takes painted face for whats worth a tidy man i say  he did not look at alvina the faint mischievous smile uncovered his teeth he fell in suddenly behind geoffrey with a jerk of his steed calling out to geoffrey in italian  it was becoming cold the cavalcade fell into a trot mr may shaking rather badly ciccio halted rested his lance against a lamppost switched his green blanket from beneath him flung it round him as he sat and darted off they had all disappeared over the brow of lumley hill descending he was gone too in the wintry twilight the crowd began lingeringly to turn away and in some strange way it manifested its disapproval of the spectacle as grownup men and women they were a little bit insulted by such a show it was an anachronism they wanted a direct appeal to the mind miss pinnegar expressed it  well she said when she was safely back in manchester house with the gas lighted and as she was pouring the boiling water into the teapot you may say what you like its interesting in a way just to show what savage redindians were like but its childish its only childishness i cant understand myself how people can go on liking shows nothing happens its not like the cinema where you see it all and take it all in at once you know everything at a glance you dont know anything by looking at these people you know theyre only men dressed up for money i cant see why you should encourage it i dont hold with idle showpeople parading round i dont myself i like to go to the cinema once a week its instruction you take it all in at a glance all you need to know and it lasts you for a week you can get to know everything about peoples actual lives from the cinema i dont see why you want people dressing up and showing off  they sat down to their tea and toast and marmalade during this harangue miss pinnegar was always like a douche of cold water to alvina bringing her back to consciousness after a delicious excitement in a minute madame and ciccio and all seemed to become unrealthe actual unrealities while the ragged dithering pictures of the film were actual real as the day and alvina was always put out when this happened she really hated miss pinnegar yet she had nothing to answer they were unreal madame and ciccio and the rest ciccio was just a fantasy blown in on the wind to blow away again the real permanent thing was woodhouse the semper idem knarborough road and the unchangeable grubby gloom of manchester house with the stuffy padding miss pinnegar and her father whose fingers whose very soul seemed dirty with pennies these were the solid permanent fact these were life itself and ciccio splashing up on his bay horse and green cloth he was a mountebank and an extraneous nonentity a coloured old rag blown down the knarborough road into limbo into limbo whilst miss pinnegar and her father sat frowsily on for ever eating their toast and cutting off the crust and sipping their third cup of tea they would never blow awaynever never woodhouse was there to eternity and the natchakeetawara troupe was blowing like a rag of old paper into limbo nothingness poor madame poor gallant histrionic madame the frowsy miss pinnegar could crumple her up and throw her down the utilitarian drain and have done with her whilst miss pinnegar lived on for ever  this put alvina into a sharp temper  miss pinnegar she said i do think you go on in the most unattractive way sometimes youre a regular spoilsport  well said miss pinnegar tartly i dont approve of your way of sport im afraid  you cant disapprove of it as much as i hate your spoilsport existence said alvina in a flare  alvina are you mad said her father  wonder im not said alvina considering what my life is     chapter viii  ciccio   madame did not pick up her spirits after her cold for two days she lay in bed attended by mrs rollings and alvina and the young men but she was most careful never to give any room for scandal the young men might not approach her save in the presence of some third party and then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business  oh your woodhouse how glad i shall be when i have left it she said to alvina i feel it is unlucky for me  do you said alvina but if youd had this bad cold in some places you might have been much worse dont you think  oh my dear cried madame do you think i could confuse you in my dislike of this woodhouse oh no you are not woodhouse on the contrary i think it is unkind for you also this place you lookalsowhat shall i saythin not very happy  it was a note of interrogation  im sure i dislike woodhouse much more than you can replied alvina  i am sure yes i am sure i see it why dont you go away why dont you marry  nobody wants to marry me said alvina  madame looked at her searchingly with shrewd black eyes under her arched eyebrows  how she exclaimed how dont they you are not bad looking only a little too thintoo haggard  she watched alvina alvina laughed uncomfortably  is there nobody persisted madame  not now said alvina absolutely nobody she looked with a confused laugh into madames strict black eyes you see i didnt care for the woodhouse young men either i couldnt  madame nodded slowly up and down a secret satisfaction came over her pallid waxy countenance in which her black eyes were like twin swift extraneous creatures oddly like two bright little dark animals in the snow  sure she said sapient sure how could you but there are other men besides these here she waved her hand to the window  i dont meet them do i said alvina  no not often but sometimes sometimes  there was a silence between the two women very pregnant  englishwomen said madame are so practical why are they  i suppose they cant help it said alvina but theyre not half so practical and clever as you madame  oh lala i am practical differently i am practical impractically she stumbled over the words but your sue now in jude the obscureis it not an interesting book and is she not always too practically practical if she had been impractically practical she could have been quite happy do you know what i meanno but she is ridiculous sue so anna karénine ridiculous both dont you think  why said alvina  why did they both make everybody unhappy when they had the man they wanted and enough money i think they are both so silly if they had been beaten they would have lost all their practical ideas and troubles merely forgot them and been happy enough i am a woman who says it such ideas they have are not tragical no not at all they are nonsense you see nonsense that is all nonsense sue and anna they arenonsensical that is all no tragedy whatsoever nonsense i am a woman i know men also and i know nonsense when i see it englishwomen are all nonsense the worst women in the world for nonsense  well i am english said alvina  yes my dear you are english but you are not necessarily so nonsensical why are you at all  nonsensical laughed alvina but i dont know what you call my nonsense  ah said madame wearily they never understand but i like you my dear i am an old woman  younger than i said alvina  younger than you because i am practical from the heart and not only from the head you are not practical from the heart and yet you have a heart  but all englishwomen have good hearts protested alvina  no no objected madame they are all very kind and very practical with their kindness but they have no heart in all their kindness it is all head all head the kindness of the head  i cant agree with you said alvina  no no i dont expect it but i dont mind you are very kind to me and i thank you but it is from the head you see and so i thank you from the head from the heartno  madame plucked her white fingers together and laid them on her breast with a gesture of repudiation her black eyes stared spitefully  but madame said alvina nettled i should never be half such a good business woman as you isnt that from the head  ha of course of course you wouldnt be a good business woman because you are kind from the head i she tapped her forehead and shook her headi am not kind from the head from the head i am businesswoman good businesswoman of course i am a good businesswomanof course but here she changed her expression widened her eyes and laid her hand on her breastwhen the heart speaksthen i listen with the heart i do not listen with the head the heart hears the heart the headthat is another thing but you have blue eyes you cannot understand only dark eyes she paused and mused  and what about yellow eyes asked alvina laughing  madame darted a look at her her lips curling with a very faint fine smile of derision yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm  yellow eyes like ciccios she said with her great watchful eyes and her smiling subtle mouth they are the darkest of all and she shook her head roguishly  are they said alvina confusedly feeling a blush burning up her throat into her face  haha laughed madame haha i am an old woman you see my heart is old enough to be kind and my head is old enough to be clever my heart is kind to few peoplevery fewespecially in this england my young men know that but perhaps to you it is kind  thank you said alvina  there from the head thank you it is not well done you see you see  but alvina ran away in confusion she felt madame was having her on a string  mr may enjoyed himself hugely playing kishwégin when madame came downstairs louis who was a good satirical mimic imitated him alvina happened to come into their sittingroom in the midst of their bursts of laughter they all stopped and looked at her cautiously  continuez continuez said madame to louis and to alvina sit down my dear and see what a good actor we have in our louis  louis glanced round laid his head a little on one side and drew in his chin with mr mays smirk exactly and wagging his tail slightly he commenced to play the false kishwégin he sidled and bridled and ejaculated with raised hands and in the dumb show the tall frenchman made such a ludicrous caricature of mr houghtons manager that madame wept again with laughter whilst max leaned back against the wall and giggled continuously like some pot involuntarily boiling geoffrey spread his shut fists across the table and shouted with laughter ciccio threw back his head and showed all his teeth in a loud laugh of delighted derision alvina laughed also but she flushed there was a certain biting annihilating quality in louis derision of the absentee and the others enjoyed it so much at moments alvina caught her lip between her teeth it was so screamingly funny and so annihilating she laughed in spite of herself in spite of herself she was shaken into a convulsion of laughter louis was masterfulhe mastered her psyche she laughed till her head lay helpless on the chair she could not move helpless inert she lay in her orgasm of laughter the end of mr may yet she was hurt  and then madame wiped her own shrewd black eyes and nodded slow approval suddenly louis started and held up a warning finger they all at once covered their smiles and pulled themselves together only alvina lay silently laughing  oh good morning mrs rollings they heard mr mays voice your company is lively is miss houghton here may i go through  they heard his quick little step and his quick little tap  come in called madame  the natchakeetawaras all sat with straight faces only poor alvina lay back in her chair in a new weak convulsion mr may glanced quickly round and advanced to madame  oh goodmorning madame so glad to see you downstairs he said taking her hand and bowing ceremoniously excuse my intruding on your mirth he looked archly round alvina was still incompetent she lay leaning sideways in her chair and could not even speak to him  it was evidently a good joke he said may i hear it too  oh said madame drawling it was no joke it was only louis making a fool of himself doing a turn  must have been a good one said mr may cant we put it on  no drawled madame it was nothingjust a nonsensical mood of the moment wont you sit down you would like a little whiskeyyes  max poured out whiskey and water for mr may  alvina sat with her face averted quiet but unable to speak to mr may max and louis had become polite geoffrey stared with his big darkblue eyes stolidly at the newcomer ciccio leaned with his arms on his knees looking sideways under his long lashes at the inert alvina  well said madame and are you satisfied with your houses  oh yes said mr may quite the two nights have been excellent excellent  ahi am glad and miss houghton tells me i should not dance tomorrow it is too soon  miss houghton knows said mr may archly  of course said madame i must do as she tells me  why yes since it is for your good and not hers  of course of course it is very kind of her  miss houghton is most kindto every one said mr may  i am sure said madame and i am very glad you have been such a good kishwégin that is very nice also  yes replied mr may i begin to wonder if i have mistaken my vocation i should have been on the boards instead of behind them  no doubt said madame but it is a little late  the eyes of the foreigners watching him flattered mr may  im afraid it is he said yes popular taste is a mysterious thing how do you feel now do you feel they appreciate your work as much as they did  madame watched him with her black eyes  no she replied they dont the pictures are driving us away perhaps we shall last for ten years more and after that we are finished  you think so said mr may looking serious  i am sure she said nodding sagely  but why is it said mr may angry and petulant  why is it i dont know i dont know the pictures are cheap and they are easy and they cost the audience nothing no feeling of the heart no appreciation of the spirit cost them nothing of these and so they like them and they dont like us because they must feel the things we do from the heart and appreciate them from the spirit there  and they dont want to appreciate and to feel said mr may  no they dont want they want it all through the eye and finishedso just curiosity impertinent curiosity thats all in all countries the same and soin ten years timeno more kishwégin at all  no then what future have you said mr may gloomily  i may be deadwho knows if not i shall have my little apartment in lausanne or in bellizona and i shall be a bourgeoise once more and the good catholic which i am  which i am also said mr may  so are you an american catholic  wellenglishirishamerican  so  mr may never felt more gloomy in his life than he did that day where finally was he to rest his troubled head  there was not all peace in the natchakeetawara group either for thursday there was to be a change of programkishwégins wedding with the white prisoner be if saidwas to take the place of the previous scene max of course was the director of the rehearsal madame would not come near the theatre when she herself was not to be acting  though very quiet and unobtrusive as a rule max could suddenly assume an air of hauteur and overbearing which was really very annoying geoffrey always fumed under it but ciccio it put into unholy ungovernable tempers for max suddenly would reveal his contempt of the eyetalian as he called ciccio using the cockney word  bah quelle tête de veau said max suddenly contemptuous and angry because ciccio who really was slow at taking in the things said to him had once more failed to understand  comment queried ciccio in his slow derisive way  comment sneered max in echo what what why what did i say calfshead i said pigshead if that seems more suitable to you  to whom to me or to you said ciccio sidling up  to you lout of an italian  maxs colour was up he held himself erect his brown hair seemed to rise erect from his forehead his blue eyes glared fierce  that is to say to me from an uncivilized german pig ah ah  all this in french alvina as she sat at the piano saw max tall and blanched with anger ciccio with his neck stuck out oblivious and convulsed with rage stretching his neck at max all were in ordinary dress but without coats acting in their shirtsleeves ciccio was clutching a property knife  now none of that none of that said mr may peremptory but ciccio stretching forward taut and immobile with rage was quite unconscious his hand was fast on his stage knife  a dirty eyetalian said max in english turning to mr may they understand nothing  but the last word was smothered in ciccios spring and stab max half started on to his guard received the blow on his collarbone near the pommel of the shoulder reeled round on top of mr may whilst ciccio sprang like a cat down from the stage and bounded across the theatre and out of the door leaving the knife rattling on the boards behind him max recovered and sprang like a demon white with rage straight out into the theatre after him  stopstop cried mr may  halte max max max attends cried louis and geoffrey as louis sprang down after his friend thud went the boards again with the spring of a man  alvina who had been seated waiting at the piano below started up and overturned her chair as ciccio rushed past her now max white with set blue eyes was upon her  dont she cried lifting her hand to stop his progress he saw her swerved and hesitated turned to leap over the seats and avoid her when louis caught him and flung his arms round him  maxattends ami laisse le partir max tu sais que je taime tu le sais ami tu le sais laisse le partir  max and louis wrestled together in the gangway max looking down with hate on his friend but louis was determined also he wrestled as fiercely as max and at last the latter began to yield he was panting and beside himself louis still held him by the hand and by the arm  let him go brother he isnt worth it what does he understand max dear brother what does he understand these fellows from the south they are half children half animal they dont know what they are doing has he hurt you dear friend has he hurt you it was a dummy knife but it was a heavy blowthe dog of an italian let us see  so gradually max was brought to stand still from under the edge of his waistcoat on the shoulder the blood was already staining the shirt  are you cut brother brother said louis let us see  max now moved his arm with pain they took off his waistcoat and pushed back his shirt a nasty blackening wound with the skin broken  if the bone isnt broken said louis anxiously if the bone isnt broken lift thy arm frèrelift it hurts youso nonoit is not brokennothe bone is not broken  there is no bone broken i know said max  the animal he hasnt done that at least  where do you imagine hes gone asked mr may  the foreigners shrugged their shoulders and paid no heed there was no more rehearsal  we had best go home and speak to madame said mr may who was very frightened for his evening performance  they locked up the endeavour alvina was thinking of ciccio he was gone in his shirt sleeves she had taken his jacket and hat from the dressingroom at the back and carried them under her raincoat which she had on her arm  madame was in a state of perturbation she had heard some one come in at the back and go upstairs and go out again mrs rollings had told her it was the italian who had come in in his shirtsleeves and gone out in his black coat and black hat taking his bicycle without saying a word poor madame she was struggling into her shoes she had her hat on when the others arrived  what is it she cried  she heard a hurried explanation from louis  ah the animal the animal he wasnt worth all my pains cried poor madame sitting with one shoe off and one shoe on why max why didst thou not remain man enough to control that insulting mountain temper of thine have i not said and said and said that in the natchakeetawara there was but one nation the red indian and but one tribe the tribe of kishwe and now thou hast called him a dirty italian or a dog of an italian and he has behaved like an animal too much too much of an animal too little esprit but thou max art almost as bad thy temper is a devils which maybe is worse than an animals ah this woodhouse a curse is on it i know it is would we were away from it will the week never pass we shall have to find ciccio without him the company is ruineduntil i get a substitute i must get a substitute and howand wherein this countrytell me that i am tired of natchakeetawara there is no true tribe of kishweno never i have had enough of natchakeetawara let us break up let us part mes braves let us say adieu here in this funeste woodhouse  oh madame dear madame said louis let us hope let us swear a closer fidelity dear madame our kishwégin let us never part max thou dost not want to part brother wellloved thou dost not want to part brother whom i love and thou geoffrey thou  madame burst into tears louis wept too even max turned aside his face with tears alvina stole out of the room followed by mr may  in a while madame came out to them  oh she said you have not gone away we are wondering which way ciccio will have gone on to knarborough or to marchay geoffrey will go on his bicycle to find him but shall it be to knarborough or to marchay  ask the policeman in the marketplace said alvina hes sure to have noticed him because ciccios yellow bicycle is so uncommon  mr may tripped out on this errand while the others discussed among themselves where ciccio might be  mr may returned and said that ciccio had ridden off down the knarborough road it was raining slightly  ah said madame and now how to find him in that great town i am afraid he will leave us without pity  surely he will want to speak to geoffrey before he goes said louis they were always good friends  they all looked at geoffrey he shrugged his broad shoulders  always good friends he said yes he will perhaps wait for me at his cousins in battersea in knarborough i dont know  how much money had he asked mr may  madame spread her hands and lifted her shoulders  who knows she said  these italians said louis turning to mr may they have always money in another country they will not spend one sou if they can help they are like this and he made the neapolitan gesture drawing in the air with his fingers  but would he abandon you all without a word cried mr may  yes yes said madame with a sort of stoic pathos he would he alone would do such a thing but he would do it  and what point would he make for  what point you mean where would he go to battersea no doubt to his cousinand then to italy if he thinks he has saved enough money to buy land or whatever it is  and so goodbye to him said mr may bitterly  geoffrey ought to know said madame looking at geoffrey  geoffrey shrugged his shoulders and would not give his comrade away  no he said i dont know he will leave a message at battersea i know but i dont know if he will go to italy  and you dont know where to find him in knarborough asked mr may sharply very much on the spot  noi dont perhaps at the station he will go by train to london it was evident geoffrey was not going to help mr may  alors said madame cutting through this futility go thou to knarborough geoffrey and seeand be back at the theatre for work go now and if thou canst find him bring him again to us tell him to come out of kindness to me tell him  and she waved the young man away he departed on his nine mile ride through the rain to knarborough  they know said madame they know each others places it is a little more than a year since we came to knarborough but they will remember  geoffrey rode swiftly as possible through the mud he did not care very much whether he found his friend or not he liked the italian but he never looked on him as a permanency he knew ciccio was dissatisfied and wanted a change he knew that italy was pulling him away from the troupe with which he had been associated now for three years or more and the swiss from martigny knew that the neapolitan would go breaking all ties one day suddenly back to italy it was so and geoffrey was philosophical about it  he rode into town and the first thing he did was to seek out the musichall artistes at their lodgings he knew a good many of them they gave him a welcome and a whiskeybut none of them had seen ciccio they sent him off to other artistes other lodginghouses he went the round of associates known and unknown of lodgings strange and familiar of thirdrate possible public houses then he went to the italians down in the marshhe knew these people always ask for one another and then hurrying he dashed to the midland station and then to the great central station asking the porters on the london departure platform if they had seen his pal a man with a yellow bicycle and a black bicycle cape all to no purpose  geoffrey hurriedly lit his lamp and swung off in the dark back to woodhouse he was a powerfully built imperturbable fellow he pressed slowly uphill through the streets then ran downhill into the darkness of the industrial country he had continually to cross the new tramlines which were awkward and he had occasionally to dodge the brilliantlyilluminated tramcars which threaded their way acrosscountry through so much darkness all the time it rained and his back wheel slipped under him in the mud and on the new tramtrack  as he pressed in the long darkness that lay between slaters mill and durbeyhouses he saw a light aheadanother cyclist he moved to his side of the road the light approached very fast it was a strong acetylene flare he watched it a flash and a splash and he saw the humped back of what was probably ciccio going by at a great pace on the low racing machine  hi cic ciccio he yelled dropping off his own bicycle  haerer he heard the answering shout unmistakably italian way down the darkness  he turnedsaw the other cyclist had stopped the flare swung round and ciccio softly rode up he dropped off beside geoffrey  toi said ciccio  hé où vastu  hé ejaculated ciccio  their conversation consisted a good deal in noises variously ejaculated  coming back asked geoffrey  whereve you been retorted ciccio  knarboroughlooking for thee where have you  buckled my front wheel at durbeyhouses  come off  hé  hurt  nothing  max is all right  merde  come on come back with me  nay ciccio shook his head  madames crying wants thee to come back  ciccio shook his head  come on cic said geoffrey  ciccio shook his head  never said geoffrey  bastahad enough said ciccio with an invisible grimace  come for a bit and well clear together  ciccio again shook his head  what is it adieu  ciccio did not speak  dont go comrade said geoffrey  faut said ciccio slightly derisive  eh alors id like to come with thee what  where  doesnt matter thourt going to italy  who knowsseems so  id like to go back  eh alors ciccio half veered round  wait for me a few days said geoffrey  where  see you tomorrow in knarborough go to mrs pyms 6 hampden street gittiventi is there right eh  ill think about it  eleven oclock eh  ill think about it  friends everciccioeh geoffrey held out his hand  ciccio slowly took it the two men leaned to each other and kissed farewell on either cheek  tomorrow cic  au revoir gigi  ciccio dropped on to his bicycle and was gone in a breath geoffrey waited a moment for a tram which was rushing brilliantly up to him in the rain then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction he went straight down to lumley and madame had to remain on tenterhooks till ten oclock  she heard the news and said  tomorrow i go to fetch him and with this she went to bed  in the morning she was up betimes sending a note to alvina alvina appeared at nine oclock  you will come with me said madame come together we will go to knarborough and bring back the naughty ciccio come with me because i havent all my strength yes you will good good let us tell the young men and we will go now on the tramcar  but i am not properly dressed said alvina  who will see said madame come let us go  they told geoffrey they would meet him at the corner of hampden street at five minutes to eleven  you see said madame to alvina they are very funny these young men particularly italians you must never let them think you have caught them perhaps he will not let us see himwho knows perhaps he will go off to italy all the same  they sat in the bumping tramcar a long and wearying journey and then they tramped the dreary hideous streets of the manufacturing town at the corner of the street they waited for geoffrey who rode up muddily on his bicycle  ask ciccio to come out to us and we will go and drink coffee at the geisha restaurantor tea or something said madame  again the two women waited wearily at the streetend at last geoffrey returned shaking his head  he wont come cried madame  no  he says he is going back to italy  to london  it is the same you can never trust them is he quite obstinate  geoffrey lifted his shoulders madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too and she was tired and dispirited  we shall have to finish the natchakeetawara that is all she said fretfully  geoffrey watched her stolidly impassively  dost thou want to go with him she asked suddenly  geoffrey smiled sheepishly and his colour deepened but he did not speak  go then she said go then go with him but for the sake of my honour finish this week at woodhouse can i make miss houghtons father lose these two nights where is your shame finish this week and then go gobut finish this week tell francesco that i have finished with him but let him finish this engagement dont put me to shame dont destroy my honour and the honour of the natchakeetawara tell him that  geoffrey turned again into the house madame in her chic little black hat and spotted veil and her trim black coatandskirt stood there at the streetcorner staring before her shivering a little with cold but saying no word of any sort  again geoffrey appeared out of the doorway his face was impassive  he says he doesnt want he said  ah she cried suddenly in french the ungrateful the animal he shall suffer see if he shall not suffer the low canaille without faith or feeling my max thou wert right ah such canaille should be beaten as dogs are beaten till they follow at heel will no one beat him for me no one yes go back tell him before he leaves england he shall feel the hand of kishwégin and it shall be heavier than the black hand tell him that the coward that causes a womans word to be broken against her will ah canaille canaille neither faith nor feeling neither faith nor feeling trust them not dogs of the south she took a few agitated steps down the pavement then she raised her veil to wipe away her tears of anger and bitter disappointment  wait a bit said alvina ill go she was touched  no dont you cried madame  yes i will she said the light of battle was in her eyes youll come with me to the door she said to geoffrey  geoffrey started obediently and led the way up a long narrow stair covered with yellowandbrown oilcloth rather worn on to the top of the house  ciccio he said outside the door  oui came the curly voice of ciccio  geoffrey opened the door ciccio was sitting on a narrow bed in a rather poor attic under the steep slope of the roof  dont come in said alvina to geoffrey looking over her shoulder at him as she entered then she closed the door behind her and stood with her back to it facing the italian he sat loose on the bed a cigarette between his fingers dropping ash on the bare boards between his feet he looked up curiously at alvina she stood watching him with wide bright blue eyes smiling slightly and saying nothing he looked up at her steadily on his guard from under his long black lashes  wont you come she said smiling and looking into his eyes he flicked off the ash of his cigarette with his little finger she wondered why he wore the nail of his little finger so long so very long still she smiled at him and still he gave no sign  do come she urged never taking her eyes from him  he made not the slightest movement but sat with his hands dropped between his knees watching her the cigarette wavering up its blue thread of smoke  wont you she said as she stood with her back to the door wont you come she smiled strangely and vividly  suddenly she took a pace forward stooped watching his face as if timidly caught his brown hand in her own and lifted it towards herself his hand started dropped the cigarette but was not withdrawn  you will come wont you she said smiling gently into his strange watchful yellow eyes that looked fixedly into hers the dark pupil opening round and softening she smiled into his softening round eyes the eyes of some animal which stares in one of its silent gentler moments and suddenly she kissed his hand kissed it twice quickly on the fingers and the back he wore a silver ring even as she kissed his fingers with her lips the silver ring seemed to her a symbol of his subjection inferiority she drew his hand slightly and he rose to his feet  she turned round and took the doorhandle still holding his fingers in her left hand  you are coming arent you she said looking over her shoulder into his eyes and taking consent from his unchanging eyes she let go his hand and slightly opened the door he turned slowly and taking his coat from a nail slung it over his shoulders and drew it on then he picked up his hat and put his foot on his halfsmoked cigarette which lay smoking still he followed her out of the room walking with his head rather forward in the half loutish sensualsubjected way of the italians  as they entered the street they saw the trim french figure of madame standing alone as if abandoned her face was very white under her spotted veil her eyes very black she watched ciccio following behind alvina in his dark hangdog fashion and she did not move a muscle until he came to a standstill in front of her she was watching his face  te voilà donc she said without expression allons boire un café hé let us go and drink some coffee she had now put an inflection of tenderness into her voice but her eyes were black with anger ciccio smiled slowly the slow fine stupid smile and turned to walk alongside  madame said nothing as they went geoffrey passed on his bicycle calling out that he would go straight to woodhouse  when the three sat with their cups of coffee madame pushed up her veil just above her eyes so that it was a black band above her brows her face was pale and full like a childs but almost stonily expressionless her eyes were black and inscrutable she watched both ciccio and alvina with her black inscrutable looks  would you like also biscuits with your coffee the two of you she said with an amiable intonation which her strange black looks belied  yes said alvina she was a little flushed as if defiant while ciccio sat sheepishly turning aside his ducked head the slow stupid yet fine smile on his lips  and no more trouble with max heinyou ciccio said madame still with the amiable intonation and the same black watching eyes no more of these stupid scenes hein what do you answer me  no more from me he said looking up at her with a narrow catlike look in his derisive eyes  ho no no more good then it is good we are glad arent we miss houghton that ciccio has come back and there are to be no more rowsheinarent we  im awfully glad said alvina  awfully gladyesawfully glad you hear you ciccio and you remember another time what dont you hé  he looked up at her the slow derisive smile curling his lips  sure he said slowly with subtle intonation  yes good well then well then we are all friends we are all friends arent we all the natchakeetawaras hé what you think what you say  yes said ciccio again looking up at her with his yellow glinting eyes  all right all right then it is all rightforgotten madame sounded quite frank and restored but the sullen watchfulness in her eyes and the narrowed look in ciccios as he glanced at her showed another state behind the obviousness of the words and miss houghton is one of us yes she has united us once more and so she has become one of us madame smiled strangely from her blank round white face  i should love to be one of the natchakeetawaras said alvina  yeswellwhy not why not become one why not what you say ciccio you can play the piano perhaps do other things perhaps better than kishwégin what you say ciccio should she not join us is she not one of us  he smiled and showed his teeth but did not answer  well what is it say then shall she not  yes said ciccio unwilling to commit himself  yes so i say so i say quite a good idea we will think of it and speak perhaps to your father and you shall come yes  so the two women returned to woodhouse by the tramcar while ciccio rode home on his bicycle it was surprising how little madame and alvina found to say to one another  madame effected the reunion of her troupe and all seemed pretty much as before she had decided to dance the next night the saturday night on sunday the party would leave for warsall about thirty miles away to fulfil their next engagement  that evening ciccio whenever he had a moment to spare watched alvina she knew it but she could not make out what his watching meant in the same way he might have watched a serpent had he found one gliding in the theatre he looked at her sideways furtively but persistently and yet he did not want to meet her glance he avoided her and watched her as she saw him standing in his negligent muscular slouching fashion with his head dropped forward and his eyes sideways sometimes she disliked him but there was a sort of finesse about his face his skin was delicately tawny and slightly lustrous the eyes were set in so dark that one expected them to be black and flashing and then one met the yellow pupils sulphureous and remote it was like meeting a lion his long fine nose his rather long rounded chin and curling lips seemed refined through ages of forgotten culture he was waiting silent there with something muscular and remote about his very droop he was waiting what for alvina could not guess she wanted to meet his eye to have an open understanding with him but he would not when she went up to talk to him he answered in his stupid fashion with a smile of the mouth and no change of the eyes saying nothing at all obstinately he held away from her when he was in his warpaint for one moment she hated his muscular handsome downwarddrooping torso so stupid and full the fine sharp uprightness of max seemed much finer clearer more manly ciccios velvety suave heaviness the very heave of his muscles so full and softly powerful sickened her  she flashed away angrily on her piano madame who was dancing kishwégin on the last evening cast sharp glances at her alvina had avoided madame as ciccio had avoided alvinaelusive and yet conscious a distance and yet a connection  madame danced beautifully no denying it she was an artist she became something quite different fresh virginal pristine a magic creature flickering there she was infinitely delicate and attractive her braves became glamorous and heroic at once and magically she cast her spell over them it was all very well for alvina to bang the piano crossly she could not put out the glow which surrounded kishwégin and her troupe ciccio was handsome now without warpaint and roused fearless and at the same time suggestive a dark mysterious glamour on his face passionate and remote a strangerand so beautiful alvina flashed at the piano almost in tears she hated his beauty it shut her apart she had nothing to do with it  madame with her long dark hair hanging in finelybrushed tresses her cheek burning under its dusky stain was another creature how soft she was on her feet how humble and remote she seemed as across a chasm from the men how submissive she was with an eternity of inaccessible submission her hovering dance round the dead bear was exquisite her dark secretive curiosity her admiration of the massive male strength of the creature her quivers of triumph over the dead beast her cruel exultation and her fear that he was not really dead it was a lovely sight suggesting the worlds morning before eve had bitten any whitefleshed apple whilst she was still dusky darkeyed and still and then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner now indeed she was the dusky eve tempted into knowledge her fascination was ruthless she kneeled by the dead brave her husband as she had knelt by the bear in fear and admiration and doubt and exultation she gave him the least little push with her foot dead meat like the bear and a flash of delight went over her that changed into a sob of mortal anguish and then flickering wicked doubtful she watched ciccio wrestling with the bear  she was the clue to all the action was kishwégin and her dark braves seemed to become darker more secret malevolent burning with a cruel fire and at the same time wistful knowing their end ciccio laughed in a strange way as he wrestled with the bear as he had never laughed on the previous evenings the sound went out into the audience a soft malevolent derisive sound and when the bear was supposed to have crushed him and he was to have fallen he reeled out of the bears arms and said to madame in his derisive voice  vivo sempre madame and then he fell  madame stopped as if shot hearing his words i am still alive madame she remained suspended motionless suddenly wilted then all at once her hand went to her mouth with a scream  the bear  so the scene concluded itself but instead of the tender halfwistful triumph of kishwégin a triumph electric as it should have been when she took the white mans hand and kissed it there was a doubt a hesitancy a nullity and max did not quite know what to do  after the performance neither madame nor max dared say anything to ciccio about his innovation into the play louis felt he had to speakit was left to him  i say cic he said why did you change the scene it might have spoiled everything if madame wasnt such a genius why did you say that  why said ciccio answering louis french in italian i am tired of being dead you see  madame and max heard in silence  when alvina had played god save the king she went round behind the stage but ciccio and geoffrey had already packed up the property and left madame was talking to james houghton louis and max were busy together mr may came to alvina  well he said that closes another week i think weve done very well in face of difficulties dont you  wonderfully she said  but poor mr may spoke and looked pathetically he seemed to feel forlorn alvina was not attending to him her eye was roving she took no notice of him  madame came up  well miss houghton she said time to say goodbye i suppose  how do you feel after dancing asked alvina  wellnot so strong as usualbut not so bad you know i shall be all rightthanks to you i think your father is more ill than i to me he looks very ill  father wears himself away said alvina  yes and when we are no longer young there is not so much to wear well i must thank you once more  what time do you leave in the morning  by the train at halfpast ten if it doesnt rain the young men will cycleperhaps all of them then they will go when they like  i will come round to say goodbye said alvina  oh nodont disturb yourself  yes i want to take home the thingsthe kettle for the bronchitis and those things  oh thank you very muchbut dont trouble yourself i will send ciccio with themor one of the others  i should like to say goodbye to you all persisted alvina  madame glanced round at max and louis  are we not all here no the two have gone no well well what time will you come  about nine  very well and i leave at ten very well then au revoir till the morning goodnight  goodnight said alvina her colour was rather flushed  she walked up with mr may and hardly noticed he was there after supper when james houghton had gone up to count his pennies alvina said to miss pinnegar  dont you think father looks rather seedy miss pinnegar  ive been thinking so a long time said miss pinnegar tartly  what do you think he ought to do  hes killing himself down there in all weathers and freezing in that boxoffice and then the bad atmosphere hes killing himself thats all  what can we do  nothing so long as theres that place down there nothing at all  alvina thought so too so she went to bed  she was up in time and watching the clock it was a grey morning but not raining at five minutes to nine she hurried off to mrs rollings in the back yard the bicycles were out glittering and muddy according to their owners ciccio was crouching mending a tire crouching balanced on his toes near the earth he turned like a quickeared animal glancing up as she approached but did not rise  are you getting ready to go she said looking down at him he screwed his head round to her unwillingly upside down his chin tilted up at her she did not know him thus inverted her eyes rested on his face puzzled his chin seemed so large aggressive he was a little bit repellent and brutal inverted yet she continued  would you help me to carry back the things we brought for madame  he rose to his feet but did not look at her he was wearing broken cycling shoes he stood looking at his bicycle tube  not just yet she said i want to say goodbye to madame will you come in half an hour  yes i will come he said still watching his bicycle tube which sprawled nakedly on the floor the forward drop of his head was curiously beautiful to her the straight powerful nape of the neck the delicate shape of the back of the head the black hair the way the neck sprang from the strong loose shoulders was beautiful there was something mindless but intent about the forward reach of his head his face seemed colourless neutraltinted and expressionless  she went indoors the young men were moving about making preparations  come upstairs miss houghton called madames voice from above alvina mounted to find madame packing  it is an uneasy moment when we are busy to move said madame looking up at alvina as if she were a stranger  im afraid im in the way but i wont stay a minute  oh it is all right here are the things you brought madame indicated a little pileand thank you very much very much i feel you saved my life and now let me give you one little token of my gratitude it is not much because we are not millionaires in the natchakeetawara just a little remembrance of our troublesome visit to woodhouse  she presented alvina with a pair of exquisite bead moccasins woven in a weird lovely pattern with soft deerskin soles and sides  they belong to kishwégin so it is kishwégin who gives them to you because she is grateful to you for saving her life or at least from a long illness  ohbut i dont want to take them said alvina  you dont like them why  i think theyre lovely lovely but i dont want to take them from you  if i give them you do not take them from me you receive them hé and madame pressed back the slippers opening her plump jewelled hands in a gesture of finality  but i dont like to take these said alvina i feel they belong to natchakeetawara and i dont want to rob natchakeetawara do i do take them back  no i have given them you cannot rob natchakeetawara in taking a pair of shoesimpossible  and im sure they are much too small for me  ha exclaimed madame it is that try  i know they are said alvina laughing confusedly  she sat down and took off her own shoe the moccasin was a little too shortjust a little but it was charming on the foot charming  yes said madame it is too short very well i must find you something else  please dont said alvina please dont find me anything i dont want anything please  what said madame eyeing her closely you dont want why you dont want anything from natchakeetawara or from kishwégin hé from which  dont give me anything please said alvina  all right all right then i wont i wont give you anything i cant give you anything you want from natchakeetawara  and madame busied herself again with the packing  im awfully sorry you are going said alvina  sorry why yes so am i sorry we shant see you any more yes so i am but perhaps we shall see you another timehé i shall send you a postcard perhaps i shall send one of the young men on his bicycle to bring you something which i shall buy for you yes shall i  oh i should be awfully gladbut dont buy alvina checked herself in time dont buy anything send me a little thing from natchakeetawara i love the slippers  but they are too small said madame who had been watching her with black eyes that read every motive madame too had her avaricious side and was glad to get back the slippers very wellvery well i will do that i will send you some small thing from natchakeetawara and one of the young men shall bring it perhaps ciccio hé  thank you so much said alvina holding out her hand goodbye im so sorry youre going  wellwell we are not going so very far not so very far perhaps we shall see each other another day it may be goodbye  madame took alvinas hand and smiled at her winsomely all at once kindly from her inscrutable black eyes a sudden unusual kindness alvina flushed with surprise and a desire to cry  yes i am sorry you are not with natchakeetawara but we shall see goodbye i shall do my packing  alvina carried down the things she had to remove then she went to say goodbye to the young men who were in various stages of their toilet max alone was quite presentable  ciccio was just putting on the outer cover of his front tire she watched his brown thumbs press it into place he was quick and sure much more capable and even masterful than you would have supposed seeing his tawny mediterranean hands he spun the wheel round patting it lightly  is it finished  yes i think he reached his pump and blew up the tire she watched his softlyapplied force what physical muscular force there was in him then he swung round the bicycle and stood it again on its wheels after which he quickly folded his tools  will you come now she said  he turned rubbing his hands together and drying them on an old cloth he went into the house pulled on his coat and his cap and picked up the things from the table  where are you going max asked  ciccio jerked his head towards alvina  oh allow me to carry them miss houghton he is not fit said max  true ciccio had no collar on and his shoes were burst  i dont mind said alvina hastily he knows where they go he brought them before  but i will carry them i am dressed allow me and he began to take the things you get dressed ciccio  ciccio looked at alvina  do you want he said as if waiting for orders  do let ciccio take them said alvina to max thank you ever so much but let him take them  so alvina marched off through the sunday morning streets with the italian who was down at heel and encumbered with an armful of sickroom apparatus she did not know what to say and he said nothing  we will go in this way she said suddenly opening the hall door she had unlocked it before she went out for that entrance was hardly ever used so she showed the italian into the sombre drawingroom with its high black bookshelves with rows and rows of calfbound volumes its old red and flowered carpet its grand piano littered with music ciccio put down the things as she directed and stood with his cap in his hands looking aside  thank you so much she said lingering  he curled his lips in a faint deprecatory smile  nothing he murmured  his eye had wandered uncomfortably up to a portrait on the wall  that was my mother said alvina  he glanced down at her but did not answer  i am so sorry youre going away she said nervously she stood looking up at him with wide blue eyes  the faint smile grew on the lower part of his face which he kept averted then he looked at her  we have to move he said with his eyes watching her reservedly his mouth twisting with a halfbashful smile  do you like continually going away she said her wide blue eyes fixed on his face  he nodded slightly  we have to do it i like it  what he said meant nothing to him he now watched her fixedly with a slightly mocking look and a reserve he would not relinquish  do you think i shall ever see you again she said  should you like he answered with a sly smile and a faint shrug  i should like awfully a flush grew on her cheek she heard miss pinnegars scarcely audible step approaching  he nodded at her slightly watching her fixedly turning up the corners of his eyes slyly his nose seeming slyly to sharpen  all right next week eh in the morning  do cried alvina as miss pinnegar came through the door he glanced quickly over his shoulder  oh cried miss pinnegar i couldnt imagine who it was she eyed the young fellow sharply  couldnt you said alvina we brought back these things  oh yes wellyoud better come into the other room to the fire said miss pinnegar  i shall go along goodbye said ciccio and with a slight bow to alvina and a still slighter to miss pinnegar he was out of the room and out of the front door as if turning tail  i suppose theyre going this morning said miss pinnegar     chapter ix  alvina becomes allaye   alvina wept when the natchas had gone she loved them so much she wanted to be with them even ciccio she regarded as only one of the natchas she looked forward to his coming as to a visit from the troupe  how dull the theatre was without them she was tired of the endeavour she wished it did not exist the rehearsal on the monday morning bored her terribly her father was nervous and irritable the previous week had tried him sorely he had worked himself into a state of nervous apprehension such as nothing would have justified unless perhaps if the wooden walls of the endeavour had burnt to the ground with james inside victimized like another samson he had developed a nervous horror of all artistes he did not feel safe for one single moment whilst he depended on a single one of them  we shall have to convert into all pictures he said in a nervous fever to mr may dont make any more engagements after the end of next month  really said mr may really have you quite decided  yes quite yes quite james fluttered i have written about a new machine and the supply of films from chanticlers  really said mr may oh well then in that case but he was filled with dismay and chagrin  of cauce he said later to alvina i cant possibly stop on if we are nothing but a picture show and he arched his blanched and dismal eyelids with ghastly finality  why cried alvina  ohwhy he was rather ironic well its not my line at all im not a filmoperator and he put his head on one side with a grimace of contempt and superiority  but you are as well said alvina  yes as well but not only you may wash the dishes in the scullery but youre not only the char are you  but is it the same cried alvina  of cauce cried mr may of cauce its the same  alvina laughed a little heartlessly into his pallid stricken eyes  but what will you do she asked  i shall have to look for something else said the injured but dauntless little man theres nothing else is there  wouldnt you stay on she asked  i wouldnt think of it i wouldnt think of it he turtled like an injured pigeon  well she said looking laconically into his face its between you and father  of cauce he said naturally where else but his tone was a little spiteful as if he had rested his last hopes on alvina  alvina went away she mentioned the coming change to miss pinnegar  well said miss pinnegar judicious but aloof its a move in the right direction but i doubt if itll do any good  do you said alvina why  i dont believe in the place and i never did declared miss pinnegar i dont believe any good will come of it  but why persisted alvina what makes you feel so sure about it  i dont know but thats how i feel and i have from the first it was wrong from the first it was wrong to begin it  but why insisted alvina laughing  your father had no business to be led into it hed no business to touch this show business it isnt like him it doesnt belong to him hes gone against his own nature and his own life  oh but said alvina father was a showman even in the shop he always was mother said he was like a showman in a booth  miss pinnegar was taken aback  well she said sharply if thats what youve seen in himthere was a pause and in that case she continued tartly i think some of the showman has come out in his daughter or showwomanwhich doesnt improve it to my idea  why is it any worse said alvina i enjoy itand so does father  no cried miss pinnegar there youre wrong there you make a mistake its all against his better nature  really said alvina in surprise what a new idea but which is fathers better nature  you may not know it said miss pinnegar coldly and if so i can never tell you but that doesnt alter it she lapsed into dead silence for a moment then suddenly she broke out vicious and cold hell go on till hes killed himself and then hell know  the little adverb then came whistling across the space like a bullet it made alvina pause was her father going to die she reflected well all men must die  she forgot the question in others that occupied her first could she bear it when the endeavour was turned into another cheap and nasty filmshop the strange figures of the artistes passing under her observation had really entertained her week by week some weeks they had bored her some weeks she had detested them but there was always a chance in the coming week think of the natchakeetawaras  she thought too much of the natchakeetawaras she knew it and she tried to force her mind to the contemplation of the new state of things when she banged at the piano to a set of dithering and boring pictures there would be her father herself and mr mayor a new operator a new manager the new managershe thought of him for a momentand thought of the mechanical factoryfaced persons who managed wrights and the woodhouse empire  but her mind fell away from this barren study she was obsessed by the natchakeetawaras they seemed to have fascinated her which of them it was or what it was that had cast the spell over her she did not know but she was as if hypnotized she longed to be with them her soul gravitated towards them all the time  monday passed and ciccio did not come tuesday passed and wednesday in her soul she was sceptical of their keeping their promiseeither madame or ciccio why should they keep their promise she knew what these nomadic artistes were and her soul was stubborn within her  on wednesday night there was another sensation at the endeavour mr may found james houghton fainting in the boxoffice after the performance had begun what to do he could not interrupt alvina nor the performance he sent the chocolateandorange boy across to the pear tree for brandy  james revived im all right he said in a brittle fashion im all right dont bother so he sat with his head on his hand in the boxoffice and mr may had to leave him to operate the film  when the interval arrived mr may hurried to the boxoffice a narrow hole that james could just sit in and there he found the invalid in the same posture semiconscious he gave him more brandy  im all right i tell you said james his eyes flaring leave me alone but he looked anything but all right  mr may hurried for alvina when the daughter entered the ticket place her father was again in a state of torpor  father she said shaking his shoulder gently whats the matter  he murmured something but was incoherent she looked at his face it was grey and blank  we shall have to get him home she said we shall have to get a cab  give him a little brandy said mr may  the boy was sent for the cab james swallowed a spoonful of brandy he came to himself irritably  what what he said i wont have all this fuss go on with the performance theres no need to bother about me his eye was wild  you must go home father said alvina  leave me alone will you leave me alone hectored by women all my lifehectored by womenfirst one then another i wont stand iti wont stand it he looked at alvina with a look of frenzy as he lapsed again fell with his head on his hands on his ticketboard alvina looked at mr may  we must get him home she said she covered him up with a coat and sat by him the performance went on without music at last the cab came james unconscious was driven up to woodhouse he had to be carried indoors alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage  fathers ill she announced to miss pinnegar  didnt i say so said miss pinnegar starting from her chair  the two women went out to meet the cabman who had james in his arms  can you manage cried alvina showing a light  he doesnt weigh much said the man  tututututututu went miss pinnegars tongue in a rapid tuttut of distress what have i said now she exclaimed what have i said all along  james was laid on the sofa his eyes were halfshut they made him drink brandy the boy was sent for the doctor alvinas bed was warmed the sick man was got to bed and then started another vigil alvina sat up in the sick room james started and muttered but did not regain consciousness dawn came and he was the same pneumonia and pleurisy and a touch of meningitis alvina drank her tea took a little breakfast and went to bed at about nine oclock in the morning leaving james in charge of miss pinnegar time was all deranged  miss pinnegar was a nervous nurse she sat in horror and apprehension her eyebrows raised starting and looking at james in terror whenever he made a noise she hurried to him and did what she could but one would have said she was repulsed she found her task unconsciously repugnant  during the course of the morning mrs rollings came up and said that the italian from last week had come and could he speak to miss houghton  tell him shes resting and mr houghton is seriously ill said miss pinnegar sharply  when alvina came downstairs at about four in the afternoon she found a package a comb of carved bone and a message from madame to miss houghton with kindest greetings and most sincere thanks from kishwégin  the comb with its carved beastfaced serpent was her portion alvina asked if there had been any other message none  mr may came in and stayed for a dismal halfhour then alvina went back to her nursing the patient was no better still unconscious miss pinnegar came down red eyed and sullen looking the condition of james gave little room for hope  in the early morning he died alvina called mrs rollings and they composed the body it was still only five oclock and not light alvina went to lie down in her fathers little rather chilly chamber at the end of the corridor she tried to sleep but could not at halfpast seven she arose and started the business of the new day the doctor cameshe went to the registrarand so on  mr may came it was decided to keep open the theatre he would find some one else for the piano some one else to issue the tickets  in the afternoon arrived frederick houghton jamess cousin and nearest relative he was a middleaged blond florid churchgoing draper from knarborough welltodo and very bourgeois he tried to talk to alvina in a fatherly fashion or a friendly or a helpful fashion but alvina could not listen to him he got on her nerves  hearing the gate bang she rose and hurried to the window she was in the drawingroom with her cousin to give the interview its proper air of solemnity she saw ciccio rearing his yellow bicycle against the wall and going with his head forward along the narrow dark way of the back yard to the scullery door  excuse me a minute she said to her cousin who looked up irritably as she left the room  she was just in time to open the door as ciccio tapped she stood on the doorstep above him he looked up with a faint smile from under his black lashes  how nice of you to come she said but her face was blanched and tired without expression only her large eyes looked blue in their tiredness as she glanced down at ciccio he seemed to her far away  madame asks how is mr houghton he said  father he died this morning she said quietly  he died exclaimed the italian a flash of fear and dismay going over his face  yesthis morning she had neither tears nor emotion but just looked down on him abstractedly from her height on the kitchen step he dropped his eyes and looked at his feet then he lifted his eyes again and looked at her she looked back at him as from across a distance so they watched each other as strangers across a wide abstract distance  he turned and looked down the dark yard towards the gate where he could just see the pale grey tire of his bicycle and the yellow mudguard he seemed to be reflecting if he went now he went for ever involuntarily he turned and lifted his face again towards alvina as if studying her curiously she remained there on the doorstep neutral blanched with wide still neutral eyes she did not seem to see him he studied her with alert yellowdusky inscrutable eyes until she met his look and then he gave the faintest gesture with his head as of summons towards him her soul started and died in her and again he gave the slight almost imperceptible jerk of the head backwards and sideways as if summoning her towards him his face too was closed and expressionless but in his eyes which kept hers there was a dark flicker of ascendancy he was going to triumph over her she knew it and her soul sank as if it sank out of her body it sank away out of her body left her there powerless soulless  and yet as he turned with his head stretched forward to move away as he glanced slightly over his shoulder she stepped down from the step down to his level to follow him he went ducking along the dark yard nearly to the gate near the gate near his bicycle was a corner made by a shed here he turned lingeringly to her and she lingered in front of him  her eyes were wide and neutral and submissive with a new awful submission as if she had lost her soul so she looked up at him like a victim there was a faint smile in his eyes he stretched forward over her  you love me yesyes he said in a voice that seemed like a palpable contact on her  yes she whispered involuntarily soulless like a victim he put his arm round her subtly and lifted her  yes he reechoed almost mocking in his triumph yes yes and smiling he kissed her delicately with a certain finesse of knowledge she moaned in spirit in his arms felt herself dead dead and he kissed her with a finesse a passionate finesse which seemed like coals of fire on her head  they heard footsteps miss pinnegar was coming to look for her ciccio set her down looked long into her eyes inscrutably smiling and said  i come tomorrow  with which he ducked and ran out of the yard picking up his bicycle like a feather and taking no notice of miss pinnegar letting the yarddoor bang to behind him  alvina said miss pinnegar  but alvina did not answer she turned slipped past ran indoors and upstairs to the little bare bedroom she had made her own she locked the door and kneeled down on the floor bowing down her head to her knees in a paroxysm on the floor in a paroxysmbecause she loved him she doubled herself up in a paroxysm on her knees on the floorbecause she loved him it was far more like pain like agony than like joy she swayed herself to and fro in a paroxysm of unbearable sensation because she loved him  miss pinnegar came and knocked at the door  alvina alvina oh you are there whatever are you doing arent you coming down to speak to your cousin  soon said alvina  and taking a pillow from the bed she crushed it against herself and swayed herself unconsciously in her orgasm of unbearable feeling right in her bowels she felt itthe terrible unbearable feeling how could she bear it  she crouched over until she became still a moment of stillness seemed to cover her like sleep an eternity of sleep in that one second then she roused and got up she went to the mirror still evanescent and tidied her hair smoothed her face she was so still so remote she felt that nothing nothing could ever touch her  and so she went downstairs to that horrible cousin of her fathers she seemed so intangible remote and virginal that her cousin and miss pinnegar both failed to make anything of her she answered their questions simply but did not talk they talked to each other and at last the cousin went away with a profound dislike of miss alvina  she did not notice she was only glad he was gone and she went about for the rest of the day elusive and vague she slept deeply that night without dreams  the next day was saturday it came with a great storm of wind and rain and hail a fury alvina looked out in dismay she knew ciccio would not be able to comehe could not cycle and it was impossible to get by train and return the same day she was almost relieved she was relieved by the intermission of fate she was thankful for the day of neutrality  in the early afternoon came a telegram coming both tomorrow morning deepest sympathy madame tomorrow was sunday and the funeral was in the afternoon alvina felt a burning inside her thinking of ciccio she wincedand yet she wanted him to come terribly she wanted him to come  she showed the telegram to miss pinnegar  good gracious said the weary miss pinnegar fancy those people and i warrant theyll want to be at the funeral as if he was anything to them  i think its very nice of her said alvina  oh well said miss pinnegar if you think so i dont fancy he would have wanted such people following myself and what does she mean by both whos the other miss pinnegar looked sharply at alvina  ciccio said alvina  the italian why goodness me whats he coming for i cant make you out alvina is that his name chicho i never heard such a name doesnt sound like a name at all to me there wont be room for them in the cabs  well order another  more expense i never knew such impertinent people  but alvina did not hear her on the next morning she dressed herself carefully in her new dress it was black voile carefully she did her hair ciccio and madame were coming the thought of ciccio made her shudder she hung about waiting luckily none of the funeral guests would arrive till after one oclock alvina sat listless musing by the fire in the drawingroom she left everything now to miss pinnegar and mrs rollings miss pinnegar redeyed and yellowskinned was irritable beyond words  it was nearly midday when alvina heard the gate she hurried to open the front door madame was in her little black hat and her black spotted veil ciccio in a black overcoat was closing the yard door behind her  oh my dear girl madame cried trotting forward with outstretched blackkid hands one of which held an umbrella i am so shockedi am so shocked to hear of your poor father am i to believe itam i really no i cant  she lifted her veil kissed alvina and dabbed her eyes ciccio came up the steps he took off his hat to alvina smiled slightly as he passed her he looked rather pale constrained she closed the door and ushered them into the drawingroom  madame looked round like a bird examining the room and the furniture she was evidently a little impressed but all the time she was uttering her condolences  tell me poor girl how it happened  there isnt much to tell said alvina and she gave the brief account of jamess illness and death  worn out worn out madame said nodding slowly up and down her black veil pushed up sagged over her brows like a mourning band you cannot afford to waste the stamina and will you keep on the theatrewith mr may  ciccio was sitting looking towards the fire his presence made alvina tremble she noticed how the fine black hair of his head showed no parting at allit just grew like a close cap and was pushed aside at the forehead sometimes he looked at her as madame talked and again looked at her and looked away  at last madame came to a halt there was a long pause  you will stay to the funeral said alvina  oh my dear we shall be too much  no said alvina i have arranged for you  there you think of everything but i will come not ciccio he will not trouble you  ciccio looked up at alvina  i should like him to come said alvina simply but a deep flush began to mount her face she did not know where it came from she felt so cold and she wanted to cry  madame watched her closely  siamo di accordo came the voice of ciccio  alvina and madame both looked at him he sat constrained with his face averted his eyes dropped but smiling  madame looked closely at alvina  is it true what he says she asked  i dont understand him said alvina i dont understand what he said  that you have agreed with him  madame and ciccio both watched alvina as she sat in her new black dress her eyes involuntarily turned to his  i dont know she said vaguely have i and she looked at him  madame kept silence for some moments then she said gravely  wellyeswell she looked from one to another well there is a lot to consider but if you have decided  neither of them answered madame suddenly rose and went to alvina she kissed her on either cheek  i shall protect you she said  then she returned to her seat  what have you said to miss houghton she said suddenly to ciccio tackling him direct and speaking coldly  he looked at madame with a faint derisive smile then he turned to alvina she bent her head and blushed  speak then said madame you have a reason she seemed mistrustful of him  but he turned aside his face and refused to speak sitting as if he were unaware of madames presence  oh well said madame i shall be there signorino  she spoke with a halfplayful threat ciccio curled his lip  you do not know him yet she said turning to alvina  i know that said alvina offended then she added wouldnt you like to take off your hat  if you truly wish me to stay said madame  yes please do and will you hang your coat in the hall she said to ciccio  oh said madame roughly he will not stay to eat he will go out to somewhere  alvina looked at him  would you rather she said  he looked at her with sardonic yellow eyes  if you want he said the awkward derisive smile curling his lips and showing his teeth  she had a moment of sheer panic was he just stupid and bestial the thought went clean through her his yellow eyes watched her sardonically it was the clean modelling of his dark otherworld face that decided herfor it sent the deep spasm across her  id like you to stay she said  a smile of triumph went over his face madame watched him stonily as she stood beside her chair one hand lightly balanced on her hip alvina was reminded of kishwégin but even in madames stony mistrust there was an element of attraction towards him he had taken his cigarette case from his pocket  on ne fume pas dans le salon said madame brutally  will you put your coat in the passageand do smoke if you wish said alvina  he rose to his feet and took off his overcoat his face was obstinate and mocking he was rather floridly dressed though in black and wore boots of black patent leather with tan uppers handsome he wasbut undeniably in bad taste the silver ring was still on his fingerand his close fine unparted hair went badly with smart english clothes he looked commonalvina confessed it and her heart sank but what was she to do he evidently was not happy obstinacy made him stick out the situation  alvina and madame went upstairs madame wanted to see the dead james she looked at his frail handsome ethereal face and crossed herself as she wept  un bel homme cependant she whispered mort en un jour cest trop fort voyez and she sniggered with fear and sobs  they went down to alvinas bare room madame glanced round as she did in every room she entered  this was fathers bedroom said alvina the other was mine he wouldnt have it anything but like thisbare  nature of a monk a hermit whispered madame who would have thought it ah the men the men  and she unpinned her hat and patted her hair before the small mirror into which she had to peep to see herself alvina stood waiting  and now whispered madame suddenly turning what about this ciccio hein it was ridiculous that she would not raise her voice above a whisper upstairs there but so it was  she scrutinized alvina with her eyes of bright black glass alvina looked back at her but did not know what to say  what about him hein will you marry him why will you  i suppose because i like him said alvina flushing  madame made a little grimace  oh yes she whispered with a contemptuous mouth oh yesbecause you like him but you know nothing of himnothing how can you like him not knowing him he may be a real bad character how would you like him then  he isnt is he said alvina  i dont know i dont know he may be even i i dont know himno though he has been with me for three years what is he he is a man of the people a boatman a labourer an artists model he sticks to nothing  how old is he asked alvina  he is twentyfivea boy only and you you are older  thirty confessed alvina  thirty well nowso much difference how can you trust him how can you why does he want to marry youwhy  i dont know said alvina  no and i dont know but i know something of these italian men who are labourers in every country just labourers and undermen always always down down down and madame pressed her spread palms downwards and sowhen they have a chance to come up she raised her hand with a springthey are very conceited and they take their chance he will want to rise by you and you will go down with him that is how it is i have seen it beforeyesmore than one time  but said alvina laughing ruefully he cant rise much because of me can he  how not how not in the first place you are english and he thinks to rise by that then you are not of the lower class you are of the higher class the class of the masters such as employ ciccio and men like him how will he not rise in the world by you yes he will rise very much or he will draw you down downyes one or another and then he thinks that now you have moneynow your father is dead here madame glanced apprehensively at the closed doorand they all like money yes very much all italians  do they said alvina scared im sure there wont be any money im sure father is in debt  what you think do you really oh poor miss houghton welland will you tell ciccio that eh hein  yescertainlyif it matters said poor alvina  of course it matters of course it matters very much it matters to him because he will not have much he saves saves saves as they all do to go back to italy and buy a piece of land and if he has you it will cost him much more he cannot continue with natchakeetawara all will be much more difficult  oh i will tell him in time said alvina pale at the lips  you will tell him yes that is better and then you will see but he is obstinateas a mule and if he will still have you then you must think can you live in england as the wife of a labouring man a dirty eyetalian as they all say it is serious it is not pleasant for you who have not known it i also have not known it but i have seen alvina watched with wide troubled eyes while madame darted looks as from bright deep black glass  yes said alvina i should hate being a labourers wife in a nasty little house in a street  in a house cried madame it would not be in a house they live many together in one house it would be two rooms or even one room in another house with many people not quite clean you see  alvina shook her head  i couldnt stand that she said finally  no madame nodded approval no you could not they live in a bad way the italians they do not know the english homenever they dont like it nor do they know the swiss clean and proper house no they dont understand they run into their holes to sleep or to shelter and that is all  the same in italy said alvina  even morebecause there it is sunny very often  and you dont need a house said alvina i should like that  yes it is nicebut you dont know the life and you would be alone with people like animals and if you go to italy he will beat youhe will beat you  if i let him said alvina  but you cant help it away there from everybody nobody will help you if you are a wife in italy nobody will help you you are his property when you marry by italian law it is not like england there is no divorce in italy and if he beats you you are helpless  but why should he beat me said alvina why should he want to  they do they are so jealous and then they go into their ungovernable tempers horrible tempers  only when they are provoked said alvina thinking of max  yes but you will not know what provokes him who can say when he will be provoked and then he beats you  there seemed to be a gathering triumph in madames bright black eyes alvina looked at her and turned to the door  at any rate i know now she said in rather a flat voice  and it is true it is all of it true whispered madame vindictively alvina wanted to run from her  i must go to the kitchen she said shall we go down  alvina did not go into the drawingroom with madame she was too much upset and she had almost a horror of seeing ciccio at that moment  miss pinnegar her face stained carmine by the fire was helping mrs rollings with the dinner  are they both staying or only one she said tartly  both said alvina busying herself with the gravy to hide her distress and confusion  the man as well said miss pinnegar what does the woman want to bring him for im sure i dont know what your father would saya common showfellow looks what he isand staying to dinner  miss pinnegar was thoroughly out of temper as she tried the potatoes alvina set the table then she went to the drawingroom  will you come to dinner she said to her two guests  ciccio rose threw his cigarette into the fire and looked round outside was a faint watery sunshine but at least it was out of doors he felt himself imprisoned and out of his element he had an irresistible impulse to go  when he got into the hall he laid his hand on his hat the stupid constrained smile was on his face  ill go now he said  we have set the table for you said alvina  stop now since you have stopped for so long said madame darting her black looks at him  but he hurried on his coat looking stupid madame lifted her eyebrows disdainfully  this is polite behaviour she said sarcastically  alvina stood at a loss  you return to the funeral said madame coldly  he shook his head  when you are ready to go he said  at four oclock said madame when the funeral has come home then we shall be in time for the train  he nodded smiled stupidly opened the door and went  this is just like him to be soso madame could not express herself as she walked down to the kitchen  miss pinnegar this is madame said alvina  how do you do said miss pinnegar a little distant and condescending madame eyed her keenly  where is the man i dont know his name said miss pinnegar  he wouldnt stay said alvina what is his name madame  marascafrancesco francesco marascaneapolitan  marasca echoed alvina  it has a bad sounda sound of a bad augury bad sign said madame maràsca she shook her head at the taste of the syllables  why do you think so said alvina do you think there is a meaning in sounds goodness and badness  yes said madame certainly some sounds are good they are for life for creating and some sounds are bad they are for destroying maràscathat is bad like swearing  but what sort of badness what does it do said alvina  what does it do it sends life downdowninstead of lifting it up  why should things always go up why should life always go up said alvina  i dont know said madame cutting her meat quickly there was a pause  and what about other names interrupted miss pinnegar a little lofty what about houghton for example  madame put down her fork but kept her knife in her hand she looked across the room not at miss pinnegar  houghton huffton she said when it is said it has a sound against that is against the neighbour against humanity but when it is written houghton then it is different it is for  it is always pronounced huffton said miss pinnegar  by us said alvina  we ought to know said miss pinnegar  madame turned to look at the unhappy elderly woman  you are a relative of the family she said  no not a relative but ive been here many years said miss pinnegar  oh yes said madame miss pinnegar was frightfully affronted the meal with the three women at table passed painfully  miss pinnegar rose to go upstairs and weep she felt very forlorn alvina rose to wipe the dishes hastily because the funeral guests would all be coming madame went into the drawingroom to smoke her sly cigarette  mr may was the first to turn up for the lugubrious affair very tight and tailored but a little extinguished all in black he never wore black and was very unhappy in it being almost morbidly sensitive to the impression the colour made on him he was set to entertain madame  she did not pretend distress but sat blackeyed and watchful very much her business self  what about the theatrewill it go on she asked  well i dont know i dont know miss houghtons intentions said mr may he was a little stilted today  its hers said madame  why as far as i understand  and if she wants to sell out  mr may spread his hands and looked dismal but distant  you should form a company and carry on said madame  mr may looked even more distant drawing himself up in an odd fashion so that he looked as if he were trussed but madames shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off  buy miss houghton out said madame shrewdly  of cauce said mr may miss houghton herself must decide  oh sure youare you married  yes  your wife here  my wife is in london  and children  a daughter  madame slowly nodded her head up and down as if she put thousands of twoandtwos together  you think there will be much to come to miss houghton she said  do you mean property i really cant say i havent enquired  no but you have a good idea eh  im afraid i havent  no well it wont be much then  really i dont know i should say not a large fortune  noeh madame kept him fixed with her black eyes do you think the other one will get anything  the other one queried mr may with an uprising cadence madame nodded slightly towards the kitchen  the old onethe missmiss pinpinnywhat you call her  miss pinnegar the manageress of the workgirls really i dont know at all mr may was most freezing  haha haha mused madame quietly then she asked which workgirls do you say  and she listened astutely to mr mays forced account of the workroom upstairs extorting all the details she desired to gather then there was a pause madame glanced round the room  nice house she said is it their own  so i believe  again madame nodded sagely debts perhapseh mortgage and she looked slyly sardonic  really said mr may bouncing to his feet do you mind if i go to speak to mrs rollings  oh nogo along said madame and mr may skipped out in a temper    madame was left alone in her comfortable chair studying details of the room and making accounts in her own mind until the actual funeral guests began to arrive and then she had the satisfaction of sizing them up several arrived with wreaths the coffin had been carried down and laid in the small sittingroommrs houghtons sittingroom it was covered with white wreaths and streamers of purple ribbon there was a crush and a confusion  and then at last the hearse and the cabs had arrivedthe coffin was carried outalvina followed on the arm of her fathers cousin whom she disliked miss pinnegar marshalled the other mourners it was a wretched business  but it was a great funeral there were nine cabs besides the hearsewoodhouse had revived its ancient respect for the house of houghton a posse of minor tradesmen followed the cabsall in black and with black gloves the richer tradesmen sat in the cabs  poor alvina this was the only day in all her life when she was the centre of public attention for once every eye was upon her every mind was thinking about her poor alvina said every member of the woodhouse middle class poor alvina houghton said every colliers wife poor thing left aloneand hardly a penny to bless herself with lucky if shes not left with a pile of debts james houghton ran through some money in his day ay if she had her rights shed be a rich woman why her mother brought three or four thousands with her ay but james sank it all in throttlehapenny and klondyke and the endeavour well he was his own worst enemy he paid his way im not so sure about that look how he served his wife and now alvina im not so sure he was his own worst enemy he was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood ah well hell spend no more money anyhow no he went sudden didnt he but he was getting very frail if you noticed oh yes why he fair seemed to totter down to lumley do you reckon as that place pays its way what the endeavourthey say it does they say it makes a nice bit well its mostly pretty full ay it is perhaps it wont be now mr houghtons gone perhaps not i wonder if he will leave much im sure he wont everything hes gots mortgaged up to the hilt hell leave debts you see if he doesnt what is she going to do then shell have to go out of manchester househer and miss pinnegar wonder what shell do perhaps shell take up that nursing she never made much of that did sheand spent a sight of money on her training they say shes a bit like her father in the business lineall flukes pity some nice young man doesnt turn up and marry her i dont know she doesnt seem to hook on does she why shes never had a proper boy they make out she was engaged once ay but nobody ever saw him and it was off as soon as it was on can you remember she went with albert witham for a bit did she no i never knew when was that why when he was at oxford you know learning for his head masters place why didnt she marry him then perhaps he never asked her ay theres that to it shed have looked down her nose at him times gone by ay but thats all over my boy shed snap at anybody now look how she carries on with that manager why thats something awful havent you ever watched her in the cinema she never lets him alone and its anybody alike oh she doesnt respect herself i dont consider no girl who respected herself would go on as she does throwing herself at every fellers head does she though ay any performer or anybody shes a tidy age though shes not much chance of getting off how old do you reckon she is must be well over thirty you never say well she looks it she does beguya dragged old maid oh but she sprightles up a bit sometimes ay when she thinks shes hooked on to somebody i wonder why she never did take its funny oh she was too high and mighty before and now its too late nobody wants her and shes got no relations to go to either has she no thats her fathers cousin who shes walking with look theyre coming hes a finelooking man isnt he youd have thought theyd have buried miss frost beside mrs houghton you would wouldnt you i should think alvina will lie by miss frost they say the grave was made for both of them ay she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother she was good to them miss frost was alvina thought the world of her thats her stonelook down there not a very grand one considering no it isnt look theres room for alvinas name underneath sh  alvina had sat back in the cab and watched from her obscurity the many faces on the street so familiar so familiar familiar as her own face and now she seemed to see them from a great distance out of her darkness her big cousin sat opposite herhow she disliked his presence  in chapel she cried thinking of her mother and miss frost and her father she felt so desolateit all seemed so empty bitterly she cried when she bent down during the prayer and her crying started miss pinnegar who cried almost as bitterly it was all rather horrible the afterwardsthe horrible afterwards  there was the slow progress to the cemetery it was a dull cold day alvina shivered as she stood on the bleak hillside by the open grave her coat did not seem warm enough her old black sealskin furs were not much protection the minister stood on the plank by the grave and she stood near watching the white flowers blowing in the cold wind she had watched them for her motherand for miss frost she felt a sudden clinging to miss pinnegar yet they would have to part miss pinnegar had been so fond of her father in a quaint reserved way poor miss pinnegar that was all life had offered her well after all it had been a home and a home life to which home and home life alvina now clung with a desperate yearning knowing inevitably she was going to lose it now her father was gone strange that he was gone but he was weary worn very thin and weary he had lived his day how different it all was now at his death from the time when alvina knew him as a little child and thought him such a fine gentleman you live and learn and lose  for one moment she looked at madame who was shuddering with cold her face hidden behind her black spotted veil but madame seemed immensely remote so unreal and cicciowhat was his name she could not think of it what was it she tried to think of madames slow enunciation marascamaraschino marasca maraschino what was maraschino where had she heard it cudgelling her brains she remembered the doctors and the suppers after the theatre and maraschinowhy that was the favourite white liqueur of the innocent dr young she could remember even now the way he seemed to smack his lips saying the word maraschino yet she didnt think much of it hot bitterish stuffnothing not like green chartreuse which dr james gave her maraschino yes that was it made from cherries well ciccios name was nearly the same ridiculous but she supposed italian words were a good deal alike  ciccio the marasca the bitter cherry was standing on the edge of the crowd looking on he had no connection whatever with the proceedingsstood outside selfconscious uncomfortable bitten by the wind and hating the people who stared at him he saw the trim plump figure of madame like some trim plump partridge among a flock of barnyard fowls and he depended on her presence without her he would have felt too horribly uncomfortable on that raw hillside she and he were in some way allied but these others how alien and uncouth he felt them impressed by their fine clothes the english workingclasses were none the less barbarians to him uncivilized just as he was to them an uncivilized animal uncouth they seemed to him all raw angles and harshness like their own weather not that he thought about them but he felt it in his flesh the harshness and discomfort of them and alvina was one of them as she stood there by the grave pale and pinched and reserved looking she was of a piece with the hideous cold grey discomfort of the whole scene never had anything been more uncongenial to him he was dying to get awayto clear out that was all he wanted only some southern obstinacy made him watch from the duskiness of his face the pale reserved girl at the grave perhaps he even disliked her at that time but he watched in his dislike  when the ceremony was over and the mourners turned away to go back to the cabs madame pressed forward to alvina  i shall say goodbye now miss houghton we must go to the station for the train and thank you thank you goodbye  but alvina looked round  ciccio is there i see him we must catch the train  oh butwont you drive wont you ask ciccio to drive with you in the cab where is he  madame pointed him out as he hung back among the graves his black hat cocked a little on one side he was watching alvina broke away from her cousin and went to him  madame is going to drive to the station she said she wants you to get in with her  he looked round at the cabs  all right he said and he picked his way across the graves to madame following alvina  so we go together in the cab said madame to him then goodbye my dear miss houghton perhaps we shall meet once more who knows my heart is with you my dear she put her arms round alvina and kissed her a little theatrically the cousin looked on very much aloof ciccio stood by  come then ciccio said madame  goodbye said alvina to him youll come again wont you she looked at him from her strained pale face  all right he said shaking her hand loosely it sounded hopelessly indefinite  you will come wont you she repeated staring at him with strained unseeing blue eyes  all right he said ducking and turning away  she stood quite still for a moment quite lost then she went on with her cousin to her cab home to the funeral tea  goodbye madame fluttered a blackedged handkerchief but ciccio most uncomfortable in his fourwheeler kept hidden  the funeral tea with its baked meats and sweets was a terrible affair but it came to an end as everything comes to an end and miss pinnegar and alvina were left alone in the emptiness of manchester house  if you werent here miss pinnegar i should be quite by myself said alvina blanched and strained  yes and so should i without you said miss pinnegar doggedly they looked at each other and that night both slept in miss pinnegars bed out of sheer terror of the empty house  during the days following the funeral no one could have been more tiresome than alvina james had left everything to his daughter excepting some rights in the workshop which were miss pinnegars but the question was how much did everything amount to there was something less than a hundred pounds in the bank there was a mortgage on manchester house there were substantial bills owing on account of the endeavour alvina had about a hundred pounds left from the insurance money when all funeral expenses were paid of that she was sure and of nothing else  for the rest she was almost driven mad by people coming to talk to her the lawyer came the clergyman came her cousin came the old stout prosperous tradesmen of woodhouse came mr may came miss pinnegar came and they all had schemes and they all had advice the chief plan was that the theatre should be sold up and that manchester house should be sold reserving a lease on the top floor where miss pinnegars workrooms were that miss pinnegar and alvina should move into a small house miss pinnegar keeping the workroom alvina giving musiclessons that the two women should be partners in the workshop  there were other plans of course there was a faction against the chapel faction which favoured the plan sketched out above the theatre faction including mr may and some of the more florid tradesmen favoured the risking of everything in the endeavour alvina was to be the proprietress of the endeavour she was to run it on some sort of successful lines and abandon all other enterprise minor plans included the election of alvina to the post of parish nurse at six pounds a month a small private school a small haberdashery shop and a position in the office of her cousins knarborough business to one and all alvina answered with a tantalizing i dont know what im going to do i dont know i cant say yet i shall see i shall see till one and all became angry with her they were all so benevolent and all so sure that they were proposing the very best thing she could do and they were all nettled even indignant that she did not jump at their proposals she listened to them all she even invited their advice continually she said well what do you think of it and she repeated the chapel plan to the theatre group the theatre plan to the chapel party the nursing to the pianoforte proposers the haberdashery shop to the private school advocates tell me what you think she said repeatedly and they all told her they thought their plan was best and bit by bit she told every advocate the proposal of every other advocate well lawyer beeby thinks and well now mr clay the minister advises and so on and so on till it was all buzzing through thirty benevolent and officious heads and thirty benevolentlyofficious wills were striving to plant each one its own particular scheme of benevolence and alvina naïve and pathetic egged them all on in their strife without even knowing what she was doing one thing only was certain some obstinate will in her own self absolutely refused to have her mind made up she would not have her mind made up for her and she would not make it up for herself and so everybody began to say im getting tired of her you talk to her and you get no forrarder she slips off to something else im not going to bother with her any more in truth woodhouse was in a fever for three weeks or more arranging alvinas unarrangeable future for her offers of charity were innumerablefor three weeks  meanwhile the lawyer went on with the proving of the will and the drawing up of a final account of jamess property mr may went on with the endeavour though alvina did not go down to play miss pinnegar went on with the workgirls and alvina went on unmaking her mind  ciccio did not come during the first week alvina had a postcard from madame from cheshire rather far off but such was the buzz and excitement over her material future such a fever was worked up round about her that alvina the pettypropertied heroine of the moment was quite carried away in a storm of schemes and benevolent suggestions she answered madames postcard but did not give much thought to the natchakeetawaras as a matter of fact she was enjoying a real moment of importance there at the centre of woodhouses rather domineering benevolence a benevolence which she unconsciously but systematically frustrated all this scheming for selling out and making reservations and hanging on and fixing prices and getting private bids for manchester house and for the endeavour the excitement of forming a limited company to run the endeavour of seeing a lawyer about the sale of manchester house and the auctioneer about the sale of the furniture of receiving men who wanted to pick up the machines upstairs cheap and of keeping everything dangling deciding nothing putting everything off till she had seen somebody else this for the moment fascinated her went to her head it was not until the second week had passed that her excitement began to merge into irritation and not until the third week had gone by that she began to feel herself entangled in an asphyxiating web of indecision and her heart began to sing because ciccio had never turned up now she would have given anything to see the natchakeetawaras again but she did not know where they were now she began to loathe the excitement of her property doubtfully hers every stick of it now she would give anything to get away from woodhouse from the horrible buzz and entanglement of her sordid affairs now again her wild recklessness came over her  she suddenly said she was going away somewhere she would not say where she cashed all the money she could a hundredandtwentyfive pounds she took the train to cheshire to the last address of the natchakeetawaras she followed them to stockport and back to chinley and there she was stuck for the night next day she dashed back almost to woodhouse and swerved round to sheffield there in that black town thank heaven she saw their announcement on the wall she took a taxi to their theatre and then on to their lodgings the first thing she saw was louis in his shirt sleeves on the landing above  she laughed with excitement and pleasure she seemed another woman madame looked up almost annoyed when she entered  i couldnt keep away from you madame she cried  evidently said madame  madame was darning socks for the young men she was a wonderful mother for them sewed for them cooked for them looked after them most carefully not many minutes was madame idle  do you mind said alvina  madame darned for some moments without answering  and how is everything at woodhouse she asked  i couldnt bear it any longer i couldnt bear it so i collected all the money i could and ran away nobody knows where i am  madame looked up with bright black censorious eyes at the flushed girl opposite alvina had a certain strangeness and brightness which madame did not know and a frankness which the frenchwoman mistrusted but found disarming  and all the business the will and all said madame  theyre still fussing about it  and there is some money  i have got a hundred pounds here laughed alvina what there will be when everything is settled i dont know but not very much im sure of that  how much do you think a thousand pounds  oh its just possible you know but its just as likely there wont be another penny  madame nodded slowly as always when she did her calculations  and if there is nothing what do you intend said madame  i dont know said alvina brightly  and if there is something  i dont know either but i thought if you would let me play for you i could keep myself for some time with my own money you said perhaps i might be with the natchakeetawaras i wish you would let me  madame bent her head so that nothing showed but the bright black folds of her hair then she looked up with a slow subtle rather jeering smile  ciccio didnt come to see you hein  no said alvina yet he promised  again madame smiled sardonically  do you call it a promise she said you are easy to be satisfied with a word a hundred pounds no more  a hundred and twenty  where is it  in my bag at the stationin notes and ive got a little here alvina opened her purse and took out some little gold and silver  at the station exclaimed madame smiling grimly then perhaps you have nothing  oh i think its quite safe dont you  yesmaybesince it is england and you think a hundred and twenty pounds is enough  what for  to satisfy ciccio  i wasnt thinking of him cried alvina  no said madame ironically i can propose it to him wait one moment she went to the door and called ciccio  he entered looking not very goodtempered  be so good my dear said madame to him to go to the station and fetch miss houghtons little bag you have got the ticket have you alvina handed the luggage ticket to madame midland railway said madame and ciccio you are listening mind there is a hundred and twenty pounds of miss houghtons money in the bag you hear mind it is not lost  its all i have said alvina  for the time for the timetill the will is proved it is all the cash she has so mind doubly you hear  all right said ciccio  tell him what sort of a bag miss houghton said madame  alvina told him he ducked and went madame listened for his final departure then she nodded sagely at alvina  take off your hat and coat my dear soon we will have teawhen cic returns let him think let him think what he likes so much money is certain perhaps there will be more let him think it will make all the difference that there is so much cashyes so much  but would it really make a difference to him cried alvina  oh my dear exclaimed madame why should it not we are on earth where we must eat we are not in paradise if it were a thousand pounds then he would want very badly to marry you but a hundred and twenty is better than a blow to the eye eh why sure  its dreadful though said alvina  oh lala dreadful if it was max who is sentimental then no the money is nothing but all the otherswhy you see they are men and they know which side to butter their bread men are like cats my dear they dont like their bread without butter why should they nor do i nor do i  can i help with the darning said alvina  hein i shall give you ciccios socks yes he pushes holes in the toesyou see madame poked two fingers through the hole in the toe of a redandblack sock and smiled a little maliciously at alvina  i dont mind which sock i darn she said  no you dont well then i give you another but if you like i will speak to him  what to say asked alvina  to say that you have so much money and hope to have more and that you like himyes am i right you like him very muchhein is it so  and then what said alvina  that he should tell me if he should like to marry you alsoquite simply what yes  no said alvina dont say anythingnot yet  hé not yet not yet all right not yet then you will see  alvina sat darning the sock and smiling at her own shamelessness the point that amused her most of all was the fact that she was not by any means sure she wanted to marry him there was madame spinning her web like a plump prolific black spider there was ciccio the unrestful fly and there was herself who didnt know in the least what she was doing there sat two of them madame and herself darning socks in a stuffy little bedroom with a gas fire as if they had been born to it and after all woodhouse wasnt fifty miles away  madame went downstairs to get tea ready wherever she was she superintended the cooking and the preparation of meals for her young men scrupulous and quick she called alvina downstairs ciccio came in with the bag  see my dear that your money is safe said madame  alvina unfastened her bag and counted the crisp white notes  and now said madame i shall lock it in my little bank yes where it will be safe and i shall give you a receipt which the young men will witness  the party sat down to tea in the stuffy sittingroom  now boys said madame what do you say shall miss houghton join the natchakeetawaras shall she be our pianist  the eyes of the four young men rested on alvina max as being the responsible party looked businesslike louis was tender geoffrey roundeyed and inquisitive ciccio furtive  with great pleasure said max but can the natchakeetawaras afford to pay a pianist for themselves  no said madame no i think not miss houghton will come for one month to prove and in that time she shall pay for herself yes so she fancies it  can we pay her expenses said max  no said alvina let me pay everything for myself for a month i should like to be with you awfully  she looked across with a look half mischievous half beseeching at the erect max he bowed as he sat at table  i think we shall all be honoured he said  certainly said louis bowing also over his teacup  geoffrey inclined his head and ciccio lowered his eyelashes in indication of agreement  now then said madame briskly we are all agreed tonight we will have a bottle of wine on it yes gentlemen what dyou say chiantihein  they all bowed above the table  and miss houghton shall have her professional name eh because we cannot say miss houghtonwhat  do call me alvina said alvina  alvinaalvyna no excuse me my dear i dont like it i dont like this vy sound tonight we shall find a name  after tea they inquired for a room for alvina there was none in the house but two doors away was another decent lodginghouse where a bedroom on the top floor was found for her  i think you are very well here said madame  quite nice said alvina looking round the hideous little room and remembering her other term of probation as a maternity nurse  she dressed as attractively as possible in her new dress of black voile and imitating madame she put four jewelled rings on her fingers as a rule she only wore the mourningring of black enamel and diamond which had been always on miss frosts finger now she left off this and took four diamond rings and one good sapphire she looked at herself in her mirror as she had never done before really interested in the effect she made and in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch  then she went down to madames house madame eyed her shrewdly with just a touch of jealousy the eternal jealousy that must exist between the plump pale partridge of a frenchwoman whose black hair is so glossy and tidy whose black eyes are so acute whose black dress is so neat and chic and the rather thin englishwoman in soft voile with soft rather loose brown hair and demure bluegrey eyes  oha differencewhat a difference when you have a little more fleshthen madame made a slight click with her tongue what a good brooch eh madame fingered the brooch old pasteold pasteantique  no said alvina they are real rubies it was my greatgrandmothers  do you mean it real are you sure  i think im quite sure  madame scrutinized the jewels with a fine eye  hm she said and alvina did not know whether she was sceptical or jealous or admiring or really impressed  and the diamonds are real said madame making alvina hold up her hands  ive always understood so said alvina  madame scrutinized and slowly nodded her head then she looked into alvinas eyes really a little jealous  another four thousand francs there she said nodding sagely  really said alvina  for sure its enoughits enough  and there was a silence between the two women  the young men had been out shopping for the supper louis who knew where to find french and german stuff came in with bundles ciccio returned with a couple of flasks geoffrey with sundry moist papers of edibles alvina helped madame to put the anchovies and sardines and tunny and ham and salami on various plates she broke off a bit of fern from one of the flowerpots to stick in the porkpie she set the table with its ugly knives and forks and glasses all the time her rings sparkled her red brooch sent out beams she laughed and was gay she was quick and she flattered madame by being very deferential to her whether she was herself or not in the hideous common stuffy sittingroom of the lodginghouse she did not know or care but she felt excited and gay she knew the young men were watching her max gave his assistance wherever possible geoffrey watched her rings half spellbound but alvina was concerned only to flatter the plump white soft vanity of madame she carefully chose for madame the finest plate the clearest glass the whitesthafted knife the most delicate fork all of which madame saw with acute eyes  at the theatre the same alvina played for kishwégin only for kishwégin and madame had the time of her life  you know my dear she said afterward to alvina i understand sympathy in music music goes straight to the heart and she kissed alvina on both cheeks throwing her arms round her neck dramatically  im so glad said the wily alvina  and the young men stirred uneasily and smiled furtively  they hurried home to the famous supper madame sat at one end of the table alvina at the other madame had max and louis by her side alvina had ciccio and geoffrey ciccio was on alvinas right hand a delicate hint  they began with hors doeuvres and tumblers three parts full of chianti alvina wanted to water her wine but was not allowed to insult the sacred liquid there was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality madame became paler her eyes blacker with the wine she drank her voice became a little raucous  tonight she said the natchakeetawaras make their feast of affiliation the white daughter has entered the tribe of the hirondelles swallows that pass from land to land and build their nests between roof and wall a new swallow a new huron from the tents of the paleface from the lodges of the north from the tribe of the yenghees madames black eyes glared with a kind of wild triumph down the table at alvina nameless without having a name comes the maiden with the red jewels darkhearted with the red beams wine from the paleface shadows drunken wine for kishwégin strange wine for the braves in their nostrils vaali à vous  madame lifted her glass  vaali drink to herboire à elle she thrust her glass forwards in the air the young men thrust their glasses up towards alvina in a cluster she could see their mouths all smiling their teeth white as they cried in their throats vaali vaali boire à vous  ciccio was near to her under the table he laid his hand on her knee quickly she put forward her hand to protect herself he took her hand and looked at her along the glass as he drank she saw his throat move as the wine went down it he put down his glass still watching her  vaali he said in his throat then across the table hé gigiviale le petit chemin comment me prendstu lallée  there came a great burst of laughter from louis  it is good it is good he cried oh madame viale it is italian for the little way the alley that is too rich  max went off into a high and ribald laugh  lallée italienne he said and shouted with laughter  alley or avenue what does it matter cried madame in french so long as it is a good journey  here geoffrey at last saw the joke with a strange determined flourish he filled his glass cocking up his elbow  a toi cicet bon voyage he said and then he tilted up his chin and swallowed in great throatfuls  certainly certainly cried madame to thy good journey my ciccio for thou art not a great traveller  na pour ça ya plus dune voie said geoffrey  during this passage in french alvina sat with very bright eyes looking from one to another and not understanding but she knew it was something improper on her account her eyes had a bright slightlybewildered look as she turned from one face to another ciccio had let go her hand and was wiping his lips with his fingers he too was a little selfconscious  assez de cette éternelle voix italienne said madame courage courage au chemin dangleterre  assez de cette éternelle voix rauque said ciccio looking round madame suddenly pulled herself together  they will not have my name they will call you allay she said to alvina is it good will it do  quite said alvina  and she could not understand why gigi and then the others after him went off into a shout of laughter she kept looking round with bright puzzled eyes her face was slightly flushed and tender looking she looked naïve young  then you will become one of the tribe of natchakeetawara of the name allaye yes  yes said alvina  and obey the strict rules of the tribe do you agree  yes  then listen madame primmed and preened herself like a black pigeon and darted glances out of her black eyes  we are one tribe one nationsay it  we are one tribe one nation repeated alvina  say all cried madame  we are one tribe one nation they shouted with varying accent  good said madame and no nation do we know but the nation of the hirondelles  no nation do we know but the nation of the hirondelles came the ragged chant of strong male voices resonant and gay with mockery  huronshirondelles means swallows said madame  yes i know said alvina  so you know well then we know no nation but the hirondelles we have no law but huron law  we have no law but huron law sang the response in a deep sardonic chant  we have no lawgiver except kishwÉgin  we have no lawgiver except kishwégin they sang sonorous  we have no home but the tent of kishwÉgin  we have no home but the tent of kishwégin  there is no good but the good of natchakeetawara  there is no good but the good of natchakeetawara  we are the hirondelles  we are the hirondelles  we are kishwÉgin  we are kishwégin  we are mondagua  we are mondagua  we are atonquois  we are atonquois  we are pacohuila  we are pacohuila  we are walgatchka  we are walgatchka  we are allaye  we are allaye  la musica pacohuila la musica cried madame starting to her feet and sounding frenzied  ciccio got up quickly and took his mandoline from its case  aaaiaiieeeya began madame with a long faint wail and on the wailing mandoline the music started she began to dance a slight but intense dance then she waved for a partner and set up a tarantella wail louis threw off his coat and sprang to tarantella attention ciccio rang out the peculiar tarantella and madame and louis danced in the tight space  bravabrava cried the others when madame sank into her place and they crowded forward to kiss her hand one after the other they kissed her fingers whilst she laid her left hand languidly on the head of one man after another as she sat slightly panting ciccio however did not come up but sat faintly twanging the mandoline nor did alvina leave her place  pacohuila cried madame with an imperious gesture allaye come  ciccio laid down his mandoline and went to kiss the fingers of kishwégin alvina also went forward madame held out her hand alvina kissed it madame laid her hand on the head of alvina  this is the squaw allaye this is the daughter of kishwégin she said in her tawara manner  and where is the brave of allaye where is the arm that upholds the daughter of kishwégin which of the swallows spreads his wings over the gentle head of the new one  pacohuila said louis  pacohuila pacohuila pacohuila said the others  spread soft wings spread darkroofed wings pacohuila said kishwégin and ciccio in his shirtsleeves solemnly spread his arms  stoop stoop allaye beneath the wings of pacohuila said kishwégin faintly pressing alvina on the shoulder  alvina stooped and crouched under the right arm of pacohuila  has the bird flown home chanted kishwégin to one of the strains of their music  the bird is home chanted the men  is the nest warm chanted kishwégin  the nest is warm  does the hebird stoop  he stoops  who takes allaye  pacohuila  ciccio gently stooped and raised alvina to her feet  cest ça said madame kissing her and now children unless the sheffield policeman will knock at our door we must retire to our wigwams all  ciccio was watching alvina madame made him a secret imperative gesture that he should accompany the young woman  you have your key allaye she said  did i have a key said alvina  madame smiled subtly as she produced a latchkey  kishwégin must open your doors for you all she said then with a slight flourish she presented the key to ciccio i give it to him yes she added with her subtle malicious smile  ciccio smiling slightly and keeping his head ducked took the key alvina looked brightly as if bewildered from one to another  also the light said madame producing a pocket flashlight which she triumphantly handed to ciccio alvina watched him she noticed how he dropped his head forward from his straight strong shoulders how beautiful that was the strong forwardinclining nape and back of the head it produced a kind of dazed submission in her the drugged sense of unknown beauty  and so goodnight allayebonne nuit fille des tawara madame kissed her and darted black unaccountable looks at her  each brave also kissed her hand with a profound salute then the men shook hands warmly with ciccio murmuring to him  he did not put on his hat nor his coat but ran round as he was to the neighbouring house with her and opened the door she entered and he followed flashing on the light so she climbed weakly up the dusty drab stairs he following when she came to her door she turned and looked at him his face was scarcely visible it seemed and yet so strange and beautiful it was the unknown beauty which almost killed her  you arent coming she quavered  he gave an odd halfgay halfmocking twitch of his thick dark brows and began to laugh silently then he nodded again laughing at her boldly carelessly triumphantly like the dark southerner he was her instinct was to defend herself when suddenly she found herself in the dark  she gasped and as she gasped he quite gently put her inside her room and closed the door keeping one arm round her all the time she felt his heavy muscular predominance so he took her in both arms powerful mysterious horrible in the pitch dark yet the sense of the unknown beauty of him weighed her down like some force if for one moment she could have escaped from that black spell of his beauty she would have been free but she could not he was awful to her shameless so that she died under his shamelessness his smiling progressive shamelessness yet she could not see him ugly if only she could for one second have seen him ugly he would not have killed her and made her his slave as he did but the spell was on her of his darkness and unfathomed handsomeness and he killed her he simply took her and assassinated her how she suffered no one can tell yet all the time his lustrous dark beauty unbearable  when later she pressed her face on his chest and cried he held her gently as if she was a child but took no notice and she felt in the darkness that he smiled it was utterly dark and she knew he smiled and she began to get hysterical but he only kissed her his smiling deepening to a heavy laughter silent and invisible but sensible as he carried her away once more he intended her to be his slave she knew and he seemed to throw her down and suffocate her like a wave and she could have fought if only the sense of his dark rich handsomeness had not numbed her like a venom so she was suffocated in his passion  in the morning when it was light he turned and looked at her from under his long black lashes a long steady cruel faintlysmiling look from his tawny eyes searching her as if to see whether she were still alive and she looked back at him heavyeyed and half subjected he smiled slightly at her rose and left her and she turned her face to the wall feeling beaten yet not quite beaten to death save for the fatal numbness of her love for him she could still have escaped him but she lay inert as if envenomed he wanted to make her his slave  when she went down to the natchakeetawaras for breakfast she found them waiting for her she was rather frail and tenderlooking with wondering eyes that showed she had been crying  come daughter of the tawaras said madame brightly to her we have been waiting for you goodmorning and all happiness eh look it is a giftday for you  madame smilingly led alvina to her place beside her plate was a bunch of violets a bunch of carnations a pair of exquisite bead moccasins and a pair of fine doeskin gloves delicately decorated with featherwork on the cuffs the slippers were from kishwégin the gloves from mondagua the carnations from atonquois the violets from walgatchkaall to the daughter of the tawaras allaye as it said on the little cards  the gift of pacohuila you know said madame smiling the brothers of pacohuila are your brothers  one by one they went to her and each one laid the back of her fingers against his forehead saying in turn  i am your brother mondagua allaye  i am your brother atonquois allaye  i am your brother walgatchka allaye best brother you know so spoke geoffrey looking at her with large almost solemn eyes of affection alvina smiled a little wanly wondering where she was it was all so solemn was it all mockery playacting she felt bitterly inclined to cry  meanwhile madame came in with the coffee which she always made herself and the party sat down to breakfast ciccio sat on alvinas right but he seemed to avoid looking at her or speaking to her all the time he looked across the table with the halfasserted knowing look in his eyes at gigi and all the time he addressed himself to gigi with the throaty rich plangent quality in his voice that alvina could not bear it seemed terrible to her and he spoke in french and the two men seemed to be exchanging unspeakable communications so that alvina for all her wistfulness and subjectedness was at last seriously offended she rose as soon as possible from table in her own heart she wanted attention and public recognition from ciccionone of which she got she returned to her own house to her own room anxious to tidy everything not wishing to have her landlady in the room and she half expected ciccio to come to speak to her  as she was busy washing a garment in the bowl her landlady knocked and entered she was a rough and rather beerylooking yorkshire woman not attractive  oh yon

dour in the doorway alvina quietly gave her halfasovereign  nay lass said the woman if you share niver a drop o th lashins you mun split it five shillins is oceans ma wench im not down on younot me ony weve got to keep up appearances a bit you know dash my rags its a caution  i havent got five shillings said alvina  yerve not all right gie s ha efcrown today an tother termorrer itll keep itll

alvina ought to have minded but she didnt she even laughed into her ricketty mirror at the back of her thoughts all she minded was that ciccio did not pay her some attention she really expected him now to come to speak to her if she could have imagined how far he was from any such intention  so she loitered unwillingly at her window high over the grey hard cobbled street and saw her landlady hastening along the black asphalt pavement her dirty apron thrown discreetly over what was most obviously a quart jug she followed the squat intent figure with her eye to the publichouse at the corner and then she saw ciccio humped over his yellow bicycle going for a steep and perilous ride with gigi  still she lingered in her sordid room she could feel madame was expecting her but she felt inert weak incommunicative only a real fear of offending madame drove her down at last  max opened the door to let her in  ah he said youve come we were wondering about you  thank you she said as she passed into the dirty hall where still two bicycles stood  madame is in the kitchen he said  alvina found madame trussed in a large white apron busy rubbing a yellowfleshed hen with lemon previous to boiling  ah said madame so there you are i have been out and done my shopping and already begun to prepare the dinner yes you may help me can you wash leeks yes every grain of sand shall i trust you then  madame usually had a kitchen to herself in the morning she either ousted her landlady or used her as second cook for madame was a gourmet if not gourmand if she inclined towards selfindulgence in any direction it was in the direction of food she loved a good table and hence the tawaras saved less money than they might she was an exacting tormenting bullying cook alvina who knew well enough how to prepare a simple dinner was offended by madames exactions madame turning back the green leaves of a leek and hunting a speck of earth down into the white like a flea in a bed was too much for alvina  im afraid i shall never be particular enough she said cant i do anything else for you  for me i need nothing to be done for me but for the young menyes i will show you in one minute  and she took alvina upstairs to her room and gave her a pair of the thin leather trousers fringed with hair belonging to one of the braves a seam had ripped madame gave alvina a fine awl and some waxed thread  the leather is not good in these things of gigis she said it is badly prepared see like this and she showed alvina another place where the garment was repaired keep on your apron at the weekend you must fetch more clothes not spoil this beautiful gown of voile where have you left your diamonds what in your room are they locked oh my dear madame turned pale and darted looks of fire at alvina if they are stolen she cried oh i have become quite weak hearing you she panted and shook her head if they are not stolen you have the holy saints alone to be thankful for keeping them but run run  and madame really stamped her foot  bring me everything youve gotevery thing that is valuable i shall lock it up how can you  alvina was hustled off to her lodging fortunately nothing was gone she brought all to madame and madame fingered the treasures lovingly  now what you want you must ask me for she said  with what close curiosity madame examined the ruby brooch  you can have that if you like madame said alvina  you meanwhat  i will give you that brooch if you like to take it  give me this cried madame and a flash went over her face then she changed into a sort of wheedling nono i shant take it i shant take it you dont want to give away such a thing  i dont mind said alvina do take it if you like it  oh no oh no i cant take it a beautiful thing it is really it would be worth over a thousand francs because i believe it is quite genuine  im sure its genuine said alvina do have it since you like it  oh i cant i cant  yes do  the beautiful red stonesantique gems antique gems and do you really give it to me  yes i should like to  you are a girl with a noble heart madame threw her arms round alvinas neck and kissed her alvina felt very cool about it madame locked up the jewels quickly after one last look  my fowl she said which must not boil too fast  at length alvina was called down to dinner the young men were at table talking as young men do not very interestingly after the meal ciccio sat and twanged his mandoline making its crying noise vibrate through the house  i shall go and look at the town said alvina  and who shall go with you asked madame  i will go alone said alvina unless you will come madame  alas no i cant i cant come will you really go alone  yes i want to go to the womens shops said alvina  you want to all right then and you will come home at teatime yes  as soon as alvina had gone out ciccio put away his mandoline and lit a cigarette then after a while he hailed geoffrey and the two young men sallied forth alvina emerging from a drapers shop in rotherhampton broadway found them loitering on the pavement outside and they strolled along with her so she went into a shop that sold ladies underwear leaving them on the pavement she stayed as long as she could but there they were when she came out they had endless lounging patience  i thought you would be gone on she said  no hurry said ciccio and he took away her parcels from her as if he had a right she wished he wouldnt tilt the flap of his black hat over one eye and she wished there wasnt quite so much waistline in the cut of his coat and that he didnt smoke cigarettes against the end of his nose in the street but wishing wouldnt alter him he strayed alongside as if he half belonged and half didntmost irritating  she wasted as much time as possible in the shops then they took the tram home again ciccio paid the three fares laying his hand restrainingly on gigis hand when gigis hand sought pence in his trouser pocket and throwing his arm over his friends shoulder in affectionate but vulgar triumph when the fares were paid alvina was on her high horse  they tried to talk to her they tried to ingratiate themselvesbut she wasnt having any she talked with icy pleasantness and so the teatime passed and the time after tea the performance went rather mechanically at the theatre and the supper at home with bottled beer and boiled ham was a conventionally cheerful affair even madame was a little afraid of alvina this evening  i am tired i shall go early to my room said alvina  yes i think we are all tired said madame  why is it said max metaphysicallywhy is it that two merry evenings never follow one behind the other  max beer makes thee a farceur of a fine quality said madame alvina rose  please dont get up she said to the others i have my key and can see quite well she said goodnight all  they rose and bowed their goodnights but ciccio with an obstinate and ugly little smile on his face followed her  please dont come she said turning at the street door but obstinately he lounged into the street with her he followed her to her door  did you bring the flashlight she said the stair is so dark  he looked at her and turned as if to get the light quickly she opened the housedoor and slipped inside shutting it sharply in his face he stood for some moments looking at the door and an ugly little look mounted his straight nose he too turned indoors  alvina hurried to bed and slept well and the next day the same she was all icy pleasantness the natchakeetawaras were a little bit put out by her she was a spoke in their wheel a scotch to their facility she made them irritable and that eveningit was fridayciccio did not rise to accompany her to her house and she knew they were relieved that she had gone  that did not please her the next day which was saturday the last and greatest day of the week she found herself again somewhat of an outsider in the troupe the tribe had assembled in its old unison she was the intruder the interloper and ciccio never looked at her only showed her the halfaverted side of his cheek on which was a slightly jeering ugly look  will you go to woodhouse tomorrow madame asked her rather coolly they none of them called her allaye any more  id better fetch some things hadnt i said alvina  certainly if you think you will stay with us  this was a nasty slap in the face for her but  i want to she said  yes then you will go to woodhouse tomorrow and come to mansfield on monday morning like that shall it be you will stay one night at woodhouse  through alvinas mind flitted the rapid thoughtthey want an evening without me her pride mounted obstinately she very nearly saidi may stay in woodhouse altogether but she held her tongue  after all they were very common people they ought to be glad to have her look how madame snapped up that brooch and look what an uncouth lout ciccio was after all she was demeaning herself shamefully staying with them in common sordid lodgings after all she had been bred up differently from that they had horribly low standardssuch low standardsnot only of morality but of life altogether really she had come down in the world conforming to such standards of life she evoked the images of her mother and miss frost ladies and noble women both whatever could she be thinking of herself  however there was time for her to retrace her steps she had not given herself away except to ciccio and her heart burned when she thought of him partly with anger and mortification partly alas with undeniable and unsatisfied love let her bridle as she might her heart burned and she wanted to look at him she wanted him to notice her and instinct told her that he might ignore her for ever she went to her room an unhappy woman and wept and fretted till morning chafing between humiliation and yearning     chapter x  the fall of manchester house   alvina rose chastened and wistful as she was doing her hair she heard the plaintive nasal sound of ciccios mandoline she looked down the mixed vista of backyards and little gardens and was able to catch sight of a portion of ciccio who was sitting on a box in the bluebrick yard of his house bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves twitching away at the wailing mandoline it was not a warm morning but there was a streak of sunshine alvina had noticed that ciccio did not seem to feel the cold unless it were a wind or a driving rain he was playing the wildlyyearning neapolitan songs of which alvina knew nothing but although she only saw a section of him the glimpse of his head was enough to rouse in her that overwhelming fascination which came and went in spells his remoteness his southernness something velvety and dark so easily she might miss him altogether within a hairsbreadth she had let him disappear  she hurried down geoffrey opened the door to her she smiled at him in a quick luminous smile a magic change in her  i could hear ciccio playing she said  geoffrey spread his rather thick lips in a smile and jerked his head in the direction of the back door with a deep intimate look into alvinas eyes as if to say his friend was lovesick  shall i go through said alvina  geoffrey laid his large hand on her shoulder for a moment looked into her eyes and nodded he was a broadshouldered fellow with a rather flat handsome face wellcoloured and with the look of the alpine ox about him slow eternal even a little mysterious alvina was startled by the deep mysterious look in his darkfringed oxeyes the odd arch of his eyebrows made him suddenly seem not quite human to her she smiled to him again startled but he only inclined his head and with his heavy hand on her shoulder gently impelled her towards ciccio  when she came out at the back she smiled straight into ciccios face with her sudden luminous smile his hand on the mandoline trembled into silence he sat looking at her with an instant reestablishment of knowledge and yet she shrank from the long inscrutable gaze of his blackset tawny eyes she resented him a little and yet she went forward to him and stood so that her dress touched him and still he gazed up at her with the heavy unspeaking look that seemed to bear her down he seemed like some creature that was watching her for his purposes she looked aside at the black garden which had a wiry gooseberry bush  you will come with me to woodhouse she said  he did not answer till she turned to him again then as she met his eyes  to woodhouse he said watching her to fix her  yes she said a little pale at the lips  and she saw his eternal smile of triumph slowly growing round his mouth she wanted to cover his mouth with her hand she preferred his tawny eyes with their black brows and lashes his eyes watched her as a cat watches a bird but without the white gleam of ferocity in his eyes was a deep deep sunwarmth something fathomless deepening black and abysmal but somehow sweet to her  will you she repeated  but his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent he turned aside his face as if unwilling to give a straight answer  yes he said  play something to me she cried  he lifted his face to her and shook his head slightly  yes do she said looking down on him  and he bent his head to the mandoline and suddenly began to sing a neapolitan song in a faint compressed headvoice looking up at her again as his lips moved looking straight into her face with a curious mocking caress as the muted voix blanche came through his lips at her amid the louder quavering of the mandoline the sound penetrated her like a thread of fire hurting but delicious the high thread of his voice she could see the adams apple move in his throat his brows tilted as he looked along his lashes at her all the time here was the strange sphinx singing again and herself between its paws she seemed almost to melt into his power  madame intervened to save her  what serenade before breakfast you have strong stomachs i say eggs and ham are more the question hein come you smell them dont you  a flicker of contempt and derision went over ciccios face as he broke off and looked aside  i prefer the serenade said alvina ive had ham and eggs before  you do hein wellalways you wont and now you must eat the ham and eggs however yes isnt it so  ciccio rose to his feet and looked at alvina as he would have looked at gigi had gigi been there his eyes said unspeakable things about madame alvina flashed a laugh suddenly and a goodhumoured halfmocking smile came over his face too  they turned to follow madame into the house and as alvina went before him she felt his fingers stroke the nape of her neck and pass in a soft touch right down her back she started as if some unseen creature had stroked her with its paw and she glanced swiftly round to see the face of ciccio mischievous behind her shoulder  now i think said madame that today we all take the same train we go by the great central as far as the junction together then you allaye go on to knarborough and we leave you until tomorrow and now there is not much time  i am going to woodhouse said ciccio in french  you also by the train or the bicycle  train said ciccio  waste so much money  ciccio raised his shoulders slightly  when breakfast was over and alvina had gone to her room geoffrey went out into the back yard where the bicycles stood  cic he said i should like to go with thee to woodhouse come on bicycle with me  ciccio shook his head  im going in train with her he said  geoffrey darkened with his heavy anger  i would like to see how it is there chez elle he said  ask her said ciccio  geoffrey watched him suddenly  thou forsakest me he said i would like to see it there  ask her repeated ciccio then come on bicycle  youre content to leave me muttered geoffrey  ciccio touched his friend on his broad cheek and smiled at him with affection  i dont leave thee gigi i asked thy advice you said go but come go and ask her and then come come on bicycle eh ask her go on go and ask her  alvina was surprised to hear a tap at her door and gigis voice in his strong foreign accent  mees houghton i carry your bag  she opened her door in surprise she was all ready  there it is she said smiling at him  but he confronted her like a powerful ox full of dangerous force her smile had reassured him  na allaye he said tell me something  what laughed alvina  can i come to woodhouse  when  today can i come on bicycle to tea eh at your house with you and ciccio eh  he was smiling with a thick doubtful half sullen smile  do said alvina  he looked at her with his large darkblue eyes  really eh he said holding out his large hand  she shook hands with him warmly  yes really she said i wish you would  good he said a broad smile on his thick mouth and all the time he watched her curiously from his large eyes  ciccioa good chap eh he said  is he laughed alvina  haa gigi shook his head solemnly the best he made such solemn eyes alvina laughed he laughed too and picked up her bag as if it were a bubble  na cic he said as he saw ciccio in the street sommes daccord  ben said ciccio holding out his hand for the bag donne  nene said gigi shrugging  alvina found herself on the new and busy station that sunday morning one of the little theatrical company it was an odd experience they were so obviously a theatrical companypeople apart from the world madame was darting her black eyes here and there behind her spotted veil and standing with the ostensible selfpossession of her profession max was circling round with large strides round a big black box on which the red words natchakeetawara showed mystic and round the small bunch of stage fittings at the end of the platform louis was waiting to get the tickets gigi and ciccio were bringing up the bicycles they were a whole train of departure in themselves busy bustling cheerfuland curiously apart vagrants  alvina strolled away towards the halfopen bookstall geoffrey was standing monumental between her and the company she returned to him  what time shall we expect you she said  he smiled at her in his broad friendly fashion  expect me to be there why he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate at four oclock  just about the time when we get there she said  he looked at her sagely and nodded  they were a goodhumoured company in the railway carriage the men smoked cigarettes and tapped off the ash on the heels of their boots madame watched every traveller with professional curiosity max scrutinized the newspaper lloyds and pointed out items to louis who read them over maxs shoulder ciccio suddenly smacked geoffrey on the thigh and looked laughing into his face so till they arrived at the junction and then there was a kissing and a taking of farewells as if the company were separating for ever louis darted into the refreshment bar and returned with little pies and oranges which he deposited in the carriage madame presented alvina with a packet of chocolate and it was goodbye goodbye allaye goodbye ciccio bon voyage have a good time both  so alvina sped on in the fast train to knarborough with ciccio  i do like them all she said  he opened his mouth slightly and lifted his head up and down she saw in the movement how affectionate he was and in his own way how emotional he loved them all she put her hand to his he gave her hand one sudden squeeze of physical understanding then left it as if nothing had happened there were other people in the carriage with them she could not help feeling how sudden and lovely that moments grasp of his hand was so warm so whole  and thus they watched the sunday morning landscape slip by as they ran into knarborough they went out to a little restaurant to eat it was one oclock  isnt it strange that we are travelling together like this she said as she sat opposite him  he smiled looking into her eyes  you think its strange he said showing his teeth slightly  dont you she cried  he gave a slight laconic laugh  and i can hardly bear it that i love you so much she said quavering across the potatoes  he glanced furtively round to see if any one was listening if any one might hear he would have hated it but no one was near beneath the tiny table he took her two knees between his knees and pressed them with a slow immensely powerful pressure helplessly she put her hand across the table to him he covered it for one moment with his hand then ignored it but her knees were still between the powerful living vice of his knees  eat he said to her smiling motioning to her plate and he relaxed her  they decided to go out to woodhouse on the tramcar a long hours ride sitting on the top of the covered car in the atmosphere of strong tobacco smoke he seemed selfconscious withdrawn into his own cover so obviously a darkskinned foreigner and alvina as she sat beside him was reminded of the woman with the negro husband down in lumley she understood the womans reserve she herself felt in the same way something of an outcast because of the man at her side an outcast and glad to be an outcast she clung to ciccios dark despised foreign nature she loved it she worshipped it she defied all the other world dark he sat beside her drawn in to himself overcast by his presumed inferiority among these northern industrial people and she was with him on his side outside the pale of her own people  there were already acquaintances on the tram she nodded in answer to their salutation but so obviously from a distance that they kept turning round to eye her and ciccio but they left her alone the breach between her and them was established for everand it was her will which established it  so up and down the weary hills of the hilly industrial countryside till at last they drew near to woodhouse they passed the ruins of throttlehapenny and alvina glanced at it indifferent they ran along the knarborough road a fair number of woodhouse young people were strolling along the pavements in their sunday clothes she knew them all she knew lizzie batess fox furs and fanny cloughs lilac costume and mrs smithams winged hat she knew them all and almost inevitably the old woodhouse feeling began to steal over her she was glad they could not see her she was a little ashamed of ciccio she wished for the moment ciccio were not there and as the time came to get down she looked anxiously back and forth to see at which halt she had better descendwhere fewer people would notice her but then she threw her scruples to the wind and descended into the staring sunday afternoon street attended by ciccio who carried her bag she knew she was a marked figure  they slipped round to manchester house miss pinnegar expected alvina but by the train which came later so she had to be knocked up for she was lying down she opened the door looking a little patched in her cheeks because of her curious colouring and a little forlorn and a little dumpy and a little irritable  i didnt know thered be two of you was her greeting  didnt you said alvina kissing her ciccio came to carry my bag  oh said miss pinnegar how do you do and she thrust out her hand to him he shook it loosely  i had your wire said miss pinnegar you said the train mrs rollings is coming in at four again  oh all right said alvina  the house was silent and afternoonlike ciccio took off his coat and sat down in mr houghtons chair alvina told him to smoke he kept silent and reserved miss pinnegar a poor patchcheeked rather roundbacked figure with greybrown fringe stood as if she did not quite know what to say or do  she followed alvina upstairs to her room  i cant think why you bring him here snapped miss pinnegar i dont know what youre thinking about the whole place is talking already  i dont care said alvina i like him  ohfor shame cried miss pinnegar lifting her hand with miss frosts helpless involuntary movement what do you think of yourself and your father a month dead  it doesnt matter father is dead and im sure the dead dont mind  i never knew such things as you say  why i mean them  miss pinnegar stood blank and helpless  youre not asking him to stay the night she blurted  yes and im going back with him to madame tomorrow you know im part of the company now as pianist  and are you going to marry him  i dont know  how can you say you dont know why its awful you make me feel i shall go out of my mind  but i dont know said alvina  its incredible simply incredible i believe youre out of your senses i used to think sometimes there was something wrong with your mother and thats what it is with you youre not quite right in your mind you need to be looked after  do i miss pinnegar ah well dont you trouble to look after me will you  no one will if i dont  i hope no one will  there was a pause  im ashamed to live another day in woodhouse said miss pinnegar  im leaving it for ever said alvina  i should think so said miss pinnegar  suddenly she sank into a chair and burst into tears wailing  your poor father your poor father  im sure the dead are all right why must you pity him  youre a lost girl cried miss pinnegar  am i really laughed alvina it sounded funny  yes youre a lost girl sobbed miss pinnegar on a final note of despair  i like being lost said alvina  miss pinnegar wept herself into silence she looked huddled and forlorn alvina went to her and laid her hand on her shoulder  dont fret miss pinnegar she said dont be silly i love to be with ciccio and madame perhaps in the end i shall marry him but if i dont her hand suddenly gripped miss pinnegars heavy arm till it hurti wouldnt lose a minute of him no not for anything would i  poor miss pinnegar dwindled convinced  you make it hard for me in woodhouse she said hopeless  never mind said alvina kissing her woodhouse isnt heaven and earth  its been my home for forty years  its been mine for thirty thats why im glad to leave it there was a pause  ive been thinking said miss pinnegar about opening a little business in tamworth you know the watsons are there  i believe youd be happy said alvina  miss pinnegar pulled herself together she had energy and courage still  i dont want to stay here anyhow she said woodhouse has nothing for me any more  of course it hasnt said alvina i think youd be happier away from it  yesprobably i shouldnow  none the less poor miss pinnegar was greyhaired she was almost a dumpy odd old woman  they went downstairs miss pinnegar put on the kettle  would you like to see the house said alvina to ciccio  he nodded and she took him from room to room his eyes looked quickly and curiously over everything noticing things but without criticism  this was my mothers little sittingroom she said she sat here for years in this chair  always here he said looking into alvinas face  yes she was ill with her heart this is another photograph of her im not like her  who is that he asked pointing to a photograph of the handsome whitehaired miss frost  that was miss frost my governess she lived here till she died i loved hershe meant everything to me  she also dead  yes five years ago  they went to the drawingroom he laid his hand on the keys of the piano sounding a chord  play she said  he shook his head smiling slightly but he wished her to play she sat and played one of kishwégins pieces he listened faintly smiling  fine pianoeh he said looking into her face  i like the tone she said  is it yours  the piano yes i suppose everything is minein name at least i dont know how fathers affairs are really  he looked at her and again his eye wandered over the room he saw a little coloured portrait of a child with a fleece of brownishgold hair and surprised eyes in a paleblue stiff frock with a broad darkblue sash  you he said  do you recognize me she said arent i comical  she took him upstairsfirst to the monumental bedroom  this was mothers room she said now it is mine  he looked at her then at the things in the room then out of the window then at her again she flushed and hurried to show him his room and the bathroom then she went downstairs  he kept glancing up at the height of the ceilings the size of the rooms taking in the size and proportion of the house and the quality of the fittings  it is a big house he said yours  mine in name said alvina father left all to meand his debts as well you see  much debts  oh yes i dont quite know how much but perhaps more debts than there is property i shall go and see the lawyer in the morning perhaps there will be nothing at all left for me when everything is paid  she had stopped on the stairs telling him this turning round to him who was on the steps above he looked down on her calculating then he smiled sourly  bad job eh if it is all gone he said  i dont mind really if i can live she said  he spread his hands deprecating not understanding then he glanced up the stairs and along the corridor again and downstairs into the hall  a fine big house grand if it was yours he said  i wish it were she said rather pathetically if you like it so much  he shrugged his shoulders  hé he said how not like it  i dont like it she said i think its a gloomy miserable hole i hate it ive lived here all my life and seen everything bad happen here i hate it  why he said with a curious sarcastic intonation  its a bad job it isnt yours for certain he said as they entered the livingroom where miss pinnegar sat cutting bread and butter  what said miss pinnegar sharply  the house said alvina  oh well we dont know well hope for the best replied miss pinnegar arranging the bread and butter on the plate then rather tart she added it is a bad job and a good many things are a bad job besides that if miss houghton had what she ought to have things would be very different i assure you  oh yes said ciccio to whom this address was directed  very different indeed if all the money hadnt beenlostin the way it has miss houghton wouldnt be playing the piano for one thing in a cinematograph show  no perhaps not said ciccio  certainly not its not the right thing for her to be doing at all  you think not said ciccio  do you imagine it is said miss pinnegar turning point blank on him as he sat by the fire  he looked curiously at miss pinnegar grinning slightly  hé he said how do i know  i should have thought it was obvious said miss pinnegar  hé he ejaculated not fully understanding  but of course those that are used to nothing better cant see anything but what theyre used to she said rising and shaking the crumbs from her black silk apron into the fire he watched her  miss pinnegar went away into the scullery alvina was laying a fire in the drawingroom she came with a dustpan to take some coal from the fire of the livingroom  what do you want said ciccio rising and he took the shovel from her hand  big hot fires arent they he said as he lifted the burning coals from the glowing mass of the grate  enough said alvina enough well put it in the drawingroom he carried the shovel of flaming smoking coals to the other room and threw them in the grate on the sticks watching alvina put on more pieces of coal  fine a fire quick work eh a beautiful thing a fire you know what they say in my place you can live without food but you cant live without fire  but i thought it was always hot in naples said alvina  no it isnt and my village you know when i was small boy that was in the mountains an hour quick train from naples cold in the winter hot in the summer  as cold as england said alvina  héand colder the wolves come down you could hear them crying in the night in the frost  how terrifying said alvina  and they will kill the dogs always they kill the dogs you know they hate dogs wolves do he made a queer noise to show how wolves hate dogs alvina understood and laughed  so should i if i was a wolf she said  yeseh his eyes gleamed on her for a moment  ah but the poor dogs you find them bittencarried away among the trees or the stones hard to find them poor things the next day  how frightened they must be said alvina  frightenedhu he made sudden gesticulations and ejaculations which added volumes to his few words  and did you like it your village she said  he put his head on one side in deprecation  no he said because you seehé there is nothing to dono moneyworkworkworkno lifeyou see nothing when i was a small boy my father he died and my mother comes with me to naples then i go with the little boats on the seafishing carrying people he flourished his hand as if to make her understand all the things that must be wordless he smiled at herbut there was a faint poignant sadness and remoteness in him a beauty of old fatality and ultimate indifference to fate  and were you very poor  poorwhy yes nothing ragsno shoesbread little fish from the seashellfish  his hands flickered his eyes rested on her with a profound look of knowledge and it seemed in spite of all one state was very much the same to him as another poverty was as much life as affluence only he had a sort of jealous idea that it was humiliating to be poor and so for vanitys sake he would have possessions the countless generations of civilization behind him had left him an instinct of the worlds meaninglessness only his little modern education made money and independence an idée fixe old instinct told him the world was nothing but modern education so shallow was much more efficacious than instinct it drove him to make a show of himself to the world alvina watching him as if hypnotized saw his old beauty formed through civilization after civilization and at the same time she saw his modern vulgarianism and decadence  and when you go back you will go back to your old village she said  he made a gesture with his head and shoulders evasive noncommittal  i dont know you see he said  what is the name of it  pescocalascio he said the word subduedly unwillingly  tell me again said alvina  pescocalascio  she repeated it  and tell me how you spell it she said  he fumbled in his pocket for a pencil and a piece of paper she rose and brought him an old sketchbook he wrote slowly but with the beautiful italian hand the name of his village  and write your name she said  marasca francesco he wrote  and write the name of your father and mother she said he looked at her enquiringly  i want to see them she said  marasca giovanni he wrote and under that califano maria  she looked at the four names in the graceful italian script and one after the other she read them out he corrected her smiling gravely when she said them properly he nodded  yes he said thats it you say it well  at that moment miss pinnegar came in to say mrs rollings had seen another of the young men riding down the street  thats gigi he doesnt know how to come here said ciccio quickly taking his hat and going out to find his friend  geoffrey arrived his broad face hot and perspiring  couldnt you find it said alvina  i find the house but i couldnt find no door said geoffrey  they all laughed and sat down to tea geoffrey and ciccio talked to each other in french and kept each other in countenance fortunately for them madame had seen to their tablemanners but still they were far too free and easy to suit miss pinnegar  do you know said ciccio in french to geoffrey what a fine house this is  no said geoffrey rolling his large eyes round the room and speaking with his cheek stuffed out with food is it  ahif it was hers you know  and so after tea ciccio said to alvina  shall you let geoffrey see the house  the tour commenced again geoffrey with his thick legs planted apart gazed round the rooms and made his comments in french to ciccio when they climbed the stairs he fingered the big smooth mahogany bannisterrail in the bedroom he stared almost dismayed at the colossal bed and cupboard in the bathroom he turned on the oldfashioned silver taps  here is my room said ciccio in french  assez éloigné replied gigi ciccio also glanced along the corridor  yes he said but an open course  look my boyif you could marry this meaning the house  ha she doesnt know if it hers any more perhaps the debts cover every bit of it  dont say so na thats a pity thats a pity la pauvre fillepauvre demoiselle lamented geoffrey  isnt it a pity what dost say  a thousand pities a thousand pities look my boy love needs no havings but marriage does love is for all even the grasshoppers but marriage means a kitchen thats how it is la pauvre demoiselle cest malheur pour elle  thats true said ciccio et aussi pour moi for me as well  for thee as well cher perhaps said geoffrey laying his arm on ciccios shoulder and giving him a sudden hug they smiled to each other  who knows said ciccio  who knows truly my cic  as they went downstairs to rejoin alvina whom they heard playing on the piano in the drawingroom geoffrey peeped once more into the big bedroom  tu nes jamais monté si haut mon beau pour moi ça serait difficile de mélever jaurais bien peur moi tu te trouves aussi un peu ébahi hein nestce pas  ya place pour trois said ciccio  non je crêverais là haut pas pour moi  and they went laughing downstairs  miss pinnegar was sitting with alvina determined not to go to chapel this evening she sat rather hulked reading a novel alvina flirted with the two men played the piano to them and suggested a game of cards  oh alvina you will never bring out the cards tonight expostulated poor miss pinnegar  but miss pinnegar it cant possibly hurt anybody  you know what i thinkand what your father thoughtand your mother and miss frost  you see i think its only prejudice said alvina  oh very well said miss pinnegar angrily  and closing her book she rose and went to the other room  alvina brought out the cards and a little box of pence which remained from endeavour harvests at that moment there was a knock it was mr may miss pinnegar brought him in in triumph  oh he said company i heard youd come miss houghton so i hastened to pay my compliments i didnt know you had company how do you do francesco how do you do geoffrey comment allezvous alors  bien said geoffrey you are going to take a hand  cards on sunday evening dear me what a revolution of course im not bigoted if miss houghton asks me  miss pinnegar looked solemnly at alvina  yes do take a hand mr may said alvina  thank you i will then if i may especially as i see those tempting piles of pennies and hapennies who is bank may i ask is miss pinnegar going to play too  but miss pinnegar had turned her poor bowed back and departed  im afraid shes offended said alvina  but why we dont put her soul in danger do we now im a good catholic you know i cant do with these provincial little creeds who deals do you miss houghton but im afraid we shall have a rather dry game what isnt that your opinion  the other men laughed  if miss houghton would just allow me to run round and bring something in yes may i that would be so much more cheerful what is your choice gentlemen  beer said ciccio and geoffrey nodded  beer oh really extraornary i always take a little whiskey myself what kind of beer aleor bitter im afraid id better bring bottles now how can i secrete them you havent a small travelling case miss houghton then i shall look as if id just been taking a journey which i haveto the sun and back and if that isnt far enough even for miss pinnegar and john wesley why im sorry  alvina produced the travelling case  excellent he said excellent it will hold halfadozen beautifully now he fell into a whisperhadnt i better sneak out at the front door and so escape the clutches of the watchdog  out he went on tiptoe the other two men grinning at him fortunately there were glasses the best old glasses in the side cupboard in the drawing room but unfortunately when mr may returned a corkscrew was in request so alvina stole to the kitchen miss pinnegar sat dumped by the fire with her spectacles and her book she watched like a lynx as alvina returned and she saw the telltale corkscrew so she dumped a little deeper in her chair  there was a sound of revelry by night for mr may after a long depression was in high feather they shouted positively shouted over their cards they roared with excitement expostulation and laughter miss pinnegar sat through it all but at one point she could bear it no longer  the drawingroom door opened and the dumpy hulked faded woman in a black serge dress stood like a rather squat avenging angel in the doorway  what would your father say to this she said sternly  the company suspended their laughter and their cards and looked around miss pinnegar wilted and felt strange under so many eyes  father said alvina but why father  you lost girl said miss pinnegar backing out and closing the door  mr may laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over  there he cried helpless look what shes cost me and he went off into another paroxysm swelling like a turkey  ciccio opened his mouth laughing silently  lost girl lost girl how lost when you are at home said geoffrey making large eyes and looking hither and thither as if he had lost something  they all went off again in a muffled burst  no but really said mr may drinking and cardplaying with strange men in the drawingroom on sunday evening of cauce its scandalous its terrible i dont know how ever youll be saved after such a sin and in manchester house too he went off into another silent turkeyscarlet burst of mirth wriggling in his chair and squealing faintly oh i love it i love it you lost girl why of cauce shes lost and miss pinnegar has only just found it out who wouldnt be lost why even miss pinnegar would be lost if she could of cauce she would quite natchral  mr may wiped his eyes with his handkerchief which had unfortunately mopped up his whiskey  so they played on till mr may and geoffrey had won all the pennies except twopence of ciccios alvina was in debt  well i think its been a most agreeable game said mr may most agreeable dont you all  the two other men smiled and nodded  im only sorry to think miss houghton has lost so steadily all evening really quite remarkable but thenyou seei comfort myself with the reflection lucky in cards unlucky in love im certainly hounded with misfortune in love and im sure miss houghton would rather be unlucky in cards than in love what isnt it so  of course said alvina  there you see of cauce well all we can do after that is to wish her success in love isnt that so gentlemen im sure we are all quite willing to do our best to contribute to it isnt it so gentlemen arent we all ready to do our best to contribute to miss houghtons happiness in love well then let us drink to it he lifted his glass and bowed to alvina with every wish for your success in love miss houghton and your devoted servant he bowed and drank  geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass  i know youll come out all right in love i know he said heavily  and you ciccio arent you drinking said mr may  ciccio held up his glass looked at alvina made a little mouth at her comical and drank his beer  well said mr may beer must confirm it since words wont  what time is it said alvina we must have supper  it was past nine oclock alvina rose and went to the kitchen the men trailing after her miss pinnegar was not there she was not anywhere  has she gone to bed said mr may and he crept stealthily upstairs on tiptoe a comical flushfaced tubby little man he was familiar with the house he returned prancing  i heard her cough he said theres a light under her door shes gone to bed now havent i always said she was a good soul i shall drink her health miss pinnegar and he bowed stiffly in the direction of the stairsyour health and a good nights rest  after which giggling gaily he seated himself at the head of the table and began to carve the cold mutton  and where are the natchakeetawaras this week he asked they told him  oh and you two are cycling back to the camp of kishwégin tonight we mustnt prolong our cheerfulness too far  ciccio is staying to help me with my bag tomorrow said alvina you know ive joined the tawaras permanentlyas pianist  no i didnt know that oh really really oh well i see permanently yes i am surprised yes as pianist and if i might ask what is your share of the tribal income  that isnt settled yet said alvina  no exactly exactly it wouldnt be settled yet and you say it is a permanent engagement of cauce at such a figure  yes it is a permanent engagement said alvina  really what a blow you give me you wont come back to the endeavour what not at all  no said alvina i shall sell out of the endeavour  really youve decided have you oh this is news to me and is this quite final too  quite said alvina  i see putting two and two together if i may say so and he glanced from her to the young meni see most decidedly most onesidedly if i may use the vulgarism i seeee oh but what a blow you give me what a blow you give me  why said alvina  whats to become of the endeavour and consequently of poor me  cant you keep it goingform a company  im afraid i cant ive done my best but im afraid you know youve landed me  im so sorry said alvina i hope not  thank you for the hope said mr may sarcastically they say hope is sweet i begin to find it a little bitter  poor man he had already gone quite yellow in the face ciccio and geoffrey watched him with darkseeing eyes  and when are you going to let this fatal decision take effect asked mr may  im going to see the lawyer tomorrow and im going to tell him to sell everything and clear up as soon as possible said alvina  sell everything this house and all it contains  yes said alvina everything  really mr may seemed smitten quite dumb i feel as if the world had suddenly come to an end he said  but hasnt your world often come to an end before said alvina  welli suppose once or twice but never quite on top of me you see before  there was a silence  and have you told miss pinnegar said mr may  not finally but she has decided to open a little business in tamworth where she has relations  has she and are you really going to tour with these young people he indicated ciccio and gigi and at no salary his voice rose why its almost white slave traffic on madames part upon my word  i dont think so said alvina dont you see thats insulting  insulting well i dont know i think its the truth  not to be said to me for all that said alvina quivering with anger  oh perked mr may yellow with strange rage oh i mustnt say what i think oh  not if you think those things said alvina  oh really the difficulty is you see im afraid i do think them alvina watched him with big heavy eyes  go away she said go away i wont be insulted by you  no indeed cried mr may starting to his feet his eyes almost bolting from his head no indeed i wouldnt think of insulting you in the presence of these two young gentlemen  ciccio rose slowly and with a slow repeated motion of the head indicated the door  allez he said  certainement cried mr may flying at ciccio verbally like an enraged hen yellow at the gills certainement je men vais cette compagnie nest pas de ma choix  allez said ciccio more loudly  and mr may strutted out of the room like a bird bursting with its own rage ciccio stood with his hands on the table listening they heard mr may slam the front door  gone said geoffrey  ciccio smiled sneeringly  voyez un cochon de lait said gigi amply and calmly  ciccio sat down in his chair geoffrey poured out some beer for him saying  drink my cic the bubble has burst prfff and gigi knocked in his own puffed cheek with his fist allaye my dear your health we are the tawaras we are allaye we are pacohuila we are walgatchka allons the milkpig is stewed and eaten voilà he drank smiling broadly  one by one said geoffrey who was a little drunk one by one we put them out of the field they are hors de combat who remains pacohuila walgatchka allaye  he smiled very broadly alvina was sitting sunk in thought and torpor after her sudden anger  allaye what do you think about you are the bride of tawara said geoffrey  alvina looked at him smiling rather wanly  and who is tawara she asked  he raised his shoulders and spread his hands and swayed his head from side to side for all the world like a comic mandarin  there he cried the question who is tawara who tell me ciccio is heand i am heand max and louis he spread his hand to the distant members of the tribe  i cant be the bride of all four of you said alvina laughing  nono nono such a thing does not come into my mind but you are the bride of tawara you dwell in the tent of pacohuila and comes the day should it ever be so there is no room for you in the tent of pacohuila then the lodge of walgatchka the bear is open for you open yes wide open he spread his arms from his ample chest at the end of the table open and when allaye enters it is the lodge of allaye walgatchka is the bear that serves allaye by the law of the pale face by the law of the yenghees by the law of the fransayes walgatchka shall be husbandbear to allaye that day she lifts the doorcurtain of his tent  he rolled his eyes and looked around alvina watched him  but i might be afraid of a husbandbear she said  geoffrey got on to his feet  by the manitou he said the head of the bear walgatchka is humble here geoffrey bowed his headhis teeth are as soft as lilies here he opened his mouth and put his finger on his small close teethhis hands are as soft as bees that stroke a flower here he spread his hands and went and suddenly flopped on his knees beside alvina showing his hands and his teeth still and rolling his eyes allaye can have no fear at all of the bear walgatchka he said looking up at her comically  ciccio who had been watching and slightly grinning here rose to his feet and took geoffrey by the shoulder pulling him up  basta he said tu es saoul you are drunk my gigi get up how are you going to ride to mansfield heingreat beast  ciccio said geoffrey solemnly i love thee i love thee as a brother and also more i love thee as a brother my ciccio as thou knowest but and he puffed fiercelyi am the slave of allaye i am the tame bear of allaye  get up said ciccio get up per bacco she doesnt want a tame bear he smiled down on his friend  geoffrey rose to his feet and flung his arms round ciccio  cic he besought him cici love thee as a brother but let me be the tame bear of allaye let me be the gentle bear of allaye  all right said ciccio thou art the tame bear of allaye  geoffrey strained ciccio to his breast  thank you thank you salute me my own friend  and ciccio kissed him on either cheek whereupon geoffrey immediately flopped on his knees again before alvina and presented her his broad richcoloured cheek  salute your bear allaye he cried salute your slave the tame bear walgatchka who is a wild bear for all except allaye and his brother pacohuila the puma geoffrey growled realistically as a wild bear as he kneeled before alvina presenting his cheek  alvina looked at ciccio who stood above watching then she lightly kissed him on the cheek and said  wont you go to bed and sleep  geoffrey staggered to his feet shaking his head  nono he said nono walgatchka must travel to the tent of kishwégin to the camp of the tawaras  not tonight mon brave said ciccio tonight we stay here hein why separate heinfrère  geoffrey again clasped ciccio in his arms  pacohuila and walgatchka are bloodbrothers two bodies one blood one blood in two bodies one stream in two valleys one lake between two mountains  here geoffrey gazed with large heavy eyes on ciccio alvina brought a candle and lighted it  you will manage in the one room she said i will give you another pillow  she led the way upstairs geoffrey followed heavily then ciccio on the landing alvina gave them the pillow and the candle smiled bade them goodnight in a whisper and went downstairs again she cleared away the supper and carried away all glasses and bottles from the drawingroom then she washed up removing all traces of the feast the cards she restored to their old mahogany box manchester house looked itself again  she turned off the gas at the meter and went upstairs to bed from the far room she could hear the gentle but profound vibrations of geoffreys snoring she was tired after her day too tired to trouble about anything any more  but in the morning she was first downstairs she heard miss pinnegar and hurried hastily she opened the windows and doors to drive away the smell of beer and smoke she heard the men rumbling in the bathroom and quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire mrs rollings would not appear till later in the day at a quarter to seven miss pinnegar came down and went into the scullery to make her tea  did both the men stay she asked  yes they both slept in the end room said alvina  miss pinnegar said no more but padded with her tea and her boiled egg into the living room in the morning she was wordless  ciccio came down in his shirtsleeves as usual but wearing a collar he greeted miss pinnegar politely  goodmorning she said and went on with her tea  geoffrey appeared miss pinnegar glanced once at him sullenly and briefly answered his goodmorning then she went on with her egg slow and persistent in her movements mum  the men went out to attend to geoffreys bicycle the morning was slow and grey obscure as they pumped up the tires they heard some one padding behind miss pinnegar came and unbolted the yard door but ignored their presence then they saw her return and slowly mount the outer stairladder which went up to the top floor two minutes afterwards they were startled by the irruption of the workgirls as for the workgirls they gave quite loud startled squeals suddenly seeing the two men on their right hand in the obscure morning and they lingered on the stairway to gaze in rapt curiosity poking and whispering until miss pinnegar appeared overhead and sharply rang a bell which hung beside the entrance door of the workrooms  after which excitements geoffrey and ciccio went in to breakfast which alvina had prepared  you have done it all eh said ciccio glancing round  yes ive made breakfast for years now said alvina  not many more times here eh he said smiling significantly  i hope not said alvina  ciccio sat down almost like a husbandas if it were his right  geoffrey was very quiet this morning he ate his breakfast and rose to go  i shall see you soon he said smiling sheepishly and bowing to alvina ciccio accompanied him to the street  when ciccio returned alvina was once more washing dishes  what time shall we go he said  well catch the one train i must see the lawyer this morning  and what shall you say to him  i shall tell him to sell everything  and marry me  she started and looked at him  you dont want to marry do you she said  yes i do  wouldnt you rather wait and see  what he said  see if there is any money  he watched her steadily and his brow darkened  why he said  she began to tremble  youd like it better if there was money  a slow sinister smile came on his mouth his eyes never smiled except to geoffrey when a flood of warm laughing light sometimes suffused them  you think i should  yes its true isnt it you would  he turned his eyes aside and looked at her hands as she washed the forks they trembled slightly then he looked back at her eyes again that were watching him large and wistful and a little accusing  his impudent laugh came on his face  yes he said it is always better if there is money he put his hand on her and she winced but i marry you for love you know you know what love is and he put his arms round her and laughed down into her face  she strained away  but you can have love without marriage she said you know that  all right all right give me love eh i want that  she struggled against him  but not now she said  she saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly and he nodded  now he said now  his yellowtawny eyes looked down into hers alien and overbearing  i cant she struggled i cant now  he laughed in a sinister way yet with a certain warmheartedness  come to that big room he said  her face flew fixed into opposition  i cant now really she said grimly  his eyes looked down at hers her eyes looked back at him hard and cold and determined they remained motionless for some seconds then a stray wisp of her hair catching his attention desire filled his heart warm and full obliterating his anger in the combat for a moment he softened he saw her hardness becoming more assertive and he wavered in sudden dislike and almost dropped her then again the desire flushed his heart his smile became reckless of her and he picked her right up  yes he said now  for a second she struggled frenziedly but almost instantly she recognized how much stronger he was and she was still mute and motionless with anger white and mute and motionless she was taken to her room and at the back of her mind all the time she wondered at his deliberate recklessness of her recklessly he had his will of herbut deliberately and thoroughly not rushing to the issue but taking everything he wanted of her progressively and fully leaving her stark with nothing nothing of herselfnothing  when she could lie still she turned away from him still mute and he lay with his arms over her motionless noises went on in the street overhead in the workroom but theirs was complete silence  at last he rose and looked at her  love is a fine thing allaye he said  she lay mute and unmoving he approached laid his hand on her breast and kissed her  love he said asserting and laughing  but still she was completely mute and motionless he threw bedclothes over her and went downstairs whistling softly  she knew she would have to break her own trance of obstinacy so she snuggled down into the bedclothes shivering deliciously for her skin had become chilled she didnt care a bit really about her own downfall she snuggled deliciously in the sheets and admitted to herself that she loved him in truth she loved himand she was laughing to herself  luxuriously she resented having to get up and tackle her heap of broken garments but she did it she took other clothes adjusted her hair tied on her apron and went downstairs once more she could not find ciccio he had gone out a stray cat darted from the scullery and broke a plate in her leap alvina found her washingup water cold she put on more and began to dry her dishes  ciccio returned shortly and stood in the doorway looking at her she turned to him unexpectedly laughing  what do you think of yourself she laughed  well he said with a little nod and a furtive look of triumph about him evasive he went past her and into the room her inside burned with love for him so elusive so beautiful in his silent passing out of her sight she wiped her dishes happily why was she so absurdly happy she asked herself and why did she still fight so hard against the sense of his dark unseizable beauty unseizable for ever unseizable that made her almost his slave she fought against her own desire to fall at his feet ridiculous to be so happy  she sang to herself as she went about her work downstairs then she went upstairs to do the bedrooms and pack her bag at ten oclock she was to go to the family lawyer  she lingered over her possessions what to take and what not to take and so doing she wasted her time it was already ten oclock when she hurried downstairs he was sitting quite still waiting he looked up at her  now i must hurry she said i dont think i shall be more than an hour  he put on his hat and went out with her  i shall tell the lawyer i am engaged to you shall i she asked  yes he said tell him what you like he was indifferent  because said alvina gaily we can please ourselves what we do whatever we say i shall say we think of getting married in the summer when we know each other better and going to italy  why shall you say all that said ciccio  because i shall have to give some account of myself or theyll make me do something i dont want to do you might come to the lawyers with me will you hes an awfully nice old man then hed believe in you  but ciccio shook his head  no he said i shant go he doesnt want to see me  well if you dont want to but i remember your name francesco marasca and i remember pescocalascio  ciccio heard in silence as they walked the halfempty mondaymorning street of woodhouse people kept nodding to alvina some hurried inquisitively across to speak to her and look at ciccio ciccio however stood aside and turned his back  oh yes alvina said i am staying with friends here and there for a few weeks no i dont know when i shall be back goodbye  youre looking well alvina people said to her i think youre looking wonderful a change does you good  it does doesnt it said alvina brightly and she was pleased she was looking well  well goodbye for a minute she said glancing smiling into his eyes and nodding to him as she left him at the gate of the lawyers house by the ivycovered wall  the lawyer was a little man all grey alvina had known him since she was a child but rather as an official than an individual she arrived all smiling in his room he sat down and scrutinized her sharply officially before beginning  well miss houghton and what news have you  i dont think ive any mr beeby i came to you for news  ah said the lawyer and he fingered a paperweight that covered a pile of papers im afraid there is nothing very pleasant unfortunately and nothing very unpleasant either for that matter    he gave her a shrewd little smile  is the will proved  not yet but i expect it will be through in a few days time  and are all the claims in  yes i think so i think so and again he laid his hand on the pile of papers under the paperweight and ran through the edges with the tips of his fingers  all those said alvina  yes he said quietly it sounded ominous  many said alvina  a fair amount a fair amount let me show you a statement  he rose and brought her a paper she made out with the lawyers help that the claims against her fathers property exceeded the gross estimate of his property by some seven hundred pounds  does it mean we owe seven hundred pounds she asked  that is only on the estimate of the property it might of course realize much more when soldor it might realize less  how awful said alvina her courage sinking  unfortunate unfortunate however i dont think the realization of the property would amount to less than the estimate i dont think so  but even then said alvina there is sure to be something owing  she saw herself saddled with her fathers debts  im afraid so said the lawyer  and then what said alvina  ohthe creditors will have to be satisfied with a little less than they claim i suppose not a very great deal you see i dont expect they will complain a great deal in fact some of them will be less badly off than they feared no on that score we need not trouble further useless if we do anyhow but now about yourself would you like me to try to compound with the creditors so that you could have some sort of provision they are mostly people who know you know your condition and i might try  try what said alvina  to make some sort of compound perhaps you might retain a lease of miss pinnegars workrooms perhaps even something might be done about the cinematograph what would you like  alvina sat still in her chair looking through the window at the ivy sprays and the leaf buds on the lilac she felt she could not she could not cut off every resource in her own heart she had confidently expected a few hundred pounds even a thousand or more and that would make her something of a catch to people who had nothing but nownothingnothing at the back of her but her hundred pounds when that was gone  in her dilemma she looked at the lawyer  you didnt expect it would be quite so bad he said  i think i didnt she said  no wellit might have been worse  again he waited and again she looked at him vacantly  what do you think he said  for answer she only looked at him with wide eyes  perhaps you would rather decide later  no she said no its no use deciding later  the lawyer watched her with curious eyes his hand beat a little impatiently  i will do my best he said to get what i can for you  oh well she said better let everything go i dont want to hang on dont bother about me at all i shall go away anyhow  you will go away said the lawyer and he studied his fingernails  yes i shant stay here  oh and may i ask if you have any definite idea where you will go  ive got an engagement as pianist with a travelling theatrical company  oh indeed said the lawyer scrutinizing her sharply she stared away vacantly out of the window he took to the attentive study of his fingernails once more and at a sufficient salary  quite sufficient thank you said alvina  oh well well now he fidgetted a little you see we are all old neighbours and connected with your father for many years wethat is the persons interested and myselfwould not like to think that you were driven out of woodhouseererdestitute iferwe could come to some compositionmake some arrangement that would be agreeable to you and would in some measure secure you a means of livelihood  he watched alvina with sharp blue eyes alvina looked back at him still vacantly  nothanks awfully she said but dont bother im going away  with the travelling theatrical company  yes  the lawyer studied his fingernails intensely  well he said feeling with a fingertip an imaginary roughness of one nailedge well in that casein that casesupposing you have made an irrevocable decision  he looked up at her sharply she nodded slowly like a porcelain mandarin  in that case he said we must proceed with the valuation and the preparation for the sale  yes she said faintly  you realize he said that everything in manchester house except your private personal property and that of miss pinnegar belongs to the claimants your fathers creditors and may not be removed from the house  yes she said  and it will be necessary to make an account of everything in the house so if you and miss pinnegar will put your possessions strictly apartbut i shall see miss pinnegar during the course of the day would you ask her to call about seveni think she is free then  alvina sat trembling  i shall pack my things today she said  of course said the lawyer any little things to which you may be attached the claimants would no doubt wish you to regard as your own for anything of greater valueyour piano for examplei should have to make a personal request  oh i dont want anything said alvina  no well you will see you will be here a few days  no said alvina im going away today  today is that also irrevocable  yes i must go this afternoon  on account of your engagement may i ask where your company is performing this week far away  mansfield  oh well then in case i particularly wished to see you you could come over  if necessary said alvina but i dont want to come to woodhouse unless it is necessary cant we write  yescertainly certainlymost things certainly and now  he went into certain technical matters and alvina signed some documents at last she was free to go she had been almost an hour in the room  well goodmorning miss houghton you will hear from me and i from you i wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation you are not leaving woodhouse for ever  goodbye she said and she hurried to the road  try as she might she felt as if she had had a blow which knocked her down she felt she had had a blow  at the lawyers gate she stood a minute there across a little hollow rose the cemetery hill there were her graves her mothers miss frosts her fathers looking she made out the white cross at miss frosts grave the grey stone at her parents then she turned slowly under the church wall back to manchester house  she felt humiliated she felt she did not want to see anybody at all she did not want to see miss pinnegar nor the natchakeetawaras and least of all ciccio she felt strange in woodhouse almost as if the ground had risen from under her feet and hit her over the mouth the fact that manchester house and its very furniture was under seal to be sold on behalf of her fathers creditors made her feel as if all her woodhouse life had suddenly gone smash she loathed the thought of manchester house she loathed staying another minute in it  and yet she did not want to go to the natchakeetawaras either the church clock above her clanged eleven she ought to take the twelveforty train to mansfield yet instead of going home she turned off down the alley towards the fields and the brook  how many times had she gone that road how many times had she seen miss frost bravely striding home that way from her musicpupils how many years had she noticed a particular wild cherrytree come into blossom a particular bit of blackthorn scatter its whiteness in among the pleached twigs of a hawthorn hedge how often how many springs had miss frost come home with a bit of this blackthorn in her hand  alvina did not want to go to mansfield that afternoon she felt insulted she knew she would be much cheaper in madames eyes she knew her own position with the troupe would be humiliating it would be openly a little humiliating but it would be much more maddeningly humiliating to stay in woodhouse and experience the full flavour of woodhouses calculated benevolence she hardly knew which was worse the cool look of insolent halfcontempt halfsatisfaction with which madame would receive the news of her financial downfall or the officious patronage which she would meet from the woodhouse magnates she knew exactly how madames black eyes would shine how her mouth would curl with a sneering slightly triumphant smile as she heard the news and she could hear the bullying tone in which henry wagstaff would dictate the woodhouse benevolence to her she wanted to go away from them allfrom them allfor ever  even from ciccio for she felt he insulted her too subtly they all did it they had regard for her possibilities as an heiress five hundred even two hundred pounds would have made all the difference useless to deny it even to ciccio ciccio would have had a lifelong respect for her if she had come with even so paltry a sum as two hundred pounds now she had nothing he would coolly withhold this respect she felt he might jeer at her and she could not get away from this feeling  mercifully she had the bit of ready money and she had a few trinkets which might be sold nothing else mercifully for the mere moment she was independent  whatever else she did she must go back and pack she must pack her two boxes and leave them ready for she felt that once she had left she could never come back to woodhouse again if england had cliffs all roundwhy when there was nowhere else to go and no getting beyond she could walk over one of the cliffs meanwhile she had her short run before her she banked hard on her independence  so she turned back to the town she would not be able to take the twelveforty train for it was already midday but she was glad she wanted some time to herself she would send ciccio on slowly she climbed the familiar hillslowlyand rather bitterly she felt her native place insulted her and she felt the natchas insulted her in the midst of the insult she remained isolated upon herself and she wished to be alone  she found ciccio waiting at the end of the yard eternally waiting it seemed he was impatient  youve been a long time he said  yes she answered  we shall have to make haste to catch the train  i cant go by this train i shall have to come on later you can just eat a mouthful of lunch and go now  they went indoors miss pinnegar had not yet come down mrs rollings was busily peeling potatoes  mr marasca is going by the train hell have to have a little cold meat said alvina would you mind putting it ready while i go upstairs  sharpses and fullbankses sent them bills said mrs rollings alvina opened them and turned pale it was thirty pounds the total funeral expenses she had completely forgotten them  and mr atterwell wants to know what youd like put on th headstone for your fatherif youd write it down  all right  mrs rollings popped on the potatoes for miss pinnegars dinner and spread the cloth for ciccio when he was eating miss pinnegar came in she inquired for alvinaand went upstairs  have you had your dinner she said for there was alvina sitting writing a letter  im going by a later train said alvina  both of you  no hes going now  miss pinnegar came downstairs again and went through to the scullery when alvina came down she returned to the living room  give this letter to madame alvina said to ciccio i shall be at the hall by seven tonight i shall go straight there  why cant you come now said ciccio  i cant possibly said alvina the lawyer has just told me fathers debts come to much more than everything is worth nothing is oursnot even the plate youre eating from everything is under seal to be sold

gasped miss pinnegar really the house and the furniture and everything got to be sold up then were on the streets i cant believe it  so he told me said alvina  but how positively awful said miss pinnegar sinking motionless into a chair  its not more than i expected said alvina im putting my things into my two trunks and i shall just ask mrs slaney to store them for me then ive the bag i shall travel with  really gasped miss pinnegar i cant believe it and when have we got to get out  oh i dont think theres a desperate hurry theyll take an inventory of all the things and we can live on here till theyre actually ready for the sale  and when will that be  i dont know a week or two  and is the cinematograph to be sold the same  yeseverything the pianoeven mothers portrait  its impossible to believe it said miss pinnegar its impossible he can never have left things so bad  ciccio said alvina youll really have to go if you are to catch the train youll give madame my letter wont you i should hate you to miss the train i know she cant bear me already for all the fuss and upset i cause  ciccio rose slowly wiping his mouth  youll be there at seven oclock he said  at the theatre she replied  and without more ado he left  mrs rollings came in  youve heard said miss pinnegar dramatically  i heard somethink said mrs rollings  sold up everything to be sold up every stick and rag i never thought i should live to see the day said miss pinnegar  you might almost have expected it said mrs rollings but youre all right yourself miss pinnegar your money isnt with his is it  no said miss pinnegar what little i have put by is safe but its not enough to live on its not enough to keep me even supposing i only live another ten years if i only spend a pound a week it costs fiftytwo pounds a year and for ten years look at it its five hundred and twenty pounds and you couldnt say less and i havent half that amount i never had more than a wage you know why miss frost earned a good deal more than i do and she didnt leave much more than fifty wheres the money to come from  but if youve enough to start a little business said alvina  yes its what i shall have to do its what i shall have to do and then what about you what about you  oh dont bother about me said alvina  yes its all very well dont bother but when you come to my age you know youve got to bother and bother a great deal if youre not going to find yourself in a position youd be sorry for you have to bother and youll have to bother before youve done  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof said alvina  ha sufficient for a good many days it seems to me  miss pinnegar was in a real temper to alvina this seemed an odd way of taking it the three women sat down to an uncomfortable dinner of cold meat and hot potatoes and warmedup pudding  but whatever you do pronounced miss pinnegar whatever you do and however you strive in this life youre knocked down in the end youre always knocked down  it doesnt matter said alvina if its only in the end it doesnt matter if youve had your life  youve never had your life till youre dead said miss pinnegar and if you work and strive youve a right to the fruits of your work  it doesnt matter said alvina laconically so long as youve enjoyed working and striving  but miss pinnegar was too angry to be philosophic alvina knew it was useless to be either angry or otherwise emotional none the less she also felt as if she had been knocked down and she almost envied poor miss pinnegar the prospect of a little daybyday haberdashery shop in tamworth her own problem seemed so much more menacing answer or die said the sphinx of fate miss pinnegar could answer her own fate according to its question she could say haberdashery shop and her sphinx would recognize this answer as true to nature and would be satisfied but every individual has his own or her own fate and her own sphinx alvinas sphinx was an old deep thoroughbred she would take no mongrel answers and her thoroughbred teeth were long and sharp to alvina the last of the fantastic but purebred race of houghton the problem of her fate was terribly abstruse  the only thing to do was not to solve it to stray on and answer fate with whatever came into ones head no good striving with fate trust to a lucky shot or take the consequences  miss pinnegar said alvina have we any money in hand  there is about twenty pounds in the bank its all shown in my books said miss pinnegar  we couldnt take it could we  every penny shows in the books  alvina pondered again  are there more bills to come in she asked i mean my bills do i owe anything  i dont think you do said miss pinnegar  im going to keep the insurance money any way they can say what they like ive got it and im going to keep it  well said miss pinnegar its not my business but theres sharps and fullbanks to pay  ill pay those said alvina you tell atterwell what to put on fathers stone how much does it cost  five shillings a letter you remember  well well just put the name and the date how much will that be james houghton born 17th january  youll have to put also of said miss pinnegar  also of said alvina onetwothreefourfivesix six lettersthirty shillings seems an awful lot for also of  but you cant leave it out said miss pinnegar you cant economize over that  i begrudge it said alvina     chapter xi  honourable engagement   for days after joining the natchakeetawaras alvina was very quiet subdued and rather remote sensible of her humiliating position as a hangeron they none of them took much notice of her they drifted on rather disjointedly the cordiality the joie de vivre did not revive madame was a little irritable and very exacting and inclined to be spiteful ciccio went his way with geoffrey  in the second week madame found out that a man had been surreptitiously inquiring about them at their lodgings from the landlady and the landladys blowsy daughter it must have been a detectivesome shoddy detective madame waited then she sent max over to mansfield on some fictitious errand yes the lousylooking dogs of detectives had been there too making the most minute enquiries as to the behaviour of the natchakeetawaras what they did how their sleeping was arranged how madame addressed the men what attitude the men took towards alvina  madame waited again and again when they moved to doncaster the same two mongrellooking fellows were lurking in the street and plying the inmates of their lodginghouse with questions all the natchas caught sight of the men and madame cleverly wormed out of the righteous and respectable landlady what the men had asked once more it was about the sleeping accommodationwhether the landlady heard anything in the nightwhether she noticed anything in the bedrooms in the beds  no doubt about it the natchakeetawaras were under suspicion they were being followed and watched what for madame made a shrewd guess they want to say we are immoral foreigners she said  but what have our personal morals got to do with them said max angrily  yesbut the english they are so pure said madame  you know said louis somebody must have put them up to it  perhaps said madame somebody on account of allaye  alvina went white  yes said geoffrey white slave traffic mr may said it  madame slowly nodded  mr may she said mr may it is he he knows all about moralsand immorals yes i know yesyesyes he suspects all our immoral doings mes braves  but there arent any except mine cried alvina pale to the lips  you you there you are madame smiled archly and rather mockingly  what are we to do said max pale on the cheekbones  curse them curse them louis was muttering in his rolling accent  wait said madame wait they will not do anything to us you are only dirty foreigners mes braves at the most they will ask us only to leave their pure country  we dont interfere with none of them cried max  curse them muttered louis  never mind mon cher you are in a pure country let us wait  if you think its me said alvina i can go away  oh my dear you are only the excuse said madame smiling indulgently at her let us wait and see  she took it smilingly but her cheeks were white as paper and her eyes black as drops of ink with anger  wait and see she chanted ironically wait and see if we must leave the dear countrythen adieu and she gravely bowed to an imaginary england  i feel its my fault i feel i ought to go away cried alvina who was terribly distressed seeing madames glitter and pallor and the black brows of the men never had ciccios brow looked so ominously black and alvina felt it was all her fault never had she experienced such a horrible feeling as if something repulsive were creeping on her from behind every minute of these weeks was a horror to her the sense of the lowdown dogs of detectives hanging round sliding behind them trying to get hold of some clear proof of immorality on their part and thenthe unknown vengeance of the authorities all the repulsive secrecy and all the absolute power of the police authorities the sense of a great malevolent power which had them all the time in its grip and was watching feeling waiting to strike the morbid blow the sense of the utter helplessness of individuals who were not even accused only watched and enmeshed the feeling that they the natchakeetawaras herself included must be monsters of hideous vice to have provoked all this and yet the sane knowledge that they none of them were monsters of vice this was quite killing the sight of a policeman would send up alvinas heart in a flame of fear agony yet she knew she had nothing legally to be afraid of every knock at the door was horrible  she simply could not understand it yet there it was they were watched followed of that there was no question and all she could imagine was that the troupe was secretly accused of white slave traffic by somebody in woodhouse probably mr may had gone the round of the benevolent magnates of woodhouse concerning himself with her virtue and currying favour with his concern of this she became convinced that it was concern for her virtue which had started the whole business and that the first instigator was mr may who had got round some vulgar magistrate or county councillor  madame did not consider alvinas view very seriously she thought it was some personal malevolence against the tawaras themselves probably put up by some other professionals with whom madame was not popular  be that as it may for some weeks they went about in the shadow of this repulsive finger which was following after them to touch them and destroy them with the black smear of shame the men were silent and inclined to be sulky they seemed to hold together they seemed to be united into a strong foursquare silence and tension they kept to themselvesand alvina kept to herselfand madame kept to herself so they went about  and slowly the cloud melted it never broke alvina felt that the very force of the sullen silent fearlessness and fury in the tawaras had prevented its bursting once there had been a weakening a cringing they would all have been lost but their hearts hardened with black indomitable anger and the cloud melted it passed away there was no sign  early summer was now at hand alvina no longer felt at home with the natchas while the trouble was hanging over they seemed to ignore her altogether the men hardly spoke to her they hardly spoke to madame for that matter they kept within the foursquare enclosure of themselves  but alvina felt herself particularly excluded left out and when the trouble of the detectives began to pass off and the men became more cheerful again wanted her to jest and be familiar with them she responded verbally but in her heart there was no response  madame had been quite generous with her she allowed her to pay for her room and the expense of travelling but she had her food with the rest wherever she was madame bought the food for the party and cooked it herself and alvina came in with the rest she paid no board  she waited however for madame to suggest a small salaryor at least that the troupe should pay her living expenses but madame did not make such a suggestion so alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted and she guarded her money and watched for some other opportunity  it became her habit to go every morning to the public library of the town in which she found herself to look through the advertisements advertisements for maternity nurses for nursery governesses pianists travelling companions even ladies maids for some weeks she found nothing though she wrote several letters  one morning ciccio who had begun to hang round her again accompanied her as she set out to the library but her heart was closed against him  why are you going to the library he asked her it was in lancaster  to look at the papers and magazines  haa to find a job eh  his cuteness startled her for a moment  if i found one i should take it she said  hé i know that he said  it so happened that that very morning she saw on the noticeboard of the library an announcement that the borough council wished to engage the services of an experienced maternity nurse applications to be made to the medical board alvina wrote down the directions ciccio watched her  what is a maternity nurse he said  an accoucheuse she said the nurse who attends when babies are born  do you know how to do that he said incredulous and jeering slightly  i was trained to do it she said  he said no more but walked by her side as she returned to the lodgings as they drew near the lodgings he said  you dont want to stop with us any more  i cant she said  he made a slight mocking gesture  i cant he repeated why do you always say you cant  because i cant she said  pff he went with a whistling sound of contempt  but she went indoors to her room fortunately when she had finally cleared her things from manchester house she had brought with her her nurses certificate and recommendations from doctors she wrote out her application took the tram to the town hall and dropped it in the letterbox there then she wired home to her doctor for another reference after which she went to the library and got out a book on her subject if summoned she would have to go before the medical board on monday she had a week she read and pondered hard recalling all her previous experience and knowledge  she wondered if she ought to appear before the board in uniform her nurses dresses were packed in her trunk at mrs slaneys in woodhouse it was now may the whole business at woodhouse was finished manchester house and all the furniture was sold to some bootandshoe people at least the bootandshoe people had the house they had given four thousand pounds for itwhich was above the lawyers estimate on the other hand the theatre was sold for almost nothing it all worked out that some thirtythree pounds which the creditors made up to fifty pounds remained for alvina she insisted on miss pinnegars having half of this and so that was all over miss pinnegar was already in tamworth and her little shop would be opened next week she wrote happily and excitedly about it  sometimes fate acts swiftly and without a hitch on thursday alvina received her notice that she was to appear before the board on the following monday and yet she could not bring herself to speak of it to madame till the saturday evening when they were all at supper she said  madame i applied for a post of maternity nurse to the borough of lancaster  madame raised her eyebrows ciccio had said nothing  oh really you never told me  i thought it would be no use if it all came to nothing they want me to go and see them on monday and then they will decide  really do they on monday and then if you get this work you will stay here yes  yes of course  of course of course yes hm and if not  the two women looked at each other  what said alvina  if you dont get it you are not sure  no said alvina i am not a bit sure  well then now and if you dont get it  what shall i do you mean  yes what shall you do  i dont know  how you dont know shall you come back to us then  i will if you like  if i like if i like come it is not a question of if i like it is what do you want to do yourself  i feel you dont want me very badly said alvina  why why do you feel who makes you which of us makes you feel so tell me  nobody in particular but i feel it  oh weell if nobody makes you and yet you feel it it must be in yourself dont you see eh isnt it so  perhaps it is admitted alvina  weell then weell so madame gave her her congé but if you like to come backif you laikethen madame shrugged her shouldersyou must come i suppose  thank you said alvina  the young men were watching they seemed indifferent ciccio turned aside with his faint stupid smile  in the morning madame gave alvina all her belongings from the little safe she called her bank  there is the moneysoand soand sothat is correct please count it once more alvina counted it and kept it clutched in her hand and there are your rings and your chain and your locketseealleverything but not the brooch where is the brooch here shall i give it back hein  i gave it to you said alvina offended she looked into madames black eyes madame dropped her eyes  yes you gave it but i thought you see as you have now not much mooney perhaps you would like to take it again  no thank you said alvina and she went away leaving madame with the red brooch in her plump hand  thank goodness ive given her something valuable thought alvina to herself as she went trembling to her room  she had packed her bag she had to find new rooms she bade goodbye to the natchakeetawaras her face was cold and distant but she smiled slightly as she bade them goodbye  and perhaps said madame perhaps you will come to wigan tomorrow afternoonor evening yes  thank you said alvina  she went out and found a little hotel where she took her room for the night explaining the cause of her visit to lancaster her heart was hard and burning a deep burning silent anger against everything possessed her and a profound indifference to mankind  and therefore the next day everything went as if by magic she had decided that at the least sign of indifference from the medical board people she would walk away take her bag and go to windermere she had never been to the lakes and windermere was not far off she would not endure one single hint of contumely from any one else she would go straight to windermere to see the big lake why not do as she wished she could be quite happy by herself among the lakes and she would be absolutely free absolutely free she rather looked forward to leaving the town hall hurrying to take her bag and off to the station and freedom hadnt she still got about a hundred pounds why bother for one moment to be quite alone in the whole worldand quite quite free with her hundred poundsthe prospect attracted her sincerely  and therefore everything went charmingly at the town hall the medical board were charming to hercharming there was no hesitation at all from the first moment she was engaged and she was given a pleasant room in a hospital in a garden and the matron was charming to her and the doctors most courteous  when could she undertake to commence her duties when did they want her the very moment she could come she could begin tomorrowbut she had no uniform oh the matron would lend her uniform and aprons till her box arrived  so there she wasby afternoon installed in her pleasant little room looking on the garden and dressed in a nurses uniform it was all sudden like magic she had wired to madame she had wired for her box she was another person  needless to say she was glad needless to say that in the morning when she had thoroughly bathed and dressed in clean clothes and put on the white dress the white apron and the white cap she felt another person so clean she felt so thankful her skin seemed caressed and live with cleanliness and whiteness luminous she felt it was so different from being with the natchas  in the garden the snowballs guelderroses swayed softly among green foliage there was pink mayblossom and single scarlet mayblossom and underneath the young green of the trees irises rearing purple and mothwhite a young gardener was workingand a convalescent slowly trailed a few paces  having ten minutes still alvina sat down and wrote to ciccio i am glad i have got this post as nurse here every one is most kind and i feel at home already i feel quite happy here i shall think of my days with the natchakeetawaras and of you who were such a stranger to me goodbyea h  this she addressed and posted no doubt madame would find occasion to read it but let her  alvina now settled down to her new work there was of course a great deal to do for she had work both in the hospital and out in the town though chiefly out in the town she went rapidly from case to case as she was summoned and she was summoned at all hours so that it was tiring work which left her no time to herself except just in snatches  she had no serious acquaintance with anybody she was too busy the matron and sisters and doctors and patients were all part of her days work and she regarded them as such the men she chiefly ignored she felt much more friendly with the matron she had many a cup of tea and many a chat in the matrons room in the quiet sunny afternoons when the work was not pressing alvina took her quiet moments when she could for she never knew when she would be rung up by one or other of the doctors in the town  and so from the matron she learned to crochet it was work she had never taken to but now she had her ball of cotton and her hook and she worked away as she chatted she was in good health and she was getting fatter again with the natchakeetawaras she had improved a good deal her colour and her strength had returned but undoubtedly the nursing life arduous as it was suited her best she became a handsome reposeful woman jolly with the other nurses really happy with her friend the matron who was wellbred and wise and never overintimate  the doctor with whom alvina had most to do was a dr mitchell a scotchman he had a large practice among the poor and was an energetic man he was about fiftyfour years old tall largelybuilt with a good figure but with extraordinarily large feet and hands his face was red and cleanshaven his eyes blue his teeth very good he laughed and talked rather mouthingly alvina who knew what the nurses told her knew that he had come as a poor boy and bottlewasher to dr robertson a fellowscotchman and that he had made his way up gradually till he became a doctor himself and had an independent practice now he was quite richand a bachelor but the nurses did not set their bonnets at him very much because he was rather mouthy and overbearing  in the houses of the poor he was a great autocrat  what is that stuff youve got there he inquired largely seeing a bottle of somebodys soothing syrup by a poor womans bedside take it and throw it down the sink and the next time you want a soothing syrup put a little bootblacking in hot water itll do you just as much good  imagine the slow pompous largemouthed way in which the redfaced handsomelybuilt man pronounced these words and you realize why the poor set such store by him  he was eagleeyed wherever he went there was a scuffle directly his foot was heard on the stairs and he knew they were hiding something he sniffed the air he glanced round with a sharp eye and during the course of his visit picked up a blue mug which was pushed behind the lookingglass he peered insideand smelled it  stout he said in a tone of indignant inquiry godalmighty would presumably take on just such a tone finding the core of an apple flung away among the deadnettle of paradise stout have you been drinking stout this as he gazed down on the wan mother in the bed  they gave me a drop doctor i felt that low  the doctor marched out of the room still holding the mug in his hand the sick woman watched him with haunted eyes the attendant women threw up their hands and looked at one another was he going for ever there came a sudden smash the doctor had flung the blue mug downstairs he returned with a solemn stride  there he said and the next person that gives you stout will be thrown down along with the mug  oh doctor the bit o comfort wailed the sick woman it ud never do me no harm  harm harm with a stomach as weak as yours harm do you know better than i do what have i come here for to be told by you what will do you harm and what wont it appears to me you need no doctor here you know everything already  oh no doctor its not like that but when you feel as if youd sink through the bed an you dont know what to do with yourself  take a little beeftea or a little rice pudding take nourishment dont take that muck do you hear charging upon the attendant women who shrank against the wallshes to have nothing alcoholic at all and dont let me catch you giving it her  they say theres nobbut fower per cent i stout retorted the daring female  fower per cent mimicked the doctor brutally why what does an ignorant creature like you know about fower per cent  the woman muttered a little under her breath  what speak out let me hear what youve got to say my woman ive no doubt its something for my benefit  but the affronted woman rushed out of the room and burst into tears on the landing after which dr mitchell mollified largely told the patient how she was to behave concluding  nourishment nourishment is what you want nonsense dont tell me you cant take it push it down if it wont go down by itself  oh doctor  dont say oh doctor to me do as i tell you thats your business after which he marched out and the rattle of his motor car was shortly heard  alvina got used to scenes like these she wondered why the people stood it but soon she realized that they loved itparticularly the women  oh nurse stop till dr mitchells been im scared to death of him for fear hes going to shout at me  why does everybody put up with him asked innocent alvina  oh hes goodhearted nurse he does feel for you  and everywhere it was the same oh hes got a heart you know hes rough but hes got a heart id rather have him than your smarmy slormin sort oh you feel safe with dr mitchell i dont care what you say  but to alvina this peculiar form of blustering bullying heart which had all the women scurrying like chickens was not particularly attractive  the men did not like dr mitchell and would not have him if possible yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor they had to submit the first thing he said to a sick or injured labourer invariably was  and keep off the beer  oh ay  keep off the beer or i shant set foot in this house again  thas got a red enough face on thee tha nedna shout  my face is red with exposure to all weathers attending ignorant people like you i never touch alcohol in any form  no an i dunna i drink a drop o beer if thats what you ca touchin alcohol an im none th wuss for it tha sees  youve heard what ive told you  ah i have  and if you go on with the beer you may go on with curing yourself i shant attend you you know i mean what i say mrs larrickthis to the wife  i do doctor and i know its true what you say an im at him night an day about it  oh well if he will hear no reason he must suffer for it he mustnt think im going to be running after him if he disobeys my orders and the doctor stalked off and the woman began to complain  none the less the women had their complaints against dr mitchell if ever alvina entered a clean house on a wet day she was sure to hear the housewife chuntering  oh my lawk come in nurse what a day doctors not been yet and hes bound to come now ive just cleaned up trapesin wi his gret feet hes got the biggest understandins of any man i lancaster my husband says theyre the best pair o pasties i th kingdom an he does make such a mess for he never stops to wipe his feet on th mat marches straight up your clean stairs  why dont you tell him to wipe his feet said alvina  oh my word fancy me telling him hed jump down my throat with both feet afore id opened my mouth hes not to be spoken to he isnt hes mylord he is you mustnt look or youre done for  alvina laughed she knew they all liked him for browbeating them and having a heart over and above  sometimes he was given a good hitthough nearly always by a man it happened he was in a workmans house when the man was at dinner  canna yer gie a man summat better nor this ere pap missis said the hairy husband turning up his nose at the rice pudding  oh go on cried the wife i hadna time for owt else dr mitchell was just stooping his handsome figure in the doorway  rice pudding he exclaimed largely you couldnt have anything more wholesome and nourishing i have a rice pudding every day of my lifeevery day of my life i do  the man was eating his pudding and pearling his big moustache copiously with it he did not answer  do you doctor cried the woman and never no different  never said the doctor  fancy that youre that fond of them  i find they agree with me they are light and digestible and my stomach is as weak as a babys  the labourer wiped his big moustache on his sleeve  mine isna tha sees he said so paps no use s watter ter me i want ter feel as ive had summat a bit o suetty dumplin an a pint o hale summat ter fill th hole up an thad be th same if tha did my work  if i did your work sneered the doctor why i do ten times the work that any one of you does its just the work that has ruined my digestion the never getting a quiet meal and never a whole nights rest when do you think i can sit at table and digest my dinner i have to be off looking after people like you  eh tha can tae th tittybottle wi thee said the labourer  but dr mitchell was furious for weeks over this it put him in a black rage to have his great manliness insulted alvina was quietly amused  the doctor began by being rather lordly and condescending with her but luckily she felt she knew her work at least as well as he knew it she smiled and let him condescend certainly she neither feared nor even admired him to tell the truth she rather disliked him the great redfaced bachelor of fiftythree with his bald spot and his stomach as weak as a babys and his mouthing imperiousness and his good heart which was as selfish as it could be nothing can be more cocksuredly selfish than a good heart which believes in its own beneficence he was a little too much the teetotaller on the one hand to be so largely manly on the other alvina preferred the labourers with their awful long moustaches that got full of food and he was a little too loudmouthedly lordly to be in human good taste  as a matter of fact he was conscious of the fact that he had risen to be a gentleman now if a man is conscious of being a gentleman he is bound to be a little less than a man but if he is gnawed with anxiety lest he may not be a gentleman he is only pitiable there is a third case however if a man must loftily by his manner assert that he is now a gentleman he shows himself a clown for alvina poor dr mitchell fell into this third category of clowns she tolerated him goodhumouredly as women so often tolerate ninnies and poseurs she smiled to herself when she saw his large and important presence on the board she smiled when she saw him at a sale buying the grandest pieces of antique furniture she smiled when he talked of going up to scotland for grouse shooting or of snatching an hour on sunday morning for golf and she talked him over with quiet delicate malice with the matron he was no favourite at the hospital  gradually dr mitchells manner changed towards her from his imperious condescension he took to a tone of uneasy equality this did not suit him dr mitchell had no equals he had only the vast stratum of inferiors towards whom he exercised his quite profitable beneficenceit brought him in about two thousand a year and then his superiors people who had been born with money it was the tradesmen and professionals who had started at the bottom and clambered to the motorcar footing who distressed him and therefore whilst he treated alvina on this uneasy tradesman footing he felt himself in a false position  she kept her attitude of quiet amusement and little by little he sank from being a lofty creature soaring over her head he was now like a big fish poking its nose above water and making eyes at her he treated her with rather presuming deference  you look tired this morning he barked at her one hot day  i think its thunder she said  thunder work you mean and he gave a slight smile im going to drive you back  oh no thanks dont trouble ive got to call on the way  where have you got to call  she told him  very well that takes you no more than five minutes ill wait for you now take your cloak  she was surprised yet like other women she submitted  as they drove he saw a man with a barrow of cucumbers he stopped the car and leaned towards the man  take that barrowload of poison and bury it he shouted in his strong voice the busy street hesitated  whats that mister replied the mystified hawker  dr mitchell pointed to the green pile of cucumbers  take that barrowload of poison and bury it he called before you do anybody any more harm with it  what barrowload of poisons that asked the hawker approaching a crowd began to gather  what barrowload of poison is that repeated the doctor why your barrowload of cucumbers  oh said the man scrutinizing his cucumbers carefully to be sure some were a little yellow at the end hows that cumbers is right enough fresh from market this morning  fresh or not fresh said the doctor mouthing his words distinctly you might as well put poison into your stomach as those things cucumbers are the worst thing you can eat  oh said the man stuttering thats appen for them as doesnt like them i niver knowed a cumber do me no harm an i eat em like a happle whereupon the hawker took a cumber from his barrow bit off the end and chewed it till the sap squirted whats wrong with that he said holding up the bitten cucumber  im not talking about whats wrong with that said the doctor my business is whats wrong with the stomach it goes into im a doctor and i know that those things cause me half my work they cause half the internal troubles people suffer from in summertime  oh ay thats no loss to you is it me an yous partners more cumbers i sell more graft for you cordin to that whats wrong then cumbers fine fresh cumberrrs all fresh and juisty all cheap and tasty yelled the man  i am a doctor not only to cure illness but to prevent it where i can and cucumbers are poison to everybody  cumbers cumbers fresh cumbers yelled the man  dr mitchell started his car  when will they learn intelligence he said to alvina smiling and showing his white even teeth  i dont care you know myself she said i should always let people do what they wanted  even if you knew it would do them harm he queried smiling with amiable condescension  yes why not its their own affair and theyll do themselves harm one way or another  and you wouldnt try to prevent it  you might as well try to stop the sea with your fingers  you think so smiled the doctor i see you are a pessimist you are a pessimist with regard to human nature  am i smiled alvina thinking the rose would smell as sweet it seemed to please the doctor to find that alvina was a pessimist with regard to human nature it seemed to give her an air of distinction in his eyes she seemed distinguished he was in a fair way to dote on her  she of course when he began to admire her liked him much better and even saw graceful boyish attractions in him there was really something childish about him and this something childish since it looked up to her as if she were the saving grace naturally flattered her and made her feel gentler towards him  he got in the habit of picking her up in his car when he could and he would tap at the matrons door smiling and showing all his beautiful teeth just about teatime  may i come in his voice sounded almost flirty  certainly  i see youre having tea very nice a cup of tea at this hour  have one too doctor  i will with pleasure and he sat down wreathed with smiles alvina rose to get a cup i didnt intend to disturb you nurse he said men are always intruders he smiled to the matron  sometimes said the matron women are charmed to be intruded upon  oh really his eyes sparkled perhaps you wouldnt say so nurse he said turning to alvina alvina was just reaching at the cupboard very charming she looked in her fresh dress and cap and soft brown hair very attractive her figure with its full soft loins she turned round to him  oh yes she said i quite agree with the matron  oh you do he did not quite know how to take it but you mind being disturbed at your tea i am sure  no said alvina we are so used to being disturbed  rather weak doctor said the matron pouring the tea  very weak please  the doctor was a little laboured in his gallantry but unmistakably gallant when he was gone the matron looked demure and alvina confused each waited for the other to speak  dont you think dr mitchell is quite coming out said alvina  quite quite the ladies man i wonder who it is can be bringing him out a very praiseworthy work i am sure she looked wickedly at alvina  no dont look at me laughed alvina i know nothing about it  do you think it may be me said the matron mischievous  im sure of it matron he begins to show some taste at last  there now said the matron i shall put my cap straight and she went to the mirror fluffing her hair and settling her cap  there she said bobbing a little curtsey to alvina  they both laughed and went off to work  but there was no mistake dr mitchell was beginning to expand with alvina he quite unbent and seemed even to sun himself when she was near to attract her attention he smiled and smirked and became oddly selfconscious rather uncomfortable he liked to hang over her chair and he made a great event of offering her a cigarette whenever they met although he himself never smoked he had a gold cigarette case  one day he asked her in to see his garden he had a pleasant old square house with a big walled garden he showed her his flowers and his wallfruit and asked her to eat his strawberries he bade her admire his asparagus and then he gave her tea in the drawingroom with strawberries and cream and cakes of all of which he ate nothing but he smiled expansively all the time he was a made man and now he was really letting himself go luxuriating in everything above all in alvina who poured tea gracefully from the old georgian teapot and smiled so pleasantly above the queen anne teacups  and she wicked that she was admired every detail of his drawingroom it was a pleasant room indeed with roses outside the french door and a lawn in sunshine beyond with bright red flowers in beds but indoors it was insistently antique alvina admired the jacobean sideboard and the jacobean armchairs and the hepplewhite wallchairs and the sheraton settee and the chippendale stands and the axminster carpet and the bronze clock with shakespeare and ariosto reclining on ityes she even admired shakespeare on the clockand the ormolu cabinet and the beadwork footstools and the dreadful sèvres dish with a cherub in it andbut why enumerate she admired everything and dr mitchells heart expanded in his bosom till he felt it would burst unless he either fell at her feet or did something extraordinary he had never even imagined what it was to be so expanded what a delicious feeling he could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion but habit so far prevented his doing more than beam  another day he said to her when they were talking of age  you are as young as you feel why when i was twenty i felt i had all the cares and responsibility of the world on my shoulders and now i am middleaged more or less i feel as light as if i were just beginning life he beamed down at her  perhaps you are only just beginning your own life she said you have lived for your work till now  it may be that he said it may be that up till now i have lived for others for my patients and now perhaps i may be allowed to live a little more for myself he beamed with real luxury saw the real luxury of life begin  why shouldnt you said alvina  oh yes i intend to he said with confidence  he really by degrees made up his mind to marry now and to retire in part from his work that is he would hire another assistant and give himself a fair amount of leisure he was inordinately proud of his house and now he looked forward to the treat of his life hanging round the woman he had made his wife following her about feeling proud of her and his house talking to her from morning till night really finding himself in her when he had to go his rounds she would go with him in the car he made up his mind she would be willing to accompany him he would teach her to drive and they would sit side by side she driving him and waiting for him and he would run out of the houses of his patients and find her sitting there and he would get in beside her and feel so snug and so sure and so happy as she drove him off to the next case he informing her about his work  and if ever she did not go out with him she would be there on the doorstep waiting for him the moment she heard the car and they would have long cosy evenings together in the drawingroom as he luxuriated in her very presence she would sit on his knees and they would be snug for hours before they went warmly and deliciously to bed and in the morning he need not rush off he would loiter about with her they would loiter down the garden looking at every new flower and every new fruit she would wear fresh flowery dresses and no cap on her hair he would never be able to tear himself away from her every morning it would be unbearable to have to tear himself away from her and every hour he would be rushing back to her they would be simply everything to one another and how he would enjoy it ah  he pondered as to whether he would have children a child would take her away from him that was his first thought but then ah well he would have to leave it till the time loves young dream is never so delicious as at the virgin age of fiftythree  but he was quite cautious he made no definite advances till he had put a plain question it was august bank holiday that for ever black day of the declaration of war when his question was put for this year of our story is the fatal year 1914  there was quite a stir in the town over the declaration of war but most people felt that the news was only intended to give an extra thrill to the allimportant event of bank holiday half the world had gone to blackpool or southport the other half had gone to the lakes or into the country lancaster was busy with a sort of fête notwithstanding and as the weather was decent everybody was in a real holiday mood  so that dr mitchell who had contrived to pick up alvina at the hospital contrived to bring her to his house at halfpast three for tea  what do you think of this new war said alvina  oh it will be over in six weeks said the doctor easily and there they left it only with a fleeting thought alvina wondered if it would affect the natchakeetawaras she had never heard any more of them  where would you have liked to go today said the doctor turning to smile at her as he drove the car  i think to windermereinto the lakes she said  we might make a tour of the lakes before long he said she was not thinking so she took no particular notice of the speech  how nice she said vaguely  we could go in the car and take them as we chose said the doctor  yes she said wondering at him now  when they had had tea quietly and gallantly têteàtête in his drawingroom he asked her if she would like to see the other rooms of the house she thanked him and he showed her the substantial oak diningroom and the little room with medical works and a revolving chair which he called his study then the kitchen and the pantry the housekeeper looking askance then upstairs to his bedroom which was very fine with old mahogany tallboys and silver candlesticks on the dressingtable and brushes with green ivory backs and a hygienic white bed and straw mats then the visitors bedroom corresponding with its old satinwood furniture and creamcoloured chairs with large paleblue cushions and a pale carpet with reddish wreaths very nice lovely awfully nice i do like that isnt that beautiful ive never seen anything like that came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from alvina and he smiled and gloated but in her mind she was thinking of manchester house and how dark and horrible it was how she hated it but how it had impressed ciccio and geoffrey how they would have loved to feel themselves masters of it and how done in the eye they were she smiled to herself rather grimly for this afternoon she was feeling unaccountably uneasy and wistful yearning into the distance again a trick she thought she had happily lost  the doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics he was a big man and he always wore navy blue suits welltailored and immaculate unconsciously she felt that big men in good navyblue suits especially if they had reddish faces and rather big feet and if their hair was wearing thin were a special type all to themselves solid and rather nambypamby and tiresome  what very nice attics i think the many angles which the roof makes the different slants you know are so attractive oh and the fascinating little window she crouched in the hollow of the small dormer window fascinating see the town and the hills i know i should want this room for my own  then have it he said have it for one of your own  she crept out of the window recess and looked up at him he was leaning forward to her smiling selfconscious tentative and eager she thought it best to laugh it off  i was only talking like a child from the imagination she said  i quite understand that he replied deliberately but i am speaking what i mean  she did not answer but looked at him reproachfully he was smiling and smirking broadly at her  wont you marry me and come and have this garret for your own he spoke as if he were offering her a chocolate he smiled with curious uncertainty  i dont know she said vaguely  his smile broadened  well now he said make up your mind im not good at talking about love you know but i think im pretty good at feeling it you know i want you to come here and be happy with me he added the two last words as a sort of sly postscriptum and as if to commit himself finally  but ive never thought about it she said rapidly cogitating  i know you havent but think about it now he began to be hugely pleased with himself think about it now and tell me if you could put up with me as well as the garret he beamed and put his head a little on one siderather like mr may for one second but he was much more dangerous than mr may he was overbearing and had the devils own temper if he was thwarted this she knew he was a big man in a navy blue suit with very white teeth  again she thought she had better laugh it off  its you i am thinking about she laughed flirting still its you i am wondering about  well he said rather pleased with himself you wonder about me till youve made up your mind  i will she said seizing the opportunity ill wonder about you till ive made up my mindshall i  yes he said thats what i wish you to do and the next time i ask you youll let me know thats it isnt it he smiled indulgently down on her thought her face young and charming charming  yes she said but dont ask me too soon will you  how too soon he smiled delightedly  youll give me time to wonder about you wont you you wont ask me again this month will you  this month his eyes beamed with pleasure he enjoyed the procrastination as much as she did but the months only just begun however yes you shall have your way i wont ask you again this month  and ill promise to wonder about you all the month she laughed  thats a bargain he said  they went downstairs and alvina returned to her duties she was very much excited very much excited indeed a big welltodo man in a navy blue suit of handsome appearance aged fiftythree with white teeth and a delicate stomach it was exciting a sure position a very nice home and lovely things in it once they were dragged about a bit and of course hed adore her that went without saying she was as fussy as if some one had given her a lovely new pair of boots she was really fussy and pleased with herself and quite decided shed take it all on that was how it put itself to her she would take it all on  of course there was the man himself to consider but he was quite presentable there was nothing at all against it nothing at all if he had pressed her during the first half of the month of august he would almost certainly have got her but he only beamed in anticipation  meanwhile the stir and restlessness of the war had begun and was making itself felt even in lancaster and the excitement and the unease began to wear through alvinas rather glamorous fussiness some of her old fretfulness came back on her her spirit which had been as if asleep these months now woke rather irritably and chafed against its collar who was this elderly man that she should marry him who was he that she should be kissed by him actually kissed and fondled by him repulsive she avoided him like the plague fancy reposing against his broad navy blue waistcoat she started as if she had been stung fancy seeing his red smiling face just above hers coming down to embrace her she pushed it away with her open hand and she ran away to avoid the thought  and yet and yet she would be so comfortable she would be so welloff for the rest of her life the hateful problem of material circumstance would be solved for ever and she knew well how hateful material circumstances can make life  therefore she could not decide in a hurry but she bore poor dr mitchell a deep grudge that he could not grant her all the advantages of his offer and excuse her the acceptance of him himself she dared not decide in a hurry and this very fear like a yoke on her made her resent the man who drove her to decision  sometimes she rebelled sometimes she laughed unpleasantly in the mans face though she dared not go too far for she was a little afraid of him and his rabid temper also in her moments of sullen rebellion she thought of natchakeetawara she thought of them deeply she wondered where they were what they were doing how the war had affected them poor geoffrey was a frenchmanhe would have to go to france to fight max and louis were swiss it would not affect them nor ciccio who was italian she wondered if the troupe was in england if they would continue together when geoffrey was gone she wondered if they thought of her she felt they did she felt they did not forget her she felt there was a connection  in fact during the latter part of august she wondered a good deal more about the natchas than about dr mitchell but wondering about the natchas would not help her she felt if she knew where they were she would fly to them but then she knew she wouldnt  when she was at the station she saw crowds and bustle people were seeing their young men off beer was flowing sailors on the train were tipsy women were holding young men by the lapel of the coat and when the train drew away the young men waving the women cried aloud and sobbed after them  a chill ran down alvinas spine this was another matter apart from her dr mitchell it made him feel very unreal trivial she did not know what she was going to do she realized she must do somethingtake some part in the wild dislocation of life she knew that she would put off dr mitchell again  she talked the matter over with the matron the matron advised her to procrastinate why not volunteer for warservice true she was a maternity nurse and this was hardly the qualification needed for the nursing of soldiers but still she was a nurse  alvina felt this was the thing to do everywhere was a stir and a seethe of excitement men were active women were needed too she put down her name on the list of volunteers for active service this was on the last day of august  on the first of september dr mitchell was round at the hospital early when alvina was just beginning her morning duties there he went into the matrons room and asked for nurse houghton the matron left them together  the doctor was excited he smiled broadly but with a tension of nervous excitement alvina was troubled her heart beat fast  now said dr mitchell what have you to say to me  she looked up at him with confused eyes he smiled excitedly and meaningful at her and came a little nearer  today is the day when you answer isnt it he said now then let me hear what you have to say  but she only watched him with large troubled eyes and did not speak he came still nearer to her  well then he said i am to take it that silence gives consent and he laughed nervously with nervous anticipation as he tried to put his arm round her but she stepped suddenly back  no not yet she said  why he asked  i havent given my answer she said  give it then he said testily  ive volunteered for active service she stammered i felt i ought to do something  why he asked he could put a nasty intonation into that monosyllable i should have thought you would answer me first  she did not answer but watched him she did not like him  i only signed yesterday she said  why didnt you leave it till tomorrow it would have looked better he was angry but he saw a halffrightened halfguilty look on her face and during the weeks of anticipation he had worked himself up  but put that aside he smiled again a little dangerously you have still to answer my question having volunteered for war service doesnt prevent your being engaged to me does it  alvina watched him with large eyes and again he came very near to her so that his blueserge waistcoat seemed to impinge on her and his purplish red face was above her  id rather not be engaged under the circumstances she said  why came the nasty monosyllable what have the circumstances got to do with it  everything is so uncertain she said id rather wait  wait havent you waited long enough theres nothing at all to prevent your getting engaged to me now nothing whatsoever come now im old enough not to be played with and im much too much in love with you to let you go on indefinitely like this come now he smiled imminent and held out his large hand for her hand let me put the ring on your finger it will be the proudest day of my life when i make you my wife give me your hand  alvina was wavering for one thing mere curiosity made her want to see the ring she half lifted her hand and but for the knowledge that he would kiss her she would have given it but he would kiss herand against that she obstinately set her will she put her hand behind her back and looked obstinately into his eyes  dont play a game with me he said dangerously  but she only continued to look mockingly and obstinately into his eyes  come he said beckoning for her to give her hand  with a barely perceptible shake of the head she refused staring at him all the time his ungovernable temper got the better of him he saw red and without knowing seized her by the shoulder swung her back and thrust her pressed her against the wall as if he would push her through it his face was blind with anger like a hot red sun suddenly almost instantaneously he came to himself again and drew back his hands shaking his right hand as if some rat had bitten it  im sorry he shouted beside himself im sorry i didnt mean it im sorry he dithered before her  she recovered her equilibrium and pale to the lips looked at him with sombre eyes  im sorry he continued loudly in his strange frenzy like a small boy dont remember dont remember dont think i did it  his face was a kind of blank and unconsciously he wrung the hand that had gripped her as if it pained him she watched him and wondered why on earth all this frenzy she was left rather cold she did not at all feel the strong feelings he seemed to expect of her there was nothing so very unnatural after all in being bumped up suddenly against the wall certainly her shoulder hurt where he had gripped it but there were plenty of worse hurts in the world she watched him with wide distant eyes  and he fell on his knees before her as she backed against the bookcase and he caught hold of the edge of her dressbottom drawing it to him which made her rather abashed and much more uncomfortable  forgive me he said dont remember forgive me love me love me forgive me and love me forgive me and love me  as alvina was looking down dismayed on the great redfaced elderly man who in his cryingout showed his white teeth like a child and as she was gently trying to draw her skirt from his clutch the door opened and there stood the matron in her big frilled cap alvina glanced at her flushed crimson and looked down to the man she touched his face with her hand  never mind she said its nothing dont think about it  he caught her hand and clung to it  love me love me love me he cried  the matron softly closed the door again withdrawing  love me love me  alvina was absolutely dumbfounded by this scene she had no idea men did such things it did not touch her it dumbfounded her  the doctor clinging to her hand struggled to his feet and flung his arms round her clasping her wildly to him  you love me you love me dont you he said vibrating and beside himself as he pressed her to his breast and hid his face against her hair at such a moment what was the good of saying she didnt but she didnt pity for his shame however kept her silent motionless and silent in his arms smothered against the blueserge waistcoat of his broad breast  he was beginning to come to himself he became silent but he still strained her fast he had no idea of letting her go  you will take my ring wont you he said at last still in the strange lamentable voice you will take my ring  yes she said coldly anything for a quiet emergence from this scene  he fumbled feverishly in his pocket with one hand holding her still fast by the other arm and with one hand he managed to extract the ring from its case letting the case roll away on the floor it was a diamond solitaire  which finger which finger is it he asked beginning to smile rather weakly she extricated her hand and held out her engagement finger upon it was the mourningring miss frost had always worn the doctor slipped the diamond solitaire above the mourning ring and folded alvina to his breast again  now he said almost in his normal voice now i know you love me the pleased selfsatisfaction in his voice made her angry she managed to extricate herself  you will come along with me now he said  i cant she answered i must get back to my work here  nurse allen can do that  id rather not  where are you going today  she told him her cases  well you will come and have tea with me i shall expect you to have tea with me every day  but alvina was straightening her crushed cap before the mirror and did not answer  we can see as much as we like of each other now were engaged he said smiling with satisfaction  i wonder where the matron is said alvina suddenly going into the cool white corridor he followed her and they met the matron just coming out of the ward  matron said dr mitchell with a return of his old mouthing importance you may congratulate nurse houghton and me on our engagement he smiled largely  i may congratulate you you mean said the matron  yes of course and both of us since we are now one he replied  not quite yet said the matron gravely  and at length she managed to get rid of him  at once she went to look for alvina who had gone to her duties  well i suppose it is all right said the matron gravely  no it isnt said alvina i shall never marry him  ah never is a long while did he hear me come in  no im sure he didnt  thank goodness for that  yes indeed it was perfectly horrible following me round on his knees and shouting for me to love him perfectly horrible  well said the matron you never know what men will do till youve known them and then you need be surprised at nothing nothing im surprised at nothing they do  i must say said alvina i was surprised very unpleasantly  but you accepted him  anything to quieten himlike a hysterical child  yes but im not sure you havent taken a very risky way of quietening him giving him what he wanted  i think said alvina i can look after myself i may be moved any day now  well said the matron he may prevent your getting moved you know hes on the board and if he says you are indispensable  this was a new idea for alvina to cogitate she had counted on a speedy escape she put his ring in her apron pocket and there she forgot it until he pounced on her in the afternoon in the house of one of her patients he waited for her to take her off  where is your ring he said  and she realized that it lay in the pocket of a soiled discarded apronperhaps lost for ever  i shant wear it on duty she said you know that  she had to go to tea with him she avoided his lovemaking by telling him any sort of spooniness revolted her and he was too much an old bachelor to take easily to a fondling habitbefore marriage at least so he mercifully left her alone he was on the whole devoutly thankful she wanted to be left alone but he wanted her to be there that was his greatest craving he wanted her to be always there and so he craved for marriage to possess her entirely and to have her always there with him so that he was never alone alone and apart from all the world but by her side always by her side  now when shall we fix the marriage he said it is no good putting it back we both know what we are doing and now the engagement is announced  he looked at her anxiously she could see the hysterical little boy under the great authoritative man  oh not till after christmas she said  after christmas he started as if he had been bitten nonsense its nonsense to wait so long next month at the latest  oh no she said i dont think so soon  why not the sooner the better you had better send in your resignation at once so that youre free  oh but is there any need i may be transferred for war service  thats not likely youre our only maternity nurse  and so the days went by she had tea with him practically every afternoon and she got used to him they discussed the furnishingshe could not help suggesting a few alterations a few arrangements according to her idea and he drew up a plan of a wedding tour in scotland yet she was quite certain she would not marry him the matron laughed at her certainty you will drift into it she said he is tying you down by too many little threads  ah well youll see said alvina  yes said the matron i shall see  and it was true that alvinas will was indeterminate at this time she was resolved not to marry but her will like a spring that is hitched somehow did not fly direct against the doctor she had sent in her resignation as he suggested but not that she might be free to marry him but that she might be at liberty to flee him so she told herself yet she worked into his hands  one day she sat with the doctor in the car near the stationit was towards the end of septemberheld up by a squad of soldiers in khaki who were marching off with their band wildly playing to embark on the special troop train that was coming down from the north the town was in great excitement warfever was spreading everywhere men were rushing to enlistand being constantly rejected for it was still the days of regular standards  as the crowds surged on the pavement as the soldiers tramped to the station as the traffic waited there came a certain flow in the opposite direction the 415 train had come in people were struggling along with luggage children were running with spades and buckets cabs were crawling along with families it was the seaside people coming home alvina watched the two crowds mingle  and as she watched she saw two men one carrying a mandoline case and a suitcase which she knew it was ciccio she did not know the other man some theatrical individual the two men halted almost near the car to watch the band go by alvina saw ciccio quite near to her she would have liked to squirt water down his brown handsome oblivious neck she felt she hated him he stood there watching the music his lips curling in his faintlyderisive italian manner as he talked to the other man his eyelashes were as long and dark as ever his eyes had still the attractive look of being set in with a smutty finger he had got the same brownish suit on which she disliked the same black hat set slightly jauntily over one eye he looked common and yet with that peculiar southern aloofness which gave him a certain beauty and distinction in her eyes she felt she hated him rather she felt she had been let down by him  the band had passed a child ran against the wheel of the standing car alvina suddenly reached forward and made a loud screeching flourish on the hooter every one looked round including the laden tramping soldiers  we cant move yet said dr mitchell  but alvina was looking at ciccio at that moment he had turned with the rest looking inquiringly at the car and his quick eyes the whites of which showed so white against his duskiness the yellow pupils so nonhuman met hers with a quick flash of recognition his mouth began to curl in a smile of greeting but she stared at him without moving a muscle just blankly stared abstracting every scrap of feeling even of animosity or coldness out of her gaze she saw the smile die on his lips his eyes glance sideways and again sideways with that curious animal shyness which characterized him it was as if he did not want to see her looking at him and ran from side to side like a caged weasel avoiding her blank glaucous look  she turned pleasantly to dr mitchell  what did you say she asked sweetly     chapter xii  allaye also is engaged   alvina found it pleasant to be respected as she was respected in lancaster it is not only the prophet who hath honour save in his own country it is every one with individuality in this northern town alvina found that her individuality really told already she belonged to the revered caste of medicinemen and into the bargain she was a personality a person  well and good she was not going to cheapen herself she felt that even in the eyes of the nativesthe welltodo part at leastshe lost a little of her distinction when she was engaged to dr mitchell the engagement had been announced in the times the morning post the manchester guardian and the local news no fear about its being known and it cast a slight slur of vulgar familiarity over her in woodhouse she knew it elevated her in the common esteem tremendously but she was no longer in woodhouse she was in lancaster and in lancaster her engagement pigeonholed her apart from dr mitchell she had a magic potentiality connected with him she was a known and labelled quantity  this she gathered from her contact with the local gentry the matron was a woman of family who somehow managed in her big white frilled cap to be distinguished like an abbess of old the really toney women of the place came to take tea in her room and these little teas in the hospital were like a little elegant female conspiracy there was a slight flavour of art and literature about the matron had known walter pater in the somewhat remote past  alvina was admitted to these teas with the few women who formed the toney intellectual élite of this northern town there was a certain freemasonry in the matrons room the matron a ladydoctor a clergymans daughter and the wives of two industrial magnates of the place these five and then alvina formed the little group they did not meet a great deal outside the hospital but they always met with that curious female freemasonry which can form a law unto itself even among most conventional women they talked as they would never talk before men or before feminine outsiders they threw aside the whole vestment of convention they discussed plainly the things they thought abouteven the most secretand they were quite calm about the things they dideven the most impossible alvina felt that her transgression was a very mild affair and that her engagement was really infra dig  and are you going to marry him asked mrs tuke with a long cool look  i cant imagine myself said alvina  oh but so many things happen outside ones imagination thats where your body has you i cant imagine that im going to have a child she lowered her eyelids wearily and sardonically over her large eyes  mrs tuke was the wife of the son of a local manufacturer she was about twentyeight years old pale with great darkgrey eyes and an arched nose and black hair very like a head on one of the lovely syracusan coins the odd look of a smile which wasnt a smile at the corners of the mouth the arched nose and the slowness of the big full classic eyes gave her the dangerous greek look of the syracusan women of the past the dangerous heavilycivilized women of old sicily those who laughed about the latomia  but do you think you can have a child without wanting it at all asked alvina  oh but there isnt one bit of me wants it not one bit my flesh doesnt want it and my mind doesntyet there it is she spread her fine hands with a flicker of inevitability  something must want it said alvina  oh said mrs tuke the universe is one big machine and were just part of it she flicked out her grey silk handkerchief and dabbed her nose watching with big blackgrey eyes the fresh face of alvina  theres not one bit of me concerned in having this child she persisted to alvina my flesh isnt concerned and my mind isnt and yetle voilàim just planté i cant imagine why i married tommy and yeti did she shook her head as if it was all just beyond her and the pseudosmile at the corners of her ageless mouth deepened  alvina was to nurse mrs tuke the baby was expected at the end of august but already the middle of september was here and the baby had not arrived  the tukes were not very richthe young ones that is tommy wanted to compose music so he lived on what his father gave him his father gave him a little house outside the town a house furnished with expensive bits of old furniture in a way that the townspeople thought insane but there you areeffie would insist on dabbing a rare bit of yellow brocade on the wall instead of a picture and in painting applegreen shelves in the recesses of the whitewashed wall of the diningroom then she enamelled the hallfurniture yellow and decorated it with curious green and lavender lines and flowers and had unearthly cushions and sardinian pottery with unspeakable peaked griffins  what were you to make of such a woman alvina slept in her house these days instead of at the hospital for effie was a very bad sleeper she would sit up in bed the two glossy black plaits hanging beside her white arch face wrapping loosely round her her dressinggown of a sort of plumbagocoloured darkgrey silk lined with fine silk of metallic blue and there ivory and jetblack and grey like blacklead she would sit in the white bedclothes flicking her handkerchief and revealing a flicker of kingfisherblue silk and white silk night dress complaining of her neuritis nerve and her own impossible condition and begging alvina to stay with her another halfhour and suddenly studying the big bloodred stone on her finger as if she was reading something in it  i believe i shall be like the woman in the cent nouvelles and carry my child for five years do you know that story she said that eating a parsley leaf on which bits of snow were sticking started the child in her it might just as well  alvina would laugh and get tired there was about her a kind of half bitter sanity and nonchalance which the nervous woman liked  one night as they were sitting thus in the bedroom at nearly eleven oclock they started and listened dogs in the distance had also started to yelp a mandoline was wailing its vibration in the night outside rapidly delicately quivering alvina went pale she knew it was ciccio she had seen him lurking in the streets of the town but had never spoken to him  whats this cried mrs tuke cocking her head on one side music a mandoline how extraordinary do you think its a serenade and she lifted her brows archly  i should think it is said alvina  how extraordinary what a moment to choose to serenade the lady isnt it like life i must look at it  she got out of bed with some difficulty wrapped her dressinggown round her pushed her feet into slippers and went to the window she opened the sash it was a lovely moonlight night of september below lay the little front garden with its short drive and its iron gates that closed on the highroad from the shadow of the highroad came the noise of the mandoline  hello tommy called mrs tuke to her husband whom she saw on the drive below her hows your musical ear  all right doesnt it disturb you came the mans voice from the moonlight below  not a bit i like it im waiting for the voice o richard o mon roi  but the music had stopped  there cried mrs tuke youve frightened him off and were dying to be serenaded arent we nurse she turned to alvina do give me my fur will you thanks so much wont you open the other window and look out there  alvina went to the second window she stood looking out  do play again mrs tuke called into the night do sing something and with her white arm she reached for a glory rose that hung in the moonlight from the wall and with a flash of her white arm she flung it toward the garden wallineffectually of course  wont you play again she called into the night to the unseen tommy go indoors the bird wont sing when youre about  its an italian by the sound of him nothing i hate more than emotional italian music perfectly nauseating  never mind dear i know it sounds as if all their insides were coming out of their mouth but we want to be serenaded dont we nurse  alvina stood at her window but did not answer  ahh came the odd query from mrs tuke dont you like it  yes said alvina very much  and arent you dying for the song  quite  there cried mrs tuke into the moonlight una canzone bellabellamolto bella  she pronounced her syllables one by one calling into the night it sounded comical there came a rude laugh from the drive below  go indoors tommy he wont sing if youre there nothing will sing if youre there called the young woman  they heard a footstep on the gravel and then the slam of the hall door  now cried mrs tuke  they waited and sure enough came the fine tinkle of the mandoline and after a few moments the song it was one of the wellknown neapolitan songs and ciccio sang it as it should be sung  mrs tuke went across to alvina  doesnt he put his bowels into it she said laying her hand on her own full figure and rolling her eyes mockingly im sure its more effective than sennapods  then she returned to her own window huddled her furs over her breast and rested her white elbows in the moonlight          torn a surrientu         fammi campar  the song suddenly ended in a clamorous animal sort of yearning mrs tuke was quite still resting her chin on her fingers alvina also was still then mrs tuke slowly reached for the rosebuds on the old wall  molto bella she cried half ironically molto bella je vous envoie une rose and she threw the roses out on to the drive a mans figure was seen hovering outside the gate on the highroad entrez called mrs tuke entrez prenez votre rose come in and take your rose  the mans voice called something from the distance  what cried mrs tuke  je ne peux pas entrer  vous ne pouvez pas entrer pourquoi alors la porte nest pas fermée à clef entrez donc  non on nentre pas called the wellknown voice of ciccio  quoi faire alors alvina take him the rose to the gate will you yes do their singing is horrible i think i cant go down to him but do take him the roses and see what he looks like yes do mrs tukes eyes were arched and excited alvina looked at her slowly alvina also was smiling to herself  she went slowly down the stairs and out of the front door from a bush at the side she pulled two sweetsmelling roses then in the drive she picked up effies flowers ciccio was standing outside the gate  allaye he said in a soft yearning voice  mrs tuke sent you these roses said alvina putting the flowers through the bars of the gate  allaye he said caressing her hand kissing it with a soft passionate yearning mouth alvina shivered quickly he opened the gate and drew her through he drew her into the shadow of the wall and put his arms round her lifting her from her feet with passionate yearning  allaye he said i love you allaye my beautiful allaye i love you allaye he held her fast to his breast and began to walk away with her his throbbing muscular power seemed completely to envelop her he was just walking away with her down the road clinging fast to her enveloping her  nurse nurse i cant see you nurse came the long call of mrs tuke through the night dogs began to bark  put me down murmured alvina put me down ciccio  come with me to italy come with me to italy allaye i cant go to italy by myself allaye come with me be married to meallaye allaye  his voice was a strange hoarse whisper just above her face he still held her in his throbbing heavy embrace  yesyes she whispered yesyes but put me down ciccio put me down  come to italy with me allaye come with me he still reiterated in a voice hoarse with pain and yearning  nurse nurse wherever are you nurse i want you sang the uneasy querulous voice of mrs tuke  do put me down murmured alvina stirring in his arms  he slowly relaxed his clasp and she slid down like rain to earth but still he clung to her  come with me allaye come with me to italy he said  she saw his face beautiful nonhuman in the moonlight and she shuddered slightly  yes she said i will come but let me go now where is your mandoline  he turned round and looked up the road  nurse you absolutely must come i cant bear it cried the strange voice of mrs tuke  alvina slipped from the man who was a little bewildered and through the gate into the drive  you must come came the voice in pain from the upper window  alvina ran upstairs she found mrs tuke crouched in a chair with a drawn horrified terrified face as her pains suddenly gripped her she uttered an exclamation and pressed her clenched fists hard on her face  the pains have begun said alvina hurrying to her  oh its horrible its horrible i dont want it cried the woman in travail alvina comforted her and reassured her as best she could and from outside once more came the despairing howl of the neapolitan song animal and inhuman on the night         e tu dic io part addio         talluntare di sta core         nel paese del amore         tien o cor di non turnar         ma nun me lasciar  it was almost unendurable but suddenly mrs tuke became quite still and sat with her fists clenched on her knees her two jetblack plaits dropping on either side of her ivory face her big eyes fixed staring into space at the line          ma nun me lasciar  she began to murmur softly to herselfyes its dreadful its horrible i cant understand it what does it mean that noise its as bad as these pains what does it mean what does he say i can understand a little italian she paused and again came the sudden complaint          ma nun me lasciar  ma nun me lasciar she murmured repeating the music that meansdont leave me dont leave me but why why shouldnt one human being go away from another what does it mean that awful noise isnt love the most horrible thing i think its horrible it just does one in and turns one into a sort of howling animal im howling with one sort of pain hes howling with another two hellish animals howling through the night im not myself hes not himself oh i think its horrible what does he look like nurse is he beautiful is he a great hefty brute  she looked with big slow enigmatic eyes at alvina  hes a man i knew before said alvina  mrs tukes face woke from its halftrance  really oh a man you knew before where  its a long story said alvina in a travelling musichall troupe  in a travelling musichall troupe how extraordinary why how did you come across such an individual  alvina explained as briefly as possible mrs tuke watched her  really she said youve done all those things and she scrutinized alvinas face youve had some effect on him thats evident she said then she shuddered and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief oh the flesh is a beastly thing she cried to make a man howl outside there like that because youre here and to make me howl because ive got a child inside me its unbearable what does he look like really  i dont know said alvina not extraordinary rather a hefty brute  mrs tuke glanced at her to detect the irony  i should like to see him she said do you think i might  i dont know said alvina noncommittal  do you think he might come up ask him do let me see him  do you really want to said alvina  of course mrs tuke watched alvina with big dark slow eyes then she dragged herself to her feet alvina helped her into bed  do ask him to come up for a minute effie said well give him a glass of tommys famous port do let me see him yes do she stretched out her long white arm to alvina with sudden imploring  alvina laughed and turned doubtfully away  the night was silent outside but she found ciccio leaning against a gatepillar he started up  allaye he said  will you come in for a moment i cant leave mrs tuke  ciccio obediently followed alvina into the house and up the stairs without a word he was ushered into the bedroom he drew back when he saw effie in the bed sitting with her long plaits and her dark eyes and the subtleseeming smile at the corners of her mouth  do come in she said i want to thank you for the music nurse says it was for her but i enjoyed it also would you tell me the words i think its a wonderful song  ciccio hung back against the door his head dropped and the shy suspicious faintly malicious smile on his face  have a glass of port do said effie nurse give us all one i should like one too and a biscuit again she stretched out her long white arm from the sudden blue lining of her wrap suddenly as if taken with the desire ciccio shifted on his feet watching alvina pour out the port  he swallowed his in one swallow and put aside his glass  have some more said effie watching over the top of her glass  he smiled faintly stupidly and shook his head  wont you now tell me the words of the song  he looked at her from out of the dusky hollows of his brow and did not answer the faint stupid halfsmile halfsneer was on his lips  wont you tell them me i understood one line  ciccio smiled more pronouncedly as he watched her but did not speak  i understood one line said effie making big eyes at him ma non me lasciaredont leave me there isnt that it  he smiled stirred on his feet and nodded  dont leave me there i knew it was that why dont you want nurse to leave you do you want her to be with you every minute  he smiled a little contemptuously awkwardly and turned aside his face glancing at alvina effies watchful eyes caught the glance it was swift and full of the terrible yearning which so horrified her  at the same moment a spasm crossed her face her expression went blank  shall we go down said alvina to ciccio  he turned immediately with his cap in his hand and followed in the hall he pricked up his ears as he took the mandoline from the chest he could hear the stifled cries and exclamations from mrs tuke at the same moment the door of the study opened and the musician a burly fellow with troubled hair came out  is that mrs tuke he snapped anxiously  yes the pains have begun said alvina  oh god and have you left her he was quite irascible  only for a minute said alvina  but with a pf of angry indignation he was climbing the stairs  she is going to have a child said alvina to ciccio i shall have to go back to her and she held out her hand  he did not take her hand but looked down into her face with the same slightly distorted look of overwhelming yearning yearning heavy and unbearable in which he was carried towards her as on a flood  allaye he said with a faint lift of the lip that showed his teeth like a pained animal a curious sort of smile he could not go away  i shall have to go back to her she said  shall you come with me to italy allaye  yes where is madame  gone gigiall gone  gone where  gone back to francecalled up  and madame and louis and max  switzerland  he stood helplessly looking at her  well i must go she said  he watched her with his yellow eyes from under his long black lashes like some chained animal haunted by doom she turned and left him standing  she found mrs tuke wildly clutching the edge of the sheets and crying no tommy dear im awfully fond of you you know i am but go away oh god go away and put a space between us put a space between us she almost shrieked  he pushed up his hair he had been working on a big choral work which he was composing and by this time he was almost demented  cant you stand my presence he shouted and dashed downstairs  nurse cried effie its no use trying to get a grip on life youre just at the mercy of forces she shrieked angrily  why not said alvina there are good lifeforces even the will of god is a lifeforce  you dont understand i want to be myself and im not myself im just torn to pieces by forces its horrible  well its not my fault i didnt make the universe said alvina if you have to be torn to pieces by forces well you have other forces will put you together again  i dont want them to i want to be myself i dont want to be nailed together like a chair with a hammer i want to be myself  you wont be nailed together like a chair you should have faith in life  but i hate life its nothing but a mass of forces i am intelligent life isnt intelligent look at it at this moment do you call this intelligent ohoh its horrible oh she was wild and sweating with her pains tommy flounced out downstairs beside himself he was heard talking to some one in the moonlight outside to ciccio he had already telephoned wildly for the doctor but the doctor had replied that nurse would ring him up  the moment mrs tuke recovered her breath she began again  i hate life and faith and such things faith is only fear and life is a mass of unintelligent forces to which intelligent beings are submitted prostituted ohohprostituted  perhaps life itself is something bigger than intelligence said alvina  bigger than intelligence shrieked effie nothing is bigger than intelligence your man is a hefty brute his yellow eyes arent intelligent theyre animal  no said alvina something else i wish he didnt attract me  there because youre not content to be at the mercy of forces cried effie im not im not i want to be myself and so forces tear me to pieces tear me to pieeeeohhh no  downstairs tommy had walked ciccio back into the house again and the two men were drinking port in the study discussing italy for which tommy had a great sentimental affection though he hated all italian music after the younger scarlatti they drank port all through the night tommy being strictly forbidden to interfere upstairs or even to fetch the doctor they drank three and a half bottles of port and were discovered in the morning by alvina fast asleep in the study with the electric light still burning tommy slept with his fair and ruffled head hanging over the edge of the couch like some great loose fruit ciccio was on the floor face downwards his face in his folded arms  alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert ciccio in the end she had to leave him and rouse tommy first who in rousing fell off the sofa with a crash which woke him disagreeably so that he turned on alvina in a fury and asked her what the hell she thought she was doing in answer to which alvina held up a finger warningly and tommy suddenly remembering fell back as if he had been struck  she is sleeping now said alvina  is it a boy or a girl he cried  it isnt born yet she said  oh god its an accursed fugue cried the bemused tommy after which they proceeded to wake ciccio who was like the dead doll in petrushka all loose and floppy when he was awake however he smiled at alvina and said allaye  the dark waking smile upset her badly     chapter xiii  the wedded wife   the upshot of it all was that alvina ran away to scarborough without telling anybody it was in the first week in october she asked for a weekend to make some arrangements for her marriage the marriage was presumably with dr mitchellthough she had given him no definite word however her months notice was up so she was legally free and therefore she packed a rather large bag with all her ordinary things and set off in her everyday dress leaving the nursing paraphernalia behind  she knew scarborough quite well and quite quickly found rooms which she had occupied before in a boardinghouse where she had stayed with miss frost long ago having recovered from her journey she went out on to the cliffs on the north side it was evening and the sea was before her what was she to do  she had run away from both menfrom ciccio as well as from mitchell she had spent the last fortnight more or less avoiding the pair of them now she had a moment to herself she was even free from mrs tuke who in her own way was more exacting than the men mrs tuke had a baby daughter and was getting well ciccio was living with the tukes tommy had taken a fancy to him and had half engaged him as a sort of personal attendant the sort of thing tommy would do not having paid his butchers bills  so alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation she was sick of being badgered about she didnt really want to marry anybody why should she she was thankful beyond measure to be by herself how sick she was of other people and their importunities what was she to do she decided to offer herself again in a little while for war servicein a new town this time meanwhile she wanted to be by herself  she made excursions she walked on the moors in the brief but lovely days of early october for three days it was all so sweet and lovelyperfect liberty pure almost paradisal  the fourth day it rained simply rained all day long and was cold dismal disheartening beyond words there she sat stranded in the dismalness and knew no way out she went to bed at nine oclock having decided in a jerk to go to london and find work in the warhospitals at once not to leave off until she had found it  but in the night she dreamed that alexander her first fiancé was with her on the quay of some harbour and was reproaching her bitterly even reviling her for having come too late so that they had missed their ship they were there to catch the boatand she for dilatoriness was an hour late and she could see the broad stern of the steamer not far off just an hour late she showed alexander her watchexactly ten oclock instead of nine and he was more angry than ever because her watch was slow he pointed to the harbour clockit was ten minutes past ten  when she woke up she was thinking of alexander it was such a long time since she had thought of him she wondered if he had a right to be angry with her  the day was still grey with sweepy rainclouds on the seagruesome objectionable it was a prolongation of yesterday well despair was no good and being miserable was no good either she got no satisfaction out of either mood the only thing to do was to act seize hold of life and wring its neck  she took the timetable that hung in the hall the timetable that magic carpet of today when in doubt move this was the maxim move where to  another click of a resolution she would wire to ciccio and meet himwhere yorkleedshalifax she looked up the places in the timetable and decided on leeds she wrote out a telegram that she would be at leeds that evening would he get it in time chance it  she hurried off and sent the telegram then she took a little luggage told the people of her house she would be back next day and set off she did not like whirling in the direction of lancaster but no matter  she waited a long time for the train from the north to come in the first person she saw was tommy he waved to her and jumped from the moving train  i say he said so glad to see you ciccio is with me effie insisted on my coming to see you  there was ciccio climbing down with the bag a sort of servant this was too much for her  so you came with your valet she said as ciccio stood with the bag  not a bit said tommy laying his hand on the other mans shoulder were the best of friends i dont carry bags because my heart is rather groggy i say nurse excuse me but i like you better in uniform black doesnt suit you you dont mind  yes i do but ive only got black clothes except uniforms  well look here now youre not going on anywhere tonight are you  it is too late  well now lets turn into the hotel and have a talk im acting under effies orders as you may gather  at the hotel tommy gave her a letter from his wife to the tune ofdont marry this italian youll put yourself in a wretched hole and one wants to avoid getting into holes i knowconcluded effie on a sinister note  tommy sang another tune ciccio was a lovely chap a rare chap a treat he tommy could quite understand any womans wanting to marry himdidnt agree a bit with effie but marriage you know was so final and then with this war on you never knew how things might turn out a foreigner and all that and thenyou wont mind what i say we wont talk about class and that rot if the mans good enough hes good enough by himself but is he your intellectual equal nurse after all its a big point you dont want to marry a man you cant talk to ciccios a treat to be with because hes so natural but it isnt a mental treat  alvina thought of mrs tuke who complained that tommy talked music and pseudophilosophy by the hour when he was wound up she saw effies long outstretched arm of repudiation and weariness  of courseanother of mrs tukes exclamations why not be atavistic if you can be and follow at a mans heel just because hes a man be like barbarous women a slave  during all this ciccio stayed out of the room as bidden it was not till alvina sat before her mirror that he opened her door softly and entered  i come in he said and he closed the door  alvina remained with her hairbrush suspended watching him he came to her smiling softly to take her in his arms but she put the chair between them  why did you bring mr tuke she said  he lifted his shoulders  i havent brought him he said watching her  why did you show him the telegram  it was mrs tuke took it  why did you give it her  it was she who gave it me in her room she kept it in her room till i came and took it  all right said alvina go back to the tukes and she began again to brush her hair  ciccio watched her with narrowing eyes  what you mean he said i shant go allaye you come with me  ha she sniffed scornfully i shall go where i like  but slowly he shook his head  youll come allaye he said you come with me with ciccio  she shuddered at the soft plaintive entreaty  how can i go with you how can i depend on you at all  again he shook his head his eyes had a curious yellow fire beseeching plaintive with a demon quality of yearning compulsion  yes you come with me allaye you come with me to italy you dont go to that other man he is too old not healthy you come with me to italy why do you send a telegram  alvina sat down and covered her face trembling  i cant i cant i cant she moaned i cant do it  yes you come with me i have money you come with me to my place in the mountains to my uncles house fine house you like it come with me allaye  she could not look at him  why do you want me she said  why i want you he gave a curious laugh almost of ridicule i dont know that you ask me another eh  she was silent sitting looking downwards  i cant i think she said abstractedly looking up at him  he smiled a fine subtle smile like a demons but inexpressibly gentle he made her shiver as if she was mesmerized and he was reaching forward to her as a snake reaches nor could she recoil  you come allaye he said softly with his foreign intonation you come you come to italy with me yes he put his hand on her and she started as if she had been struck but his hands with the soft powerful clasp only closed her faster  yes he said yes all right eh all righthe had a strange mesmeric power over her as if he possessed the sensual secrets and she was to be subjected  i cant she moaned trying to struggle but she was powerless  dark and insidious he was he had no regard for her how could a mans movements be so soft and gentle and yet so inhumanly regardless he had no regard for her why didnt she revolt why couldnt she she was as if bewitched she couldnt fight against her bewitchment why because he seemed to her beautiful so beautiful and this left her numb submissive why must she see him beautiful why was she willless she felt herself like one of the old sacred prostitutes a sacred prostitute  in the morning very early they left for scarborough leaving a letter for the sleeping tommy in scarborough they went to the registrars office they could be married in a fortnights time and so the fortnight passed and she was under his spell only she knew it she felt extinguished ciccio talked to her but only ordinary things there was no wonderful intimacy of speech such as she had always imagined and always craved for no he loved herbut it was in a dark mesmeric way which did not let her be herself his love did not stimulate her or excite her it extinguished her she had to be the quiescent obscure woman she felt as if she were veiled her thoughts were dim in the dim back regions of consciousnessyet somewhere she almost exulted atavism mrs tukes word would play in her mind was it atavism this sinking into extinction under the spell of ciccio was it atavism this strange sleeplike submission to his being perhaps it was perhaps it was but it was also heavy and sweet and rich somewhere she was content somewhere even she was vastly proud of the dark veiled eternal loneliness she felt under his shadow  and so it had to be she shuddered when she touched him because he was so beautiful and she was so submitted she quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow yet her mind remained distantly clear she would criticize him find fault with him the things he did but ultimately she could find no fault with him she had lost the power she didnt care she had lost the power to care about his faults strange sweet poisonous indifference she was drugged and she knew it would she ever wake out of her dark warm coma she shuddered and hoped not mrs tuke would say atavism atavism the word recurred curiously  but under all her questionings she felt well a nonchalance deep as sleep a passivity and indifference so dark and sweet she felt it must be evil evil she was evil and yet she had no power to be otherwise they were legally married and she was glad she was relieved by knowing she could not escape she was mrs marasca what was the good of trying to be miss houghton any longer marasca the bitter cherry some dark poison fruit she had eaten how glad she was she had eaten it how beautiful he was and no one saw it but herself for her it was so potent it made her tremble when she noticed him his beauty his dark shadow ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage he seemed to emerge before he had seemed to make himself invisible in the streets in england altogether but now something unfolded in him he was a potent glamorous presence people turned to watch him there was a certain dark leopardlike pride in the air about him something that the english people watched  he wanted to go to italy and now it was his will which counted alvina as his wife must submit he took her to london the day after the marriage he wanted to get away to italy he did not like being in england a foreigner amid the beginnings of the spy craze  in london they stayed at his cousins house his cousin kept a restaurant in battersea and was a flourishing london italian a real london product with all the good english virtues of cleanliness and honesty added to an italian shrewdness his name was giuseppe califano and he was pale and he had four children of whom he was very proud he received alvina with an affable respect as if she were an asset in the family but as if he were a little uneasy and disapproving she had come down in marrying ciccio she had lost caste he rather seemed to exult over her degradation for he was a northernized italian he had accepted english standards his children were english brats he almost patronized alvina  but then a long slow look from her remote blue eyes brought him up sharp and he envied ciccio suddenly he was almost in love with her himself she disturbed him she disturbed him in his new english aplomb of a london restaurateur and she disturbed in him the old italian dark soul to which he was renegade he tried treating her as an english lady but the slow remote look in her eyes made this fall flat he had to be italian  and he was jealous of ciccio in ciccios face was a lurking smile and round his fine nose there seemed a subtle semidefiant triumph after all he had triumphed over his welltodo anglicized cousin with a stealthy leopardlike pride ciccio went through the streets of london in those wild early days of war he was the one victor arching stealthily over the vanquished north  alvina saw nothing of all these complexities for the time being she was all dark and potent things were curious to her it was curious to be in battersea in this englishitalian household where the children spoke english more readily than italian it was strange to be high over the restaurant to see the trees of the park to hear the clang of trams it was strange to walk out and come to the river it was strange to feel the seethe of war and dread in the air but she did not question she seemed steeped in the passional influence of the man as in some narcotic she even forgot mrs tukes atavism vague and unquestioning she went through the days she accompanied ciccio into town she went with him to make purchases or she sat by his side in the music hall or she stayed in her room and sewed or she sat at meals with the califanos a vague brightness on her face and mrs califano was very nice to her very gentle though with a suspicion of malicious triumph mockery beneath her gentleness still she was nice and womanly hovering as she was between her english emancipation and her italian subordination she half pitied alvina and was more than half jealous of her  alvina was aware of nothingonly of the presence of ciccio it was his physical presence which cast a spell over her she lived within his aura and she submitted to him as if he had extended his dark nature over her she knew nothing about him she lived mindlessly within his presence quivering within his influence as if his blood beat in her she knew she was subjected one tiny corner of her knew and watched  he was very happy and his face had a real beauty his eyes glowed with lustrous secrecy like the eyes of some victorious happy wild creature seen remote under a bush and he was very good to her his tenderness made her quiver into a swoon of complete selfforgetfulness as if the floodgates of her depths opened the depth of his warm mindless enveloping love was immeasurable she felt she could sink forever into his warm pulsating embrace  afterwards later on when she was inclined to criticize him she would remember the moment when she saw his face at the italian consulate in london there were many people at the consulate clamouring for passportsa wild and illregulated crowd they had waited their turn and got insideciccio was not good at pushing his way and inside a courteous tall old man with a white beard had lifted the flap for alvina to go inside the office and sit down to fill in the form she thanked the old man who bowed as if he had a reputation to keep up  ciccio followed and it was he who had to sit down and fill up the form because she did not understand the italian questions she stood at his side watching the excited laughing noisy eastend italians at the desk the whole place had a certain freeandeasy confusion a human unofficial muddling liveliness which was not quite like england even though it was in the middle of london  what was your mothers name ciccio was asking her she turned to him he sat with the pen perched flourishingly at the end of his fingers suspended in the serious and artistic business of filling in a form and his face had a dark luminousness like a dark transparence which was shut and has now expanded she quivered as if it was more than she could bear for his face was open like a flower right to the depths of his soul a dark lovely translucency vulnerable to the deep quick of his soul the lovely rich darkness of his southern nature so different from her own exposing itself now in its passional vulnerability made her go white with a kind of fear for an instant her face seemed drawn and old as she looked down at him answering his questions then her eyes became sightless with tears she stooped as if to look at his writing and quickly kissed his fingers that held the pen there in the midst of the crowded vulgar consulate  he stayed suspended again looking up at her with the bright unfolded eyes of a wild creature which plays and is not seen a faint smile very beautiful to her was on his face what did he see when he looked at her she did not know she did not know and she would never know for an instant she swore inside herself that god himself should not take her away from this man she would commit herself to him through every eternity and then the vagueness came over her again she turned aside photographically seeing the crowd in the consulate but really unconscious his movement as he rose seemed to move her in her sleep she turned to him at once  it was early in november before they could leave for italy and her dim lustrous state lasted all the time she found herself at charing cross in the early morning in all the bustle of catching the continental train giuseppe was there and gemma his wife and two of the children besides three other italian friends of ciccio they all crowded up the platform giuseppe had insisted that ciccio should take secondclass tickets they were very early alvina and ciccio were installed in a secondclass compartment with all their packages ciccio was pale yellowish under his tawny skin and nervous he stood excitedly on the platform talking in italianor rather in his own dialectwhilst alvina sat quite still in her corner sometimes one of the women or one of the children came to say a few words to her or giuseppe hurried to her with illustrated papers they treated her as if she were some sort of invalid or angel now she was leaving but most of their attention they gave to ciccio talking at him rapidly all at once whilst he answered and glanced in this way and that under his fine lashes and smiled his old nervous meaningless smile he was curiously upset  time came to shut the doors the women and children kissed alvina saying  youll be all right eh going to italy and then profound and meaningful nods which she could not interpret but which were fraught surely with goodfellowship  then they all kissed ciccio the men took him in their arms and kissed him on either cheek the children lifted their faces in eager anticipation of the double kiss strange how eager they were for this embracehow they all kept taking ciccios hand one after the other whilst he smiled constrainedly and nervously     chapter xiv  the journey across   the train began to move giuseppe ran alongside holding ciccios hand still the women and children were crying and waving their handkerchiefs the other men were shouting messages making strange eager gestures and alvina sat quite still wonderingly and so the big heavy train drew out leaving the others small and dim on the platform it was foggy the river was a sea of yellow beneath the ponderous iron bridge the morning was dim and dank  the train was very full next to alvina sat a trim frenchwoman reading laiglon there was a terrible encumbrance of packages and luggage everywhere opposite her sat ciccio his black overcoat open over his palegrey suit his black hat a little over his left eye he glanced at her from time to time smiling constrainedly she remained very still they ran through bromley and out into the open country it was grey with shivers of grey sunshine on the downs there was thin snow the air in the train was hot heavy with the crowd and tense with excitement and uneasiness the train seemed to rush ponderously massively across the weald  and so through folkestone to the sea there was sun in the sky now and white clouds in the sort of hollow skydome above the grey earth with its horizon walls of fog the air was still the sea heaved with a sucking noise inside the dock alvina and ciccio sat aft on the secondclass deck their bags near them he put a white muffler round himself alvina hugged herself in her beaver scarf and muff she looked tender and beautiful in her still vagueness and ciccio hovering about her was beautiful too his estrangement gave him a certain wistful nobility which for the moment put him beyond all class inferiority the passengers glanced at them across the magic of estrangement  the sea was very still the sun was fairly high in the open sky where white cloudtops showed against the pale wintry blue across the sea came a silver suntrack and alvina and ciccio looked at the sun which stood a little to the right of the ships course  the sun said ciccio nodding towards the orb and smiling to her  i love it she said  he smiled again silently he was strangely moved she did not know why  the wind was cold over the wintry sea though the suns beams were warm they rose walked round the cabins other ships were at seadestroyers and battleships grey low and sinister on the water then a tall bright schooner glimmered far down the channel some brown fishing smacks kept together all was very still in the wintry sunshine of the channel  so they turned to walk to the stern of the boat and alvinas heart suddenly contracted she caught ciccios arm as the boat rolled gently for there behind behind all the sunshine was england england beyond the water rising with ashgrey corpsegrey cliffs and streaks of snow on the downs above england like a long ashgrey coffin slowly submerging she watched it fascinated and terrified it seemed to repudiate the sunshine to remain unilluminated long and ashgrey and dead with streaks of snow like cerements that was england her thoughts flew to woodhouse the grey centre of it all home  her heart died within her never had she felt so utterly strange and faroff ciccio at her side was as nothing as spellbound she watched away off behind all the sunshine and the sea the grey snowstreaked substance of england slowly receding and sinking submerging she felt she could not believe it it was like looking at something else what it was like a long ashgrey coffin winter slowly submerging in the sea england  she turned again to the sun but clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky the cold was beginning to soak in moreover she sat very still for a long time almost an eternity and when she looked round again there was only a bank of mist behind beyond the sea a bank of mist and a few grey stalking ships she must watch for the coast of france  and there it was already looming up grey and amorphous patched with snow it had a grey heaped sordid look in the november light she had imagined boulogne gay and brilliant whereas it was more grey and dismal than england but not that magical mystic phantom look  the ship slowly put about and backed into the harbour she watched the quay approach ciccio was gathering up the luggage then came the first cry one ever hears porteur porteur want a porteur a porter in a blouse strung the luggage on his strap and ciccio and alvina entered the crush for the exit and the passport inspection there was a tense eager frightened crowd and officials shouting directions in french and english alvina found herself at last before a table where bearded men in uniforms were splashing open the big pink sheets of the english passports she felt strange and uneasy that her passport was unimpressive and italian the official scrutinized her and asked questions of ciccio nobody asked her anythingshe might have been ciccios shadow so they went through to the vast crowded cavern of a customs house where they found their porter waving to them in the mob ciccio fought in the mob while the porter whisked off alvina to get seats in the big train and at last she was planted once more in a seat with ciccios place reserved beside her and there she sat looking across the railway lines at the harbour in the last burst of grey sunshine men looked at her officials stared at her soldiers made remarks about her and at last after an eternity ciccio came along the platform the porter trotting behind  they sat and ate the food they had brought and drank wine and tea and after weary hours the train set off through snowpatched country to paris everywhere was crowded the train was stuffy without being warm next to alvina sat a large fat youngish frenchman who overflowed over her in a hot fashion darkness began to fall the train was very late there were strange and frightening delays strange lights appeared in the sky everybody seemed to be listening for strange noises it was all such a whirl and confusion that alvina lost count relapsed into a sort of stupidity gleams flashes noises and then at last the frenzy of paris  it was night a black city and snow falling and no train that night across to the gare de lyon in a state of semistupefaction after all the questionings and examinings and blusterings they were finally allowed to go straight across paris but this meant another wild tussle with a paris taxidriver in the filtering snow so they were deposited in the gare de lyon  and the first person who rushed upon them was geoffrey in a rather grimy privates uniform he had already seen some hard service and had a wild bewildered look he kissed ciccio and burst into tears on his shoulder there in the great turmoil of the entrance hall of the gare de lyon people looked but nobody seemed surprised geoffrey sobbed and the tears came silently down ciccios cheeks  ive waited for you since five oclock and ive got to go back now ciccio ciccio i wanted so badly to see you i shall never see thee again brother my brother cried gigi and a sob shook him  gigi mon gigi tu as done regu ma lettre  yesterday o ciccio ciccio i shall die without thee  but no gigi frère you wont die  yes ciccio i shall i know i shall  i say no brother said ciccio but a spasm suddenly took him he pulled off his hat and put it over his face and sobbed into it  adieu ami adieu cried gigi clutching the other mans arm ciccio took his hat from his tearstained face and put it on his head then the two men embraced  toujours à toi said geoffrey with a strange solemn salute in front of ciccio and alvina then he turned on his heel and marched rapidly out of the station his soiled soldiers overcoat flapping in the wind at the door ciccio watched him go then he turned and looked with haunted eyes into the eyes of alvina and then they hurried down the desolate platform in the darkness many people italians largely were camped waiting there while bits of snow wavered down ciccio bought food and hired cushions the train backed in there was a horrible fight for seats men scrambling through windows alvina got a placebut ciccio had to stay in the corridor  then the long night journey through france slow and blind the train was now so hot that the iron plate on the floor burnt alvinas feet outside she saw glimpses of snow a fat italian hotelkeeper put on a smoking cap covered the light and spread himself before alvina in the next carriage a child was screaming it screamed all the nightall the way from paris to chambéry it screamed the train came to sudden halts and stood still in the snow the hotelkeeper snored alvina became almost comatose in the burning heat of the carriage and again the train rumbled on and again she saw glimpses of stations glimpses of snow through the chinks in the curtained windows and again there was a jerk and a sudden halt a drowsy mutter from the sleepers somebody uncovering the light and somebody covering it again somebody looking out somebody tramping down the corridor the child screaming  the child belonged to two poor italiansmilanesea shred of a thin little man and a rather loose woman they had five tiny children all boys and the four who could stand on their feet all wore scarlet caps the fifth was a baby alvina had seen a french official yelling at the poor shred of a young father on the platform  when morning came and the bleary people pulled the curtains it was a clear dawn and they were in the south of france there was no sign of snow the landscape was half southern half alpine white houses with brownish tiles stood among almond trees and cactus it was beautiful and alvina felt she had known it all before in a happier life the morning was graceful almost as spring she went out in the corridor to talk to ciccio  he was on his feet with his back to the inner window rolling slightly to the motion of the train his face was pale he had that sombre haunted unhappy look alvina thrilled by the southern country was smiling excitedly  this is my first morning abroad she said  yes he answered  i love it here she said isnt this like italy  he looked darkly out of the window and shook his head  but the sombre look remained on his face she watched him and her heart sank as she had never known it sink before  are you thinking of gigi she said  he looked at her with a faint unhappy bitter smile but he said nothing he seemed far off from her a wild unhappiness beat inside her breast she went down the corridor away from him to avoid this new agony which after all was not her agony she listened to the chatter of french and italian in the corridor she felt the excitement and terror of france inside the railway carriage and outside she saw white oxen slowly ploughing beneath the lingering yellow poplars of the subalps she saw peasants looking up she saw a woman holding a baby to her breast watching the train she saw the excited yeasty crowds at the station and they passed a river and a great lake and it all seemed bigger nobler than england she felt vaster influences spreading around the past was greater more magnificent in these regions for the first time the nostalgia of the vast roman and classic world took possession of her and she found it splendid for the first time she opened her eyes on a continent the alpine core of a continent and for the first time she realized what it was to escape from the smallish perfection of england into the grander imperfection of a great continent  near chambéry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car and secretly she was very happy ciccios distress made her uneasy but underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad ciccio did not trouble her very much the sense of the bigness of the lands about her the excitement of travelling with continental people the pleasantness of her coffee and rolls and honey the feeling that vast events were taking placeall this stimulated her she had brushed as it were the fringe of the terror of the war and the invasion fear was seething around her and yet she was excited and glad the vast world was in one of its convulsions and she was moving amongst it somewhere she believed in the convulsion the event elated her  the train began to climb up to modane how wonderful the alps werewhat a bigness an unbreakable power was in the mountains up and up the train crept and she looked at the rocky slopes the glistening peaks of snow in the blue heaven the hollow valleys with fir trees and lowroofed houses there were quarries near the railway and men working there was a strange mountain town dirtylooking and still the train climbed up and up in the hot morning sunshine creeping slowly round the mountain loops so that a little brown dog from one of the cottages ran alongside the train for a long way barking at alvina even running ahead of the creeping snorting train and barking at the people ahead alvina looking out saw the two unfamiliar engines snorting out their smoke round the bend ahead and the morning wore away to midday  ciccio became excited as they neared modane the frontier station his eye lit up again he pulled himself together for the entrance into italy slowly the train rolled in to the dismal station and then a confusion indescribable of porters and masses of luggage the unspeakable crush and crowd at the customs barriers the more intense crowd through the passport office all like a madness  they were out on the platform again they had secured their places ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant they went through the passages and there in the dirty station gangways and big corridors dozens of italians were lying on the ground men women children camping with their bundles and packages in heaps they were either emigrants or refugees alvina had never seen people herd about like cattle dumb brute cattle it impressed her she could not grasp that an italian labourer would lie down just where he was tired in the street on a station in any corner like a dog  in the afternoon they were slipping down the alps towards turin and everywhere was snowdeep white wonderful snow beautiful and fresh glistening in the afternoon light all down the mountain slopes on the railway track almost seeming to touch the train and twilight was falling and at the stations people crowded in once more  it had been dark a long time when they reached turin many people alighted from the train many surged to get in but ciccio and alvina had seats side by side they were becoming tired now but they were in italy once more they went down for a meal and then the train set off again in the night for alessandria and genoa pisa and rome  it was night the train ran better there was a more easy sense in italy ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions and alvina settled her cushion and slept more or less till genoa after the long wait at genoa she dozed off again she woke to see the sea in the moonlight beneath hera lovely silvery sea coming right to the carriage the train seemed to be tripping on the edge of the mediterranean round bays and between dark rocks and under castles a nighttime fairyland for hours she watched spellbound spellbound by the magic of the world itself and she thought to herself whatever life may be and whatever horror men have made of it the world is a lovely place a magic place something to marvel over the world is an amazing place  this thought dozed her off again yet she had a consciousness of tunnels and hills and of broad marshes pallid under a moon and a coming dawn and in the dawn there was pisa she watched the word hanging in the station in the dimness pisa ciccio told her people were changing for florence it all seemed wonderful to herwonderful she sat and watched the black stationthen she heard the sound of the childs trumpet and it did not occur to her to connect the trains moving on with the sound of the trumpet  but she saw the golden dawn a golden sun coming out of level country she loved it she loved being in italy she loved the lounging carelessness of the train she liked having italian money hearing the italians round herthough they were neither as beautiful nor as melodious as she expected she loved watching the glowing antique landscape she read and read again e pericoloso sporgersi and e vietato fumare and the other little magical notices on the carriages ciccio told her what they meant and how to say them and sympathetic italians opposite at once asked him if they were married and who and what his bride was and they gazed at her with bright approving eyes though she felt terribly bedraggled and travelworn  you come from england yes nice contry said a man in a corner leaning forward to make this display of his linguistic capacity  not so nice as this said alvina  eh  alvina repeated herself  not so nice oh no fog eh the fat man whisked his fingers in the air to indicate fog in the atmosphere but nice contry veryconvenient  he sat up in triumph having achieved this word and the conversation once more became a spatter of italian the women were very interested they looked at alvina at every atom of her and she divined that they were wondering if she was already with child sure enough they were asking ciccio in italian if she was making him a baby but he shook his head and did not know just a bit constrained so they ate slices of sausages and bread and fried riceballs with wonderfully greasy fingers and they drank red wine in big throatfuls out of bottles and they offered their fare to ciccio and alvina and were charmed when she said to ciccio she would have some bread and sausage he picked the strips off the sausage for her with his fingers and made her a sandwich with a roll the women watched her bite it and brighteyed and pleased they said nodding their heads  buono buono  and she who knew this word understood and replied  yes good buono nodding her head likewise which caused immense satisfaction the women showed the whole paper of sausage slices and nodded and beamed and said  se vuole ancora  and alvina bit her wide sandwich and smiled and said  yes awfully nice  and the women looked at each other and said something and ciccio interposed shaking his head but one woman ostentatiously wiped a bottle mouth with a clean handkerchief and offered the bottle to alvina saying  vino buono vecchio vecchio nodding violently and indicating that she should drink she looked at ciccio and he looked back at her doubtingly  shall i drink some she said  if you like he replied making an italian gesture of indifference  so she drank some of the wine and it dribbled on to her chin she was not good at managing a bottle but she liked the feeling of warmth it gave her she was very tired  si piace piace  do you like it interpreted ciccio  yes very much what is very much she asked of ciccio  molto  si molto of course i knew molto from music she added  the women made noises and smiled and nodded and so the train pulsed on till they came to rome there was again the wild scramble with luggage a general leave taking and then the masses of people on the station at rome roma roma what was it to alvina but a name and a crowded excited station and ciccio running after the luggage and the pair of them eating in a station restaurant  almost immediately after eating they were in the train once more with new fellow travellers running south this time towards naples in a daze of increasing weariness alvina watched the dreary to her sordidseeming campagna that skirts the railway the broken aqueduct trailing in the near distance over the stricken plain she saw a tramcar far out from everywhere running up to cross the railway she saw it was going to frascati  and slowly the hills approachedthey passed the vines of the foothills the reeds and were among the mountains wonderful little towns perched fortified on rocks and peaks mountains rose straight up off the level plain like old topographical prints rivers wandered in the wild rocky places it all seemed ancient and shaggy savage still under all its remote civilization this region of the alban mountains south of rome so the train clambered up and down and went round corners  they had not far to go now alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like they were going to ciccios native village they were to stay in the house of his uncle his mothers brother this uncle had been a model in london he had built a house on the land left by ciccios grandfather he lived alone now for his wife was dead and his children were abroad giuseppe was his son giuseppe of battersea in whose house alvina had stayed  this much alvina knew she knew that a portion of the land down at pescocalascio belonged to ciccio a bit of halfsavage ancient earth that had been left to his mother by old francesco califano her hardgrinding peasant father this land remained integral in the property and was worked by ciccios two uncles pancrazio and giovanni pancrazio was the welltodo uncle who had been a model and had built a villa giovanni was not much good that was how ciccio put it  they expected pancrazio to meet them at the station ciccio collected his bundles and put his hat straight and peered out of the window into the steep mountains of the afternoon there was a town in the opening between steep hills a town on a flat plain that ran into the mountains like a gulf the train drew up they had arrived  alvina was so tired she could hardly climb down to the platform it was about four oclock ciccio looked up and down for pancrazio but could not see him so he put his luggage into a pile on the platform told alvina to stand by it whilst he went off for the registered boxes a porter came and asked her questions of which she understood nothing then at last came ciccio shouldering one small trunk whilst a porter followed shouldering another out they trotted leaving alvina abandoned with the pile of hand luggage she waited the train drew out ciccio and the porter came bustling back they took her out through the little gate to where in the flat desert space behind the railway stood two great drab motoromnibuses and a rank of open carriages ciccio was handing up the handbags to the roof of one of the big postomnibuses when it was finished the man on the roof came down and ciccio gave him and the station porter each sixpence the stationporter immediately threw his coin on the ground with a gesture of indignant contempt spread his arms wide and expostulated violently ciccio expostulated back again and they pecked at each other verbally like two birds it ended by the rolling up of the burly black moustached driver of the omnibus whereupon ciccio quite amicably gave the porter two nickel twopences in addition to the sixpence whereupon the porter quite lovingly wished him buon viaggio  so alvina was stowed into the body of the omnibus with ciccio at her side they were no sooner seated than a voice was heard in beautifullymodulated english  you are here why how have i missed you  it was pancrazio a smallish rather batteredlooking shabby italian of sixty or more with a big moustache and reddishrimmed eyes and a deeplylined face he was presented to alvina  how have i missed you he said i was on the station when the train came and i did not see you  but it was evident he had taken wine he had no further opportunity to talk the compartment was full of large mountainpeasants with black hats and big cloaks and overcoats they found pancrazio a seat at the far end and there he sat with his deeplylined impassive face and slightly glazed eyes he had yellowbrown eyes like ciccio but in the uncle the eyelids dropped in a curious heavy way the eyes looked dull like those of some old rakish tomcat they were slightly rimmed with red a curious person and his english though slow was beautifully pronounced he glanced at alvina with slow impersonal glances not at all a stare and he sat for the most part impassive and abstract as a red indian  at the last moment a large black priest was crammed in and the door shut behind him every available seat was let down and occupied the second great postomnibus rolled away and then the one for mola followed rolling alvina and ciccio over the next stage of their journey  the sun was already slanting to the mountain tops shadows were falling on the gulf of the plain the omnibus charged at a great speed along a straight white road which cut through the cultivated level straight towards the core of the mountain by the roadside peasant men in cloaks peasant women in fullgathered dresses with white bodices or blouses having great full sleeves tramped in the ridge of grass driving cows or goats or leading heavilyladen asses the women had coloured kerchiefs on their heads like the women alvina remembered at the sundayschool treats who used to tell fortunes with green little lovebirds and they all tramped along towards the blue shadow of the closingin mountains leaving the peaks of the town behind on the left  at a branchroad the bus suddenly stopped and there it sat calmly in the road beside an icy brook in the falling twilight great mothwhite oxen waved past drawing a long low load of wood the peasants left behind began to come up again in picturesque groups the icy brook tinkled goats pigs and cows wandered and shook their bells along the grassy borders of the road and the flat unbroken fields being driven slowly home peasants jumped out of the omnibus on to the road to chatand a sharp air came in high overhead as the sun went down was the curious icy radiance of snow mountains and a pinkness while shadow deepened in the valley  at last after about half an hour the youth who was conductor of the omnibus came running down the wild sideroad everybody clambered in and away the vehicle charged into the neck of the plain with a growl and a rush it swooped up the first loop of the ascent great precipices rose on the right the ruddiness of sunset above them the road wound and swirled trying to get up the pass the omnibus pegged slowly up then charged round a corner swirled into another loop and pegged heavily once more it seemed dark between the closingin mountains the rocks rose very high the road looped and swerved from one side of the wide defile to the other the vehicle pulsed and persisted sometimes there was a house sometimes a wood of oaktrees sometimes the glimpse of a ravine then the tall white glisten of snow above the earthly blackness and still they went on and on up the darkness  peering ahead alvina thought she saw the hollow between the peaks which was the top of the pass and every time the omnibus took a new turn she thought it was coming out on the top of this hollow between the heights but nothe road coiled right away again  a wild little village came in sight this was the destination again no only the tall handsome mountain youth who had sat across from her descended grumbling because the bus had brought him past his road the driver having refused to pull up everybody expostulated with him and he dropped into the shadow the big priest squeezed into his place the bus wound on and on and always towards that hollow skyline between the high peaks  at last they ran up between buildings nipped between high rockfaces and out into a little marketplace the crown of the pass the luggage was got out and lifted down alvina descended there she was in a wild centre of an old unfinished little mountain town the façade of a church rose from a small eminence a white road ran to the right where a great open valley showed faintly beyond and beneath low squalid sort of buildings stood aroundwith some high buildings and there were bare little trees the stars were in the sky the air was icy people stood darkly excitedly about women with an odd shellpattern headdress of gofered linen something like a parlourmaids cap came and stared hard they were hardfaced mountain women  pancrazio was talking to ciccio in dialect  i couldnt get a cart to come down he said in english but i shall find one here now what will you do put the luggage in grazias place while you wait  they went across the open place to a sort of shop called the post restaurant it was a little hole with an earthen floor and a smell of cats three crones were sitting over a low brass brazier in which charcoal and ashes smouldered men were drinking ciccio ordered coffee with rumand the hardfaced grazia in her unfresh headdress dabbled the little dirty coffeecups in dirty water took the coffeepot out of the ashes poured in the old black boiling coffee three parts full and slopped the cup over with rum then she dashed in a spoonful of sugar to add to the pool in the saucer and her customers were served  however ciccio drank up so alvina did likewise burning her lips smartly ciccio paid and ducked his way out  now what will you buy asked pancrazio  buy said ciccio  food said pancrazio have you brought food  no said ciccio  so they trailed up stony dark ways to a butcher and got a big red slice of meat to a baker and got enormous flat loaves sugar and coffee they bought and pancrazio lamented in his elegant english that no butter was to be obtained everywhere the hardfaced women came and stared into alvinas face asking questions and both ciccio and pancrazio answered rather coldly with some hauteur there was evidently not too much intimacy between the people of pescocalascio and these semitownfolk of ossona alvina felt as if she were in a strange hostile country in the darkness of the savage little mountain town  at last they were ready they mounted into a twowheeled cart alvina and ciccio behind pancrazio and the driver in front the luggage promiscuous the bigger things were left for the morrow it was icy cold with a flashing darkness the moon would not rise till later  and so without any light but that of the stars the cart went spanking and rattling downhill down the pale road which wound down the head of the valley to the gulf of darkness below down in the darkness into the darkness they rattled wildly and without heed the young driver making strange noises to his dim horse cracking a whip and asking endless questions of pancrazio  alvina sat close to ciccio he remained almost impassive the wind was cold the stars flashed and they rattled down the rough broad road under the rocks down and down in the darkness ciccio sat crouching forwards staring ahead alvina was aware of mountains rocks and stars  i didnt know it was so wild she said  it is not much he said there was a sad plangent note in his voice he put his hand upon her  you dont like it he said  i think its lovelywonderful she said dazed  he held her passionately but she did not feel she needed protecting it was all wonderful and amazing to her she could not understand why he seemed upset and in a sort of despair to her there was magnificence in the lustrous stars and the steepnesses magic rather terrible and grand  they came down to the level valley bed and went rolling along there was a house and a lurid red fire burning outside against the wall and dark figures about it  what is that she said what are they doing  i dont know said ciccio cosa fanno lieh  ka fanno il buga said the driver  they are doing some washing said pancrazio explanatory  washing said alvina  boiling the clothes said ciccio  on the cart rattled and bumped in the cold night down the highway in the valley alvina could make out the darkness of the slopes overhead she saw the brilliance of orion she felt she was quite quite lost she had gone out of the world over the border into some place of mystery she was lost to woodhouse to lancaster to englandall lost  they passed through a darkness of woods with a swift sound of cold water and then suddenly the cart pulled up some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness  we must get down herethe cart doesnt go any further said pancrazio  are we there said alvina  no it is about a mile but we must leave the cart  ciccio asked questions in italian alvina climbed down  goodevening are you cold came a loud raucous americanitalian female voice it was another relation of ciccios alvina stared and looked at the handsome sinister raucousvoiced young woman who stood in the light of the doorway  rather cold she said  come in and warm yourself said the young woman  my sisters husband lives here explained pancrazio  alvina went through the doorway into the room it was a sort of inn on the earthen floor glowed a great round pan of charcoal which looked like a flat pool of fire men in hats and cloaks sat at a table playing cards by the light of a small lamp a man was pouring wine the room seemed like a cave  warm yourself said the young woman pointing to the flat disc of fire on the floor she put a chair up to it and alvina sat down the men in the room stared but went on noisily with their cards ciccio came in with luggage men got up and greeted him effusively watching alvina between whiles as if she were some alien creature words of american sounded among the italian dialect  there seemed to be a confab of some sort aside ciccio came and said to her  they want to know if we will stay the night here  i would rather go on home she said  he averted his face at the word home  you see said pancrazio i think you might be more comfortable here than in my poor house you see i have no woman to care for it  alvina glanced round the cave of a room at the rough fellows in their black hats she was thinking how she would be more comfortable here  i would rather go on she said  then we will get the donkey said pancrazio stoically and alvina followed him out on to the highroad  from a shed issued a smallish brigandlooking fellow carrying a lantern he had his cloak over his nose and his hat over his eyes his legs were bundled with white rag crossed and crossed with hide straps and he was shod in silent skin sandals  this is my brother giovanni said pancrazio he is not quite sensible then he broke into a loud flood of dialect  giovanni touched his hat to alvina and gave the lantern to pancrazio then he disappeared returning in a few moments with the ass ciccio came out with the baggage and by the light of the lantern the things were slung on either side of the ass in a rather precarious heap pancrazio tested the rope again  there go on and i shall come in a minute  ayerer cried giovanni at the ass striking the flank of the beast then he took the leading rope and led up on the dark highway stalking with his dingy white legs under his muffled cloak leading the ass alvina noticed the shuffle of his skinsandalled feet the quiet step of the ass  she walked with ciccio near the side of the road he carried the lantern the ass with its load plodded a few steps ahead there were trees on the roadside and a small channel of invisible but noisy water big rocks jutted sometimes it was freezing the mountain highroad was congealed high stars flashed overhead  how strange it is said alvina to ciccio are you glad you have come home  it isnt my home he replied as if the word fretted him yes i like to see it again but it isnt the place for young people to live in you will see how you like it  she wondered at his uneasiness it was the same in pancrazio the latter now came running to catch them up  i think you will be tired he said you ought to have stayed at my relations house down there  no i am not tired said alvina but im hungry  well we shall eat something when we come to my house  they plodded in the darkness of the valley highroad pancrazio took the lantern and went to examine the load hitching the ropes a great flat loaf fell out and rolled away and smack came a little valise pancrazio broke into a flood of dialect to giovanni handing him the lantern ciccio picked up the bread and put it under his arm  break me a little piece said alvina  and in the darkness they both chewed bread  after a while pancrazio halted with the ass just ahead and took the lantern from giovanni  we must leave the road here he said  and with the lantern he carefully courteously showed alvina a small track descending in the side of the bank between bushes alvina ventured down the steep descent pancrazio following showing a light in the rear was giovanni making noises at the ass they all picked their way down into the great whitebouldered bed of a mountain river it was a wide strange bed of dry boulders pallid under the stars there was a sound of a rushing river glacialsounding the place seemed wild and desolate in the distance was a darkness of bushes along the far shore  pancrazio swinging the lantern they threaded their way through the uneven boulders till they came to the river itselfnot very wide but rushing fast a long slender drooping plank crossed over alvina crossed rather tremulous followed by pancrazio with the light and ciccio with the bread and the valise they could hear the click of the ass and the ejaculations of giovanni  pancrazio went back over the stream with the light alvina saw the dim ass come up wander uneasily to the stream plant his fore legs and sniff the water his nose right down  er err cried pancrazio striking the beast on the flank  but it only lifted its nose and turned aside it would not take the stream pancrazio seized the leading rope angrily and turned upstream  why were donkeys made they are beasts without sense his voice floated angrily across the chill darkness  ciccio laughed he and alvina stood in the wide stony riverbed in the strong starlight watching the dim figures of the ass and the men crawl upstream with the lantern  again the same performance the white muzzle of the ass stooping down to sniff the water suspiciously his hindquarters tilted up with the load again the angry yells and blows from pancrazio and the ass seemed to be taking the water but no after a long deliberation he drew back angry language sounded through the crystal air the group with the lantern moved again upstream becoming smaller  alvina and ciccio stood and watched the lantern looked small up the distance but therea clocking shouting splashing sound  he is going over said ciccio  pancrazio came hurrying back to the plank with the lantern  oh the stupid beast i could kill him cried he  isnt he used to the water said alvina  yes he is but he wont go except where he thinks he will go you might kill him before he should go  they picked their way across the river bed to the wild scrub and bushes of the farther side there they waited for the ass which came up clicking over the boulders led by the patient giovanni and then they took a difficult rocky track ascending between banks alvina felt the uneven scramble a great effort but she got up again they waited for the ass and then again they struck off to the right under some trees  a house appeared dimly  is that it said alvina  no it belongs to me but that is not my house a few steps further now we are on my land  they were treading a rough sort of grasslandand still climbing it ended in a sudden little scramble between big stones and suddenly they were on the threshold of a quite importantlooking house but it was all dark  oh exclaimed pancrazio they have done nothing that i told them he made queer noises of exasperation  what said alvina  neither made a fire nor anything wait a minute  the ass came up ciccio alvina giovanni and the ass waited in the frosty starlight under the wild house pancrazio disappeared round the back ciccio talked to giovanni he seemed uneasy as if he felt depressed  pancrazio returned with the lantern and opened the big door alvina followed him into a stonefloored wide passage where stood farm implements where a little of straw and beans lay in a corner and whence rose bare wooden stairs so much she saw in the glimpse of lanternlight as pancrazio pulled the string and entered the kitchen a dimwalled room with a vaulted roof and a great dark open hearth fireless a bare room with a little rough dark furniture an unswept stone floor ironbarred windows rather small in the deepthickness of the wall onehalf shut with a drab shutter it was rather like a room on the stage gloomy not meant to be lived in  i will make a light said pancrazio taking a lamp from the mantelpiece and proceeding to wind it up  ciccio stood behind alvina silent he had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest she turned to him  its a beautiful room she said  which with its high vaulted roof its dirty whitewash its great black chimney it really was but ciccio did not understand he smiled gloomily  the lamp was lighted alvina looked round in wonder  now i will make a fire you ciccio will help giovanni with the donkey said pancrazio scuttling with the lantern  alvina looked at the room there was a wooden settle in front of the hearth stretching its back to the room there was a little table under a square recessed window on whose sloping ledge were newspapers scattered letters nails and a hammer on the table were dried beans and two maize cobs in a corner were shelves with two chipped enamel plates and a small table underneath on which stood a bucket of water with a dipper then there was a wooden chest two little chairs and a litter of faggots cane vinetwigs bare maizehubs oaktwigs filling the corner by the hearth  pancrazio came scrambling in with fresh faggots  they have not done what i told them the tiresome people he said i told them to make a fire and prepare the house you will be uncomfortable in my poor home i have no woman nothing everything is wrong  he broke the pieces of cane and kindled them in the hearth soon there was a good blaze ciccio came in with the bags and the food  i had better go upstairs and take my things off said alvina i am so hungry  you had better keep your coat on said pancrazio the room is cold which it was icecold she shuddered a little she took off her hat and fur  shall we fry some meat said pancrazio  he took a fryingpan found lard in the wooden chestit was the foodchestand proceeded to fry pieces of meat in a fryingpan over the fire alvina wanted to lay the table but there was no cloth  we will sit here as i do to eat said pancrazio he produced two enamel plates and one soupplate three penny iron forks and two old knives and a little grey coarse salt in a wooden bowl these he placed on the seat of the settle in front of the fire ciccio was silent  the settle was dark and greasy alvina feared for her clothes but she sat with her enamel plate and her impossible fork a piece of meat and a chunk of bread and ate it was difficultbut the food was good and the fire blazed only there was a film of woodsmoke in the room rather smarting ciccio sat on the settle beside her and ate in large mouthfuls  i think its fun said alvina  he looked at her with dark haunted gloomy eyes she wondered what was the matter with him  dont you think its fun she said smiling  he smiled slowly  you wont like it he said  why not she cried in panic lest he prophesied truly  pancrazio scuttled in and out with the lantern he brought wrinkled pears and green round grapes and walnuts on a white cloth and presented them  i think my pears are still good he said you must eat them and excuse my uncomfortable house  giovanni came in with a big bowl of soup and a bottle of milk there was room only for three on the settle before the hearth he pushed his chair among the litter of firekindling and sat down he had bright bluish eyes and a fattish facewas a man of about fifty but had a simple kindly slightly imbecile face all the men kept their hats on  the soup was from giovannis cottage it was for pancrazio and him but there was only one spoon so pancrazio ate a dozen spoonfuls and handed the bowl to giovanniwho protested and tried to refusebut accepted and ate ten spoonfuls then handed the bowl back to his brother with the spoon so they finished the bowl between them then pancrazio found winea whitish wine not very good for which he apologized and he invited alvina to coffee which she accepted gladly  for though the fire was warm in front behind was very cold pancrazio stuck a long pointed stick down the handle of a saucepan and gave this utensil to ciccio to hold over the fire and scald the milk whilst he put the tin coffeepot in the ashes he took a long iron tube or blowpipe which rested on two little feet at the far end this he gave to giovanni to blow the fire  giovanni was a fireworshipper his eyes sparkled as he took the blowing tube he put fresh faggots behind the firethough pancrazio forbade him he arranged the burning faggots and then softly he blew a redhot fire for the coffee  basta basta said ciccio but giovanni blew on his eyes sparkling looking to alvina he was making the fire beautiful for her  there was one cup one enamelled mug one little bowl this was the coffeeservice pancrazio noisily ground the coffee he seemed to do everything old stooping as he was  at last giovanni took his leavethe kettle which hung on the hook over the fire was boiling over ciccio burnt his hand lifting it off and at last at last alvina could go to bed  pancrazio went first with the candlethen ciccio with the black kettlethen alvina the men still had their hats on their boots tramped noisily on the bare stairs  the bedroom was very cold it was a fairsized room with a concrete floor and white walls and windowdoor opening on a little balcony there were two high white beds on opposite sides of the room the washstand was a little tripod thing  the air was very cold freezing the stone floor was dead cold to the feet ciccio sat down on a chair and began to take off his boots she went to the window the moon had risen there was a flood of light on dazzling white snow tops glimmering and marvellous in the evanescent night she went out for a moment on to the balcony it was a wonderworld the moon over the snow heights the pallid valleybed away below the river hoarse and round about her scrubby bluedark foothills with twiggy trees magical it all wasbut so cold  you had better shut the door said ciccio  she came indoors she was dead tired and stunned with cold and hopelessly dirty after that journey ciccio had gone to bed without washing  why does the bed rustle she asked him  it was stuffed with dry maizeleaves the dry sheathes from the cobsstuffed enormously high he rustled like a snake among dead foliage  alvina washed her hands there was nothing to do with the water but throw it out of the door then she washed her face thoroughly in good hot water what a blessed relief she sighed as she dried herself  it does one good she sighed  ciccio watched her as she quickly brushed her hair she was almost stupefied with weariness and the cold bruising air blindly she crept into the high rustling bed but it was made high in the middle and it was icy cold it shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water she shuddered and became semiconscious with fatigue the blankets were heavy heavy she was dazed with excitement and wonder she felt vaguely that ciccio was miserable and wondered why  she woke with a start an hour or so later the moon was in the room she did not know where she was and she was frightened and she was cold a real terror took hold of her ciccio in his bed was quite still everything seemed electric with horror she felt she would die instantly everything was so terrible around her she could not move she felt that everything around her was horrific extinguishing her putting her out her very being was threatened in another instant she would be transfixed  making a violent effort she sat up the silence of ciccio in his bed was as horrible as the rest of the night she had a horror of him also what would she do where should she flee she was lostlostlost utterly  the knowledge sank into her like ice then deliberately she got out of bed and went across to him he was horrible and frightening but he was warm she felt his power and his warmth invade her and extinguish her the mad and desperate passion that was in him sent her completely unconscious again completely unconscious     chapter xv  the place called califano   there is no mistake about it alvina was a lost girl she was cut off from everything she belonged to ovid isolated in thrace might well lament the soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment this nourishment lacking nothing is well  at pescocalascio it was the mysterious influence of the mountains and valleys themselves which seemed always to be annihilating the englishwoman nay not only her but the very natives themselves ciccio and pancrazio clung to her essentially as if she saved them also from extinction it needed all her courage truly she had to support the souls of the two men  at first she did not realize she was only stunned with the strangeness of it all startled halfenraptured with the terrific beauty of the place halfhorrified by its savage annihilation of her but she was stunned the days went by  it seems there are places which resist us which have the power to overthrow our psychic being it seems as if every country has its potent negative centres localities which savagely and triumphantly refuse our living culture and alvina had struck one of them here on the edge of the abruzzi  she was not in the village of pescocalascio itself that was a long hours walk away pancrazios house was the chief of a tiny hamlet of three houses called califano because the califanos had made it there was the ancient savage hole of a house quite windowless where pancrazio and ciccios mother had been born the family home then there was pancrazios villa and then a little below another newish modern house in a sort of wild meadow inhabited by the peasants who worked the land ten minutes walk away was another cluster of seven or eight houses where giovanni lived but there was no shop no post nearer than pescocalascio an hours heavy road up deep and rocky wearying tracks  and yet what could be more lovely than the sunny days pure hot blue days among the mountain foothills irregular steep little hills half wild with twiggy brown oaktrees and marshes and broom heaths half cultivated in a wild scattered fashion lovely in the lost hollows beyond a marsh to see ciccio slowly ploughing with two great white oxen lovely to go with pancrazio down to the wild scrub that bordered the riverbed then over the whitebouldered massive desert and across stream to the other scrubby savage shore and so up to the highroad pancrazio was very happy if alvina would accompany him he liked it that she was not afraid and her sense of the beauty of the place was an infinite relief to him  nothing could have been more marvellous than the winter twilight sometimes alvina and pancrazio were late returning with the ass and then gingerly the ass would step down the steep banks already beginning to freeze when the sun went down and again and again he would balk the stream while a violetblue dusk descended on the white wide streambed and the scrub and lower hills became dark and in heaven oh almost unbearably lovely the snow of the near mountains was burning rose against the darkblue heavens how unspeakably lovely it was no one could ever tell the grand pagan twilight of the valleys savage cold with a sense of ancient gods who knew the right for human sacrifice it stole away the soul of alvina she felt transfigured in it clairvoyant in another mystery of life a savage hardness came in her heart the gods who had demanded human sacrifice were quite right immutably right the fierce savage gods who dipped their lips in blood these were the true gods  the terror the agony the nostalgia of the heathen past was a constant torture to her mediumistic soul she did not know what it was but it was a kind of neuralgia in the very soul never to be located in the human body and yet physical coming over the brow of a heathy rocky hillock and seeing ciccio beyond leaning deep over the plough in his white shirtsleeves following the slow waving mothpale oxen across a small track of land turned up in the heathen hollow her soul would go all faint she would almost swoon with realization of the world that had gone before and ciccio was so silent there seemed so much dumb magic and anguish in him as if he were for ever afraid of himself and the thing he was he seemed in his silence to concentrate upon her so terribly she believed she would not live  sometimes she would go gathering acorns large fine acorns a precious crop in that land where the fat pig was almost an object of veneration silently she would crouch filling the pannier and far off she would hear the sound of giovanni chopping wood of ciccio calling to the oxen or pancrazio making noises to the ass or the sound of a peasants mattock over all the constant speech of the passing river and the real breathing presence of the upper snows and a wild terrible happiness would take hold of her beyond despair but very like despair no one would ever find her she had gone beyond the world into the preworld she had reopened on the old eternity  and then maria the little elvish old wife of giovanni would come up with the cows one cow she held by a rope round its horns and she hauled it from the patches of young corn into the rough grass from the little plantation of trees in among the heath maria wore the fullpleated whitesleeved dress of the peasants and a red kerchief on her head but her dress was dirty and her face was dirty and the big gold rings of her ears hung from ears which perhaps had never been washed she was rather smokedried too from perpetual woodsmoke  maria in her red kerchief hauling the white cow and screaming at it would come laughing towards alvina who was rather afraid of cows and then screaming high in dialect maria would talk to her alvina smiled and tried to understand impossible it was not strictly a human speech it was rather like the crying of halfarticulate animals it certainly was not italian and yet alvina by dint of constant hearing began to pick up the coagulated phrases  she liked maria she liked them all they were all very kind to her as far as they knew but they did not know and they were kind with each other for they all seemed lost like lost forlorn aborigines and they treated alvina as if she were a higher being they loved her that she would strip maizecobs or pick acorns but they were all anxious to serve her and it seemed as if they needed some one to serve it seemed as if alvina the englishwoman had a certain magic glamour for them and so long as she was happy it was a supreme joy and relief to them to have her there but it seemed to her she would not live  and when she was unhappy ah the dreadful days of cold rain mingled with sleet when the world outside was more than impossible and the house inside was a horror the natives kept themselves alive by going about constantly working dumb and elemental but what was alvina to do  for the house was unspeakable the only two habitable rooms were the kitchen and alvinas bedroom and the kitchen with its little grated windows high up in the wall one of which had a broken pane and must keep onehalf of its shutters closed was like a dark cavern vaulted and bitter with woodsmoke seated on the settle before the fire the hard greasy settle alvina could indeed keep the fire going with faggots of green oak but the smoke hurt her chest she was not clean for one moment and she could do nothing else the bedroom again was just impossibly cold and there was no other place and from far away came the wild braying of an ass primeval and desperate in the snow  the house was quite large but uninhabitable downstairs on the left of the wide passage where the ass occasionally stood out of the weather and where the chickens wandered in search of treasure was a big long apartment where pancrazio kept implements and tools and potatoes and pumpkins and where four or five rabbits hopped unexpectedly out of the shadows opposite this on the right was the cantina a dark place with winebarrels and more agricultural stores this was the whole of the downstairs  going upstairs half way up at the turn of the stairs was the opening of a sort of barn a great wirenetting behind which showed a glow of orange maizecobs and some wheat upstairs were four rooms but alvinas room alone was furnished pancrazio slept in the unfurnished bedroom opposite on a pile of old clothes beyond was a room with litter in it a chest of drawers and rubbish of old books and photographs pancrazio had brought from england there was a battered photograph of lord leighton among others the fourth room approached through the cornchamber was always locked  outside was just as hopeless there had been a little garden within the stone enclosure but fowls geese and the ass had made an end of this fowldroppings were everywhere indoors and out the ass left his pile of droppings to steam in the winter air on the threshold while his heartrending bray rent the air roads there were none only deep tracks like profound ruts with rocks in them in the hollows and rocky grooved tracks over the brows the hollow grooves were full of mud and water and one struggled slipperily from rock to rock or along narrow grassledges  what was to be done then on mornings that were dark with sleet pancrazio would bring a kettle of hot water at about halfpast eight for had he not travelled europe with english gentlemen as a sort of modelvalet had he not loved his english gentlemen even now he was infinitely happier performing these little attentions for alvina than attending to his wretched domains  ciccio rose early and went about in the haphazard useless way of italians all day long getting nothing done alvina came out of the icy bedroom to the black kitchen pancrazio would be gallantly heating milk for her at the end of a long stick so she would sit on the settle and drink her coffee and milk into which she dipped her dry bread then the day was before her  she washed her cup and her enamelled plate and she tried to clean the kitchen but pancrazio had on the fire a great black pot dangling from the chain he was boiling food for the eternal pigthe only creature for which any cooking was done ciccio was tramping in with faggots pancrazio went in and out back and forth from his pot  alvina stroked her brow and decided on a method once she was rid of pancrazio she would wash every cup and plate and utensil in boiling water well at last pancrazio went off with his great black pan and she set to but there were not six pieces of crockery in the house and not more than six cooking utensils these were soon scrubbed then she scrubbed the two little tables and the shelves she lined the foodchest with clean paper she washed the high windowledges and the narrow mantelpiece that had large mounds of dusty candlewax in deposits then she tackled the settle she scrubbed it also then she looked at the floor and even she english housewife as she was realized the futility of trying to wash it as well try to wash the earth itself outside it was just a piece of stonelaid earth she swept it as well as she could and made a little order in the faggotheap in the corner then she washed the little highup windows to try and let in light  and what was the difference a dank wet soapy smell and not much more maria had kept scuffling admiringly in and out crying her wonderment and approval she had most ostentatiously chased out an obtrusive hen from this temple of cleanliness and that was all  it was hopeless the same black walls the same floor the same cold from behind the same greenoak woodsmoke the same bucket of water from the wellthe same comeandgo of aimless busy men the same cackle of wet hens the same hopeless nothingness  alvina stood up against it for a time and then she caught a bad cold and was wretched probably it was the woodsmoke but her chest was raw she felt weak and miserable she could not sit in her bedroom for it was too cold if she sat in the darkness of the kitchen she was hurt with smoke and perpetually cold behind her neck and pancrazio rather resented the amount of faggots consumed for nothing the only hope would have been in work but there was nothing in that house to be done how could she even sew  she was to prepare the midday and evening meals but with no pots and over a smoking wood fire what could she prepare black and greasy she boiled potatoes and fried meat in lard in a longhandled frying pan then pancrazio decreed that maria should prepare macaroni with the tomato sauce and thick vegetable soup and sometimes polenta this coarse heavy food was wearying beyond words  alvina began to feel she would die in the awful comfortless meaninglessness of it all true sunny days returned and some magic but she was weak and feverish with her cold which would not get better so that even in the sunshine the crude comfortlessness and inferior savagery of the place only repelled her  the others were depressed when she was unhappy  do you wish you were back in england ciccio asked her with a little sardonic bitterness in his voice she looked at him without answering he ducked and went away  we will make a fireplace in the other bedroom said pancrazio  no sooner said than done ciccio persuaded alvina to stay in bed a few days she was thankful to take refuge then she heard a rare comeandgo pancrazio ciccio giovanni maria and a mason all set about the fireplace up and down stairs they went maria carrying stone and lime on her head and swerving in alvinas doorway with her burden perched aloft to shout a few unintelligible words in the intervals of limecarrying she brought the invalid her soup or her coffee or her hot milk  it turned out quite a good joba pleasant room with two windows that would have all the sun in the afternoon and would see the mountains on one hand the faroff village perched up on the other when she was well enough they set off one early monday morning to the market in ossona they left the house by starlight but dawn was coming by the time they reached the river at the highroad pancrazio harnessed the ass and after endless delay they jogged off to ossona the dawning mountains were wonderful dimgreen and mauve and rose the ground rang with frost along the roads many peasants were trooping to market women in their best dresses some of thick heavy silk with the white fullsleeved bodices dresses green lavender darkred with gay kerchiefs on the head men muffled in cloaks treading silently in their pointed skin sandals asses with loads carts full of peasants a belated cow  the market was lovely there in the crown of the pass in the old town on the frosty sunny morning bulls cows sheep pigs goats stood and lay about under the bare little trees on the platform high over the valley some one had kindled a great fire of brushwood and men crowded round out of the blue frost from laden asses vegetables were unloaded from little carts all kinds of things boots pots tinware hats sweetthings and heaps of corn and beans and seeds by eight oclock in the december morning the market was in full swing a great crowd of handsome mountain people all peasants nearly all in costume with different headdresses  ciccio and pancrazio and alvina went quietly about they bought pots and pans and vegetables and sweetthings and thick rush matting and two wooden armchairs and one old soft armchair going quietly and bargaining modestly among the crowd as anglicized italians do  the sun came on to the market at about nine oclock and then from the terrace of the town gate alvina looked down on the wonderful sight of all the coloured dresses of the peasant women the black hats of the men the heaps of goods the squealing pigs the pale lovely cattle the many tethered assesand she wondered if she would die before she became one with it altogether it was impossible for her to become one with it altogether ciccio would have to take her to england again or to america he was always hinting at america  but then italy might enter the war even here it was the great theme of conversation she looked down on the seethe of the market the sun was warm on her ciccio and pancrazio were bargaining for two cowskin rugs she saw ciccio standing with his head rather forward her husband she felt her heart die away within her  all those other peasant women did they feel as she didthe same sort of acquiescent passion the same lapse of life she believed they did the same helpless passion for the man the same remoteness from the worlds actuality probably under all their tension of money and moneygrubbing and vindictive mountain morality and rather horrible religion probably they felt the same she was one with them but she could never endure it for a lifetime it was only a test on her ciccio must take her to america or englandto america preferably  and even as he turned to look for her she felt a strange thrilling in her bowels a sort of trill strangely within her yet extraneous to her she caught her hand to her flank and ciccio was looking up for her from the market beneath searching with that quick hasty look he caught sight of her she seemed to glow with a delicate light for him there beyond all the women he came straight towards her smiling his slow enigmatic smile he could not bear it if he lost her she knew how he loved heralmost inhumanly elementally without communication and she stood with her hand to her side her face frightened she hardly noticed him it seemed to her she was with child and yet in the whole marketplace she was aware of nothing but him  we have bought the skins he said twentyseven lire each  she looked at him his dark skin his golden eyesso near to her so unified with her yet so incommunicably remote how far off was his being from hers  i believe im going to have a child she said  eh he ejaculated quickly but he had understood his eyes shone weirdly on her she felt the strange terror and loveliness of his passion and she wished she could lie down there by that town gate in the sun and swoon for ever unconscious living was almost too great a demand on her his yellow luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her there was nothing for her but to yield yield yield and yet she could not sink to earth  she saw pancrazio carrying the skins to the little cart which was tilted up under a small palestemmed tree on the platform above the valley then she saw him making his way quickly back through the crowd to rejoin them  did you feel something said ciccio  yeshere she said pressing her hand on her side as the sensation trilled once more upon her consciousness she looked at him with remote frightened eyes  thats good he said his eyes full of a triumphant incommunicable meaning  welland now said pancrazio coming up shall we go and eat something  they jogged home in the little flat cart in the wintry afternoon it was almost night before they had got the ass untackled from the shafts at the wild lonely house where pancrazio left the cart giovanni was there with the lantern ciccio went on ahead with alvina whilst the others stood to load up the ass by the highway  ciccio watched alvina carefully when they were over the river and among the dark scrub he took her in his arms and kissed her with long terrible passion she saw the snowridges flare with evening beyond his cheek they had glowed dawn as she crossed the river outwards they were whitefiery now in the dusk sky as she returned what strange valley of shadow was she threading what was the terrible mans passion that haunted her like a dark angel why was she so much beyond herself     chapter xvi  suspense   christmas was at hand there was a heap of maize cobs still unstripped alvina sat with ciccio stripping them in the cornplace  will you be able to stop here till the baby is born he asked her  she watched the films of the leaves come off from the burning gold maize cob under his fingers the long ruddy cone of fruition the heap of maize on one side burned like hot sunshine she felt it really gave off warmth it glowed it burned on the other side the filmy crackly sere sheaths were also faintly sunny again and again the long redgold full ear of corn came clear in his hands and was put gently aside he looked up at her with his yellow eyes  yes i think so she said will you  yes if they let me i should like it to be born here  would you like to bring up a child here she asked  you wouldnt be happy here so long he said sadly  would you  he slowly shook his head indefinite  she was settling down she had her room upstairs her cups and plates and spoons her own things pancrazio had gone back to his old habit he went across and ate with giovanni and maria ciccio and alvina had their meals in their pleasant room upstairs they were happy alone only sometimes the terrible influence of the place preyed on her  however she had a clean room of her own where she could sew and read she had written to the matron and mrs tuke and mrs tuke had sent books also she helped ciccio when she could and maria was teaching her to spin the white sheeps wool into coarse thread  this morning pancrazio and giovanni had gone off somewhere alvina and ciccio were alone on the place stripping the last maize suddenly in the grey morning air a wild music burst out the drone of a bagpipe and a mans high voice half singing half yelling a brief verse at the end of which a wild flourish on some other reedy wood instrument alvina sat still in surprise it was a strange high rapid yelling music the very voice of the mountains beautiful in our musical sense of the word it was not but oh the magic the nostalgia of the untamed heathen past which it evoked  it is for christmas said ciccio they will come every day now  alvina rose and went round to the little balcony two men stood below amid the crumbling of finely falling snow one the elder had a bagpipe whose bag was patched with shirting the younger was dressed in greenish clothes he had his face lifted and was yelling the verses of the unintelligible christmas ballad short rapid verses followed by a brilliant flourish on a short wooden pipe he held ready in his hand alvina felt he was going to be out of breath but no rapid and high came the next verse verse after verse with the wild scream on the little new pipe in between over the roar of the bagpipe and the crumbs of snow were like a speckled veil faintly drifting the atmosphere and powdering the littered threshold where they stooda threshold littered with faggots leaves straw fowls and geese and ass droppings and rag thrown out from the house and pieces of paper  the carol suddenly ended the young man snatched off his hat to alvina who stood above and in the same breath he was gone followed by the bagpipe alvina saw them dropping hurriedly down the incline between the twiggy wild oaks  they will come every day now till christmas said ciccio they go to every house  and sure enough when alvina went down in the cold silent house and out to the well in the still crumbling snow she heard the sound far off strange yelling wonderful and the same ache for she knew not what overcame her so that she felt one might go mad there in the veiled silence of these mountains in the great hilly valley cut off from the world  ciccio worked all day on the land or round about he was building a little earth closet also the obvious and unscreened place outside was impossible it was curious how little he went to pescocalascio how little he mixed with the natives he seemed always to withhold something from them only with his relatives of whom he had many he was more free in a kind of family intimacy  yet even here he was guarded his uncle at the mill an unwashed fat man with a wife who tinkled with gold and grime and who shouted a few lost words of american insisted on giving alvina wine and a sort of cake made with cheese and rice ciccio too was feasted in the dark hole of a room and the two natives seemed to press their cheer on alvina and ciccio wholeheartedly  how nice they are said alvina when she had left they give so freely  but ciccio smiled a wry smile silent  why do you make a face she said  its because you are a foreigner and they think you will go away again he said  but i should have thought that would make them less generous she said  no they like to give to foreigners they dont like to give to the people here giocomo puts water in the wine which he sells to the people who go by and if i leave the donkey in her shed i give marta maria something or the next time she wont let me have it ha they arethey are sly ones the people here  they are like that everywhere said alvina  yes but nowhere they say so many bad things about people as herenowhere where i have ever been  it was strange to alvina to feel the deepbedrock distrust which all the hillpeasants seemed to have of one another they were watchful venomous dangerous  ah said pancrazio i am glad there is a woman in my house once more  but did nobody come in and do for you before asked alvina why didnt you pay somebody  nobody will come said pancrazio in his slow aristocratic english nobody will come because i am a man and if somebody should see her at my house they will all talk  talk alvina looked at the deeplylined man of sixtysix but what will they say  many bad things many bad things indeed they are not good people here all saying bad things and all jealous they dont like me because i have a housethey think i am too much a signore they say to me why do you think you are a signore oh they are bad people envious you cannot have anything to do with them  they are nice to me said alvina  they think you will go away but if you stay they will say bad things you must wait oh they are evil people evil against one another against everybody but strangers who dont know them  alvina felt the curious passion in pancrazios voice the passion of a man who has lived for many years in england and known the social confidence of england and who coming back is deeply injured by the ancient malevolence of the remote somewhat gloomy hillpeasantry she understood also why he was so glad to have her in his house so proud why he loved serving her she seemed to see a fairness a luminousness in the northern soul something free touched with divinity such as these people here lacked entirely  when she went to ossona with him she knew everybody questioned him about her and ciccio she began to get the drift of the questionswhich pancrazio answered with reserve  and how long are they staying  this was an invariable envious question and invariably pancrazio answered with a reserved  some months as long as they like  and alvina could feel waves of black envy go out against pancrazio because she was domiciled with him and because she sat with him in the flat cart driving to ossona  yet pancrazio himself was a study he was thin and very shabby and rather out of shape only in his yellow eyes lurked a strange sardonic fire and a leer which puzzled her when ciccio happened to be out in the evening he would sit with her and tell her stories of lord leighton and millais and alma tadema and other academicians dead and living there would sometimes be a strange passivity on his worn face an impassive almost red indian look and then again he would stir into a curious arch malevolent laugh for all the world like a debauched old tomcat his narration was like this either simple bare stoical with a touch of nobility or else satiric malicious with a strange rather repellent jeering  leightonhe wasnt lord leighton thenhe wouldnt have me to sit for him because my figure was too poor he didnt like it he liked fair young men with plenty of flesh but once when he was doing a picturei dont know if you know it it is a crucifixion with a man on a cross and he described the picture no well the model had to be tied hanging on to a wooden cross and it made you suffer ah here the odd arch diabolic yellow flare lit up through the stoicism of pancrazios eyes because leighton he was cruel to his model he wouldnt let you rest damn you youve got to keep still till ive finished with you you devil so he said well for this man on the cross he couldnt get a model who would do it for him they all tried it once but they would not go again so they said to him he must try califano because califano was the only man who would stand it at last then he sent for me i dont like your damned figure califano he said to me but nobody will do this if you wont now will you do it yes i said i will so he tied me up on the cross and he paid me well so i stood it well he kept me tied up hanging you know forwards naked on this cross for four hours and then it was luncheon and after luncheon he would tie me again well i suffered i suffered so much that i must lean against the wall to support me to walk home and in the night i could not sleep i could cry with the pains in my arms and my ribs i had no sleep youve said youd do it so now you must he said to me and i will do it i said and so he tied me up this cross you know was on a little raised placei dont know what you call it  a platform suggested alvina  a platform now one day when he came to do something to me when i was tied up he slipped back over this platform and he pulled me who was tied on the cross with him so we all fell down he with the naked man on top of him and the heavy cross on top of us both i could not move because i was tied and it was so with me on top of him and the heavy cross that he could not get out so he had to lie shouting underneath me until some one came to the studio to untie me no we were not hurt because the top of the cross fell so that it did not crush us now you have had a taste of the cross i said to him yes you devil but i shant let you off he said to me  to make the time go he would ask me questions once he said now califano what time is it i give you three guesses and if you guess right once i give you sixpence so i guessed three oclock thats one now then what time is it again three oclock thats two guesses gone you silly devil now then what time is it so now i was obstinate and i said three oclock he took out his watch why damn you how did you know i give you a shilling it was three oclock as i said so he gave me a shilling instead of sixpence as he had said  it was strange in the silent winter afternoon downstairs in the black kitchen to sit drinking a cup of tea with pancrazio and hearing these stories of english painters it was strange to look at the battered figure of pancrazio and think how much he had been crucified through the long years in london for the sake of late victorian art it was strangest of all to see through his yellow often dull redrimmed eyes these blithe and wellconditioned painters pancrazio looked on them admiringly and contemptuously as an old rakish tomcat might look on such frivolous wellgroomed young gentlemen  as a matter of fact pancrazio had never been rakish or debauched but mountainmoral timid so that the queer halfsinister drop of his eyelids was curious and the strange wicked yellow flare that came into his eyes was almost frightening there was in the man a sort of sulphuryellow flame of passion which would light up in his battered body and give him an almost diabolic look alvina felt that if she were left much alone with him she would need all her english ascendancy not to be afraid of him  it was a sunday morning just before christmas when alvina and ciccio and pancrazio set off for pescocalascio for the first time snow had fallennot much round the house but deep between the banks as they climbed and the sun was very bright so that the mountains were dazzling the snow was wet on the roads they wound between oaktrees and under the broomscrub climbing over the jumbled hills that lay between the mountains until the village came near they got on to a broader track where the path from a distant village joined theirs they were all talking in the bright clear air of the morning  a little man came down an upper path as he joined them near the village he hailed them in english  good morning nice morning  does everybody speak english here asked alvina  i have been eighteen years in glasgow i am only here for a trip  he was a little italian shopkeeper from glasgow he was most friendly insisted on paying for drinks and coffee and almond biscuits for alvina evidently he also was grateful to britain  the village was wonderful it occupied the crown of an eminence in the midst of the wide valley from the terrace of the highroad the valley spread below with all its jumble of hills and two rivers set in the walls of the mountains a wide space but imprisoned it glistened with snow under the blue sky but the lowest hollows were brown in the distance ossona hung at the edge of a platform many villages clung like pale swarms of birds to the far slopes or perched on the hills beneath it was a world within a world a valley of many hills and townlets and streams shut in beyond access  pescocalascio itself was crowded the roads were sloppy with snow but none the less peasants in full dress their feet soaked in the skin sandals were trooping in the sun purchasing selling bargaining for cloth talking all the time in the shop which was also a sort of inn an ancient woman was making coffee over a charcoal brazier while a crowd of peasants sat at the tables at the back eating the food they had brought  post was due at midday ciccio went to fetch it whilst pancrazio took alvina to the summit to the castle there in the level region boys were snowballing and shouting the ancient castle badly cracked by the last earthquake looked wonderfully down on the valley of many hills beneath califano a speck down the left ossona a blot to the right suspended its towers and its castle clear in the light behind the castle of pescocalascio was a deep steep valley almost a gorge at the bottom of which a river ran and where pancrazio pointed out the electricity works of the village deep in the gloom above this gorge at the end rose the long slopes of the mountains up to the vivid snowand across again was the wall of the abruzzi  they went down past the ruined houses broken by the earthquake ciccio still had not come with the post a crowd surged at the postoffice door in a steep black wet sidestreet alvinas feet were sodden pancrazio took her to the place where she could drink coffee and a strega to make her warm on the platform of the highway above the valley people were parading in the hot sun alvina noticed some ultrasmart young men they came up to pancrazio speaking english alvina hated their cockney accent and florid showy vulgar presence they were more models pancrazio was cool with them  alvina sat apart from the crowd of peasants on a chair the old crone had ostentatiously dusted for her pancrazio ordered beer for himself ciccio came with letterslongdelayed letters that had been censored alvinas heart went down  the first she opened was from miss pinnegarall war and fear and anxiety the second was a letter a real insulting letter from dr mitchell i little thought at the time when i was hoping to make you my wife that you were carrying on with a dirty italian organgrinder so your fairseeming face covered the schemes and vice of your true nature well i can only thank providence which spared me the disgust and shame of marrying you and i hope that when i meet you on the streets of leicester square i shall have forgiven you sufficiently to be able to throw you a coin  here was a pretty little epistle in spite of herself she went pale and trembled she glanced at ciccio fortunately he was turning round talking to another man she rose and went to the ruddy brazier as if to warm her hands she threw on the screwedup letter the old crone said something unintelligible to her she watched the letter catch fireglanced at the peasants at the tableand out at the wide wild valley the world beyond could not help but it still had the power to injure one here she felt she had received a bitter blow a black hatred for the mitchells of this world filled her  she could hardly bear to open the third letter it was from mrs tuke and again all war would italy join the allies she ought to her every interest lay that way could alvina bear to be so far off when such terrible events were happening near home could she possibly be happy nurses were so valuable now she mrs tuke had volunteered she would do whatever she could she had had to leave off nursing jenifer who had an excellent scotch nurse much better than a mother well alvina and mrs tuke might yet meet in some hospital in france so the letter ended  alvina sat down pale and trembling pancrazio was watching her curiously  have you bad news he asked  only the war  ha and the italian gesture of halfbitter what can one do  they were talking warall talking war the dandy young models had left england because of the war expecting italy to come in and everybody talked talked talked alvina looked round her it all seemed alien to her bruising upon the spirit  do you think i shall ever be able to come here alone and do my shopping by myself she asked  you must never come alone said pancrazio in his curious benevolent courtesy either ciccio or i will come with you you must never come so far alone  why not she said  you are a stranger here you are not a contadina alvina could feel the oriental idea of women which still leaves its mark on the mediterranean threatening her with surveillance and subjection she sat in her chair with cold wet feet looking at the sunshine outside the wet snow the moving figures in the strong light the men drinking at the counter the cluster of peasant women bargaining for dressmaterial ciccio was still turning talking in the rapid way to his neighbour she knew it was war she noticed the movement of his finelymodelled cheek a little sallow this morning  and she rose hastily  i want to go into the sun she said  when she stood above the valley in the strong tiring light she glanced round ciccio inside the shop had risen but he was still turning to his neighbour and was talking with all his hands and all his body he did not talk with his mind and lips alone his whole physique his whole living body spoke and uttered and emphasized itself  a certain weariness possessed her she was beginning to realize something about him how he had no sense of home and domestic life as an englishman has ciccios home would never be his castle his castle was the piazza of pescocalascio his home was nothing to him but a possession and a hole to sleep in he didnt live in it he lived in the open air and in the community when the true italian came out in him his veriest home was the piazza of pescocalascio the little sort of marketplace where the roads met in the village under the castle and where the men stood in groups and talked talked talked this was where ciccio belonged his active mindful self his active mindful self was none of hers she only had his passive self and his family passion his masculine mind and intelligence had its home in the little public square of his village she knew this as she watched him now with all his body talking politics he could not break off till he had finished and then with a swift intimate handshake to the group with whom he had been engaged he came away putting all his interest off from himself  she tried to make him talk and discuss with her but he wouldnt an obstinate spirit made him darkly refuse masculine conversation with her  if italy goes to war you will have to join up she asked him  yes he said with a smile at the futility of the question  and i shall have to stay here  he nodded rather gloomily  do you want to go she persisted  no i dont want to go  but you think italy ought to join in  yes i do  then you do want to go  i want to go if italy goes inand she ought to go in  curious he was somewhat afraid of her he half venerated her and half despised her when she tried to make him discuss in the masculine way he shut obstinately against her something like a child and the slow fine smile of dislike came on his face instinctively he shut off all masculine communication from her particularly politics and religion he would discuss both violently with other men in politics he was something of a socialist in religion a freethinker but all this had nothing to do with alvina he would not enter on a discussion in english  somewhere in her soul she knew the finality of his refusal to hold discussion with a woman so though at times her heart hardened with indignant anger she let herself remain outside the more so as she felt that in matters intellectual he was rather stupid let him go to the piazza or to the wineshop and talk  to do him justice he went little pescocalascio was only half his own village the nostalgia the campanilismo from which italians suffer the craving to be in sight of the native churchtower to stand and talk in the native market place or piazza this was only half formed in ciccio taken away as he had been from pescocalascio when so small a boy he spent most of his time working in the fields and woods most of his evenings at home often weaving a special kind of fishnet or netbasket from fine frail strips of cane it was a work he had learned at naples long ago alvina meanwhile would sew for the child or spin wool she became quite clever at drawing the strands of wool from her distaff rolling them fine and even between her fingers and keeping her bobbin rapidly spinning away below dangling at the end of the thread to tell the truth she was happy in the quietness with ciccio now they had their own pleasant room she loved his presence she loved the quality of his silence so rich and physical she felt he was never very far away that he was a good deal a stranger in califano as she was that he clung to her presence as she to his then pancrazio also contrived to serve her and shelter her he too loved her for being there they both revered her because she was with child so that she lived more and more in a little isolate illusory wonderful world then content moreover because the living cost so little she had sixty pounds of her own money always intact in the little case and after all the highway beyond the river led to ossona and ossona gave access to the railway and the railway would take her anywhere  so the month of january passed with its short days and its bits of snow and bursts of sunshine on sunny days alvina walked down to the desolate riverbed which fascinated her when pancrazio was carrying up stone or lime on the ass she accompanied him and pancrazio was always carrying up something for he loved the extraneous jobs like building a fireplace much more than the heavy work of the land then she would find little tufts of wild narcissus among the rocks goldcentred pale little things many on one stem and their scent was powerful and magical like the sound of the men who came all those days and sang before christmas she loved them there was green hellebore too a fascinating plantand one or two little treasures the last of the rosecoloured alpine cyclamens near the earth with snakeskin leaves and so rose so rose like violets for shadowiness she sat and cried over the first she found heaven knows why  in february as the days opened the first almond trees flowered among grey olives in warm level corners between the hills but it was march before the real flowering began and then she had continual bowlfuls of white and blue violets she had sprays of almond blossom silverwarm and lustrous then sprays of peach and apricot pink and fluttering it was a great joy to wander looking for flowers she came upon a bankside all wide with lavender crocuses the sun was on them for the moment and they were opened flat great fivepointed sevenpointed lilac stars with burning centres burning with a strange lavender flame as she had seen some metal burn lilacflamed in the laboratory of the hospital at islington all down the oakdry bankside they burned their great exposed stars and she felt like going down on her knees and bending her forehead to the earth in an oriental submission they were so royal so lovely so supreme she came again to them in the morning when the sky was grey and they were closed sharp clubs wonderfully fragile on their stems of sap among leaves and old grass and wild periwinkle they had wonderful dark stripes running up their cheeks the crocuses like the clear proud stripes on a badgers face or on some proud cat she took a handful of the sappy shut striped flames in her room they opened into a grand bowl of lilac fire  march was a lovely month the men were busy in the hills she wandered extending her range sometimes with a strange fear but it was a fear of the elements rather than of man one day she went along the highroad with her letters towards the village of casa latina the highroad was depressing wherever there were houses for the houses had that sordid ramshackle slummy look almost invariable on an italian highroad they were patched with a hideous greenish mouldcolour blotched as if with leprosy it frightened her till pancrazio told her it was only the copper sulphate that had sprayed the vines hitched on to the walls but none the less the houses were sordid unkempt slummy one house by itself could make a complete slum  casa latina was across the valley in the shadow approaching it were rows of low cabinsfairly new they were the onestorey dwellings commanded after the earthquake and hideous they were the village itself was old dark in perpetual shadow of the mountain streams of cold water ran round it the piazza was gloomy forsaken but there was a great twintowered church wonderful from outside  she went inside and was almost sick with repulsion the place was large whitewashed and crowded with figures in glass cases and ex voto offerings the lousylooking dressedup dolls life size and tinselly that stood in the glass cases the bloodstreaked jesus on the crucifix the mouldering mumbling filthy peasant women on their knees all the sense of trashy repulsive degraded fetishworship was too much for her she hurried out shrinking from the contamination of the dirty leather doorcurtain  enough of casa latina she would never go there again she was beginning to feel that if she lived in this part of the world at all she must avoid the inside of it she must never if she could help it enter into any interior but her ownneither into house nor church nor even shop or postoffice if she could help it the moment she went through a door the sense of dark repulsiveness came over her if she was to save her sanity she must keep to the open air and avoid any contact with human interiors when she thought of the insides of the native people she shuddered with repulsion as in the great degraded church of casa latina they were horrible  yet the outside world was so fair corn and maize were growing green and silken vines were in the small bud everywhere little grape hyacinths hung their blue bells it was a pity they reminded her of the manybreasted artemis a picture of whom or of whose statue she had seen somewhere artemis with her clusters of breasts was horrible to her now she had come south nauseating beyond words and the milky grape hyacinths reminded her  she turned with thankfulness to the magenta anemones that were so gay some one told her that wherever venus had shed a tear for adonis one of these flowers had sprung they were not tearlike and yet their redpurple silkiness had something preworld about it at last the more she wandered the more the shadow of the bygone pagan world seemed to come over her sometimes she felt she would shriek and go mad so strong was the influence on her something preworld and it seemed to her now vindictive she seemed to feel in the air strange furies lemures things that had haunted her with their tombfrenzied vindictiveness since she was a child and had pored over the illustrated classical dictionary black and cruel presences were in the underair they were furtive and slinking they bewitched you with loveliness and lurked with fangs to hurt you afterwards there it was the fangs sheathed in beauty the beauty first and then horribly inevitably the fangs  being a great deal alone in the strange place fancies possessed her people took on strange shapes even ciccio and pancrazio and it came that she never wandered far from the house from her room after the first months she seemed to hide herself in her room there she sewed and spun wool and read and learnt italian her men were not at all anxious to teach her italian indeed her chief teacher at first was a young fellow called bussolo he was a model from london and he came down to califano sometimes hanging about anxious to speak english  alvina did not care for him he was a dandy with pale grey eyes and a heavy figure yet he had a certain penetrating intelligence  no this country is a country for old men it is only for old men he said talking of pescocalascio you wont stop here nobody young can stop here  the odd plangent certitude in his voice penetrated her and all the young people said the same thing they were all waiting to go away but for the moment the war held them up  ciccio and pancrazio were busy with the vines as she watched them hoeing crouching tying tending grafting mindless and utterly absorbed hour after hour day after day thinking vines living vines she wondered they didnt begin to sprout vinebuds and vine stems from their own elbows and neckjoints there was something to her unnatural in the quality of the attention the men gave to the wine it was a sort of worship almost a degradation again and heaven knows pancrazios wine was poor enough his grapes almost invariably bruised with hailstones and halfrotten instead of ripe  the loveliness of april came with hot sunshine astonishing the ferocity of the sun when he really took upon himself to blaze alvina was amazed the burning day quite carried her away she loved it it made her quite careless about everything she was just swept along in the powerful flood of the sunshine in the end she felt that intense sunlight had on her the effect of night a sort of darkness and a suspension of life she had to hide in her room till the cold wind blew again  meanwhile the declaration of war drew nearer and became inevitable she knew ciccio would go and with him went the chance of her escape she steeled herself to bear the agony of the knowledge that he would go and she would be left alone in this place which sometimes she hated with a hatred unspeakable after a spell of hot intensely dry weather she felt she would die in this valley wither and go to powder as some exposed april roses withered and dried into dust against a hot wall then the cool wind came in a storm the next day there was grey sky and soft air the rosecoloured wild gladioli among the young green corn were a dream of beauty the morning of the world the lovely pristine morning of the world before our epoch began rosered gladioli among corn in among the rocks and small irises blackpurple and yellow blotched with brown like a wasp standing low in little desert places that would seem forlorn but for this weird darklustrous magnificence then there were the tiny irises only one finger tall growing in dry places frail as crocuses and much tinier and blue blue as the eye of the morning heaven which was a morning earlier more pristine than ours the lovely translucent pale irises tiny and morningblue they lasted only a few hours but nothing could be more exquisite like gods on earth it was the flowers that brought back to alvina the passionate nostalgia for the place the human influence was a bit horrible to her but the flowers that came out and uttered the earth in magical expression they cast a spell on her bewitched her and stole her own soul away from her  she went down to ciccio where he was weeding armfuls of rosered gladioli from the halfgrown wheat and cutting the lushness of the first weedy herbage he threw down his sheaves of gladioli and with his sickle began to cut the forest of bright yellow cornmarigolds he looked intent he seemed to work feverishly  must they all be cut she said as she went to him  he threw aside the great armful of yellow flowers took off his cap and wiped the sweat from his brow the sickle dangled loose in his hand  we have declared war he said  in an instant she realized that she had seen the figure of the old postcarrier dodging between the rocks rosered and goldyellow of the flowers swam in her eyes ciccios duskyellow eyes were watching her she sank on her knees on a sheaf of cornmarigolds her eyes watching him were vulnerable as if stricken to death indeed she felt she would die  you will have to go she said  yes we shall all have to go there seemed a certain sound of triumph in his voice cruel  she sank lower on the flowers and her head dropped but she would not be beaten she lifted her face  if you are very long she said i shall go to england i cant stay here very long without you  you will have pancrazioand the child he said  yes but i shall still be myself i cant stay here very long without you i shall go to england  he watched her narrowly  i dont think theyll let you he said  yes they will  at moments she hated him he seemed to want to crush her altogether she was always making little plans in her mindhow she could get out of that great cruel valley and escape to rome to english people she would find the english consul and he would help her she would do anything rather than be really crushed she knew how easy it would be once her spirit broke for her to die and be buried in the cemetery at pescocalascio  and they would all be so sentimental about herjust as pancrazio was she felt that in some way pancrazio had killed his wifenot consciously but unconsciously as ciccio might kill her pancrazio would tell alvina about his wife and her ailments and he seemed always anxious to prove that he had been so good to her no doubt he had been good to her also but there was something underneathmalevolent in his spirit some cagedin sort of cruelty malignant beyond his control it crept out in his stories and it revealed itself in his fear of his dead wife alvina knew that in the night the elderly man was afraid of his dead wife and of her ghost or her avenging spirit he would huddle over the fire in fear in the same way the cemetery had a fascination of horror for himas she noticed for most of the natives it was an ugly square place all stone slabs and wallcupboards enclosed in foursquare stone walls and lying away beneath pescocalascio village obvious as if it were on a plate  that is our cemetery pancrazio said pointing it out to her where we shall all be carried some day  and there was fear horror in his voice he told her how the men had carried his wife therea long journey over the hilltracks almost two hours  these were days of waitinghorrible days of waiting for ciccio to be called up one batch of young men left the villageand there was a lugubrious sort of saturnalia men and women alike got rather drunk the young men left amid howls of lamentation and shrieks of distress crowds accompanied them to ossona whence they were marched towards the railway it was a horrible event  a shiver of horror and death went through the valley in a lugubrious way they seemed to enjoy it  youll never be satisfied till youve gone she said to ciccio why dont they be quick and call you  it will be next week he said looking at her darkly in the twilight he came to her when she could hardly see him  are you sorry you came here with me allaye he asked there was malice in the very question  she put down the spoon and looked up from the fire he stood shadowy his head ducked forward the firelight faint on his enigmatic timeless halfsmiling face  im not sorry she answered slowly using all her courage because i love you  she crouched quite still on the hearth he turned aside his face after a moment or two he went out she stirred her pot slowly and sadly she had to go downstairs for something  and there on the landing she saw him standing in the darkness with his arm over his face as if fending a blow  what is it she said laying her hand on him he uncovered his face  i would take you away if i could he said  i can wait for you she answered  he threw himself in a chair that stood at a table there on the broad landing and buried his head in his arms  dont wait for me dont wait for me he cried his voice muffled  why not she said filled with terror he made no sign why not she insisted and she laid her fingers on his head  he got up and turned to her  i love you even if it kills me she said  but he only turned aside again leaned his arm against the wall and hid his face utterly noiseless  what is it she said what is it i dont understand he wiped his sleeve across his face and turned to her  i havent any hope he said in a dull dogged voice  she felt her heart and the child die within her  why she said  was she to bear a hopeless child  you have hope dont make a scene she snapped and she went downstairs as she had intended  and when she got into the kitchen she forgot what she had come for she sat in the darkness on the seat with all life gone dark and still death and eternity settled down on her death and eternity were settled down on her as she sat alone and she seemed to hear him moaning upstairsi cant come back i cant come back she heard it she heard it so distinctly that she never knew whether it had been an actual utterance or whether it was her inner ear which had heard the inner unutterable sound she wanted to answer to call to him but she could not heavy mute powerless there she sat like a lump of darkness in that doomed italian kitchen i cant come back she heard it so fatally  she was interrupted by the entrance of pancrazio  oh he cried startled when having come near the fire he caught sight of her and he said something frightened in italian  is it you why are you in the darkness he said  i am just going upstairs again  you frightened me  she went up to finish the preparing of the meal ciccio came down to pancrazio the latter had brought a newspaper the two men sat on the settle with the lamp between them reading and talking the news  ciccios group was called up for the following week as he had said the departure hung over them like a doom those were perhaps the worst days of all the days of the impending departure neither of them spoke about it  but the night before he left she could bear the silence no more  you will come back wont you she said as he sat motionless in his chair in the bedroom it was a hot luminous night there was still a late scent of orange blossom from the garden the nightingale was shaking the air with his sound at times other honey scents wafted from the hills  you will come back she insisted  who knows he replied  if you make up your mind to come back you will come back we have our fate in our hands she said  he smiled slowly  you think so he said  i know it if you dont come back it will be because you dont want tono other reason it wont be because you cant it will be because you dont want to  who told you so he asked with the same cruel smile  i know it she said  all right he answered  but he still sat with his hands abandoned between his knees  so make up your mind she said  he sat motionless for a long while while she undressed and brushed her hair and went to bed and still he sat there unmoving like a corpse it was like having some unnatural doomed unbearable presence in the room she blew out the light that she need not see him but in the darkness it was worse  at last he stirredhe rose he came hesitating across to her  ill come back allaye he said quietly be damned to them all she heard unspeakable pain in his voice  to whom she said sitting up  he did not answer but put his arms round her  ill come back and well go to america he said  youll come back to me she whispered in an ecstasy of pain and relief it was not her affair where they should go so long as he really returned to her  ill come back he said  sure she whispered straining him to her
