uncle toms cabin sunny memories of foreign lands etc   boston phillips sampson and company 13 winter street 1855  entered according to act of congress in the year 1855 by phillips sampson and company in the clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts  stereotyped at the boston stereotype foundry     illustration truly yours h b stowe     introduction   mr g b emerson in his late report to the legislature of massachusetts on the trees and shrubs of that state thus describes the may flower  often from beneath the edge of a snow bank are seen rising the fragrant pearlywhite or rosecolored flowers of this earliest harbinger of spring  it abounds in the edges of the woods about plymouth as elsewhere and must have been the first flower to salute the stormbeaten crew of the mayflower on the conclusion of their first terrible winter their descendants have thence piously derived the name although its bloom is often passed before the coming in of may  no flower could be more appropriately selected as an emblem token by the descendants of the puritans though so fragrant and graceful it is invariably the product of the hardest and most rocky soils and seems to draw its ethereal beauty of color and wealth of perfume rather from the air than from the slight hold which its rootlets take of the earth it may often be found in fullest beauty matting a granite lodge with scarcely any perceptible soil for its support  what better emblem of that faith and hope and piety by which our fathers were supported in dreary and barren enterprises and which drew their life and fragrance from heaven more than earth  the may flower was therefore many years since selected by the author as the title of a series of new england sketches that work had comparatively a limited circulation and is now entirely out of print its articles are republished in the present volume with other miscellaneous writings which have from time to time appeared in different periodicals

odor and languor from the orient or chivalry from the occident or gayety from france or vigor from england no no these are all too oldtoo romanceliketoo obviously picturesque for me no let me turn to my own landmy own new england the land of bright fires and strong hearts the land of deeds and not of words the land of fruits and not of flowers the land often spoken against yet always respected the latchet of whose shoes the nations of the earth are not worthy to unloose  now from this very heroic apostrophe you may suppose that i have something very heroic to tell by no means it is merely a little introductory breeze of patriotism such as occasionally brushes over every mind bearing on its wings the remembrance of all we ever loved or cherished in the land of our early years and if it should seem to be rodomontade to any people in other parts of the earth let them only imagine it to be said about old kentuck old england or any other corner of the world in which they happened to be born and they will find it quite rational  but as touching our story it is time to begin did you ever see the little village of newbury in new england i dare say you never did for it was just one of those out of the way places where nobody ever came unless they came on purpose a green little hollow wedged like a birds nest between half a dozen high hills that kept off the wind and kept out foreigners so that the little place was as straitly sui generis as if there were not another in the world the inhabitants were all of that respectable old standfast family who make it a point to be born bred married die and be buried all in the selfsame spot there were just so many houses and just so many people lived in them and nobody ever seemed to be sick or to die either at least while i was there the natives grew old till they could not grow any older and then they stood still and lasted from generation to generation there was too an unchangeability about all the externals of newbury here was a red house and there was a brown house and across the way was a yellow house and there was a straggling rail fence or a tribe of mullein stalks between the minister lived here and squire moses lived there and deacon hart lived under the hill and messrs nadab and abihu peters lived by the cross road and the old widder smith lived by the meeting house and ebenezer camp kept a shoemakers shop on one side and patience mosely kept a milliners shop in front and there was old comfort scran who kept store for the whole town and sold axe heads brass thimbles licorice ball fancy handkerchiefs and every thing else you can think of here too was the general post office where you might see letters marvellously folded directed wrong side upward stamped with a thimble and superscribed to some of the dollys or pollys or peters or moseses aforenamed or not named  for the rest as to manners morals arts and sciences the people in newbury always went to their parties at three oclock in the afternoon and came home before dark always stopped all work the minute the sun was down on saturday night always went to meeting on sunday had a school house with all the ordinary inconveniences were in neighborly charity with each other read their bibles feared their god and were content with such things as they hadthe best philosophy after all such was the place into which master james benton made an irruption in the year eighteen hundred and no matter what now this james is to be our hero and he is just the hero for a sensationat least so you would have thought if you had been in newbury the week after his arrival master james was one of those wholehearted energetic yankees who rise in the world as naturally as cork does in water he possessed a great share of that characteristic national trait so happily denominated cuteness which signifies an ability to do every thing without trying and to know every thing without learning and to make more use of ones ignorance than other people do of their knowledge this quality in james was mingled with an elasticity of animal spirits a buoyant cheerfulness of mind which though found in the new england character perhaps as often as any where else is not ordinarily regarded as one of its distinguishing traits  as to the personal appearance of our hero we have not much to say of itnot half so much as the girls in newbury found it necessary to remark the first sabbath that he shone out in the meeting house there was a saucy frankness of countenance a knowing roguery of eye a joviality and prankishness of demeanor that was wonderfully captivating especially to the ladies  it is true that master james had an uncommonly comfortable opinion of himself a full faith that there was nothing in creation that he could not learn and could not do and this faith was maintained with an abounding and triumphant joyfulness that fairly carried your sympathies along with him and made you feel quite as much delighted with his qualifications and prospects as he felt himself there are two kinds of selfsufficiency one is amusing and the other is provoking his was the amusing kind it seemed in truth to be only the buoyancy and overflow of a vivacious mind delighted with every thing delightful in himself or others he was always ready to magnify his own praise but quite as ready to exalt his neighbor if the channel of discourse ran that way his own perfections being more completely within his knowledge he rejoiced in them more constantly but if those of any one else came within the same range he was quite as much astonished and edified as if they had been his own  master james at the time of his transit to the town of newbury was only eighteen years of age so that it was difficult to say which predominated in him most the boy or the man the belief that he could and the determination that he would be something in the world had caused him to abandon his home and with all his worldly effects tied in a blue cotton pocket handkerchief to proceed to seek his fortune in newbury and never did stranger in yankee village rise to promotion with more unparalleled rapidity or boast a greater plurality of employment he figured as schoolmaster all the week and as chorister on sundays and taught singing and reading in the evenings besides studying latin and greek with the minister nobody knew when thus fitting for college while he seemed to be doing every thing else in the world besides  james understood every art and craft of popularity and made himself mightily at home in all the chimney corners of the region round about knew the geography of every bodys cider barrel and apple bin helping himself and every one else therefrom with all bountifulness rejoicing in the good things of this life devouring the old ladies doughnuts and pumpkin pies with most flattering appetite and appearing equally to relish every body and thing that came in his way  the degree and versatility of his acquirements were truly wonderful he knew all about arithmetic and history and all about catching squirrels and planting corn made poetry and hoe handles with equal celerity wound yarn and took out grease spots for old ladies and made nosegays and knickknacks for young ones caught trout saturday afternoons and discussed doctrines on sundays with equal adroitness and effect in short mr james moved on through the place             victorious     happy and glorious  welcomed and privileged by every body in every place and when he had told his last ghost story and fairly flourished himself out of doors at the close of a long winters evening you might see the hard face of the good man of the house still phosphorescent with his departing radiance and hear him exclaim in a paroxysm of admiration that jemeses talk reely did beat all that he was sartainly most a miraculous cretur  it was wonderfully contrary to the buoyant activity of master jamess mind to keep a school he had moreover so much of the boy and the rogue in his composition that he could not be strict with the iniquities of the curly pates under his charge and when he saw how determinately every little heart was boiling over with mischief and motion he felt in his soul more disposed to join in and help them to a frolic than to lay justice to the line as was meet this would have made a sad case had it not been that the activity of the masters mind communicated itself to his charge just as the reaction of one brisk little spring will fill a manufactory with motion so that there was more of an impulse towards study in the golden goodnatured day of james benton than in the time of all that went before or came after him  but when school was out jamess spirits foamed over as naturally as a tumbler of soda water and he could jump over benches and burst out of doors with as much rapture as the veriest little elf in his company then you might have seen him stepping homeward with a most felicitous expression of countenance occasionally reaching his hand through the fence for a bunch of currants or over it after a flower or bursting into some back yard to help an old lady empty her wash tub or stopping to pay his devoirs to aunt this or mistress that for james well knew the importance of the powers that be and always kept the sunny side of the old ladies  we shall not answer for jamess general flirtations which were sundry and manifold for he had just the kindly heart that fell in love with every thing in feminine shape that came in his way and if he had not been blessed with an equal facility in falling out again we do not know what ever would have become of him but at length he came into an abiding captivity and it is quite time that he should for having devoted thus much space to the illustration of our hero it is fit we should do something in behalf of our heroine and therefore we must beg the readers attention while we draw a diagram or two that will assist him in gaining a right idea of her  do you see yonder brown house with its broad roof sloping almost to the ground on one side and a great unsupported sun bonnet of a piazza shooting out over the front door you must often have noticed it you have seen its tall well sweep relieved against the clear evening sky or observed the feather beds and bolsters lounging out of its chamber windows on a still summer morning you recollect its gate that swung with a chain and a great stone its pantry window latticed with little brown slabs and looking out upon a forest of bean poles you remember the zephyrs that used to play among its pea brush and shake the long tassels of its corn patch and how vainly any zephyr might essay to perform similar flirtations with the considerate cabbages that were solemnly vegetating near by then there was the whole neighborhood of purpleleaved beets and feathery parsnips there were the billows of gooseberry bushes rolled up by the fence interspersed with rows of quince trees and far off in one corner was one little patch penuriously devoted to ornament which flamed with marigolds poppies snappers and fouroclocks then there was a little box by itself with one rose geranium in it which seemed to look around the garden as much like a stranger as a french dancing master in a yankee meeting house  that is the dwelling of uncle lot griswold uncle lot as he was commonly called had a character that a painter would sketch for its lights and contrasts rather than its symmetry he was a chestnut burr abounding with briers without and with substantial goodness within he had the stronggrained practical sense the calculating worldly wisdom of his class of people in new england he had too a kindly heart but all the strata of his character were crossed by a vein of surly petulance that half way between joke and earnest colored every thing that he said and did  if you asked a favor of uncle lot he generally kept you arguing half an hour to prove that you really needed it and to tell you that he could not all the while be troubled with helping one body or another all which time you might observe him regularly making his preparations to grant your request and see by an odd glimmer of his eye that he was preparing to let you hear the conclusion of the whole matter which was well welli guessill go on the hulli spose i must at least so off he would go and work while the day lasted and then wind up with a farewell exhortation not to be a callin on your neighbors when you could get along without if any of uncle lots neighbors were in any trouble he was always at hand to tell them that they shouldnt a done so that it was strange they couldnt had more sense and then to close his exhortations by laboring more diligently than any to bring them out of their difficulties groaning in spirit meanwhile that folks would make people so much trouble  uncle lot father wants to know if you will lend him your hoe today says a little boy making his way across a cornfield  why dont your father use his own hoe  ours is broke  broke how came it broke  i broke it yesterday trying to hit a squirrel  what business had you to be hittin squirrels with a hoe say  but father wants to borrow yours  why dont you have that mended its a great pester to have every body usin a bodys things  well i can borrow one some where else i suppose says the suppliant after the boy has stumbled across the ploughed ground and is fairly over the fence uncle lot calls  halloo there you little rascal what are you goin off without the hoe for  i didnt know as you meant to lend it  i didnt say i wouldnt did i here come and take itstay ill bring it and do tell your father not to be a lettin you hunt squirrels with his hoes next time  uncle lots household consisted of aunt sally his wife and an only son and daughter the former at the time our story begins was at a neighboring literary institution aunt sally was precisely as clever as easy to be entreated and kindly in externals as her helpmate was the reverse she was one of those respectable pleasant old ladies whom you might often have met on the way to church on a sunday equipped with a great fan and a psalm book and carrying some dried orange peel or a stalk of fennel to give to the children if they were sleepy in meeting she was as cheerful and domestic as the tea kettle that sung by her kitchen fire and slipped along among uncle lots angles and peculiarities as if there never was any thing the matter in the world and the same mantle of sunshine seemed to have fallen on miss grace her only daughter  pretty in her person and pleasant in her ways endowed with native selfpossession and address lively and chatty having a mind and a will of her own yet goodhumored withal miss grace was a universal favorite it would have puzzled a city lady to understand how grace who never was out of newbury in her life knew the way to speak and act and behave on all occasions exactly as if she had been taught how she was just one of those wild flowers which you may sometimes see waving its little head in the woods and looking so civilized and gardenlike that you wonder if it really did come up and grow there by nature she was an adept in all household concerns and there was something amazingly pretty in her energetic way of bustling about and putting things to rights like most yankee damsels she had a longing after the tree of knowledge and having exhausted the literary fountains of a district school she fell to reading whatsoever came in her way true she had but little to read but what she perused she had her own thoughts upon so that a person of information in talking with her would feel a constant wondering pleasure to find that she had so much more to say of this that and the other thing than he expected  uncle lot like every one else felt the magical brightness of his daughter and was delighted with her praises as might be discerned by his often finding occasion to remark that he didnt see why the boys need to be all the time a comin to see grace for she was nothing so extrornary after all about all matters and things at home she generally had her own way while uncle lot would scold and give up with a regular good grace that was quite creditable  father says grace i want to have a party next week  you shant go to havin your parties grace i always have to eat bits and ends a fortnight after you have one and i wont have it so and so uncle lot walked out and aunt sally and miss grace proceeded to make the cake and pies for the party  when uncle lot came home he saw a long array of pies and rows of cakes on the kitchen table  gracegracegrace i say what is all this here flummery for  why it is to eat father said grace with a goodnatured look of consciousness  uncle lot tried his best to look sour but his visage began to wax comical as he looked at his merry daughter so he said nothing but quietly sat down to his dinner  father said grace after dinner we shall want two more candlesticks next week  why cant you have your party with what youve got  no father we want two more  i cant afford it gracetheres no sort of use ontand you shant have any  o father now do said grace  i wont neither said uncle lot as he sallied out of the house and took the road to comfort scrans store  in half an hour he returned again and fumbling in his pocket and drawing forth a candlestick levelled it at grace  theres your candlestick  but father i said i wanted two  why cant you make one do  no i cant i must have two  well then theres tother and heres a folderol for you to tie round your neck so saying he bolted for the door and took himself off with all speed it was much after this fashion that matters commonly went on in the brown house  but having tarried long on the way we must proceed with the main story  james thought miss grace was a glorious girl and as to what miss grace thought of master james perhaps it would not have been developed had she not been called to stand on the defensive for him with uncle lot for from the time that the whole village of newbury began to be wholly given unto the praise of master james uncle lot set his face as a flint against himfrom the laudable fear of following the multitude he therefore made conscience of stoutly gainsaying every thing that was said in his behalf which as james was in high favor with aunt sally he had frequent opportunities to do  so when miss grace perceived that uncle lot did not like our hero as much as he ought to do she of course was bound to like him well enough to make up for it certain it is that they were remarkably happy in finding opportunities of being acquainted that james waited on her as a matter of course from singing school that he volunteered making a new box for her geranium on an improved plan and above all that he was remarkably particular in his attentions to aunt sallya stroke of policy which showed that james had a natural genius for this sort of matters even when emerging from the meeting house in full glory with flute and psalm book under his arm he would stop to ask her how she did and if it was cold weather he would carry her foot stove all the way home from meeting discoursing upon the sermon and other serious matters as aunt sally observed in the pleasantest prettiest way that ever ye see this flute was one of the crying sins of james in the eyes of uncle lot james was particularly fond of it because he had learned to play on it by intuition and on the decease of the old pitchpipe which was slain by a fall from the gallery he took the liberty to introduce the flute in its place for this and other sins and for the good reasons above named uncle lots countenance was not towards james neither could he be moved to himward by any manner of means  to all aunt sallys good words and kind speeches he had only to say that he didnt like him that he hated to see him a manifesting and glorifying there in the front gallery sundays and a acting every where as if he was master of all he didnt like it and he wouldnt but our hero was no whit cast down or discomfited by the malcontent aspect of uncle lot on the contrary when report was made to him of divers of his hard speeches he only shrugged his shoulders with a very satisfied air and remarked that he knew a thing or two for all that  why james said his companion and chief counsellor do you think grace likes you  i dont know said our hero with a comfortable appearance of certainty  but you cant get her james if uncle lot is cross about it  fudge i can make uncle lot like me if i have a mind to try  well then jim youll have to give up that flute of yours i tell you now  fa sol lai can make him like me and my flute too  why how will you do it  o ill work it said our hero  well jim i tell you now you dont know uncle lot if you say so for he is just the settest critter in his way that ever you saw  i do know uncle lot though better than most folks he is no more cross than i am and as to his being set you have nothing to do but make him think he is in his own way when he is in yoursthat is all  well said the other but you see i dont believe it  and ill bet you a gray squirrel that ill go there this very evening and get him to like me and my flute both said james  accordingly the late sunshine of that afternoon shone full on the yellow buttons of james as he proceeded to the place of conflict it was a bright beautiful evening a thunder storm had just cleared away and the silver clouds lay rolled up in masses around the setting sun the rain drops were sparkling and winking to each other over the ends of the leaves and all the bluebirds and robins breaking forth into song made the little green valley as merry as a musical box  jamess soul was always overflowing with that kind of poetry which consists in feeling unspeakably happy and it is not to be wondered at considering where he was going that he should feel in a double ecstasy on the present occasion he stepped gayly along occasionally springing over a fence to the right to see whether the rain had swollen the trout brook or to the left to notice the ripening of mr somebodys watermelonsfor james always had an eye on all his neighbors matters as well as his own  in this way he proceeded till he arrived at the picket fence that marked the commencement of uncle lots ground here he stopped to consider just then four or five sheep walked up and began also to consider a loose picket which was hanging just ready to drop off and james began to look at the sheep well mister said he as he observed the leader judiciously drawing himself through the gap in with youjust what i wanted and having waited a moment to ascertain that all the company were likely to follow he ran with all haste towards the house and swinging open the gate pressed all breathless to the door  uncle lot there are four or five sheep in your garden uncle lot dropped his whetstone and scythe  ill drive them out said our hero and with that he ran down the garden alley and made a furious descent on the enemy bestirring himself as bunyan says lustily and with good courage till every sheep had skipped out much quicker than it skipped in and then springing over the fence he seized a great stone and nailed on the picket so effectually that no sheep could possibly encourage the hope of getting in again this was all the work of a minute and he was back again but so exceedingly out of breath that it was necessary for him to stop a moment and rest himself uncle lot looked ungraciously satisfied  what under the canopy set you to scampering so said he i could a driv out them critturs myself  if you are at all particular about driving them out yourself i can let them in again said james  uncle lot looked at him with an odd sort of twinkle in the corner of his eye  spose i must ask you to walk in said he  much obliged said james but i am in a great hurry so saying he started in very businesslike fashion towards the gate  youd better jest stop a minute  cant stay a minute  i dont see what possesses you to be all the while in sich a hurry a body would think you had all creation on your shoulders  just my situation uncle lot said james swinging open the gate  well at any rate have a drink of cider cant ye said uncle lot who was now quite engaged to have his own way in the case  james found it convenient to accept this invitation and uncle lot was twice as goodnatured as if he had staid in the first of the matter  once fairly forced into the premises james thought fit to forget his long walk and excess of business especially as about that moment aunt sally and miss grace returned from an afternoon call you may be sure that the last thing these respectable ladies looked for was to find uncle lot and master james têteàtête over a pitcher of cider and when as they entered our hero looked up with something of a mischievous air miss grace in particular was so puzzled that it took her at least a quarter of an hour to untie her bonnet strings but james staid and acted the agreeable to perfection first he must needs go down into the garden to look at uncle lots wonderful cabbages and then he promenaded all around the corn patch stopping every few moments and looking up with an appearance of great gratification as if he had never seen such corn in his life and then he examined uncle lots favorite apple tree with an expression of wonderful interest  i never he broke forth having stationed himself against the fence opposite to it what kind of an apple tree is that  its a bellflower or somethin another said uncle lot  why where did you get it i never saw such apples said our hero with his eyes still fixed on the tree  uncle lot pulled up a stalk or two of weeds and threw them over the fence just to show that he did not care any thing about the matter and then he came up and stood by james  nothin so remarkable as i know on said he  just then grace came to say that supper was ready once seated at table it was astonishing to see the perfect and smiling assurance with which our hero continued his addresses to uncle lot it sometimes goes a great way towards making people like us to take it for granted that they do already and upon this principle james proceeded he talked laughed told stories and joked with the most fearless assurance occasionally seconding his words by looking uncle lot in the face with a countenance so full of good will as would have melted any snowdrift of prejudices in the world  james also had one natural accomplishment more courtierlike than all the diplomacy in europe and that was the gift of feeling a real interest for any body in five minutes so that if he began to please in jest he generally ended in earnest with great simplicity of mind he had a natural tact for seeing into others and watched their motions with the same delight with which a child gazes at the wheels and springs of a watch to see what it will do  the rough exterior and latent kindness of uncle lot were quite a spiritstirring study and when tea was over as he and grace happened to be standing together in the front door he broke forth  i do really like your father grace  do you said grace  yes i do he has something in him and i like him all the better for having to fish it out  well i hope you will make him like you said grace unconsciously and then she stopped and looked a little ashamed  james was too well bred to see this or look as if grace meant any more than she saida kind of breeding not always attendant on more fashionable polishso he only answered  i think i shall grace though i doubt whether i can get him to own it  he is the kindest man that ever was said grace and he always acts as if he was ashamed of it  james turned a little away and looked at the bright evening sky which was glowing like a calm golden sea and over it was the silver new moon with one little star to hold the candle for her he shook some bright drops off from a rosebush near by and watched to see them shine as they fell while grace stood very quietly waiting for him to speak again  grace said he at last i am going to college this fall  so you told me yesterday said grace  james stooped down over graces geranium and began to busy himself with pulling off all the dead leaves remarking in the mean while  and if i do get him to like me grace will you like me too  i like you now very well said grace  come grace you know what i mean said james looking steadfastly at the top of the apple tree  well i wish then you would understand what i mean without my saying any more about it said grace  o to be sure i will said our hero looking up with a very intelligent air and so as aunt sally would say the matter was settled with no words about it  now shall we narrate how our hero as he saw uncle lot approaching the door had the impudence to take out his flute and put the parts together arranging and adjusting the stops with great composure  uncle lot said he looking up this is the best flute that ever i saw  i hate them tooting critturs said uncle lot snappishly  i declare i wonder how you can said james for i do think they exceed  so saying he put the flute to his mouth and ran up and down a long flourish  there what do you think of that said he looking in uncle lots face with much delight  uncle lot turned and marched into the house but soon faced to the rightabout and came out again for james was fingering yankee doodlethat appropriate national air for the descendants of the puritans  uncle lots patriotism began to bestir itself and now if it had been any thing as he said but that are fluteas it was he looked more than once at jamess fingers  how under the sun could you learn to do that said he  o its easy enough said james proceeding with another tune and having played it through he stopped a moment to examine the joints of his flute and in the mean time addressed uncle lot you cant think how grand this is for pitching tunesi always pitch the tunes on sunday with it  yes but i dont think its a right and fit instrument for the lords house said uncle lot  why not it is only a kind of a long pitchpipe you see said james and seeing the old one is broken and this will answer i dont see why it is not better than nothing  why yes it may be better than nothing said uncle lot but as i always tell grace and my wife it aint the right kind of instrument after all it aint solemn  solemn said james that is according as you work it see here now  so saying he struck up old hundred and proceeded through it with great perseverance  there now said he  well well i dont know but it is said uncle lot but as i said at first i dont like the look of it in meetin  but yet you really think it is better than nothing said james for you see i couldnt pitch my tunes without it  maybe tis said uncle lot but that isnt sayin much  this however was enough for master james who soon after departed with his flute in his pocket and graces last words in his heart soliloquizing as he shut the gate there now i hope aunt sally wont go to praising me for just so sure as she does i shall have it all to do over again  james was right in his apprehension uncle lot could be privately converted but not brought to open confession and when the next morning aunt sally remarked in the kindness of her heart  well i always knew you would come to like james uncle lot only responded who said i did like him  but im sure you seemed to like him last night  why i couldnt turn him out o doors could i i dont think nothin of him but what i always did  but it was to be remarked that uncle lot contented himself at this time with the mere general avowal without running it into particulars as was formerly his wont it was evident that the ice had begun to melt but it might have been a long time in dissolving had not collateral incidents assisted  it so happened that about this time george griswold the only son before referred to returned to his native village after having completed his theological studies at a neighboring institution it is interesting to mark the gradual development of mind and heart from the time that the whiteheaded bashful boy quits the country village for college to the period when he returns a formed and matured man to notice how gradually the rust of early prejudices begins to cleave from himhow his opinions like his handwriting pass from the cramped and limited forms of a country school into that confirmed and characteristic style which is to mark the man for life in george this change was remarkably striking he was endowed by nature with uncommon acuteness of feeling and fondness for reflectionqualities as likely as any to render a child backward and uninteresting in early life  when he left newbury for college he was a taciturn and apparently phlegmatic boy only evincing sensibility by blushing and looking particularly stupefied whenever any body spoke to him vacation after vacation passed and he returned more and more an altered being and he who once shrunk from the eye of the deacon and was ready to sink if he met the minister now moved about among the dignitaries of the place with all the composure of a superior being  it was only to be regretted that while the mind improved the physical energies declined and that every visit to his home found him paler thinner and less prepared in body for the sacred profession to which he had devoted himself but now he was returned a ministera real minister with a right to stand in the pulpit and preach and what a joy and glory to aunt sallyand to uncle lot if he were not ashamed to own it  the first sunday after he came it was known far and near that george griswold was to preach and never was a more ready and expectant audience  as the time for reading the first psalm approached you might see the whiteheaded men turning their faces attentively towards the pulpit the anxious and expectant old women with their little black bonnets bent forward to see him rise there were the children looking because every body else looked there was uncle lot in the front pew his face considerately adjusted there was aunt sally seeming as pleased as a mother could seem and miss grace lifting her sweet face to her brother like a flower to the sun there was our friend james in the front gallery his joyous countenance a little touched with sobriety and expectation in short a more embarrassingly attentive audience never greeted the first effort of a young minister under these circumstances there was something touching in the fervent selfforgetfulness which characterized the first exercises of the morningsomething which moved every one in the house  the devout poetry of his prayer rich with the orientalism of scripture and eloquent with the expression of strong yet chastened emotion breathed over his audience like music hushing every one to silence and beguiling every one to feeling in the sermon there was the strong intellectual nerve the constant occurrence of argument and statement which distinguishes a new england discourse but it was touched with life by the intense yet halfsubdued feeling with which he seemed to utter it like the rays of the sun it enlightened and melted at the same moment  the strong peculiarities of new england doctrine involving as they do all the hidden machinery of mind all the mystery of its divine relations and future progression and all the tremendous uncertainties of its eternal good or ill seemed to have dwelt in his mind to have burned in his thoughts to have wrestled with his powers and they gave to his manner the fervency almost of another world while the exceeding paleness of his countenance and a tremulousness of voice that seemed to spring from bodily weakness touched the strong workings of his mind with a pathetic interest as if the being so early absorbed in another world could not be long for this  when the services were over the congregation dispersed with the air of people who had felt rather than heard and all the criticism that followed was similar to that of old deacon hartan upright shrewd manwho as he lingered a moment at the church door turned and gazed with unwonted feeling at the young preacher  hes a blessed cretur said he the tears actually making their way to his eyes i haint been so near heaven this many a day hes a blessed cretur of the lord thats my mind about him  as for our friend james he was at first sobered then deeply moved and at last wholly absorbed by the discourse and it was only when meeting was over that he began to think where he really was  with all his versatile activity james had a greater depth of mental capacity than he was himself aware of and he began to feel a sort of electric affinity for the mind that had touched him in a way so new and when he saw the mild minister standing at the foot of the pulpit stairs he made directly towards him  i do want to hear more from you said he with a face full of earnestness may i walk home with you  it is a long and warm walk said george smiling  o i dont care for that if it does not trouble you said james and leave being gained you might have seen them slowly passing along under the trees james pouring forth all the floods of inquiry which the sudden impulse of his mind had brought out and supplying his guide with more questions and problems for solution than he could have gone through with in a month  i cannot answer all your questions now said he as they stopped at uncle lots gate  well then when will you said james eagerly let me come home with you tonight  the minister smiled assent and james departed so full of new thoughts that he passed grace without even seeing her from that time a friendship commenced between the two which was a beautiful illustration of the affinities of opposites it was like a friendship between morning and eveningall freshness and sunshine on one side and all gentleness and peace on the other  the young minister worn by longcontinued ill health by the fervency of his own feelings and the gravity of his own reasonings found pleasure in the healthful buoyancy of a youthful unexhausted mind while james felt himself sobered and made better by the moonlight tranquillity of his friend it is one mark of a superior mind to understand and be influenced by the superiority of others and this was the case with james the ascendency which his new friend acquired over him was unlimited and did more in a month towards consolidating and developing his character than all the four years course of a college our religious habits are likely always to retain the impression of the first seal which stamped them and in this case it was a peculiarly happy one the calmness the settled purpose the mild devotion of his friend formed a just alloy to the energetic and reckless buoyancy of jamess character and awakened in him a set of feelings without which the most vigorous mind must be incomplete  the effect of the ministrations of the young pastor in awakening attention to the subjects of his calling in the village was marked and of a kind which brought pleasure to his own heart but like all other excitement it tends to exhaustion and it was not long before he sensibly felt the decline of the powers of life to the best regulated mind there is something bitter in the relinquishment of projects for which we have been long and laboriously preparing and there is something far more bitter in crossing the longcherished expectations of friends all this george felt he could not bear to look on his mother hanging on his words and following his steps with eyes of almost childish delighton his singular father whose whole earthly ambition was bound up in his success and think how soon the candle of their old age must be put out when he returned from a successful effort it was painful to see the old man so evidently delighted and so anxious to conceal his triumph as he would seat himself in his chair and begin with george that are doctrine is rather of a puzzler but you seem to think youve got the run ont i should rely like to know what business you have to think you know better than other folks about it and though he would cavil most courageously at all georges explanations yet you might perceive through all that he was inly uplifted to hear how his boy could talk  if george was engaged in argument with any one else he would sit by with his head bowed down looking out from under his shaggy eyebrows with a shamefaced satisfaction very unusual with him expressions of affection from the naturally gentle are not half so touching as those which are forced out from the hardfavored and severe and george was affected even to pain by the evident pride and regard of his father  he never said so much to any body before thought he and what will he do if i die  in such thoughts as these grace found her brother engaged one still autumn morning as he stood leaning against the garden fence  what are you solemnizing here for this bright day brother george said she as she bounded down the alley  the young man turned and looked on her happy face with a sort of twilight smile  how happy you are grace said he  to be sure i am and you ought to be too because you are better  i am happy gracethat is i hope i shall be  you are sick i know you are said grace you look worn out o i wish your heart could spring once as mine does  i am not well dear grace and i fear i never shall be said he turning away and fixing his eyes on the fading trees opposite  o george dear george dont dont say that youll break all our hearts said grace with tears in her own eyes  yes but it is true sister i do not feel it on my own account so much ashowever he added it will all be the same in heaven  it was but a week after this that a violent cold hastened the progress of debility into a confirmed malady he sunk very fast aunt sally with the selfdeceit of a fond and cheerful heart thought every day that he would be better and uncle lot resisted conviction with all the obstinate pertinacity of his character while the sick man felt that he had not the heart to undeceive them  james was now at the house every day exhausting all his energy and invention in the case of his friend and any one who had seen him in his hours of recklessness and glee could scarcely recognize him as the being whose step was so careful whose eye so watchful whose voice and touch were so gentle as he moved around the sick bed but the same quickness which makes a mind buoyant in gladness often makes it gentlest and most sympathetic in sorrow  it was now nearly morning in the sick room george had been restless and feverish all night but towards day he fell into a slight slumber and james sat by his side almost holding his breath lest he should waken him it was yet dusk but the sky was brightening with a solemn glow and the stars were beginning to disappear all save the bright and morning one which standing alone in the east looked tenderly through the casement like the eye of our heavenly father watching over us when all earthly friendships are fading  george awoke with a placid expression of countenance and fixing his eyes on the brightening sky murmured faintly      the sweet immortal morning sheds     its blushes round the spheres  a moment after a shade passed over his face he pressed his fingers over his eyes and the tears dropped silently on his pillow  george dear george said james bending over him  its my friendsits my fathermy mother said he faintly  jesus christ will watch over them said james soothingly  o yes i know he will for he loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end but i am dyingand before i have done any good  o do not say so said james think think what you have done if only for me god bless you for it god will bless you for it it will follow you to heaven it will bring me there yes i will do as you have taught me i will give my life my soul my whole strength to it and then you will not have lived in vain  george smiled and looked upward his face was as that of an angel and james in his warmth continued  it is not i alone who can say this we all bless you every one in this place blesses you you will be had in everlasting remembrance by some hearts here i know  bless god said george  we do said james i bless him that i ever knew you we all bless him and we love you and shall forever  the glow that had kindled over the pale face of the invalid again faded as he said  but james i must i ought to tell my father and mother i ought to and how can i  at that moment the door opened and uncle lot made his appearance he seemed struck with the paleness of georges face and coming to the side of the bed he felt his pulse and laid his hand anxiously on his forehead and clearing his voice several times inquired if he didnt feel a little better  no father said george then taking his hand he looked anxiously in his face and seemed to hesitate a moment father he began you know that we ought to submit to god  there was something in his expression at this moment which flashed the truth into the old mans mind he dropped his sons hand with an exclamation of agony and turning quickly left the room  father father said grace trying to rouse him as he stood with his arms folded by the kitchen window  get away child said he roughly  father mother says breakfast is ready  i dont want any breakfast said he turning short about sally what are you fixing in that ere porringer  o its only a little tea for george twill comfort him up and make him feel better poor fellow  you wont make him feel betterhes gone said uncle lot hoarsely  o dear heart no said aunt sally  be still a contradicting me i wont be contradicted all the time by nobody the short of the case is that george is goin to die just as weve got him ready to be a minister and all and i wish to pity i was in my grave myself and so said uncle lot as he plunged out of the door and shut it after him  it is well for man that there is one being who sees the suffering heart as it is and not as it manifests itself through the repellances of outward infirmity and who perhaps feels more for the stern and wayward than for those whose gentler feelings win for them human sympathy with all his singularities there was in the heart of uncle lot a depth of religious sincerity but there are few characters where religion does any thing more than struggle with natural defect and modify what would else be far worse  in this hour of trial all the native obstinacy and pertinacity of the old mans character rose and while he felt the necessity of submission it seemed impossible to submit and thus reproaching himself struggling in vain to repress the murmurs of nature repulsing from him all external sympathy his mind was tempesttossed and not comforted  it was on the still afternoon of the following sabbath that he was sent for in haste to the chamber of his son he entered and saw that the hour was come the family were all there grace and james side by side bent over the dying one and his mother sat afar off with her face hid in her apron that she might not see the death of the child the aged minister was there and the bible lay open before him the father walked to the side of the bed he stood still and gazed on the face now brightening with life and immortality the son lifted up his eyes he saw his father smiled and put out his hand i am glad you are come said he o george to the pity dont dont smile on me so i know what is coming i have tried and tried and i cant i cant have it so and his frame shook and he sobbed audibly the room was still as death there was none that seemed able to comfort him at last the son repeated in a sweet but interrupted voice those words of mans best friend let not your heart be troubled in my fathers house are many mansions  yes but i cant help being troubled i suppose the lords will must be done but itll kill me  o father dont dont break my heart said the son much agitated i shall see you again in heaven and you shall see me again and then your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you  i never shall get to heaven if i feel as i do now said the old man i cannot have it so  the mild face of the sufferer was overcast i wish he saw all that i do said he in a low voice then looking towards the minister he articulated pray for us  they knelt in prayer it was soothing as real prayer always must be and when they rose every one seemed more calm but the sufferer was exhausted his countenance changed he looked on his friends there was a faint whisper peace i leave with youand he was in heaven  we need not dwell on what followed the seed sown by the righteous often blossoms over their grave and so was it with this good man the words of peace which he spoke unto his friends while he was yet with them came into remembrance after he was gone and though he was laid in the grave with many tears yet it was with softened and submissive hearts  the lord bless him said uncle lot as he and james were standing last of all over the grave i believe my heart is gone to heaven with him and i think the lord really did know what was best after all  our friend james seemed now to become the support of the family and the bereaved old man unconsciously began to transfer to him the affections that had been left vacant  james said he to him one day i suppose you know that you are about the same to me as a son  i hope so said james kindly  well well youll go to college next week and none o yr keepin school to get along ive got enough to bring you safe outthat is if youll be carful and stiddy  james knew the heart too well to refuse a favor in which the poor old mans mind was comforting itself he had the selfcommand to abstain from any extraordinary expressions of gratitude but took it kindly as a matter of course  dear grace said he to her the last evening before he left home i am changed we both are altered since we first knew each other and now i am going to be gone a long time but i am sure  he stopped to arrange his thoughts  yes you may be sure of all those things that you wish to say and cannot said grace  thank you said james then looking thoughtfully he added god help me i believe i have mind enough to be what i mean to but whatever i am or have shall be given to god and my fellowmen and then grace your brother in heaven will rejoice over me  i believe he does now said grace god bless you james i dont know what would have become of us if you had not been here  yes you will live to be like him and to do even more good she added her face brightening as she spoke till james thought she really must be right                                       it was five years after this that james was spoken of as an eloquent and successful minister in the state of c and was settled in one of its most thriving villages late one autumn evening a tall bony hardfavored man was observed making his way into the outskirts of the place  halloa there he called to a man over the other side of a fence what town is this ere  its farmington sir  well i want to know if you know any thing of a boy of mine that lives here  a boy of yours who  why ive got a boy here thats livin on the town and i thought id jest look him up  i dont know any boy that is living on the town whats his name  why said the old man pushing his hat off from his forehead i believe they call him james benton  james benton why that is our ministers name  o wal i believe he is the minister come to think ont hes a boy o mine though where does he live  in that white house that you see set back from the road there with all those trees round it  at this instant a tall manlylooking person approached from behind have we not seen that face before it is a touch graver than of old and its lines have a more thoughtful significance but all the vivacity of james benton sparkles in that quick smile as his eye falls on the old man  i thought you could not keep away from us long said he with the prompt cheerfulness of his boyhood and laying hold of both of uncle lots hard hands  they approached the gate a bright face glances past the window and in a moment grace is at the door  father dear father  youd better make believe be so glad said uncle lot his eyes glistening as he spoke  come come father i have authority in these days said grace drawing him towards the house so no disrespectful speeches away with your hat and coat and sit down in this great chair  so ho miss grace said uncle lot you are at your old tricks ordering round as usual well if i must i must so down he sat  father said grace as he was leaving them after a few days stay its thanksgiving day next month and you and mother must come and stay with us  accordingly the following month found aunt sally and uncle lot by the ministers fireside delighted witnesses of the thanksgiving presents which a willing people were pouring in and the next day they had once more the pleasure of seeing a son of theirs in the sacred desk and hearing a sermon that every body said was the best that he ever preached and it is to be remarked that this was the standing commentary on all jamess discourses so that it was evident he was going on unto perfection  theres a great deal thats worth having in this ere life after all said uncle lot as he sat by the coals of the bright evening fire of that day that is if wed only take it when the lord lays it in our way  yes said james and let us only take it as we should and this life will be cheerfulness and the next fulness of joy     love versus law   how many kinds of beauty there are how many even in the human form there are the bloom and motion of childhood the freshness and ripe perfection of youth the dignity of manhood the softness of womanall different yet each in its kind perfect  but there is none so peculiar none that bears more the image of the heavenly than the beauty of christian old age it is like the loveliness of those calm autumn days when the heats of summer are past when the harvest is gathered into the garner and the sun shines over the placid fields and fading woods which stand waiting for their last change it is a beauty more strictly moral more belonging to the soul than that of any other period of life poetic fiction always paints the old man as a christian nor is there any period where the virtues of christianity seem to find a more harmonious development the aged man who has outlived the hurry of passionwho has withstood the urgency of temptationwho has concentrated the religious impulses of youth into habits of obedience and lovewho having served his generation by the will of god now leans in helplessness on him whom once he served is perhaps one of the most faultless representations of the beauty of holiness that this world affords  thoughts something like these arose in my mind as i slowly turned my footsteps from the graveyard of my native village where i had been wandering after years of absence it was a lovely spota soft slope of ground close by a little stream that ran sparkling through the cedars and junipers beyond it while on the other side arose a green hill with the white village laid like a necklace of pearls upon its bosom  there is no feature of the landscape more picturesque and peculiar than that of the graveyardthat city of the silent as it is beautifully expressed by the orientalsstanding amid the bloom and rejoicing of nature its white stones glittering in the sun a memorial of decay a link between the living and the dead  as i moved slowly from mound to mound and read the inscriptions which purported that many a moneysaving man and many a busy anxious housewife and many a prattling halfblossomed child had done with care or mirth i was struck with a plain slab bearing the inscription to the memory of deacon enos dudley who died in his hundredth year my eye was caught by this inscription for in other years i had well known the person it recorded at this instant his mild and venerable form arose before me as erst it used to rise from the deacons seat a straight close slip just below the pulpit i recollect his quiet and lowly coming into meeting precisely ten minutes before the time every sundayhis tall form a little stoopinghis best suit of butternutcolored sunday clothes with long flaps and wide cuffs on one of which two pins were always to be seen stuck in with the most reverent precision when seated the top of the pew came just to his chin so that his silvery placid head rose above it like the moon above the horizon his head was one that might have been sketched for a st johnbald at the top and around the temples adorned with a soft flow of bright fine hair      that down his shoulders reverently spread     as hoary frost with spangles doth attire     the naked branches of an oak half dead  he was then of great age and every line of his patient face seemed to say and now lord what wait i for yet still year after year was he to be seen in the same place with the same dutiful punctuality  the services he offered to his god were all given with the exactness of an ancient israelite no words could have persuaded him of the propriety of meditating when the choir was singing or of sitting down even through infirmity before the close of the longest prayer that ever was offered a mighty contrast was he to his fellowofficer deacon abrams a tight little tripping welltodo man who used to sit beside him with his hair brushed straight up like a little blaze his coat buttoned up trig and close his psalm book in hand and his quick gray eyes turned first on one side of the broad aisle and then on the other and then up into the gallery like a man who came to church on business and felt responsible for every thing that was going on in the house  a great hinderance was the business talent of this good little man to the enjoyments of us youngsters who perched along in a row on a low seat in front of the pulpit attempted occasionally to diversify the long hour of sermon by sundry small exercises of our own such as making our handkerchiefs into rabbits or exhibiting in a sly way the apples and gingerbread we had brought for a sunday dinner or pulling the ears of some discreet meetinggoing dog who now and then would soberly pitapat through the broad aisle but woe be to us during our contraband sports if we saw deacon abramss sleek head dodging up from behind the top of the deacons seat instantly all the apples gingerbread and handkerchiefs vanished and we all sat with our hands folded looking as demure as if we understood every word of the sermon and more too  there was a great contrast between these two deacons in their services and prayers when as was often the case the absence of the pastor devolved on them the burden of conducting the duties of the sanctuary that god was great and good and that we all were sinners were truths that seemed to have melted into the heart of deacon enos so that his very soul and spirit were bowed down with them with deacon abrams it was an undisputed fact which he had settled long ago and concerning which he felt that there could be no reasonable doubt and his bustling way of dealing with the matter seemed to say that he knew that and a great many things besides  deacon enos was known far and near as a very proverb for peacefulness of demeanor and unbounded charitableness in covering and excusing the faults of others as long as there was any doubt in a case of alleged evil doing deacon enos guessed the man did not mean any harm after all and when transgression became too barefaced for this excuse he always guessed it want best to say much about it nobody could tell what they might be left to  some incidents in his life will show more clearly these traits a certain shrewd landholder by the name of jones who was not well reported of in the matter of honesty sold to deacon enos a valuable lot of land and received the money for it but under various pretences deferred giving the deed soon after he died and to the deacons amazement the deed was nowhere to be found while this very lot of land was left by will to one of his daughters  the deacon said it was very extraornary he always knew that seth jones was considerably sharp about money but he did not think he would do such a right upanddown wicked thing so the old man repaired to squire abel to state the case and see if there was any redress i kinder hate to tell of it said he but squire abel you know mr jones waswaswhat he was even if he is dead and gone this was the nearest approach the old gentleman could make to specifying a heavy charge against the dead on being told that the case admitted of no redress deacon enos comforted himself with half soliloquizing well at any rate the land has gone to those two girls poor lone crittersi hope it will do them some good there is silencewe wont say much about her but sukey is a nice pretty girl and so the old man departed leaving it as his opinion that since the matter could not be mended it was just as well not to say any thing about it  now the two girls here mentioned to wit silence and sukey were the eldest and the youngest of a numerous family the offspring of three wives of seth jones of whom these two were the sole survivors the elder silence was a tall strong blackeyed hardfeatured woman verging upon forty with a good loud resolute voice and what the irishman would call a dacent notion of using it why she was called silence was a standing problem to the neighborhood for she had more faculty and inclination for making a noise than any person in the whole township miss silence was one of those persons who have no disposition to yield any of their own rights she marched up to all controverted matters faced down all opposition held her way lustily and with good courage making men women and children turn out for her as they would for a mail stage so evident was her innate determination to be free and independent that though she was the daughter of a rich man and well portioned only one swain was ever heard of who ventured to solicit her hand in marriage and he was sent off with the assurance that if he ever showed his face about the house again she would set the dogs on him  but susan jones was as different from her sister as the little graceful convolvulus from the great rough stick that supports it at the time of which we speak she was just eighteen a modest slender blushing girl as timid and shrinking as her sister was bold and hardy indeed the education of poor susan had cost miss silence much painstaking and trouble and after all she said the girl would make a fool of herself she never could teach her to be up and down with people as she was  when the report came to miss silences ears that deacon enos considered himself as aggrieved by her fathers will she held forth upon the subject with great strength of courage and of lungs deacon enos might be in better business than in trying to cheat orphans out of their rightsshe hoped he would go to law about it and see what good he would get by ita pretty church member and deacon to be sure getting up such a story about her poor father dead and gone  but silence said susan deacon enos is a good man i do not think he means to injure any one there must be some mistake about it  susan you are a little fool as i have always told you replied silence you would be cheated out of your eye teeth if you had not me to take care of you  but subsequent events brought the affairs of these two damsels in closer connection with those of deacon enos as we shall proceed to show  it happened that the next door neighbor of deacon enos was a certain old farmer whose crabbedness of demeanor had procured for him the name of uncle jaw this agreeable surname accorded very well with the general characteristics both of the person and manner of its possessor he was tall and hardfavored with an expression of countenance much resembling a northeast rain storma drizzling settled sulkiness that seemed to defy all prospect of clearing off and to take comfort in its own disagreeableness his voice seemed to have taken lessons of his face in such admirable keeping was its sawing deliberate growl with the pleasing physiognomy before indicated by nature he was endowed with one of those active acute hairsplitting minds which can raise forty questions for dispute on any point of the compass and had he been an educated man he might have proved as clever a metaphysician as ever threw dust in the eyes of succeeding generations but being deprived of these advantages he nevertheless exerted himself to quite as useful a purpose in puzzling and mystifying whomsoever came in his way but his activity particularly exercised itself in the line of the law as it was his meat and drink and daily meditation either to find something to go to law about or to go law about something he had found there was always some question about an old rail fence that used to run a leetle more to the left hand or that was built up a leetle more to the right hand and so cut off a strip of his medder land or else there was some outrage of peter somebodys turkeys getting into his mowing or squire mosess geese were to be shut up in the town pound or something equally important kept him busy from years end to years end now as a matter of private amusement this might have answered very well but then uncle jaw was not satisfied to fight his own battles but must needs go from house to house narrating the whole length and breadth of the case with all the says hes and says is and the i telld hims and he telld mes which do either accompany or flow therefrom moreover he had such a marvellous facility of finding out matters to quarrel about and of letting every one else know where they too could muster a quarrel that he generally succeeded in keeping the whole neighborhood by the ears  and as good deacon enos assumed the office of peacemaker for the village uncle jaws efficiency rendered it no sinecure the deacon always followed the steps of uncle jaw smoothing hushing up and putting matters aright with an assiduity that was truly wonderful  uncle jaw himself had a great respect for the good man and in common with all the neighborhood sought unto him for counsel though like other seekers of advice he appropriated only so much as seemed good in his own eyes  still he took a kind of pleasure in dropping in of an evening to deacon enoss fire to recount the various matters which he had taken or was to take in hand at one time to narrate how he had been over the milldam telling old granny clark that she could get the law of seth scran about that pasture lot or else how he had told ziah bacons widow that she had a right to shut up bill scrantons pig every time she caught him in front of her house  but the grand matter of matters and the one that took up the most of uncle jaws spare time lay in a dispute between him and squire jones the father of susan and silence for it so happened that his lands and those of uncle jaw were contiguous now the matter of dispute was on this wise on squire joness land there was a mill which mill uncle jaw averred was always aflooding his medder land as uncle jaws medder land was by nature half bog and bulrushes and therefore liable to be found in a wet condition there was always a happy obscurity as to where the water came from and whether there was at any time more there than belonged to his share so when all other subject matters of dispute failed uncle jaw recreated himself with getting up a lawsuit about his medder land and one of these cases was in pendency when by the death of the squire the estate was left to susan and silence his daughters when therefore the report reached him that deacon enos had been cheated out of his dues uncle jaw prepared forthwith to go and compare notes therefore one evening as deacon enos was sitting quietly by the fire musing and reading with his big bible open before him he heard the premonitory symptoms of a visitation from uncle jaw on his door scraper and soon the man made his appearance after seating himself directly in front of the fire with his elbows on his knees and his hands spread out over the coals he looked up in deacon enoss mild face with his little inquisitive gray eyes and remarked by way of opening the subject well deacon old squire jones is gone at last i wonder how much good all his land will do him now  yes replied deacon enos it just shows how all these things are not worth striving after we brought nothing into the world and it is certain we can carry nothing out  why yes replied uncle jaw thats all very right deacon but it was strange how that old squire jones did hang on to things now that mill of his that was always soaking off water into these medders of minei took and telld squire jones just how it was pretty nigh twenty times and yet he would keep it just so and now hes dead and gone there is that old gal silence is full as bad and makes more noise and she and suke have got the land but you see i mean to work it yet  here uncle jaw paused to see whether he had produced any sympathetic excitement in deacon enos but the old man sat without the least emotion quietly contemplating the top of the long kitchen shovel uncle jaw fidgeted in his chair and changed his mode of attack for one more direct i heard em tell deacon enos that the squire served you something of an unhandy sort of trick about that ere lot of land  still deacon enos made no reply but uncle jaws perseverance was not so to be put off and he recommenced squire abel you see he telld me how the matter was and he said he did not see as it could be mended but i took and telld him squire abel says i id bet pretty nigh most any thing if deacon enos would tell the matter to me that i could find a hole for him to creep out at for says i ive seen daylight through more twistical cases than that afore now  still deacon enos remained mute and uncle jaw after waiting a while recommenced with but railly deacon i should like to hear the particulars  i have made up my mind not to say any thing more about that business said deacon enos in a tone which though mild was so exceedingly definite that uncle jaw felt that the case was hopeless in that quarter he therefore betook himself to the statement of his own grievances  why you see deacon he began at the same time taking the tongs and picking up all the little brands and disposing them in the middle of the fireyou see two days arter the funeral for i didnt railly like to go any sooner i stepped up to hash over the matter with old silence for as to sukey she hant no more to do with such things than our white kitten now you see squire jones just afore he died he took away an old rail fence of hisn that lay between his land and mine and began to build a new stone wall and when i come to measure i found he had took and put amost the whole width of the stone wall on to my land when there ought not to have been more than half of it come there now you see i could not say a word to squire jones because jest before i found it out he took and died and so i thought id speak to old silence and see if she meant to do any thing about it cause i knew pretty well she wouldnt and i tell you if she didnt put it on to me we had a regular pitched battlethe old gal i thought she would a screamed herself to death i dont know but she would but just then poor sukey came in and looked so frightened and scareysukey is a pretty gal and looks so trembling and delicate that its kinder a shame to plague her and so i took and come away for that time  here uncle jaw perceived a brightening in the face of the good deacon and felt exceedingly comforted that at last he was about to interest him in his story  but all this while the deacon had been in a profound meditation concerning the ways and means of putting a stop to a quarrel that had been his torment from time immemorial and just at this moment a plan had struck his mind which our story will proceed to unfold  the mode of settling differences which had occurred to the good man was one which has been considered a specific in reconciling contending sovereigns and states from early antiquity and the deacon hoped it might have a pacifying influence even in so unpromising a case as that of miss silence and uncle jaw  in former days deacon enos had kept the district school for several successive winters and among his scholars was the gentle susan jones then a plump rosy little girl with blue eyes curly hair and the sweetest disposition in the world there was also little joseph adams the only son of uncle jaw a fine healthy robust boy who used to spell the longest words make the best snowballs and poplar whistles and read the loudest and fastest in the columbian orator of any boy at school  little joe inherited all his fathers sharpness with a double share of good humor so that though he was forever effervescing in the way of one funny trick or another he was a universal favorite not only with the deacon but with the whole school  master joseph always took little susan jones under his especial protection drew her to school on his sled helped her out with all the long sums in her arithmetic saw to it that nobody pillaged her dinner basket or knocked down her bonnet and resolutely whipped or snowballed any other boy who attempted the same gallantries years passed on and uncle jaw had sent his son to college he sent him because as he said he had a right to send him just as good a right as squire abel or deacon abrams to send their boys and so he would send him it was the remembrance of his old favorite joseph and his little pet susan that came across the mind of deacon enos and which seemed to open a gleam of light in regard to the future so when uncle jaw had finished his prelection the deacon after some meditation came out with railly they say that your son is going to have the valedictory in college  though somewhat startled at the abrupt transition uncle jaw found the suggestion too flattering to his pride to be dropped so with a countenance grimly expressive of his satisfaction he replied why yesyesi dont see no reason why a poor mans son hant as much right as any one to be at the top if he can get there  just so replied deacon enos  he was always the boy for larning and for nothing else continued uncle jaw put him to farming couldnt make nothing of him if i set him to hoeing corn or hilling potatoes id always find him stopping to chase hoptoads or off after chipsquirrels but set him down to a book and there he was that boy larnt reading the quickest of any boy that ever i saw it wasnt a month after he began his a b abs before he could read in the fox and the brambles and in a month more he could clatter off his chapter in the testament as fast as any of them and you see in college its jest sohe has ris right up to be first  and he is coming home week after next said the deacon meditatively  the next morning as deacon enos was eating his breakfast he quietly remarked to his wife sally i believe it was week after next you were meaning to have your quilting  why i never told you so what alive makes you think that deacon dudley  i thought that was your calculation said the good man quietly  why no to be sure i can have it and may be its the best of any time if we can get black dinah to come and help about the cakes and pies i guess we will finally  i think its likely you had better replied the deacon and we will have all the young folks here  and now let us pass over all the intermediate pounding and grinding and chopping which for the next week foretold approaching festivity in the kitchen of the deacon let us forbear to provoke the appetite of a hungry reader by setting in order before him the minced pies the cranberry tarts the pumpkin pies the doughnuts the cookies and other sweet cakes of every description that sprang into being at the magic touch of black dinah the village priestess on all these solemnities suffice it to say that the day had arrived and the auspicious quilt was spread  the invitation had not failed to include the misses silence and susan jonesnay the good deacon had pressed gallantry into the matter so far as to be the bearer of the message himself for which he was duly rewarded by a broadside from miss silence giving him what she termed a piece of her mind in the matter of the rights of widows and orphans to all which the good old man listened with great benignity from the beginning to the end and replied with  well well miss silence i expect you will think better of this before long there had best not be any hard words about it so saying he took up his hat and walked off while miss silence who felt extremely relieved by having blown off steam declared that it was of no more use to hector old deacon enos than to fire a gun at a bag of cotton wool for all that though she shouldnt go to the quilting nor more should susan  but sister why not said the little maiden i think i shall go and susan said this in a tone so mildly positive that silence was amazed  what upon arth ails you susan said she opening her eyes with astonishment havent you any more spirit than to go to deacon enoss when he is doing all he can to ruin us  i like deacon enos replied susan he was always kind to me when i was a little girl and i am not going to believe that he is a bad man now  when a young lady states that she is not going to believe a thing good judges of human nature generally give up the case but miss silence to whom the language of opposition and argument was entirely new could scarcely give her ears credit for veracity in the case she therefore repeated over exactly what she said before only in a much louder tone of voice and with much more vehement forms of asseverationa mode of reasoning which if not strictly logical has at least the sanction of very respectable authorities among the enlightened and learned  silence replied susan when the storm had spent itself if it did not look like being angry with deacon enos i would stay away to oblige you but it would seem to every one to be taking sides in a quarrel and i never did and never will have any part or lot in such things  then youll just be trod and trampled on all your days susan replied silence but however if you choose to make a fool of yourself i dont and so saying she flounced out of the room in great wrath it so happened however that miss silence was one of those who have so little economy in disposing of a fit of anger that it was all used up before the time of execution arrived it followed of consequence that having unburdened her mind freely both to deacon enos and to susan she began to feel very much more comfortable and goodnatured and consequent upon that came divers reflections upon the many gossiping opportunities and comforts of a quilting and then the intrusive little reflection what if she should go after all what harm would be done and then the inquiry whether it was not her duty to go and look after susan poor child who had no mother to watch over her in short before the time of preparation arrived miss silence had fully worked herself up to the magnanimous determination of going to the quilting accordingly the next day while susan was standing before her mirror braiding up her pretty hair she was startled by the apparition of miss silence coming into the room as stiff as a changeable silk and a high horn comb could make her and grimly determined was her look  well susan said she if you will go to the quilting this afternoon i think it is my duty to go and see to you  what would people do if this convenient shelter of duty did not afford them a retreat in cases when they are disposed to change their minds susan suppressed the arch smile that in spite of herself laughed out at the corners of her eyes and told her sister that she was much obliged to her for her care so off they went together  silence in the mean time held forth largely on the importance of standing up for ones rights and not letting ones self be trampled on  the afternoon passed on the elderly ladies quilted and talked scandal and the younger ones discussed the merits of the various beaux who were expected to give vivacity to the evening entertainment among these the newlyarrived joseph adams just from college with all his literary honors thick about him became a prominent subject of conversation  it was duly canvassed whether the young gentleman might be called handsome and the affirmative was carried by a large majority although there were some variations and exceptions one of the party declaring his whiskers to be in too high a state of cultivation another maintaining that they were in the exact line of beauty while a third vigorously disputed the point whether he wore whiskers at all it was allowed by all however that he had been a great beau in the town where he had passed his college days it was also inquired into whether he were matrimonially engaged and the negative being understood they diverted themselves with predicting to one another the capture of such a prize each prophecy being received with such disclaimers as come now do be still hush your nonsense and the like  at length the longwishedfor hour arrived and one by one the lords of the creation began to make their appearance and one of the last was this much admired youth  that is joe adams that is he was the busy whisper as a tall welllooking young man came into the room with the easy air of one who had seen several things before and was not to be abashed by the combined blaze of all the village beauties  in truth our friend joseph had made the most of his residence in n paying his court no less to the graces than the muses his fine person his frank manly air his ready conversation and his faculty of universal adaptation had made his society much coveted among the beau monde of n and though the place was small he had become familiar with much good society  we hardly know whether we may venture to tell our fair readers the whole truth in regard to our hero we will merely hint in the gentlest manner in the world that mr joseph adams being undeniably first in the classics and first in the drawing room having been gravely commended in his class by his venerable president and gayly flattered in the drawing room by the elegant miss this and miss that was rather inclining to the opinion that he was an uncommonly fine fellow and even had the assurance to think that under present circumstances he could please without making any great efforta thing which however true it were in point of fact is obviously improper to be thought of by a young man be that as it may he moved about from one to another shaking hands with all the old ladies and listening with the greatest affability to the various comments on his growth and personal appearance his points of resemblance to his father mother grandfather and grandmother which are always detected by the superior acumen of elderly females  among the younger ones he at once and with full frankness recognized old schoolmates and partners in various whortleberry chestnut and strawberry excursions and thus called out an abundant flow of conversation nevertheless his eye wandered occasionally around the room as if in search of something not there what could it be it kindled however with an expression of sudden brightness as he perceived the tall and spare figure of miss silence whether owing to the personal fascinations of that lady or to other causes we leave the reader to determine  miss silence had predetermined never to speak a word again to uncle jaw or any of his race but she was taken by surprise at the frank extended hand and friendly how dye do it was not in woman to resist so cordial an address from a handsome young man and miss silence gave her hand and replied with a graciousness that amazed herself at this moment also certain soft blue eyes peeped forth from a corner just to see if he looked as he used to yes there he was the same dark mirthful eyes that used to peer on her from behind the corners of the spelling book at the district school and susan jones gave a deep sigh to those times and then wondered why she happened to think of such nonsense  how is your sister little miss susan said joseph  why she is herehave you not seen her said silence there she is in that corner  joseph looked but could scarcely recognize her there stood a tall slender blooming girl that might have been selected as a specimen of that union of perfect health with delicate fairness so characteristic of the young new england beauty  she was engaged in telling some merry story to a knot of young girls and the rich color that like a bright spirit constantly went and came in her cheeks the dimples quick and varying as those of a little brook the clear mild eye the clustering curls and above all the happy rejoicing smile and the transparent frankness and simplicity of expression which beamed like sunshine about her all formed a combination of charms that took our hero quite by surprise and when silence who had a remarkable degree of directness in all her dealings called out here susan is joe adams inquiring after you our practised young gentleman felt himself color to the roots of his hair and for a moment he could scarce recollect that first rudiment of manners to make his bow like a good boy susan colored also but perceiving the confusion of our hero her countenance assumed an expression of mischievous drollery which helped on by the titter of her companions added not a little to his confusion  dense take it thought he whats the matter with me and calling up his courage he dashed into the formidable circle of fair ones and began chattering with one and another calling by name with or without introduction remembering things that never happened with a freedom that was perfectly fascinating  really how handsome he has grown thought susan and she colored deeply when once or twice the dark eyes of our hero made the same observation with regard to herself in that quick intelligible dialect which eyes alone can speak and when the little party dispersed as they did very punctually at nine oclock our hero requested of miss silence the honor of attending her homean evidence of discriminating taste which materially raised him in the estimation of that lady it was true to be sure that susan walked on the other side of him her little white hand just within his arm and there was something in that light touch that puzzled him unaccountably as might be inferred from the frequency with which miss silence was obliged to bring up the ends of conversation with what did you say what were you going to say and other persevering forms of inquiry with which a regulartrained matteroffact talker will hunt down a poor fellowmortal who is in danger of sinking into a comfortable revery  when they parted at the gate however silence gave our hero a hearty invitation to come and see them any time which he mentally regarded as more to the point than any thing else that had been said  as joseph soberly retraced his way homeward his thoughts by some unaccountable association began to revert to such topics as the loneliness of man by himself the need of kindred spirits the solaces of sympathy and other like matters  that night joseph dreamed of trotting along with his dinner basket to the old brown school house and vainly endeavoring to overtake susan jones whom he saw with her little pasteboard sun bonnet a few yards in front of him then he was teetering with her on a long board her bright little face glancing up and down while every curl around it seemed to be living with delight and then he was snowballing tom williams for knocking down susans dolls house or he sat by her on a bench helping her out with a long sum in arithmetic but with the mischievous fatality of dreams the more he ciphered and expounded the longer and more hopeless grew the sum and he awoke in the morning pshawing at his ill luck after having done a sum over half a dozen times while susan seemed to be looking on with the same air of arch drollery that he saw on her face the evening before  joseph said uncle jaw the next morning at breakfast i spose squire joness daughters were not at the quilting  yes sir they were said our hero they were both there  why you dont say so  they certainly were persisted the son  well i thought the old gal had too much spunk for that you see there is a quarrel between the deacon and them gals  indeed said joseph i thought the deacon never quarrelled with any body  but you see old silence there she will quarrel with him railly that cretur is a tough one and uncle jaw leaned back in his chair and contemplated the quarrelsome propensities of miss silence with the satisfaction of a kindred spirit but ill fix her yet he continued i see how to work it  indeed father i did not know that you had any thing to do with their affairs  haint i i should like to know if i haint replied uncle jaw triumphantly now see here joseph you see i mean you shall be a lawyer im pretty considerable of a lawyer myselfthat is for one not college larnt and ill tell you how it isand thereupon uncle jaw launched forth into the case of the medder land and the mill and concluded with now joseph this ere is a kinder whetstone for you to hone up your wits on  in pursuance therefore of this plan of sharpening his wits in the manner aforesaid our hero after breakfast went like a dutiful son directly towards squire joness doubtless for the purpose of taking ocular survey of the meadow land mill and stone wall but by some unaccountable mistake lost his way and found himself standing before the door of squire joness house  the old squire had been among the aristocracy of the village and his house had been the ultimate standard of comparison in all matters of style and garniture their big front room instead of being strewn with lumps of sand duly streaked over twice a week was resplendent with a carpet of red yellow and black stripes while a towering pair of longlegged brass andirons scoured to a silvery white gave an air of magnificence to the chimney which was materially increased by the tall brassheaded shovel and tongs which like a decorous starched married couple stood bolt upright in their places on either side the sanctity of the place was still further maintained by keeping the window shutters always closed admitting only so much light as could come in by a round hole at the top of the shutter and it was only on occasions of extraordinary magnificence that the room was thrown open to profane eyes  our hero was surprised therefore to find both the doors and windows of this apartment open and symptoms evident of its being in daily occupation the furniture still retained its massive clumsy stiffness but there were various tokens that lighter fingers had been at work there since the notable days of good dame jones there was a vase of flowers on the table two or three books of poetry and a little fairy workbasket from which peeped forth the edges of some worked ruffling there was a small writing desk and last not least in a ladys collection an album with leaves of every color of the rainbow containing inscriptions in sundry strong masculine hands to susan indicating that other people had had their eyes open as well as mr joseph adams so said he to himself this quiet little beauty has had admirers after all and consequent upon this came another question which was none of his concern to be sure whether the little lady were or were not engaged and from these speculations he was aroused by a light footstep and anon the neat form of susan made its appearance  good morning miss jones said he bowing  now there is something very comical in the feeling when little boys and girls who have always known each other as plain susan or joseph first meet as mr or miss soandso each one feels half disposed half afraid to return to the old familiar form and awkwardly fettered by the recollection that they are no longer children both parties had felt this the evening before when they met in company but now that they were alone together the feeling became still stronger and when susan had requested mr adams to take a chair and mr adams had inquired after miss susans health there ensued a pause which the longer it continued seemed the more difficult to break and during which susans pretty face slowly assumed an expression of the ludicrous till she was as near laughing as propriety would admit and mr adams having looked out at the window and up at the mantelpiece and down at the carpet at last looked at susan their eyes met the effect was electrical they both smiled and then laughed outright after which the whole difficulty of conversation vanished  susan said joseph do you remember the old school house  i thought that was what you were thinking of said susan but really you have grown and altered so that i could hardly believe my eyes last night  nor i mine said joseph with a glance that gave a very complimentary turn to the expression  our readers may imagine that after this the conversation proceeded to grow increasingly confidential and interesting that from the account of early life each proceeded to let the other know something of intervening history in the course of which each discovered a number of new and admirable traits in the other such things being matters of very common occurrence in the course of the conversation joseph discovered that it was necessary that susan should have two or three books then in his possession and as promptitude is a great matter in such cases he promised to bring them tomorrow  for some time our young friends pursued their acquaintance without a distinct consciousness of any thing except that it was a very pleasant thing to be together during the long still afternoons they rambled among the fading woods now illuminated with the radiance of the dying year and sentimentalized and quoted poetry and almost every evening joseph found some errand to bring him to the house a book for miss susan or a bundle of roots and herbs for miss silence or some remarkably fine yarn for her to knitattentions which retained our hero in the good graces of the latter lady and gained him the credit of being a young man that knew how to behave himself as susan was a leading member in the village choir our hero was directly attacked with a violent passion for sacred music which brought him punctually to the singing school where the young people came together to sing anthems and fuguing tunes and to eat apples and chestnuts  it cannot be supposed that all these things passed unnoticed by those wakeful eyes that are ever upon the motions of such bright particular stars and as is usual in such cases many things were known to a certainty which were not yet known to the parties themselves the young belles and beaux whispered and tittered and passed the original jokes and witticisms common in such cases while the old ladies soberly took the matter in hand when they went out with their knitting to make afternoon visits considering how much money uncle jaw had how much his son would have and what all together would come to and whether joseph would be a smart man and susan a good housekeeper with all the ifs ands and buts of married life  but the most fearful wonders and prognostics crowded around the point what uncle jaw would have to say to the matter his lawsuit with the sisters being well understood as there was every reason it should be it was surmised what two such vigorous belligerents as himself and miss silence would say to the prospect of a matrimonial conjunction it was also reported that deacon enos dudley had a claim to the land which constituted the finest part of susans portion the loss of which would render the consent of uncle jaw still more doubtful but all this while miss silence knew nothing of the matter for her habit of considering and treating susan as a child seemed to gain strength with time susan was always to be seen to and watched and instructed and taught and miss silence could not conceive that one who could not even make pickles without her to oversee could think of such a matter as setting up housekeeping on her own account to be sure she began to observe an extraordinary change in her sister remarked that lately susan seemed to be getting sort o crazyheaded that she seemed not to have any faculty for any thing that she had made gingerbread twice and forgot the ginger one time and put in mustard the other that she shook the saltcellar out in the tablecloth and let the cat into the pantry half a dozen times and that when scolded for these sins of omission or commission she had a fit of crying and did a little worse than before silence was of opinion that susan was getting to be weakly and naarvy and actually concocted an unmerciful pitcher of wormwood and boneset which she said was to keep off the shaking weakness that was coming over her in vain poor susan protested that she was well enough miss silence knew better and one evening she entertained mr joseph adams with a long statement of the case in all its bearings and ended with demanding his opinion as a candid listener whether the wormwood and boneset sentence should not be executed  poor susan had that very afternoon parted from a knot of young friends who had teased her most unmercifully on the score of attentions received till she began to think the very leaves and stones were so many eyes to pry into her secret feelings and then to have the whole case set in order before the very person too whom she most dreaded certainly he would think she was acting like a fool perhaps he did not mean any thing more than friendship after all and she would not for the world have him suppose that she cared a copper more for him than for any other friend or that she was in love of all things so she sat very busy with her knitting work scarcely knowing what she was about till silence called out  why susan what a piece of work you are making of that stocking heel what in the world are you doing to it  susan dropped her knitting and making some pettish answer escaped out of the room  now did you ever said silence laying down the seam she had been crossstitching what is the matter with her mr adams  miss susan is certainly indisposed replied our hero gravely i must get her to take your advice miss silence  our hero followed susan to the front door where she stood looking out at the moon and begged to know what distressed her  of course it was nothing the young ladys usual complaint when in low spirits and to show that she was perfectly easy she began an unsparing attack on a white rosebush near by  susan said joseph laying his hand on hers and in a tone that made her start she shook back her curls and looked up to him with such an innocent confiding face  ah my good reader you may go on with this part of the story for yourself we are principled against unveiling the sacred mysteries the thoughts that breathe and words that burn in such little moonlight interviews as these you may fancy all that followed and we can only assure all who are doubtful that under judicious management cases of this kind may be disposed of without wormwood or boneset our hero and heroine were called to sublunary realities by the voice of miss silence who came into the passage to see what upon earth they were doing that lady was satisfied by the representations of so friendly and learned a young man as joseph that nothing immediately alarming was to be apprehended in the case of susan and she retired from that evening susan stepped about with a heart many pounds lighter than before  ill tell you what joseph said uncle jaw ill tell you what now i hear em tell that youve took and courted that ere susan jones now i jest want to know if its true  there was an explicitness about this mode of inquiry that took our hero quite by surprise so that he could only reply  why sir supposing i had would there be any objection to it in your mind  dont talk to me said uncle jaw i jest want to know if its true  our hero put his hands in his pockets walked to the window and whistled  cause if you have said uncle jaw you may jest uncourt as fast as you can for squire joness daughter wont get a single cent of my money i can tell you that  why father susan jones is not to blame for any thing that her father did and im sure she is a pretty girl enough  i dont care if she is pretty whats that to me ive got you through college joseph and a hard time ive had of it adelvin and slavin and here you come and the very first thing you do you must take and court that ere squire joness daughter who was always putting himself up above me besides i mean to have the law on that estate yet and deacon dudley he will have the law too and it will cut off the best piece of land the girl has and when you get married i mean you shall have something its jest a trick of them gals at me but i guess ill come up with em yet im just agoin down to have a regular hash with old silence to let her know she cant come round me that way  silence said susan drawing her head into the window and looking apprehensive there is mr adams coming here  what joe adams well and what if he is  no no sister but it is his fatherit is uncle jaw  well spose tis childwhat scares you spose im afraid of him if he wants more than i gave him last time ill put it on so saying miss silence took her knitting work and marched down into the sitting room and sat herself bolt upright in an attitude of defiance while poor susan feeling her heart beat unaccountably fast glided out of the room  well good morning miss silence said uncle jaw after having scraped his feet on the scraper and scrubbed them on the mat nearly ten minutes in silent deliberation  morning sir said silence abbreviating the good  uncle jaw helped himself to a chair directly in front of the enemy dropped his hat on the floor and surveyed miss silence with a dogged air of satisfaction like one who is sitting down to a regular comfortable quarrel and means to make the most of it  miss silence tossed her head disdainfully but scorned to commence hostilities  so miss silence said uncle jaw deliberately you dont think youll do any thing about that ere matter  what matter said silence with an intonation resembling that of a roasted chestnut when it bursts from the fire  i really thought miss silence in that ere talk i had with you about squire joness cheatin about that ere  mr adams said silence i tell you to begin with im not a going to be sauced in this ere way by you you haint got common decency nor common sense nor common any thing else to talk so to me about my father i wont bear it i tell you  why miss jones said uncle jaw how you talk well to be sure squire jones is dead and gone and its as well not to call it cheatin as i was tellin deacon enos when he was talking about that ere lotthat ere lot you know that he sold the deacon and never let him have the deed ont  thats a lie said silence starting on her feet thats an up and down black lie i tell you that now before you say another word  miss silence railly you seem to be getting touchy said uncle jaw well to be sure if the deacon can let that pass other folks can and maybe the deacon will because squire jones was a church member and the deacon is mazin tender about bringin out any thing against professors but railly now miss silence i didnt think you and susan were going to work it so cunning in this here way  i dont know what you mean and whats more i dont care said silence resuming her work and calling back the boltupright dignity with which she began  there was a pause of some moments during which the features of silence worked with suppressed rage which was contemplated by uncle jaw with undisguised satisfaction  you see i spose i shouldnt a minded your susans setting out to court up my joe if it hadnt a been for them things  courting your son mr adams i should like to know what you mean by that im sure nobody wants your son though hes a civil likely fellow enough yet with such an old dragon for a father ill warrant he wont get any body to court him nor be courted by him neither  railly miss silence you aint hardly civil now  civil i should like to know who could be civil you know now as well as i do that you are saying all this out of clear sheer ugliness and thats what you keep a doing all round the neighborhood  miss silence said uncle jaw i dont want no hard words with you its pretty much known round the neighborhood that your susan thinks shell get my joe and i spose you was thinking that perhaps it would be the best way of settling up matters but you see now i took and telld my son i railly didnt see as i could afford it i took and telld him that young folks must have something considerable to start with and that if susan lost that ere piece of ground as is likely she will it would be cutting off quite too much of a piece so you see i dont want you to take no encouragement about that  well i think this is pretty well exclaimed silence provoked beyond measure or endurance you old torment think i dont know what youre at i and susan courting your son i wonder if you aint ashamed of yourself now i should like to know what i or she have done now to get that notion into your head  i didnt spose you spected to get him yourself said uncle jaw for i guess by this time youve pretty much gin up trying haint ye but susan does im pretty sure  here susan susan youcome down called miss silence in great wrath throwing open the chamber door mr adams wants to speak with you susan fluttering and agitated slowly descended into the room where she stopped and looked hesitatingly first at uncle jaw and then at her sister who without ceremony proposed the subject matter of the interview as follows  now susan heres this man pretends to say that youve been a courting and snaring to get his son and i just want you to tell him that you haint never had no thought of him and that you wont have neither  this considerate way of announcing the subject had the effect of bringing the burning color into susans face as she stood like a convicted culprit with her eyes bent on the floor  uncle jaw savage as he was was always moved by female loveliness as wild beasts are said to be mysteriously swayed by music and looked on the beautiful downcast face with more softening than miss silence who provoked that susan did not immediately respond to the question seized her by the arm and eagerly reiterated  susan why dont you speak child  gathering desperate courage susan shook off the hand of silence and straightened herself up with as much dignity as some little flower lifts up its head when it has been bent down by rain drops  silence she said i never would have come down if i had thought it was to hear such things as this mr adams all i have to say to you is that your son has sought me and not i your son if you wish to know any more he can tell you better than i  well i vow she is a pretty gal said uncle jaw as susan shut the door  this exclamation was involuntary then recollecting himself he picked up his hat and saying well i guess i may as well get along hum he began to depart but turning round before he shut the door he said miss silence if you should conclude to do any thing about that ere fence just send word over and let me know  silence without deigning any reply marched up into susans little chamber where our heroine was treating resolution to a good fit of crying  susan i did not think you had been such a fool said the lady i do want to know now if youve railly been thinking of getting married and to that joe adams of all folks  poor susan such an interlude in all her pretty romantic little dreams about kindred feelings and a hundred other delightful ideas that flutter like singing birds through the fairy land of first love such an interlude to be called on by gruff human voices to give up all the cherished secrets that she had trembled to whisper even to herself she felt as if love itself had been defiled by the coarse rough hands that had been meddling with it so to her sisters soothing address susan made no answer only to cry and sob still more bitterly than before  miss silence if she had a great stout heart had no less a kind one and seeing susan take the matter so bitterly to heart she began gradually to subside  susan you poor little fool you said she at the same time giving her a hearty slap as expressive of earnest sympathy i really do feel for you that goodfornothing fellow has been a cheatin you i do believe  o dont talk any more about it for mercys sake said susan i am sick of the whole of it  thats you susan glad to hear you say so ill stand up for you susan if i catch joe adams coming here again with his palavering face ill let him know  no no dont for mercys sake say any thing to mr adamsdont  well child dont claw hold of a body so well at any rate ill just let joe adams know that we haint nothing more to say to him  but i dont wish to say thatthat isi dont knowindeed sister silence dont say any thing about it  why not you aint such a natural now as to want to marry him after all hey  i dont know what i want nor what i dont want only silence do now if you love me do promise not to say any thing at all to mr adamsdont  well then i wont said silence but susan if you railly was in love all this while why haint you been and told me dont you know that im as much as a mother to you and you ought to have told me in the beginning  i dont know silence i couldnti dont want to talk about it  well susan you aint a bit like me said silencea remark evincing great discrimination certainly and with which the conversation terminated  that very evening our friend joseph walked down towards the dwelling of the sisters not without some anxiety for the result for he knew by his fathers satisfied appearance that war had been declared he walked into the family room and found nobody there but miss silence who was sitting grim as an egyptian sphinx stitching very vigorously on a meal bag in which interesting employment she thought proper to be so much engaged as not to remark the entrance of our hero to josephs accustomed good evening miss silence she replied merely by looking up with a cold nod and went on with her sewing it appeared that she had determined on a literal version of her promise not to say any thing to mr adams  our hero as we have before stated was familiar with the crooks and turns of the female mind and mentally resolved to put a bold face on the matter and give miss silence no encouragement in her attempt to make him feel himself unwelcome it was rather a frosty autumnal evening and the fire on the hearth was decaying mr joseph bustled about most energetically throwing down the tongs and shovel and bellows while he pulled the fire to pieces raked out ashes and brands and then in a twinkling was at the woodpile from whence he selected a massive backlog and forestick with accompaniments which were soon roaring and crackling in the chimney  there now that does look something like comfort said our hero and drawing forward the big rocking chair he seated himself in it and rubbed his hands with an air of great complacency miss silence looked not up but stitched so much the faster so that one might distinctly hear the crack of the needle and the whistle of the thread all over the apartment  have you a headache tonight miss silence  no was the gruff answer  are you in a hurry about those bags said he glancing at a pile of unmade ones which lay by her side  no reply hang it all said our hero to himself ill make her speak  miss silences needle book and brown thread lay on a chair beside her our friend helped himself to a needle and thread and taking one of the bags planted himself bolt upright opposite to miss silence and pinning his work to his knee commenced stitching at a rate fully equal to her own  miss silence looked up and fidgeted but went on with her work faster than before but the faster she worked the faster and steadier worked our hero all in marvellous silence there began to be an odd twitching about the muscles of miss silences face our hero took no notice having pursed his features into an expression of unexampled gravity which only grew more intense as he perceived by certain uneasy movements that the adversary was beginning to waver  as they were sitting stitching away their needles whizzing at each other like a couple of locomotives engaged in conversation susan opened the door  the poor child had been crying for the greater part of her spare time during the day and was in no very merry humor but the moment that her astonished eyes comprehended the scene she burst into a fit of almost inextinguishable merriment while silence laid down her needle and looked half amused and half angry our hero however continued his business with inflexible perseverance unpinning his work and moving the seam along and going on with increased velocity  poor miss silence was at length vanquished and joined in the loud laugh which seemed to convulse her sister whereupon our hero unpinned his work and folding it up looked up at her with all the assurance of impudence triumphant and remarked to susan  your sister had such a pile of these pillow cases to make that she was quite discouraged and engaged me to do half a dozen of them when i first came in she was so busy she could not even speak to me  well if you aint the beater for impudence said miss silence  the beater for industryso i thought rejoined our hero  susan who had been in a highly tragical state of mind all day and who was meditating on nothing less sublime than an eternal separation from her lover which she had imagined with all the affecting attendants and consequents was entirely revolutionized by the unexpected turn thus given to her ideas while our hero pursued the opportunity he had made for himself and exerted his powers of entertainment to the utmost till miss silence declaring that if she had been washing all day she should not have been more tired than she was with laughing took up her candle and goodnaturedly left our young people to settle matters between themselves there was a grave pause of some length when she had departed which was broken by our hero who seating himself by susan inquired very seriously if his father had made proposals of marriage to miss silence that morning  no you provoking creature said susan at the same time laughing at the absurdity of the idea  well now dont draw on your long face again susan said joseph you have been trying to lengthen it down all the evening if i would have let you seriously now i know that something painful passed between my father and you this morning but i shall not inquire what it was i only tell you frankly that he has expressed his disapprobation of our engagement forbidden me to go on with it and  and consequently i release you from all engagements and obligations to me even before you ask it said susan  you are extremely accommodating replied joseph but i cannot promise to be as obliging in giving up certain promises made to me unless indeed the feelings that dictated them should have changed  o nono indeed said susan earnestly you know it is not that but if your father objects to me  if my father objects to you he is welcome not to marry you said joseph  now joseph do be serious said susan  well then seriously susan i know my obligations to my father and in all that relates to his comfort i will ever be dutiful and submissive for i have no college boy pride on the subject of submission but in a matter so individually my own as the choice of a wife in a matter that will most likely affect my happiness years and years after he has ceased to be i hold that i have a right to consult my own inclinations and by your leave my dear little lady i shall take that liberty  but then if your father is made angry you know what sort of a man he is and how could i stand in the way of all your prospects  why my dear susan do you think i count myself dependent upon my father like the heir of an english estate who has nothing to do but sit still and wait for money to come to him no i have energy and education to start with and if i cannot take care of myself and you too then cast me off and welcome and as joseph spoke his fine face glowed with a conscious power which unfettered youth never feels so fully as in america he paused a moment and resumed nevertheless susan i respect my father whatever others may say of him i shall never forget that i owe to his hard earnings the education that enables me to do or be any thing and i shall not wantonly or rudely cross him i do not despair of gaining his consent my father has a great partiality for pretty girls and if his love of contradiction is not kept awake by open argument i will trust to time and you to bring him round but whatever comes rest assured my dearest one i have chosen for life and cannot change  the conversation after this took a turn which may readily be imagined by all who have been in the same situation and will therefore need no further illustration                                       well deacon railly i dont know what to think now theres my joe hes took and been a courting that ere susan said uncle jaw  this was the introduction to one of uncle jaws periodical visits to deacon enos who was sitting with his usual air of mild abstraction looking into the coals of a bright november fire while his busy helpmate was industriously rattling her knitting needles by his side  a close observer might have suspected that this was no news to the good deacon who had given a great deal of good advice in private to master joseph of late but he only relaxed his features into a quiet smile and ejaculated i want to know  yes and railly deacon that ere gal is a rail pretty un i was a tellin my folks that our new ministers wife was a fool to her  and so your son is going to marry her said the good lady i knew that long ago  wellnonot so fast ye see theres two to that bargain yet you see joe he never said a word to me but took and courted the gal out of his own head and when i come to know says i joe says i that ere gal wont do for me and i took and telld him then about that ere old fence and all about that old mill and them medders of mine and i telld him too about that ere lot of susans and i should like to know now deacon how that lot business is a going to turn out  judge smith and squire moseley say that my claim to it will stand said the deacon  they do said uncle jaw with much satisfaction spose then youll sue wont you  i dont know replied the deacon meditatively  uncle jaw was thoroughly amazed that any one should have doubts about entering suit for a fine piece of land when sure of obtaining it was a problem quite beyond his powers of solving  you say your son has courted the girl said the deacon after a long pause that strip of land is the best part of susans share i paid down five hundred dollars on the nail for it ive got papers here that judge smith and squire moseley say will stand good in any court of law  uncle jaw pricked up his ears and was all attention eying with eager looks the packet but to his disappointment the deacon deliberately laid it into his desk shut and locked it and resumed his seat  now railly said uncle jaw i should like to know the particulars  well well said the deacon the lawyers will be at my house tomorrow evening and if you have any concern about it you may as well come along  uncle jaw wondered all the way home at what he could have done to get himself into the confidence of the old deacon who he rejoiced to think was a going to take and go to law like other folks  the next day there was an appearance of some bustle and preparation about the deacons house the best room was opened and aired an ovenful of cake was baked and our friend joseph with a face full of business was seen passing to and fro in and out of the house from various closetings with the deacon the deacons lady bustled about the house with an air of wonderful mystery and even gave her directions about eggs and raisins in a whisper lest they should possibly let out some eventful secret  the afternoon of that day joseph appeared at the house of the sisters stating that there was to be company at the deacons that evening and he was sent to invite them  why whats got into the deacons folks lately said silence to have company so often joe adams this ere is some cut up of yours come what are you up to now  come come dress yourselves and get ready said joseph and stepping up to susan as she was following silence out of the room he whispered something into her ear at which she stopped short and colored violently  why joseph what do you mean  it is so said he  no no joseph no i cant indeed i cant  but you can susan  o joseph dont  o susan do  why how strange joseph  come come my dear you keep me waiting if you have any objections on the score of propriety we will talk about them tomorrow and our hero looked so saucy and so resolute that there was no disputing further so after a little more lingering and blushing on susans part and a few kisses and persuasions on the part of the suitor miss susan seemed to be brought to a state of resignation  at a table in the middle of uncle enoss north front room were seated the two lawyers whose legal opinion was that evening to be fully made up the younger of these squire moseley was a rosy portly laughing little bachelor who boasted that he had offered himself in rotation to every pretty girl within twenty miles round and among others to susan jones notwithstanding which he still remained a bachelor with a fair prospect of being an old one but none of these things disturbed the boundless flow of good nature and complacency with which he seemed at all times full to overflowing on the present occasion he appeared to be particularly in his element as if he had some law business in hand remarkably suited to his turn of mind for on finishing the inspection of the papers he started up slapped his graver brother on the back made two or three flourishes round the room and then seizing the old deacons hand shook it violently exclaiming  alls right deacon alls right go it go it hurrah  when uncle jaw entered the deacon without preface handed him a chair and the papers saying  these papers are what you wanted to see i just wish you would read them over  uncle jaw read them deliberately over didnt i tell ye so deacon the case is as clear as a bell now ye will go to law wont you  look here mr adams now you have seen these papers and heard whats to be said ill make you an offer let your son marry susan jones and ill burn these papers and say no more about it and there wont be a girl in the parish with a finer portion  uncle jaw opened his eyes with amazement and looked at the old man his mouth gradually expanding wider and wider as if he hoped in time to swallow the idea  well now i swan at length he ejaculated  i mean just as i say said the deacon  why thats the same as giving the gal five hundred dollars out of your own pocket and she aint no relation neither  i know it said the deacon but i have said i will do it  what upon arth for said uncle jaw  to make peace said the deacon and to let you know that when i say it is better to give up ones rights than to quarrel i mean so i am an old man my children are deadhis voice falteredmy treasures are laid up in heaven if i can make the children happy why i will when i thought i had lost the land i made up my mind to lose it and so i can now  uncle jaw looked fixedly on the old deacon and said  well deacon i believe you i vow if you haint got something ahead in tother world id like to know who hasthats all so if joe has no objections and i rather guess he wont have  the short of the matter is said the squire well have a wedding so come on and with that he threw open the parlor door where stood susan and joseph in a recess by the window while silence and the rev mr bissel were drawn up by the fire and the deacons lady was sweeping up the hearth as she had been doing ever since the party arrived  instantly joseph took the hand of susan and led her to the middle of the room the merry squire seized the hand of miss silence and placed her as bridesmaid and before any one knew what they were about the ceremony was in actual progress and the minister having been previously instructed made the two one with extraordinary celerity  what what what said uncle jaw joseph deacon  fair bargain sir said the squire hand over your papers deacon  the deacon handed them and the squire having read them aloud proceeded with much ceremony to throw them into the fire after which in a mock solemn oration he gave a statement of the whole affair and concluded with a grave exhortation to the new couple on the duties of wedlock which unbent the risibles even of the minister himself  uncle jaw looked at his pretty daughterinlaw who stood half smiling half blushing receiving the congratulations of the party and then at miss silence who appeared full as much taken by surprise as himself  well well miss silence these ere young folks have come round us slick enough said he i dont see but we must shake hands upon it and the warlike powers shook hands accordingly which was a signal for general merriment  as the company were dispersing miss silence laid hold of the good deacon and by main strength dragged him aside deacon said she i take back all that ere i said about you every word ont  dont say any more about it miss silence said the good man its gone by and let it go  joseph said his father the next morning as he was sitting at breakfast with joseph and susan i calculate i shall feel kinder proud of this ere gal and ill tell you what ill jest give you that nice little delicate stanton place that i took on stantons mortgage its a nice little place with green blinds and flowers and all them things just right for susan  and accordingly many happy years flew over the heads of the young couple in the stanton place long after the hoary hairs of their kind benefactor the deacon were laid with reverence in the dust uncle jaw was so far wrought upon by the magnanimity of the good old man as to be very materially changed for the better instead of quarrelling in real earnest all around the neighborhood he confined himself merely to battling the opposite side of every question with his son which as the latter was somewhat of a logician afforded a pretty good field for the exercise of his powers and he was heard to declare at the funeral of the old deacon that after all a man got as much and may be more to go along as the deacon did than to be all the time fisting and jawing though i tell you what it is said he afterwards taint every one that has the deacons faculty any how     the tea rose   there it stood in its little green vase on a light ebony stand in the window of the drawing room the rich satin curtains with their costly fringes swept down on either side of it and around it glittered every rare and fanciful trifle which wealth can offer to luxury and yet that simple rose was the fairest of them all so pure it looked its white leaves just touched with that delicious creamy tint peculiar to its kind its cup so full so perfect its head bending as if it were sinking and melting away in its own richnesso when did ever man make any thing to equal the living perfect flower  but the sunlight that streamed through the window revealed something fairer than the rose reclined on an ottoman in a deep recess and intently engaged with a book rested what seemed the counterpart of that so lovely flower that cheek so pale that fair forehead so spiritual that countenance so full of high thought those long downcast lashes and the expression of the beautiful mouth sorrowful yet subdued and sweetit seemed like the picture of a dream  florence florence echoed a merry and musical voice in a sweet impatient tone turn your head reader and you will see a light and sparkling maiden the very model of some little wilful elf born of mischief and motion with a dancing eye a foot that scarcely seems to touch the carpet and a smile so multiplied by dimples that it seems like a thousand smiles at once come florence i say said the little sprite put down that wise good and excellent volume and descend from your cloud and talk with a poor little mortal  the fair apparition thus adjured obeyed and looking up revealed just such eyes as you expected to see beneath such lidseyes deep pathetic and rich as a strain of sad music  i say cousin said the bright ladye i have been thinking what you are to do with your pet rose when you go to new york as to our consternation you are determined to do you know it would be a sad pity to leave it with such a scatterbrain as i am i do love flowers that is a fact that is i like a regular bouquet cut off and tied up to carry to a party but as to all this tending and fussing which is needful to keep them growing i have no gifts in that line  make yourself easy as to that kate said florence with a smile i have no intention of calling upon your talents i have an asylum in view for my favorite  o then you know just what i was going to say mrs marshall i presume has been speaking to you she was here yesterday and i was quite pathetic upon the subject telling her the loss your favorite would sustain and so forth and she said how delighted she would be to have it in her greenhouse it is in such a fine state now so full of buds i told her i knew you would like to give it to her you are so fond of mrs marshall you know  now kate i am sorry but i have otherwise engaged it  whom can it be to you have so few intimates here  o it is only one of my odd fancies  but do tell me florence  well cousin you know the little pale girl to whom we give sewing  what little mary stephens how absurd florence this is just another of your motherly oldmaidish waysdressing dolls for poor children making bonnets and knitting socks for all the little dirty babies in the region round about i do believe you have made more calls in those two vile illsmelling alleys back of our house than ever you have in chestnut street though you know every body is half dying to see you and now to crown all you must give this choice little bijou to a seamstress girl when one of your most intimate friends in your own class would value it so highly what in the world can people in their circumstances want of flowers  just the same as i do replied florence calmly have you not noticed that the little girl never comes here without looking wistfully at the opening buds and dont you remember the other morning she asked me so prettily if i would let her mother come and see it she was so fond of flowers  but florence only think of this rare flower standing on a table with ham eggs cheese and flour and stifled in that close little room where mrs stephens and her daughter manage to wash iron cook and nobody knows what besides  well kate and if i were obliged to live in one coarse room and wash and iron and cook as you sayif i had to spend every moment of my time in toil with no prospect from my window but a brick wall and dirty lanesuch a flower as this would be untold enjoyment to me  pshaw florenceall sentiment poor people have no time to be sentimental besides i dont believe it will grow with them it is a greenhouse flower and used to delicate living  o as to that a flower never inquires whether its owner is rich or poor and mrs stephens whatever else she has not has sunshine of as good quality as this that streams through our window the beautiful things that god makes are his gift to all alike you will see that my fair rose will be as well and cheerful in mrs stephenss room as in ours  well after all how odd when one gives to poor people one wants to give them something usefula bushel of potatoes a ham and such things  why certainly potatoes and ham must be supplied but having ministered to the first and most craving wants why not add any other little pleasures or gratifications we may have it in our power to bestow i know there are many of the poor who have fine feeling and a keen sense of the beautiful which rusts out and dies because they are too hard pressed to procure it any gratification poor mrs stephens for example i know she would enjoy birds and flowers and music as much as i do i have seen her eye light up as she looked on these things in our drawing room and yet not one beautiful thing can she command from necessity her room her clothing all she has must be coarse and plain you should have seen the almost rapture she and mary felt when i offered them my rose  dear me all this may be true but i never thought of it before i never thought that these hardworking people had any ideas of taste  then why do you see the geranium or rose so carefully nursed in the old cracked teapot in the poorest room or the morning glory planted in a box and twined about the window do not these show that the human heart yearns for the beautiful in all ranks of life you remember kate how our washerwoman sat up a whole night after a hard days work to make her first baby a pretty dress to be baptized in  yes and i remember how i laughed at you for making such a tasteful little cap for it  well katy i think the look of perfect delight with which the poor mother regarded her baby in its new dress and cap was something quite worth creating i do believe she could not have felt more grateful if i had sent her a barrel of flour  well i never thought before of giving any thing to the poor but what they really needed and i have always been willing to do that when i could without going far out of my way  well cousin if our heavenly father gave to us after this mode we should have only coarse shapeless piles of provisions lying about the world instead of all this beautiful variety of trees and fruits and flowers  well well cousin i suppose you are rightbut have mercy on my poor head it is too small to hold so many new ideas all at onceso go on your own way and the little lady began practising a waltzing step before the glass with great satisfaction                                       it was a very small room lighted by only one window there was no carpet on the floor there was a clean but coarselycovered bed in one corner a cupboard with a few dishes and plates in the other a chest of drawers and before the window stood a small cherry stand quite new and indeed it was the only article in the room that seemed so  a pale sicklylooking woman of about forty was leaning back in her rocking chair her eyes closed and her lips compressed as if in pain she rocked backward and forward a few minutes pressed her hand hard upon her eyes and then languidly resumed her fine stitching on which she had been busy since morning the door opened and a slender little girl of about twelve years of age entered her large blue eyes dilated and radiant with delight as she bore in the vase with the rose tree in it  o see mother see here is one in full bloom and two more half out and ever so many more pretty buds peeping out of the green leaves  the poor womans face brightened as she looked first on the rose and then on her sickly child on whose face she had not seen so bright a color for months  god bless her she exclaimed unconsciously  miss florenceyes i knew you would feel so mother does it not make your head feel better to see such a beautiful flower now you will not look so longingly at the flowers in the market for we have a rose that is handsomer than any of them why it seems to me it is worth as much to us as our whole little garden used to be only see how many buds there are just count them and only smell the flower now where shall we set it up and mary skipped about placing her flower first in one position and then in another and walking off to see the effect till her mother gently reminded her that the rose tree could not preserve its beauty without sunlight  o yes truly said mary well then it must stand here on our new stand how glad i am that we have such a handsome new stand for it it will look so much better and mrs stephens laid down her work and folded a piece of newspaper on which the treasure was duly deposited  there said mary watching the arrangement eagerly that will dono for it does not show both the opening buds a little farther arounda little more there that is right and then mary walked around to view the rose in various positions after which she urged her mother to go with her to the outside and see how it looked there how kind it was in miss florence to think of giving this to us said mary though she had done so much for us and given us so many things yet this seems the best of all because it seems as if she thought of us and knew just how we felt and so few do that you know mother  what a bright afternoon that little gift made in that little room how much faster marys fingers flew the livelong day as she sat sewing by her mother and mrs stephens in the happiness of her child almost forgot that she had a headache and thought as she sipped her evening cup of tea that she felt stronger than she had done for some time  that rose its sweet influence died not with the first day through all the long cold winter the watching tending cherishing that flower awakened a thousand pleasant trains of thought that beguiled the sameness and weariness of their life every day the fair growing thing put forth some fresh beautya leaf a bud a new shoot and constantly awakened fresh enjoyment in its possessors as it stood in the window the passer by would sometimes stop and gaze attracted by its beauty and then proud and happy was mary nor did even the serious and careworn widow notice with indifference this tribute to the beauty of their favorite  but little did florence think when she bestowed the gift that there twined about it an invisible thread that reached far and brightly into the web of her destiny  one cold afternoon in early spring a tall and graceful gentleman called at the lowly room to pay for the making of some linen by the inmates he was a stranger and wayfarer recommended through the charity of some of mrs stephenss patrons as he turned to go his eye rested admiringly on the rose tree and he stopped to gaze at it  how beautiful said he  yes said little mary and it was given to us by a lady as sweet and beautiful as that is  ah said the stranger turning upon her a pair of bright dark eyes pleased and rather struck by the communication and how came she to give it to you my little girl  o because we are poor and mother is sick and we never can have any thing pretty we used to have a garden once and we loved flowers so much and miss florence found it out and so she gave us this  florence echoed the stranger  yes miss florence lestrangea beautiful lady they say she was from foreign parts but she speaks english just like other ladies only sweeter  is she here now is she in this city said the gentleman eagerly  no she left some months ago said the widow noticing the shade of disappointment on his face but said she you can find out all about her at her aunts mrs carlysles no 10  street  a short time after florence received a letter in a handwriting that made her tremble during the many early years of her life spent in france she had well learned to know that writinghad loved as a woman like her loves only once but there had been obstacles of parents and friends long separation long suspense till after anxious years she had believed the ocean had closed over that hand and heart and it was this that had touched with such pensive sorrow the lines in her lovely face  but this letter told that he was livingthat he had traced her even as a hidden streamlet may be traced by the freshness the verdure of heart which her deeds of kindness had left wherever she had passed thus much said our readers need no help in finishing my story for themselves     trials of a housekeeper   i have a detail of very homely grievances to present but such as they are many a heart will feel them to be heavythe trials of a housekeeper  poh says one of the lords of creation taking his cigar out of his mouth and twirling it between his two first fingers what a fuss these women do make of this simple matter of managing a family i cant see for my life as there is any thing so extraordinary to be done in this matter of housekeeping only three meals a day to be got and cleared offand it really seems to take up the whole of their mind from morning till night i could keep house without so much of a flurry i know  now prithee good brother listen to my story and see how much you know about it i came to this enlightened west about a year since and was duly established in a comfortable country residence within a mile and a half of the city and there commenced the enjoyment of domestic felicity i had been married about three months and had been previously in love in the most approved romantic way with all the proprieties of moonlight walks serenades sentimental billets doux and everlasting attachment  after having been allowed as i said about three months to get over this sort of thing and to prepare for realities i was located for life as aforesaid my family consisted of myself and husband a female friend as a visitor and two brothers of my good man who were engaged with him in business  i pass over the two or three first days spent in that process of hammering boxes breaking crockery knocking things down and picking them up again which is commonly called getting to housekeeping as usual carpets were sewed and stretched laid down and taken up to be sewed over things were formed and reformed transformed and conformed till at last a settled order began to appear but now came up the great point of all during our confusion we had cooked and eaten our meals in a very miscellaneous and pastoral manner eating now from the top of a barrel and now from a fireboard laid on two chairs and drinking some from teacups and some from saucers and some from tumblers and some from a pitcher big enough to be drowned in and sleeping some on sofas and some on straggling beds and mattresses thrown down here and there wherever there was room all these pleasant barbarities were now at an end the house was in order the dishes put up in their places three regular meals were to be administered in one day all in an orderly civilized form beds were to be made rooms swept and dusted dishes washed knives scoured and all the et cetera to be attended to now for getting help as mrs trollope says and where and how were we to get it we knew very few persons in the city and how were we to accomplish the matter at length the house of employment was mentioned and my husband was despatched thither regularly every day for a week while i in the mean time was very nearly despatched by the abundance of work at home at length one evening as i was sitting completely exhausted thinking of resorting to the last feminine expedient for supporting life viz a good fit of crying my husband made his appearance with a most triumphant air at the door there margaret i have got you a couple at lastcook and chambermaid so saying he flourished open the door and gave to my view the picture of a little dry snuffylooking old woman and a great staring dutch girl in a green bonnet with red ribbons with mouth wide open and hands and feet that would have made a greek sculptor open his mouth too i addressed forthwith a few words of encouragement to each of this cultivatedlooking couple and proceeded to ask their names and forthwith the old woman began to snuffle and to wipe her face with what was left of an old silk pocket handkerchief preparatory to speaking while the young lady opened her mouth wider and looked around with a frightened air as if meditating an escape after some preliminaries however i found out that my old woman was mrs tibbins and my hebes name was kotterin also that she knew much more dutch than english and not any too much of either the old lady was the cook i ventured a few inquiries had she ever cooked  yes maam sartain she had lived at two or three places in the city  i suspect my dear said my husband confidently that she is an experienced cook and so your troubles are over and he went to reading his newspaper i said no more but determined to wait till morning the breakfast to be sure did not do much honor to the talents of my official but it was the first time and the place was new to her after breakfast was cleared away i proceeded to give directions for dinner it was merely a plain joint of meat i said to be roasted in the tin oven the experienced cook looked at me with a stare of entire vacuity the tin oven i repeated stands there pointing to it  she walked up to it and touched it with such an appearance of suspicion as if it had been an electrical battery and then looked round at me with a look of such helpless ignorance that my soul was moved i never see one of them things before said she  never saw a tin oven i exclaimed i thought you said you had cooked in two or three families  they does not have such things as them though rejoined my old lady nothing was to be done of course but to instruct her into the philosophy of the case and having spitted the joint and given numberless directions i walked off to my room to superintend the operations of kotterin to whom i had committed the making of my bed and the sweeping of my room it never having come into my head that there could be a wrong way of making a bed and to this day it is a marvel to me how any one could arrange pillows and quilts to make such a nondescript appearance as mine now presented one glance showed me that kotterin also was just caught and that i had as much to do in her department as in that of my old lady  just then the door bell rang o there is the door bell i exclaimed run kotterin and show them into the parlor  kotterin started to run as directed and then stopped and stood looking round on all the doors and on me with a wofully puzzled air the street door said i pointing towards the entry kotterin blundered into the entry and stood gazing with a look of stupid wonder at the bell ringing without hands while i went to the door and let in the company before she could be fairly made to understand the connection between the ringing and the phenomenon of admission  as dinner time approached i sent word into my kitchen to have it set on but recollecting the state of the heads of department there i soon followed my own orders i found the tin oven standing out in the middle of the kitchen and my cook seated à la turc in front of it contemplating the roast meat with full as puzzled an air as in the morning i once more explained the mystery of taking it off and assisted her to get it on to the platter though somewhat cooled by having been so long set out for inspection i was standing holding the spit in my hands when kotterin who had heard the door bell ring and was determined this time to be in season ran into the hall and soon returning opened the kitchen door and politely ushered in three or four fashionable looking ladies exclaiming here she is as these were strangers from the city who had come to make their first call this introduction was far from proving an eligible onethe look of thunderstruck astonishment with which i greeted their first appearance as i stood brandishing the spit and the terrified snuffling and staring of poor mrs tibbins who again had recourse to her old pocket handkerchief almost entirely vanquished their gravity and it was evident that they were on the point of a broad laugh so recovering my selfpossession i apologized and led the way to the parlor  let these few incidents be a specimen of the four mortal weeks that i spent with these helps during which time i did almost as much work with twice as much anxiety as when there was nobody there and yet every thing went wrong besides the young gentlemen complained of the patches of starch grimed to their collars and the streaks of black coal ironed into their dickies while one week every pocket handkerchief in the house was starched so stiff that you might as well have carried an earthen plate in your pocket the tumblers looked muddy the plates were never washed clean or wiped dry unless i attended to each one and as to eating and drinking we experienced a variety that we had not before considered possible  at length the old woman vanished from the stage and was succeeded by a knowing active capable damsel with a temper like a steeltrap who remained with me just one week and then went off in a fit of spite to her succeeded a rosy goodnatured merry lass who broke the crockery burned the dinner tore the clothes in ironing and knocked down every thing that stood in her way about the house without at all discomposing herself about the matter one night she took the stopper from a barrel of molasses and came singing off up stairs while the molasses ran soberly out into the cellar bottom all night till by morning it was in a state of universal emancipation having done this and also despatched an entire set of tea things by letting the waiter fall she one day made her disappearance  then for a wonder there fell to my lot a tidy efficienttrained english girl pretty and genteel and neat and knowing how to do every thing and with the sweetest temper in the world now said i to myself i shall rest from my labors every thing about the house began to go right and looked as clean and genteel as marys own pretty self but alas this period of repose was interrupted by the vision of a clever trimlooking young man who for some weeks could be heard scraping his boots at the kitchen door every sunday night and at last miss mary with some smiling and blushing gave me to understand that she must leave in two weeks  why mary said i feeling a little mischievous dont you like the place  o yes maam  then why do you look for another  i am not going to another place  what mary are you going to learn a trade  no maam  why then what do you mean to do  i expect to keep house myself maam said she laughing and blushing  o ho said i that is it and so in two weeks i lost the best little girl in the world peace to her memory  after this came an interregnum which put me in mind of the chapter in chronicles that i used to read with great delight when a child where basha and elah and tibni and zimri and omri one after the other came on to the throne of israel all in the compass of half a dozen verses we had one old woman who staid a week and went away with the misery in her tooth one young woman who ran away and got married one cook who came at night and went off before light in the morning one very clever girl who staid a month and then went away because her mother was sick another who staid six weeks and was taken with the fever herself and during all this time who can speak the damage and destruction wrought in the domestic paraphernalia by passing through these multiplied hands  what shall we do shall we give up houses have no furniture to take care of keep merely a bag of meal a porridge pot and a pudding stick and sit in our tent door in real patriarchal independence what shall we do     little edward   were any of you born in new england in the good old catechizing churchgoing schoolgoing orderly times if so you may have seen my uncle abel the most perpendicular rectangular upright downright good man that ever labored six days and rested on the seventh  you remember his hard weatherbeaten countenance where every line seemed drawn with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond his considerate gray eyes that moved over objects as if it were not best to be in a hurry about seeing the circumspect opening and shutting of the mouth his downsitting and uprising all performed with conviction aforethoughtin short the whole ordering of his life and conversation which was according to the tenor of the military order to the right about faceforward march  now if you supposed from all this triangularism of exterior that this good man had nothing kindly within you were much mistaken you often find the greenest grass under a snowdrift and though my uncles mind was not exactly of the flower garden kind still there was an abundance of wholesome and kindly vegetation there  it is true he seldom laughed and never joked himself but no man had a more serious and weighty conviction of what a good joke was in another and when some exceeding witticism was dispensed in his presence you might see uncle abels face slowly relax into an expression of solemn satisfaction and he would look at the author with a sort of quiet wonder as if it was past his comprehension how such a thing could ever come into a mans head  uncle abel too had some relish for the fine arts in proof of which i might adduce the pleasure with which he gazed at the plates in his family bible the likeness whereof is neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the earth and he was also such an eminent musician that he could go through the singing book at one sitting without the least fatigue beating time like a windmill all the way  he had too a liberal hand though his liberality was all by the rule of three he did by his neighbor exactly as he would be done by he loved some things in this world very sincerely he loved his god much but he honored and feared him more he was exact with others he was more exact with himself and he expected his god to be more exact still  every thing in uncle abels house was in the same time place manner and form from years end to years end there was old master bose a dog after my uncles own heart who always walked as if he was studying the multiplication table there was the old clock forever ticking in the kitchen corner with a picture on its face of the sun forever setting behind a perpendicular row of poplar trees there was the neverfailing supply of red peppers and onions hanging over the chimney there too were the yearly hollyhocks and morningglories blooming about the windows there was the best room with its sanded floor the cupboard in one corner with its glass doors the ever green asparagus bushes in the chimney and there was the stand with the bible and almanac on it in another corner there too was aunt betsey who never looked any older because she always looked as old as she could who always dried her catnip and wormwood the last of september and began to clean house the first of may in short this was the land of continuance old time never took it into his head to practise either addition or subtraction or multiplication on its sum total  this aunt betsey aforenamed was the neatest and most efficient piece of human machinery that ever operated in forty places at once she was always every where predominating over and seeing to every thing and though my uncle had been twice married aunt betseys rule and authority had never been broken she reigned over his wives when living and reigned after them when dead and so seemed likely to reign on to the end of the chapter but my uncles latest wife left aunt betsey a much less tractable subject than ever before had fallen to her lot little edward was the child of my uncles old age and a brighter merrier little blossom never grew on the verge of an avalanche he had been committed to the nursing of his grandmamma till he had arrived at the age of indiscretion and then my old uncles heart so yearned for him that he was sent for home  his introduction into the family excited a terrible sensation never was there such a condemner of dignities such a violator of high places and sanctities as this very master edward it was all in vain to try to teach him decorum he was the most outrageously merry elf that ever shook a head of curls and it was all the same to him whether it was sabba day or any other day he laughed and frolicked with every body and every thing that came in his way not even excepting his solemn old father and when you saw him with his fair arms around the old mans neck and his bright blue eyes and blooming cheek peering out beside the bleak face of uncle abel you might fancy you saw spring caressing winter uncle abels metaphysics were sorely puzzled by this sparkling dancing compound of spirit and matter nor could he devise any method of bringing it into any reasonable shape for he did mischief with an energy and perseverance that was truly astonishing once he scoured the floor with aunt betseys very scotch snuff once he washed up the hearth with uncle abels most immaculate clothes brush and once he was found trying to make bose wear his fathers spectacles in short there was no use except the right one to which he did not put every thing that came in his way  but uncle abel was most of all puzzled to know what to do with him on the sabbath for on that day master edward seemed to exert himself to be particularly diligent and entertaining  edward edward must not play sunday his father would call out and then edward would hold up his curly head and look as grave as the catechism but in three minutes you would see pussy scampering through the best room with edward at her heels to the entire discomposure of all devotion in aunt betsey and all others in authority  at length my uncle came to the conclusion that it wasnt in natur to teach him any better and that he could no more keep sunday than the brook down in the lot my poor uncle he did not know what was the matter with his heart but certain it was he lost all faculty of scolding when little edward was in the case and he would rub his spectacles a quarter of an hour longer than common when aunt betsey was detailing his witticisms and clever doings  in process of time our hero had compassed his third year and arrived at the dignity of going to school he went illustriously through the spelling book and then attacked the catechism went from mans chief end to the requirins and forbiddins in a fortnight and at last came home inordinately merry to tell his father that he had got to amen after this he made a regular business of saying over the whole every sunday evening standing with his hands folded in front and his checked apron folded down occasionally glancing round to see if pussy gave proper attention and being of a practically benevolent turn of mind he made several commendable efforts to teach bose the catechism in which he succeeded as well as might be expected in short without further detail master edward bade fair to become a literary wonder  but alas for poor little edward his merry dance was soon over a day came when he sickened aunt betsey tried her whole herbarium but in vain he grew rapidly worse and worse his father sickened in heart but said nothing he only staid by his bedside day and night trying all means to save with affecting pertinacity  cant you think of any thing more doctor said he to the physician when all had been tried in vain  nothing answered the physician  a momentary convulsion passed over my uncles face the will of the lord be done said he almost with a groan of anguish  just at that moment a ray of the setting sun pierced the checked curtains and gleamed like an angels smile across the face of the little sufferer he woke from troubled sleep  o dear i am so sick he gasped feebly his father raised him in his arms he breathed easier and looked up with a grateful smile just then his old playmate the cat crossed the room there goes pussy said he o dear i shall never play any more  at that moment a deadly change passed over his face he looked up in his fathers face with an imploring expression and put out his hand as if for help there was one moment of agony and then the sweet features all settled into a smile of peace and mortality was swallowed up of life  my uncle laid him down and looked one moment at his beautiful face it was too much for his principles too much for his consistency and he lifted up his voice and wept  the next morning was the sabbaththe funeral dayand it rose with breath all incense and with cheek all bloom uncle abel was as calm and collected as ever but in his face there was a sorrowstricken appearance touching to behold i remember him at family prayers as he bent over the great bible and began the psalm lord thou hast been our dwellingplace in all generations apparently he was touched by the melancholy splendor of the poetry for after reading a few verses he stopped there was a dead silence interrupted only by the tick of the clock he cleared his voice repeatedly and tried to go on but in vain he closed the book and kneeled down to prayer the energy of sorrow broke through his usual formal reverence and his language flowed forth with a deep and sorrowful pathos which i shall never forget the god so much reverenced so much feared seemed to draw near to him as a friend and comforter his refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble  my uncle rose and i saw him walk to the room of the departed one he uncovered the face it was set with the seal of death but o how surpassingly lovely the brilliancy of life was gone but that pure transparent face was touched with a mysterious triumphant brightness which seemed like the dawning of heaven  my uncle looked long and earnestly he felt the beauty of what he gazed on his heart was softened but he had no words for his feelings he left the room unconsciously and stood in the front door the morning was bright the bells were ringing for church the birds were singing merrily and the pet squirrel of little edward was frolicking about the door my uncle watched him as he ran first up one tree and then down and up another and then over the fence whisking his brush and chattering just as if nothing was the matter  with a deep sigh uncle abel broke forth how happy that cretur is well the lords will be done  that day the dust was committed to dust amid the lamentations of all who had known little edward years have passed since then and all that is mortal of my uncle has long since been gathered to his fathers but his just and upright spirit has entered the glorious liberty of the sons of god yes the good man may have had opinions which the philosophical scorn weaknesses at which the thoughtless smile but death shall change him into all that is enlightened wise and refined for he shall awake in his likeness and be satisfied     aunt mary   since sketching character is the mode i too take up my pencil not to make you laugh though peradventure it may beto get you to sleep  i am now a tolerably old gentlemanan old bachelor moreoverand what is more to the point an unpretending and soberminded one lest however any of the ladies should take exceptions against me in the very outset i will merely remark en passant that a man can sometimes become an old bachelor because he has too much heart as well as too little  years agobefore any of my readers were borni was a little goodfornought of a boy of precisely that unlucky kind who are always in every bodys way and always in mischief i had to watch over my uprearing a father and mother and a whole army of older brothers and sisters my relatives bore a very great resemblance to other human beings neither good angels nor the opposite class but as mathematicians say in the mean proportion  as i have before insinuated i was a sort of family scapegrace among them and one on whose head all the domestic trespasses were regularly visited either by real actual desert or by imputation  for this order of things there was i confess a very solid and serious foundation in the constitution of my mind whether i was born under some crosseyed planet or whether i was fairysmitten in my cradle certain it is that i was from the dawn of existence a sort of murad the unlucky an outoftime outofplace outofform sort of a boy with whom nothing prospered  who always left open doors in cold weather it was henry who was sure to upset his coffee cup at breakfast or to knock over his tumbler at dinner or to prostrate saltcellar pepper box and mustard pot if he only happened to move his arm why henry who was plate breaker general for the family it was henry who tangled mammas silks and cottons and tore up the last newspaper for papa or threw down old phoebes clothes horse with all her clean ironing thereupon why henry  now all this was no malice prepense in me for i solemnly believe that i was the bestnatured boy in the world but something was the matter with the attraction of cohesion or the attraction of gravitationwith the general dispensation of matter around methat let me do what i would things would fall down and break or be torn and damaged if i only came near them and my unluckiness in any matter seemed in exact proportion to my carefulness  if any body in the room with me had a headache or any kind of nervous irritability which made it particularly necessary for others to be quiet and if i was in an especial desire unto the same i was sure while stepping around on tiptoe to fall headlong over a chair which would give an introductory push to the shovel which would fall upon the tongs which would animate the poker and all together would set in action two or three sticks of wood and down they would come together with just that hearty sociable sort of racket which showed that they were disposed to make as much of the opportunity as possible  in the same manner every thing that came into my hand or was at all connected with me was sure to lose by it if i rejoiced in a clean apron in the morning i was sure to make a fulllength prostration thereupon on my way to school and come home nothing better but rather worse if i was sent on an errand i was sure either to lose my money in going or my purchases in returning and on these occasions my mother would often comfort me with the reflection that it was well that my ears were fastened to my head or i should lose them too of course i was a fair mark for the exhortatory powers not only of my parents but of all my aunts uncles and cousins to the third and fourth generation who ceased not to reprove rebuke and exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine  all this would have been very well if nature had not gifted me with a very unnecessary and uncomfortable capacity of feeling which like a refined ear for music is undesirable because in this world one meets with discord ninetynine times where it meets with harmony once much therefore as i furnished occasion to be scolded at i never became used to scolding so that i was just as much galled by it the fortyfirst time as the first there was no such thing as philosophy in me i had just that unreasonable heart which is not conformed unto the nature of things neither indeed can be i was timid and shrinking and proud i was nothing to any one around me but an awkward unlucky boy nothing to my parents but one of half a dozen children whose faces were to be washed and stockings mended on saturday afternoon if i was very sick i had medicine and the doctor if i was a little sick i was exhorted unto patience and if i was sick at heart i was left to prescribe for myself  now all this was very well what should a child need but meat and drink and room to play and a school to teach him reading and writing and somebody to take care of him when sick certainly nothing  but the feelings of grownup children exist in the mind of little ones oftener than is supposed and i had even at this early day the same keen sense of all that touched the heart wrong the same longing for something which should touch it aright the same discontent with latent matterofcourse affection and the same craving for sympathy which has been the unprofitable fashion of this world in all ages and no human being possessing such constitutionals has a better chance of being made unhappy by them than the backward uninteresting wrongdoing child we can all sympathize to some extent with men and women but how few can go back to the sympathies of childhood can understand the desolate insignificance of not being one of the grownup people of being sent to bed to be out of the way in the evening and to school to be out of the way in the morning of manifold similar grievances and distresses which the child has no elocution to set forth and the grown person no imagination to conceive  when i was seven years old i was told one morning with considerable domestic acclamation that aunt mary was coming to make us a visit and so when the carriage that brought her stopped at our door i pulled off my dirty apron and ran in among the crowd of brothers and sisters to see what was coming i shall not describe her first appearance for as i think of her i begin to grow somewhat sentimental in spite of my spectacles and might perhaps talk a little nonsense  perhaps every man whether married or unmarried who has lived to the age of fifty or thereabouts has seen some woman who in his mind is the woman in distinction from all others she may not have been a relative she may not have been a wife she may simply have shone on him from afar she may be remembered in the distance of years as a star that is set as music that is hushed as beauty and loveliness faded forever but remembered she is with interest with fervor with enthusiasm with all that heart can feel and more than words can tell  to me there has been but one such and that is she whom i describe was she beautiful you ask i also will ask you one question if an angel from heaven should dwell in human form and animate any human face would not that face be lovely it might not be beautiful but would it not be lovely she was not beautiful except after this fashion  how well i remember her as she used sometimes to sit thinking with her head resting on her hand her face mild and placid with a quiet october sunshine in her blue eyes and an everpresent smile over her whole countenance i remember the sudden sweetness of look when any one spoke to her the prompt attention the quick comprehension of things before you uttered them the obliging readiness to leave for you whatever she was doing  to those who mistake occasional pensiveness for melancholy it might seem strange to say that my aunt mary was always happy yet she was so her spirits never rose to buoyancy and never sunk to despondency i know that it is an article in the sentimental confession of faith that such a character cannot be interesting for this impression there is some ground the placidity of a medium commonplace mind is uninteresting but the placidity of a strong and wellgoverned one borders on the sublime mutability of emotion characterizes inferior orders of being but he who combines all interest all excitement all perfection is the same yesterday today and forever and if there be any thing sublime in the idea of an almighty mind in perfect peace itself and therefore at leisure to bestow all its energies on the wants of others there is at least a reflection of the same sublimity in the character of that human being who has so quieted and governed the world within that nothing is left to absorb sympathy or distract attention from those around  such a woman was my aunt mary her placidity was not so much the result of temperament as of choice she had every susceptibility of suffering incident to the noblest and most delicate construction of mind but they had been so directed that instead of concentrating thought on self they had prepared her to understand and feel for others  she was beyond all things else a sympathetic person and her character like the green in a landscape was less remarkable for what it was in itself than for its perfect and beautiful harmony with all the coloring and shading around it  other women have had talents others have been good but no woman that ever i knew possessed goodness and talent in union with such an intuitive perception of feelings and such a faculty of instantaneous adaptation to them the most troublesome thing in this world is to be condemned to the society of a person who can never understand any thing you say unless you say the whole of it making your commas and periods as you go along and the most desirable thing in the world is to live with a person who saves you all the trouble of talking by knowing just what you mean before you begin to speak  something of this kind of talent i began to feel to my great relief when aunt mary came into the family i remember the very first evening as she sat by the hearth surrounded by all the family her eye glanced on me with an expression that let me know she saw me and when the clock struck eight and my mother proclaimed that it was my bedtime my countenance fell as i moved sorrowfully from the back of her rocking chair and thought how many beautiful stories aunt mary would tell after i was gone to bed she turned towards me with such a look of real understanding such an evident insight into the case that i went into banishment with a lighter heart than ever i did before how very contrary is the obstinate estimate of the heart to the rational estimate of worldly wisdom are there not some who can remember when one word one look or even the withholding of a word has drawn their heart more to a person than all the substantial favors in the world by ordinary acceptation substantial kindness respects the necessaries of animal existence while those wants which are peculiar to mind and will exist with it forever by equally correct classification are designated as sentimental ones the supply of which though it will excite more gratitude in fact ought not to in theory before aunt mary had lived with us a month i loved her beyond any body in the world and a utilitarian would have been amused in ciphering out the amount of favors which produced this result it was a looka worda smile it was that she seemed pleased with my new kite that she rejoiced with me when i learned to spin a top that she alone seemed to estimate my proficiency in playing ball and marbles that she never looked at all vexed when i upset her workbox upon the floor that she received all my awkward gallantry and maladroit helpfulness as if it had been in the best taste in the world that when she was sick she insisted on letting me wait on her though i made my customary havoc among the pitchers and tumblers of her room and displayed through my zeal to please a more than ordinary share of insufficiency for the station she also was the only person that ever i conversed with and i used to wonder how any body who could talk all about matters and things with grownup persons could talk so sensibly about marbles and hoops and skates and all sorts of littleboy matters and i will say by the by that the same sort of speculation has often occurred to the minds of older people in connection with her she knew the value of varied information in making a woman not a pedant but a sympathetic companionable being and such she was to almost every class of mind  she had too the faculty of drawing others up to her level in conversation so that i would often find myself going on in most profound style while talking with her and would wonder when i was through whether i was really a little boy still  when she had enlightened us many months the time came for her to take leave and she besought my mother to give me to her for company all the family wondered what she could find to like in henry but if she did like me it was no matter and so was the case disposed of  from that time i lived with herand there are some persons who can make the word live signify much more than it commonly doesand she wrought on my character all those miracles which benevolent genius can work she quieted my heart directed my feelings unfolded my mind and educated me not harshly or by force but as the blessed sunshine educates the flower into full and perfect life and when all that was mortal of her died to this world her words and deeds of unutterable love shed a twilight around her memory that will fade only in the brightness of heaven     frankness   there is one kind of frankness which is the result of perfect unsuspiciousness and which requires a measure of ignorance of the world and of life this kind appeals to our generosity and tenderness there is another which is the frankness of a strong but pure mind acquainted with life clear in its discrimination and upright in its intention yet above disguise or concealment this kind excites respect the first seems to proceed simply from impulse the second from impulse and reflection united the first proceeds in a measure from ignorance the second from knowledge the first is born from an undoubting confidence in others the second from a virtuous and wellgrounded reliance on ones self  now if you suppose that this is the beginning of a sermon or of a fourth of july oration you are very much mistaken though i must confess it hath rather an uncertain sound i merely prefaced it to a little sketch of character which you may look at if you please though i am not sure you will like it  it was said of alice h that she had the mind of a man the heart of a woman and the face of an angela combination that all my readers will think peculiarly happy  there never was a woman who was so unlike the mass of society in her modes of thinking and acting yet so generally popular but the most remarkable thing about her was her proud superiority to all disguise in thought word and deed she pleased you for she spoke out a hundred things that you would conceal and spoke them with a dignified assurance that made you wonder that you had ever hesitated to say them yourself nor did this unreserve appear like the weakness of one who could not conceal or like a determination to make war on the forms of society it was rather a calm wellguided integrity regulated by a just sense of propriety knowing when to be silent but speaking the truth when it spoke at all  her extraordinary frankness often beguiled superficial observers into supposing themselves fully acquainted with her long before they were so as the beautiful transparency of some lakes is said to deceive the eye as to their depth yet the longer you knew her the more variety and compass of character appeared through the same transparent medium but you may just visit miss alice for half an hour tonight and judge for yourselves you may walk into this little parlor there sits miss alice on that sofa sewing a pair of lace sleeves into a satin dress in which peculiarly angelic employment she may persevere till we have finished another sketch  do you see that pretty little lady with sparkling eyes elastic form and beautiful hand and foot sitting opposite to her she is a belle the character is written in her faceit sparkles from her eyeit dimples in her smile and pervades the whole woman  but therealice has risen and is gone to the mirror and is arranging the finest auburn hair in the world in the most tasteful manner the little lady watches every motion as comically as a kitten watches a pinball  it is all in vain to deny it aliceyou are really anxious to look pretty this evening said she  i certainly am said alice quietly  ay and you hope you shall please mr a and mr b said the little accusing angel  certainly i do said alice as she twisted her fingers in a beautiful curl  well i would not tell of it alice if i did  then you should not ask me said alice  i declare alice  and what do you declare  i never saw such a girl as you are  very likely said alice stooping to pick up a pin  well for my part said the little lady i never would take any pains to make any body like meparticularly a gentleman  i would said alice if they would not like me without  why alice i should not think you were so fond of admiration  i like to be admired very much said alice returning to the sofa and i suppose every body else does  i dont care about admiration said the little lady i would be as well satisfied that people shouldnt like me as that they should  then cousin i think its a pity we all like you so well said alice with a goodhumored smile if miss alice had penetration she never made a severe use of it  but really cousin said the little lady i should not think such a girl as you would think any thing about dress or admiration and all that  i dont know what sort of a girl you think i am said alice but for my own part i only pretend to be a common human being and am not ashamed of common human feelings if god has made us so that we love admiration why should we not honestly say so i love ityou love itevery body loves it and why should not every body say it  why yes said the little lady i suppose every body has ahas aa general love for admiration i am willing to acknowledge that i have but  but you have no love for it in particular said alice i suppose you mean to say that is just the way the matter is commonly disposed of every body is willing to acknowledge a general wish for the good opinion of others but half the world are ashamed to own it when it comes to a particular case now i have made up my mind that if it is correct in general it is correct in particular and i mean to own it both ways  but somehow it seems mean said the little lady  it is mean to live for it to be selfishly engrossed in it but not mean to enjoy it when it comes or even to seek it if we neglect no higher interest in doing so all that god made us to feel is dignified and pure unless we pervert it  but alice i never heard any person speak out so frankly as you do  almost all that is innocent and natural may be spoken out and as for that which is not innocent and natural it ought not even to be thought  but can every thing be spoken that may be thought said the lady  no we have an instinct which teaches us to be silent sometimes but if we speak at all let it be in simplicity and sincerity  now for instance alice said the lady it is very innocent and natural as you say to think this that and the other nice thing of yourself especially when every body is telling you of it now would you speak the truth if any one asked you on this point  if it were a person who had a right to ask and if it were a proper time and place i would said alice  well then said the bright lady i ask you alice in this very proper time and place do you think that you are handsome  now i suppose you expect me to make a courtesy to every chair in the room before i answer said alice but dispensing with that ceremony i will tell you fairly i think i am  do you think that you are good  not entirely said alice  well but dont you think you are better than most people  as far as i can tell i think i am better than some people but really cousin i dont trust my own judgment in this matter said alice  well alice one more question do you think james martyrs likes you or me best  i do not know said alice  i did not ask you what you knew but what you thought said the lady you must have some thought about it  well then i think he likes me best said alice  just then the door opened and in walked the identical james martyrs alice blushed looked a little comical and went on with her sewing while the little lady began  really mr james i wish you had come a minute sooner to hear alices confessions  what has she confessed said james  why that she is handsomer and better than most folks  thats nothing to be ashamed of said james  o thats not all she wants to look pretty and loves to be admired and all  it sounds very much like her said james looking at alice  o but besides that said the lady she has been preaching a discourse in justification of vanity and selflove  and next time you shall take notes when i preach said alice for i dont think your memory is remarkably happy  you see james said the lady that alice makes it a point to say exactly the truth when she speaks at all and ive been puzzling her with questions i really wish you would ask her some and see what she will say but mercy there is uncle c come to take me to ride i must run and off flew the little humming bird leaving james and alice têteàtête  there really is one question said james clearing his voice  alice looked up  there is one question alice which i wish you would answer  alice did not inquire what the question was but began to look very solemn and just then the door was shutand so i never knew what the question wasonly i observed that james martyrs seemed in some seventh heaven for a week afterwards andandyou can finish for yourself lady     the sabbath  sketches from a note book of an elderly gentleman   the puritan sabbathis there such a thing existing now or has it gone with the things that were to be looked at as a curiosity in the museum of the past can any one in memory take himself back to the unbroken stillness of that day and recall the sense of religious awe which seemed to brood in the very atmosphere checking the merry laugh of childhood and chaining in unwonted stillness the tongue of volatile youth and imparting even to the sunshine of heaven and the unconscious notes of animals a tone of its own gravity and repose if you cannot remember these things go back with me to the verge of early boyhood and live with me one of the sabbaths that i have spent beneath the roof of my uncle phineas fletcher  imagine the long sunny hours of a saturday afternoon insensibly slipping away as we youngsters are exploring the length and breadth of a trout stream or chasing gray squirrels or building mud milldams in the brook the sun sinks lower and lower but we still think it does not want half an hour to sundown at last he so evidently is really going down that there is no room for scepticism or latitude of opinion on the subject and with many a lingering regret we began to put away our fishhooks and hang our hoops over our arm preparatory to trudging homeward  o henry dont you wish that saturday afternoons lasted longer said little john to me  i do says cousin bill who was never the boy to mince matters in giving his sentiments and i wouldnt care if sunday didnt come but once a year  o bill thats wicked im afraid says little conscientious susan who with her doll in hand was coming home from a saturday afternoon visit  cant help it says bill catching susans bag and tossing it in the air i never did like to sit still and thats why i hate sundays  hate sundays o bill why aunt kezzy says heaven is an eternal sabbathonly think of that  well i know i must be pretty different from what i am now before i could sit still forever said bill in a lower and somewhat disconcerted tone as if admitting the force of the consideration  the rest of us began to look very grave and to think that we must get to liking sunday some time or other or it would be a very bad thing for us as we drew near the dwelling the compact and businesslike form of aunt kezzy was seen emerging from the house to hasten our approach  how often have i told you young ones not to stay out after sundown on saturday night dont you know its the same as sunday you wicked children you come right into the house every one of you and never let me hear of such a thing again  this was aunt kezzys regular exordium every saturday night for we children being blinded as she supposed by natural depravity always made strange mistakes in reckoning time on saturday afternoons after being duly suppered and scrubbed we were enjoined to go to bed and remember that tomorrow was sunday and that we must not laugh and play in the morning with many a sorrowful look did susan deposit her doll in the chest and give one lingering glance at the patchwork she was piecing for dollys bed while william john and myself emptied our pockets of all superfluous fishhooks bits of twine popguns slices of potato marbles and all the various items of boy property which to keep us from temptation were taken into aunt kezzys safe keeping over sunday  my uncle phineas was a man of great exactness and sunday was the centre of his whole worldly and religious system every thing with regard to his worldly business was so arranged that by saturday noon it seemed to come to a close of itself all his accounts were looked over his workmen paid all borrowed things returned and lent things sent after and every tool and article belonging to the farm was returned to its own place at exactly such an hour every saturday afternoon and an hour before sundown every item of preparation even to the blacking of his sunday shoes and the brushing of his sunday coat was entirely concluded and at the going down of the sun the stillness of the sabbath seemed to settle down over the whole dwelling  and now it is sunday morning and though all without is fragrance and motion and beauty the dewdrops are twinkling butterflies fluttering and merry birds carolling and racketing as if they never could sing loud or fast enough yet within there is such a stillness that the tick of the tall mahogany clock is audible through the whole house and the buzz of the blue flies as they whiz along up and down the window panes is a distinct item of hearing look into the best front room and you may see the upright form of my uncle phineas in his immaculate sunday clothes with his bible spread open on the little stand before him and even a deeper than usual gravity settling down over his toilworn features alongside in wellbrushed sunday clothes with clean faces and smooth hair sat the whole of us younger people each drawn up in a chair with hat and handkerchief ready for the first stroke of the bell while aunt kezzy all trimmed and primmed and made ready for meeting sat reading her psalm book only looking up occasionally to give an additional jerk to some shirt collar or the fifteenth pull to susans frock or to repress any straggling looks that might be wandering about beholding vanity  a stranger in glancing at uncle phineas as he sat intent on his sunday reading might have seen that the sabbath was in his heartthere was no mistake about it it was plain that he had put by all worldly thoughts when he shut up his account book and that his mind was as free from every earthly association as his sunday coat was from dust the slave of worldliness who is driven by perplexing business or adventurous speculation through the hours of a halfkept sabbath to the fatigues of another week might envy the unbroken quiet the sunny tranquillity which hallowed the weekly rest of my uncle  the sabbath of the puritan christian was the golden day and all its associations and all its thoughts words and deeds were so entirely distinct from the ordinary material of life that it was to him a sort of weekly translationa quitting of this world to sojourn a day in a better and year after year as each sabbath set its seal on the completed labors of a week the pilgrim felt that one more stage of his earthly journey was completed and that he was one week nearer to his eternal rest and as years with their changes came on and the strong man grew old and missed one after another familiar forms that had risen around his earlier years the face of the sabbath became like that of an old and tried friend carrying him back to the scenes of his youth and connecting him with scenes long gone by restoring to him the dew and freshness of brighter and more buoyant days  viewed simply as an institution for a christian and mature mind nothing could be more perfect than the puritan sabbath if it had any failing it was in the want of adaptation to children and to those not interested in its peculiar duties if you had been in the dwelling of my uncle of a sabbath morning you must have found the unbroken stillness delightful the calm and quiet must have soothed and disposed you for contemplation and the evident appearance of singlehearted devotion to the duties of the day in the elder part of the family must have been a striking addition to the picture but then if your eye had watched attentively the motions of us juveniles you might have seen that what was so very invigorating to the disciplined christian was a weariness to young flesh and bones then there was not as now the intellectual relaxation afforded by the sunday school with its various forms of religious exercise its thousand modes of interesting and useful information our whole stock in this line was the bible and primer and these were our main dependence for whiling away the tedious hours between our early breakfast and the signal for meeting how often was our invention stretched to find wherewithal to keep up our stock of excitement in a line with the duties of the day for the first half hour perhaps a story in the bible answered our purpose very well but having despatched the history of joseph or the story of the ten plagues we then took to the primer and then there was first the looking over the system of theological and ethical teaching commencing in adams fall we sinned all and extending through three or four pages of pictorial and poetic embellishment next was the death of john rogers who was burned at smithfield and for a while we could entertain ourselves with counting all his nine children and one at the breast as in the picture they stand in a regular row like a pair of stairs these being done came miscellaneous exercises of our own invention such as counting all the psalms in the psalm book backward and forward to and from the doxology or numbering the books in the bible or some other such device as we deemed within the pale of religious employments when all these failed and it still wanted an hour of meeting time we looked up at the ceiling and down at the floor and all around into every corner to see what we could do next and happy was he who could spy a pin gleaming in some distant crack and forthwith muster an occasion for getting down to pick it up then there was the infallible recollection that we wanted a drink of water as an excuse to get out to the well or else we heard some strange noise among the chickens and insisted that it was essential that we should see what was the matter or else pussy would jump on to the table when all of us would spring to drive her down while there was a most assiduous watching of the clock to see when the first bell would ring happy was it for us in the interim if we did not begin to look at each other and make up faces or slyly slip off and on our shoes or some other incipient attempts at roguery which would gradually so undermine our gravity that there would be some sudden explosion of merriment whereat uncle phineas would look up and say tut tut and aunt kezzy would make a speech about wicked children breaking the sabbath day i remember once how my cousin bill got into deep disgrace one sunday by a roguish trick he was just about to close his bible with all sobriety when snap came a grasshopper through an open window and alighted in the middle of the page bill instantly kidnapped the intruder for so important an auxiliary in the way of employment was not to be despised presently we children looked towards bill and there he sat very demurely reading his bible with the grasshopper hanging by one leg from the corner of his mouth kicking and sprawling without in the least disturbing master williams gravity we all burst into an uproarious laugh but it came to be rather a serious affair for bill as his good father was in the practice of enforcing truth and duty by certain modes of moral suasion much recommended by solomon though fallen into disrepute at the present day  this morning picture may give a good specimen of the whole livelong sunday which presented only an alternation of similar scenes until sunset when a universal unchaining of tongues and a general scamper proclaimed that the sun was down  but it may be asked what was the result of all this strictness did it not disgust you with the sabbath and with religion no it did not it did not because it was the result of no unkindly feeling but of consistent principle and consistency of principle is what even children learn to appreciate and revere the law of obedience and of reverence for the sabbath was constraining so equally on the young and the old that its claims came to be regarded like those immutable laws of nature which no one thinks of being out of patience with though they sometimes bear hard on personal convenience the effect of the system was to ingrain into our character a veneration for the sabbath which no friction of after life would ever efface i have lived to wander in many climates and foreign lands where the sabbath is an unknown name or where it is only recognized by noisy mirth but never has the day returned without bringing with it a breathing of religious awe and even a yearning for the unbroken stillness the placid repose and the simple devotion of the puritan sabbath   another scene  how late we are this morning said mrs roberts to her husband glancing hurriedly at the clock as they were sitting down to breakfast on a sabbath morning really it is a shame to us to be so late sundays i wonder john and henry are not up yet hannah did you speak to them  yes maam but i could not make them mind they said it was sunday and that we always have breakfast later sundays  well it is a shame to us i must say said mrs roberts sitting down to the table i never lie late myself unless something in particular happens last night i was out very late and sabbath before last i had a bad headache  well well my dear said mr roberts it is not worth while to worry yourself about it sunday is a day of rest every body indulges a little of a sunday morning it is so very natural you know ones work done up one feels like taking a little rest  well i must say it was not the way my mother brought me up said mrs roberts and i really cant feel it to be right  this last part of the discourse had been listened to by two sleepylooking boys who had meanwhile taken their seats at table with that listless air which is the result of late sleeping  o by the by my dear what did you give for those hams saturday said mr roberts  eleven cents a pound i believe replied mrs roberts but stephens and philips have some much nicer canvas and all for ten cents i think we had better get our things at stephens and philipss in future my dear  why are they much cheaper  o a great deal but i forget it is sunday we ought to be thinking of other things boys have you looked over your sunday school lesson  no maam  now how strange and here it wants only half an hour of the time and you are not dressed either now see the bad effects of not being up in time  the boys looked sullen and said they were up as soon as any one else in the house  well your father and i had some excuse because we were out late last night you ought to have been up full three hours ago and to have been all ready with your lessons learned now what do you suppose you shall do  o mother do let us stay at home this one morning we dont know the lesson and it wont do any good for us to go  no indeed i shall not you must go and get along as well as you can it is all your own fault now go up stairs and hurry we shall not find time for prayers this morning  the boys took themselves up stairs to hurry as directed and soon one of them called from the top of the stairs mother mother the buttons are off this vest so i cant wear it and mother here is a long rip in my best coat said another  why did you not tell me of it before said mrs roberts coming up stairs  i forgot it said the boy  well well stand still i must catch it together somehow if it is sunday there there is the bell stand still a minute and mrs roberts plied needle and thread and scissors there that will do for today dear me how confused every thing is today  it is always just so sundays said john flinging up his book and catching it again as he ran down stairs  it is always just so sundays these words struck rather unpleasantly on mrs robertss conscience for something told her that whatever the reason might be it was just so on sunday every thing was later and more irregular than any other day in the week  hannah you must boil that piece of beef for dinner today  i thought you told me you did not have cooking done on sunday  no i do not generally i am very sorry mr roberts would get that piece of meat yesterday we did not need it but here it is on our hands the weather is too hot to keep it it wont do to let it spoil so i must have it boiled for aught i see  hannah had lived four sabbaths with mrs roberts and on two of them she had been required to cook from similar reasoning for once is apt in such cases to become a phrase of very extensive signification  it really worries me to have things go on so as they do on sundays said mrs roberts to her husband i never do feel as if we kept sunday as we ought  my dear you have been saying so ever since we were married and i do not see what you are going to do about it for my part i do not see why we do not do as well as people in general we do not visit nor receive company nor read improper books we go to church and send the children to sunday school and so the greater part of the day is spent in a religious way then out of church we have the childrens sunday school books and one or two religious newspapers i think that is quite enough  but somehow when i was a child my mother said mrs roberts hesitating  o my dear your mother must not be considered an exact pattern for these days people were too strict in your mothers time they carried the thing too far altogether every body allows it now  mrs roberts was silenced but not satisfied a strict religious education had left just conscience enough on this subject to make her uneasy  these worthy people had a sort of general idea that sunday ought to be kept and they intended to keep it but they had never taken the trouble to investigate or inquire as to the most proper way nor was it so much an object of interest that their weekly arrangements were planned with any reference to it mr roberts would often engage in business at the close of the week which he knew would so fatigue him that he would be weary and listless on sunday and mrs roberts would allow her family cares to accumulate in the same way so that she was either wearied with efforts to accomplish it before the sabbath or perplexed and worried by finding every thing at loose ends on that day they had the idea that sunday was to be kept when it was perfectly convenient and did not demand any sacrifice of time or money but if stopping to keep the sabbath in a journey would risk passage money or a seat in the stage or in housekeeping if it would involve any considerable inconvenience or expense it was deemed a providential intimation that it was a work of necessity and mercy to attend to secular matters to their minds the fourth command read thus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy when it comes convenient and costs neither time nor money  as to the effects of this on the children there was neither enough of strictness to make them respect the sabbath nor of religions interest to make them love it of course the little restraint there was proved just enough to lead them to dislike and despise it children soon perceive the course of their parents feelings and it was evident enough to the children of this family that their father and mother generally found themselves hurried into the sabbath with hearts and minds full of this world and their conversation and thoughts were so constantly turning to worldly things and so awkwardly drawn back by a sense of religious obligation that the sabbath appeared more obviously a clog and a fetter than it did under the strictest régime of puritan days   sketch second  the little quiet village of camden stands under the brow of a rugged hill in one of the most picturesque parts of new england and its regular honest and industrious villagers were not a little surprised and pleased that mr james a rich man and pleasantspoken withal had concluded to take up his residence among them he brought with him a pretty genteel wife and a group of rosy romping but amiable children and there was so much of good nature and kindness about the manners of every member of the family that the whole neighborhood were prepossessed in their favor mr james was a man of somewhat visionary and theoretical turn of mind and very much in the habit of following out his own ideas of right and wrong without troubling himself particularly as to the appearance his course might make in the eyes of others he was a supporter of the ordinances of religion and always ready to give both time and money to promote any benevolent object and though he had never made any public profession of religion nor connected himself with any particular set of christians still he seemed to possess great reverence for god and to worship him in spirit and in truth and he professed to make the bible the guide of his life mr james had been brought up under a system of injudicious religious restraint he had determined in educating his children to adopt an exactly opposite course and to make religion and all its institutions sources of enjoyment his aim doubtless was an appropriate one but his method of carrying it out to say the least was one which was not a safe model for general imitation in regard to the sabbath for example he considered that although the plan of going to church twice a day and keeping all the family quiet within doors the rest of the time was good other methods would be much better accordingly after the morning service which he and his whole family regularly attended he would spend the rest of the day with his children in bad weather he would instruct them in natural history show them pictures and read them various accounts of the works of god combining all with such religious instruction and influence as a devotional mind might furnish when the weather permitted he would range with them through the fields collecting minerals and plants or sail with them on the lake meanwhile directing the thoughts of his young listeners upward to god by the many beautiful traces of his presence and agency which superior knowledge and observation enabled him to discover and point out these sunday strolls were seasons of most delightful enjoyment to the children though it was with some difficulty that their father could restrain them from loud and noisy demonstrations of delight and he saw with some regret that the mere animal excitement of the stroll seemed to draw the attention too much from religious considerations and in particular to make the exercises of the morning seem like a preparatory penance to the enjoyments of the afternoon nevertheless when mr james looked back to his own boyhood and remembered the frigid restraint the entire want of any kind of mental or bodily excitement which had made the sabbath so much a weariness to him he could not but congratulate himself when he perceived his children looking forward to sunday as a day of delight and found himself on that day continually surrounded by a circle of smiling and cheerful faces his talent of imparting religious instruction in a simple and interesting form was remarkably happy and it is probable that there was among his children an uncommon degree of real thought and feeling on religious subjects as the result  the good people of camden however knew not what to think of a course that appeared to them an entire violation of all the requirements of the sabbath the first impulse of human nature is to condemn at once all who vary from what has been commonly regarded as the right way and accordingly mr james was unsparingly denounced by many good people as a sabbath breaker an infidel and an opposer to religion  such was the character heard of him by mr richards a young clergyman who shortly after mr james fixed his residence in camden accepted the pastoral charge of the village it happened that mr richards had known mr james in college and remembering him as a remarkably serious amiable and conscientious man he resolved to ascertain from himself the views which had led him to the course of conduct so offensive to the good people of the neighborhood  this is all very well my good friend said he after he had listened to mr jamess eloquent account of his own system of religious instruction and its effects upon his family i do not doubt that this system does very well for yourself and family but there are other things to be taken into consideration besides personal and family improvement do you not know mr james that the most worthless and careless part of my congregation quote your example as a respectable precedent for allowing their families to violate the order of the sabbath you and your children sail about on the lake with minds and hearts i doubt not elevated and tranquillized by its quiet repose but ben dakes and his idle profane army of children consider themselves as doing very much the same thing when they lie lolling about sunning themselves on its shore or skipping stones over its surface the whole of a sunday afternoon  let every one answer to his own conscience replied mr james if i keep the sabbath conscientiously i am approved of god if another transgresses his conscience to his own master he standeth or falleth i am not responsible for all the abuses that idle or evildisposed persons may fall into in consequence of my doing what is right  let me quote an answer from the same chapter said mr richards let no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way let not your good be evil spoken of it is good neither to eat flesh nor drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or made weak now my good friend you happen to be endowed with a certain tone of mind which enables you to carry through your mode of keeping the sabbath with little comparative evil and much good so far as your family is concerned but how many persons in this neighborhood do you suppose would succeed equally well if they were to attempt it if it were the common custom for families to absent themselves from public worship in the afternoon and to stroll about the fields or ride or sail how many parents do you suppose would have the dexterity and talent to check all that was inconsistent with the duties of the day is it not your ready command of language your uncommon tact in simplifying and illustrating your knowledge of natural history and of biblical literature that enable you to accomplish the results that you do and is there one parent in a hundred that could do the same now just imagine our neighbor squire hart with his ten boys and girls turned out into the fields on a sunday afternoon to profit withal you know he can never finish a sentence without stopping to begin it again half a dozen times what progress would he make in instructing them and so of a dozen others i could name along this very street here now you men of cultivated minds must give your countenance to courses which would be best for society at large or as the sentiment was expressed by st paul we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves for even christ pleased not himself think my dear sir if our savior had gone only on the principle of avoiding what might be injurious to his own improvement how unsafe his example might have proved to less elevated minds doubtless he might have made a sabbath day fishing excursion an occasion of much elevated and impressive instruction but although he declared himself lord of the sabbath day and at liberty to suspend its obligation at his own discretion yet he never violated the received method of observing it except in cases where superstitious tradition trenched directly on those interests which the sabbath was given to promote he asserted the right to relieve pressing bodily wants and to administer to the necessities of others on the sabbath but beyond that he allowed himself in no deviation from established custom  mr james looked thoughtful i have not reflected on the subject in this view he replied but my dear sir considering how little of the public services of the sabbath is on a level with the capacity of younger children it seems to me almost a pity to take them to church the whole of the day  i have thought of that myself replied mr richards and have sometimes thought that could persons be found to conduct such a thing it would be desirable to institute a separate service for children in which the exercises should be particularly adapted to them  i should like to be minister to a congregation of children said mr james warmly  well replied mr richards give our good people time to get acquainted with you and do away the prejudices which your extraordinary mode of proceeding has induced and i think i could easily assemble such a company for you every sabbath  after this much to the surprise of the village mr james and his family were regular attendants at both the services of the sabbath mr richards explained to the good people of his congregation the motives which had led their neighbor to the adoption of what to them seemed so unchristian a course and upon reflection they came to the perception of the truth that a man may depart very widely from the received standard of right for other reasons than being an infidel or an opposer of religion a ready return of cordial feeling was the result and as mr james found himself treated with respect and confidence he began to feel notwithstanding his fastidiousness that there were strong points of congeniality between all real and warmhearted christians however different might be their intellectual culture and in all simplicity united himself with the little church of camden a year from the time of his first residence there every sabbath afternoon saw him surrounded by a congregation of young children for whose benefit he had at his own expense provided a room fitted up with maps scriptural pictures and every convenience for the illustration of biblical knowledge and the parents or guardians who from time to time attended their children during these exercises often confessed themselves as much interested and benefited as any of their youthful companions   sketch third  it was near the close of a pleasant saturday afternoon that i drew up my weary horse in front of a neat little dwelling in the village of n this as near as i could gather from description was the house of my cousin william fletcher the identical rogue of a bill fletcher of whom we have aforetime spoken bill had always been a thriving pushahead sort of a character and during the course of my rambling life i had improved every occasional opportunity of keeping up our early acquaintance the last time that i returned to my native country after some years of absence i heard of him as married and settled in the village of n where he was conducting a very prosperous course of business and shortly after received a pressing invitation to visit him at his own home now as i had gathered from experience the fact that it is of very little use to rap ones knuckles off on the front door of a country house without any knocker i therefore made the best of my way along a little path bordered with marigolds and balsams that led to the back part of the dwelling the sound of a number of childish voices made me stop and looking through the bushes i saw the very image of my cousin bill fletcher as he used to be twenty years ago the same bold forehead the same dark eyes the same smart saucy mouth and the same whocaresforthat toss to his head there now exclaimed the boy setting down a pair of shoes that he had been blacking and arranging them at the head of a long row of all sizes and sorts from those which might have fitted a two year old foot upward there ive blacked every single one of them and made them shine too and done it all in twenty minutes if any body thinks they can do it quicker than that id just like to have them try thats all  i know they couldnt though said a fairhaired little girl who stood admiring the sight evidently impressed with the utmost reverence for her brothers ability and bill ive been putting up all the playthings in the big chest and i want you to come and turn the lockthe key hurts my fingers  poh i can turn it easier than that said the boy snapping his fingers have you got them all in  yes all only i left out the soft bales and the string of red beads and the great rag baby for fanny to play withyou know mother says babies must have their playthings sunday  o to be sure said the brother very considerately babies cant read you know as we can nor hear bible stories nor look at pictures at this moment i stepped forward for the spell of former times was so powerfully on me that i was on the very point of springing forward with a halloo there bill as i used to meet the father in old times but the look of surprise that greeted my appearance brought me to myself  is your father at home said i  father and mother are both gone out but i guess sir they will be home in a few moments wont you walk in  i accepted the invitation and the little girl showed me into a small and very prettily furnished parlor there was a piano with music books on one side of the room some fine pictures hung about the walls and a little neat centre table was plentifully strewn with books besides this the two recesses on each side of the fireplace contained each a bookcase with a glass locked door  the little girl offered me a chair and then lingered a moment as if she felt some disposition to entertain me if she could only think of something to say and at last looking up in my face she said in a confidential tone mother says she left willie and me to keep house this afternoon while she was gone and we are putting up all the things for sunday so as to get every thing done before she comes home willie has gone to put away the playthings and im going to put up the books so saying she opened the doors of one of the bookcases and began busily carrying the books from the centre table to deposit them on the shelves in which employment she was soon assisted by willie who took the matter in hand in a very masterly manner showing his sister what were and what were not sunday books with the air of a person entirely at home in the business robinson crusoe and the manyvolumed peter parley were put by without hesitation there was however a short demurring over a north american review because willie said he was sure his father read something one sunday out of one of them while susan averred that he did not commonly read in it and only read in it then because the piece was something about the bible but as nothing could be settled definitively on the point the review was laid on the table like knotty questions in congress then followed a long discussion over an extract book which as usual contained all sorts both sacred serious comic and profane and at last willie with much gravity decided to lock it up on the principle that it was best to be on the safe side in support of which he appealed to me i was saved from deciding the question by the entrance of the father and mother my old friend knew me at once and presented his pretty wife to me with the same look of exultation with which he used to hold up a string of trout or an uncommonly fine perch of his own catching for my admiration and then looking round on his fine family of children two more of which he had brought home with him seemed to say to me there what do you think of that now  and in truth a very pretty sight it wasenough to make any ones old bachelor coat sit very uneasily on him indeed there is nothing that gives one such a startling idea of the tricks that old father time has been playing on us as to meet some boyish or girlish companions with half a dozen or so of thriving children about them my old friend i found was in essence just what the boy had been there was the same upright bearing the same confident cheerful tone to his voice and the same fire in his eye only that the hand of manhood had slightly touched some of the lines of his face giving them a staidness of expression becoming the man and the father  very well my children said mrs fletcher as after tea william and susan finished recounting to her the various matters that they had set in order that afternoon i believe now we can say that our weeks work is finished and that we have nothing to do but rest and enjoy ourselves  o and papa will show us the pictures in those great books that he brought home for us last monday will he not said little robert  and mother you will tell us some more about solomons temple and his palaces wont you said susan  and i should like to know if father has found out the answer to that hard question i gave him last sunday said willie  all will come in good time said mrs fletcher but tell me my dear children are you sure that you are quite ready for the sabbath you say you have put away the books and the playthings have you put away too all wrong and unkind feelings do you feel kindly and pleasantly towards every body  yes mother said willie who appeared to have taken a great part of this speech to himself i went over to tom walters this very morning to ask him about that chicken of mine and he said that he did not mean to hit it and did not know he had till i told him of it and so we made all up again and i am glad i went  i am inclined to think willie said his father that if every body would make it a rule to settle up all their differences before sunday there would be very few long quarrels and lawsuits in about half the cases a quarrel is founded on some misunderstanding that would be got over in five minutes if one would go directly to the person for explanation  i suppose i need not ask you said mrs fletcher whether you have fully learned your sunday school lessons  o to be sure said william you know mother that susan and i were busy about them through monday and tuesday and then this afternoon we looked them over again and wrote down some questions  and i heard robert say his all through and showed him all the places on the bible atlas said susan  well then said my friend if every thing is done let us begin sunday with some music  thanks to the recent improvements in the musical instruction of the young every family can now form a domestic concert with words and tunes adapted to the capacity and the voices of children and while these little ones full of animation pressed round their mother as she sat at the piano and accompanied her music with the words of some beautiful hymns i thought that though i might have heard finer music i had never listened to any that answered the purpose of music so well  it was a custom at my friends to retire at an early hour on saturday evening in order that there might be abundant time for rest and no excuse for late rising on the sabbath and accordingly when the children had done singing after a short season of family devotion we all betook ourselves to our chambers and i for one fell asleep with the impression of having finished the week most agreeably and with anticipations of very great pleasure on the morrow  early in the morning i was roused from my sleep by the sound of little voices singing with great animation in the room next to mine and listening i caught the following words      awake awake your bed forsake       to god your praises pay     the morning sun is clear and bright     with joy we hail his cheerful light           in songs of love           praise god above         it is the sabbath day  the last words were repeated and prolonged most vehemently by a voice that i knew for master williams  now willie i like the other one best said the soft voice of little susan and immediately she began      how sweet is the day     when leaving our play       the saviour we seek     the fair morning glows     when jesus arose       the best in the week  master william helped along with great spirit in the singing of this tune though i heard him observing at the end of the first verse that he liked the other one better because it seemed to step off so kind o lively and his accommodating sister followed him as he began singing it again with redoubled animation  it was a beautiful summer morning and the voices of the children within accorded well with the notes of birds and bleating flocks withouta cheerful yet sabbathlike and quieting sound  blessed be childrens music said i to myself how much better this is than the solitary tick tick of old uncle fletchers tall mahogany clock  the family bell summoned us to the breakfast room just as the children had finished their hymn the little breakfast parlor had been swept and garnished expressly for the day and a vase of beautiful flowers which the children had the day before collected from their gardens adorned the centre table the door of one of the bookcases by the fireplace was thrown open presenting to view a collection of prettily bound books over the top of which appeared in gilt letters the inscription sabbath library the windows were thrown open to let in the invigorating breath of the early morning and the birds that flitted among the rosebushes without seemed scarcely lighter and more buoyant than did the children as they entered the room it was legibly written on every face in the house that the happiest day in the week had arrived and each one seemed to enter into its duties with a whole soul it was still early when the breakfast and the season of family devotion were over and the children eagerly gathered round the table to get a sight of the pictures in the new books which their father had purchased in new york the week before and which had been reserved as a sundays treat they were a beautiful edition of calmets dictionary in several large volumes with very superior engravings  it seems to me that this work must be very expensive i remarked to my friend as we were turning the leaves  indeed it is so he replied but here is one place where i am less withheld by considerations of expense than in any other in all that concerns making a show in the world i am perfectly ready to economize i can do very well without expensive clothing or fashionable furniture and am willing that we should be looked on as very plain sort of people in all such matters but in all that relates to the cultivation of the mind and the improvement of the hearts of my children i am willing to go to the extent of my ability whatever will give my children a better knowledge of or deeper interest in the bible or enable them to spend a sabbath profitably and without weariness stands first on my list among things to be purchased i have spent in this way one third as much as the furnishing of my house costs me on looking over the shelves of the sabbath library i perceived that my friend had been at no small pains in the selection it comprised all the popular standard works for the illustration of the bible together with the best of the modern religious publications adapted to the capacity of young children two large drawers below were filled with maps and scriptural engravings some of them of a very superior character  we have been collecting these things gradually ever since we have been at housekeeping said my friend the children take an interest in this library as something more particularly belonging to them and some of the books are donations from their little earnings  yes said willie i bought helens pilgrimage with my egg money and susan bought the life of david and little robert is going to buy one too next new year  but said i would not the sunday school library answer all the purpose of this  the sabbath school library is an admirable thing said my friend but this does more fully and perfectly what that was intended to do it makes a sort of central attraction at home on the sabbath and makes the acquisition of religious knowledge and the proper observance of the sabbath a sort of family enterprise you know he added smiling that people always feel interested for an object in which they have invested money  the sound of the first sabbath school bell put an end to this conversation the children promptly made themselves ready and as their father was the superintendent of the school and their mother one of the teachers it was quite a family party  one part of every sabbath at my friends was spent by one or both parents with the children in a sort of review of the week the attention of the little ones was directed to their own characters the various defects or improvements of the past week were pointed out and they were stimulated to be on their guard in the time to come and the whole was closed by earnest prayer for such heavenly aid as the temptations and faults of each particular one might need after church in the evening while the children were thus withdrawn to their mothers apartment i could not forbear reminding my friend of old times and of the rather antisabbatical turn of his mind in our boyish days  now william said i do you know that you were the last boy of whom such an enterprise in sabbath keeping as this was to have been expected i suppose you remember sunday at the old place  nay now i think i was the very one said he smiling for i had sense enough to see as i grew up that the day must be kept thoroughly or not at all and i had enough blood and motion in my composition to see that something must be done to enliven and make it interesting so i set myself about it it was one of the first of our housekeeping resolutions that the sabbath should be made a pleasant day and yet be as inviolably kept as in the strictest times of our good father and we have brought things to run in that channel so long that it seems to be the natural order  i have always supposed said i that it required a peculiar talent and more than common information in a parent to accomplish this to any extent  it requires nothing replied my friend but common sense and a strong determination to do it parents who make a definite object of the religious instruction of their children if they have common sense can very soon see what is necessary in order to interest them and if they find themselves wanting in the requisite information they can in these days very readily acquire it the sources of religious knowledge are so numerous and so popular in their form that all can avail themselves of them the only difficulty after all is that the keeping of the sabbath and the imparting of religious instruction are not made enough of a home object parents pass off the responsibility on to the sunday school teacher and suppose of course if they send their children to sunday school they do the best they can for them now i am satisfied from my experience as a sabbath school teacher that the best religious instruction imparted abroad still stands in need of the coöperation of a systematic plan of religious discipline and instruction at home for after all god gives a power to the efforts of a parent that can never be transferred to other hands  but do you suppose said i that the common class of minds with ordinary advantages can do what you have done  i think in most cases they could if they begin right but when both parents and children have formed habits it is more difficult to change than to begin right at first however i think all might accomplish a great deal if they would give time money and effort towards it it is because the object is regarded of so little value compared with other things of a worldly nature that so little is done  my friend was here interrupted by the entrance of mrs fletcher with the children mrs fletcher sat down to the piano and the sabbath was closed with the happy songs of the little ones nor could i notice a single anxious eye turning to the window to see if the sun was not almost down the tender and softened expression of each countenance bore witness to the subduing power of those instructions which had hallowed the last hour and their sweet birdlike voices harmonized well with the beautiful words      how sweet the light of sabbath eve     how soft the sunbeam lingering there     those holy hours this low earth leave     and rise on wings of faith and prayer     let every man mind his own business   and so you will not sign this paper said alfred melton to his cousin a finelooking young man who was lounging by the centre table  not i indeed what in life have i to do with these decidedly vulgar temperance pledges pshaw they have a relish of whiskey in their very essence  come come cousin melton said a brilliant darkeyed girl who had been lolling on the sofa during the conference i beg of you to give over attempting to evangelize edward you see as falstaff has it he is little better than one of the wicked you must not waste such valuable temperance documents on him  but seriously melton my good fellow resumed edward this signing and sealing and pledging is altogether an unnecessary affair for me my past and present habits my situation in lifein short every thing that can be mentioned with regard to megoes against the supposition of my ever becoming the slave of a vice so debasing and this pledging myself to avoid it is something altogether needlessnay by implication it is degrading as to what you say of my influence i am inclined to the opinion that if every man will look to himself every man will be looked to this modern notion of tacking the whole responsibility of society on to every individual is one i am not at all inclined to adopt for first i know it is a troublesome doctrine and secondly i doubt if it be a true one for both which reasons i shall decline extending to it my patronage  well positively exclaimed the lady you gentlemen have the gift of continuance in an uncommon degree you have discussed this matter backward and forward till i am ready to perish i will take the matter in hand myself and sign a temperance pledge for edward and see that he gets into none of those naughty courses upon which you have been so pathetic  i dare say said melton glancing on her brilliant face with evident admiration that you will be the best temperance pledge he could have but every man cousin may not be so fortunate  but melton said edward seeing my steady habits are so well provided for you must carry your logic and eloquence to some poor fellow less favored and thus the conference ended  what a good disinterested fellow melton is said edward after he had left  yes good as the day is long said augusta but rather prosy after all this tiresome temperance business one never hears the end of it nowadays temperance paperstemperance tractstemperance hotelstemperance this that and the other thing even down to temperance pocket handkerchiefs for little boys really the world is getting intemperately temperate  ah well with the security you have offered augusta i shall dread no temptation  though there was nothing peculiar in these words yet there was a certain earnestness of tone that called the color into the face of augusta and set her to sewing with uncommon assiduity and thereupon edward proceeded with some remark about guardian angels together with many other things of the kind which though they contain no more that is new than a temperance lecture always seem to have a peculiar freshness to people in certain circumstances in fact before the hour was at an end edward and augusta had forgotten where they began and had wandered far into that land of anticipations and bright dreams which surrounds the young and loving before they eat of the tree of experience and gain the fatal knowledge of good and evil  but here stopping our sketching pencil let us throw in a little background and perspective that will enable our readers to perceive more readily the entire picture  edward howard was a young man whose brilliant talents and captivating manners had placed him first in the society in which he moved though without property or weight of family connections he had become a leader in the circles where these appendages are most considered and there were none of their immunities and privileges that were not freely at his disposal  augusta elmore was conspicuous in all that lies within the sphere of feminine attainment she was an orphan and accustomed from a very early age to the free enjoyment and control of an independent property this circumstance doubtless added to the magic of her personal graces in procuring for her that flattering deference which beauty and wealth secure  her mental powers were naturally superior although from want of motive they had received no development except such as would secure success in society native good sense with great strength of feeling and independence of mind had saved her from becoming heartless and frivolous she was better fitted to lead and to influence than to be influenced or led and hence though not swayed by any habitual sense of moral responsibility the tone of her character seemed altogether more elevated than the average of fashionable society  general expectation had united the destiny of two persons who seemed every way fitted for each other and for once general expectation did not err a few months after the interview mentioned were witnessed the festivities and congratulations of their brilliant and happy marriage  never did two young persons commence life under happier auspices what an exact match what a beautiful couple said all the gossips they seem made for each other said every one and so thought the happy lovers themselves  love which with persons of strong character is always an earnest and sobering principle had made them thoughtful and considerate and as they looked forward to future life and talked of the days before them their plans and ideas were as rational as any plans can be when formed entirely with reference to this life without any regard to another  for a while their absorbing attachment to each other tended to withdraw them from the temptations and allurements of company and many a long winter evening passed delightfully in the elegant quietude of home as they read and sang and talked of the past and dreamed of the future in each others society but contradictory as it may appear to the theory of the sentimentalist it is nevertheless a fact that two persons cannot always find sufficient excitement in talking to each other merely and this is especially true of those to whom high excitement has been a necessary of life after a while the young couple though loving each other none the less began to respond to the many calls which invited them again into society and the pride they felt in each other added zest to the pleasures of their return  as the gaze of admiration followed the graceful motions of the beautiful wife and the whispered tribute went round the circle whenever she entered edward felt a pride beyond all that flattery addressed to himself had ever excited and augusta when told of the convivial talents and powers of entertainment which distinguished her husband could not resist the temptation of urging him into society even oftener than his own wishes would have led him  alas neither of them knew the perils of constant excitement nor supposed that in thus alienating themselves from the pure and simple pleasures of home they were risking their whole capital of happiness it is in indulging the first desire for extra stimulus that the first and deepest danger to domestic peace lies let that stimulus be either bodily or mental its effects are alike to be dreaded  the man or the woman to whom habitual excitement of any kind has become essential has taken the first step towards ruin in the case of a woman it leads to discontent fretfulness and dissatisfaction with the quiet duties of domestic life in the case of a man it leads almost invariably to animal stimulus ruinous alike to the powers of body and mind  augusta fondly trusting to the virtue of her husband saw no danger in the constant round of engagements which were gradually drawing his attention from the graver cares of business from the pursuit of selfimprovement and from the love of herself already there was in her horizon the cloud as big as a mans handthe precursor of future darkness and tempest but too confident and buoyant she saw it not  it was not until the cares and duties of a mother began to confine her at home that she first felt with a startling sensation of fear that there was an alteration in her husband though even then the change was so shadowy and indefinite that it could not be defined by words  it was known by that quick prophetic sense which reveals to the heart of woman the first variation in the pulse of affection though it be so slight that no other touch can detect it  edward was still fond affectionate admiring and when he tendered her all the little attentions demanded by her situation or caressed and praised his beautiful son she felt satisfied and happy but when she saw that even without her the convivial circle had its attractions and that he could leave her to join it she sighed she scarce knew why surely she said i am not so selfish as to wish to rob him of pleasure because i cannot enjoy it with him but yet once he told me there was no pleasure where i was not alas is it true what i have so often heard that such feelings cannot always last  poor augusta she knew not how deep reason she had to fear she saw not the temptations that surrounded her husband in the circles where to all the stimulus of wit and intellect was often added the zest of wine used far too freely for safety  already had edward become familiar with a degree of physical excitement which touches the very verge of intoxication yet strong in selfconfidence and deluded by the customs of society he dreamed not of danger the traveller who has passed above the rapids of niagara may have noticed the spot where the first white sparkling ripple announces the downward tendency of the waters all here is brilliancy and beauty and as the waters ripple and dance in the sunbeam they seem only as if inspired by a spirit of new life and not as hastening to a dreadful fall so the first approach to intemperance that ruins both body and soul seems only like the buoyancy and exulting freshness of a new life and the unconscious voyager feels his bark undulating with a thrill of delight ignorant of the inexorable hurry the tremendous sweep with which the laughing waters urge him on beyond the reach of hope or recovery  it was at this period in the life of edward that one judicious and manly friend who would have had the courage to point out to him the danger that every one else perceived might have saved him but among the circle of his acquaintances there was none such let every man mind his own business was their universal maxim true heads were gravely shaken and mr a regretted to mr b that so promising a young man seemed about to ruin himself but one was no relation of edwards and the other felt a delicacy in speaking on such a subject and therefore according to a very ancient precedent they passed by on the other side yet it was at mr as sideboard always sparkling with the choicest wine that he had felt the first excitement of extra stimulus it was at mr bs house that the convivial club began to hold their meetings which after a time found a more appropriate place in a public hotel it is thus that the sober the regular and the discreet whose constitution saves them from liabilities to excess will accompany the ardent and excitable to the very verge of danger and then wonder at their want of selfcontrol  it was a cold winter evening and the wind whistled drearily around the closed shutters of the parlor in which augusta was sitting every thing around her bore the marks of elegance and comfort  splendid books and engravings lay about in every direction vases of rare and costly flowers exhaled perfume and magnificent mirrors multiplied every object all spoke of luxury and repose save the anxious and sad countenance of its mistress  it was late and she had watched anxiously for her husband for many long hours she drew out her gold and diamond repeater and looked at it it was long past midnight she sighed as she remembered the pleasant evenings they had passed together as her eye fell on the books they had read together and on her piano and harp now silent and thought of all he had said and looked in those days when each was all to the other  she was aroused from this melancholy revery by a loud knocking at the street door she hastened to open it but started back at the sight it disclosedher husband borne by four men  dead is he dead she screamed in agony  no maam said one of the men but he might as well be dead as in such a fix as this  the whole truth in all its degradation flashed on the mind of augusta without a question or comment she motioned to the sofa in the parlor and her husband was laid there she locked the street door and when the last retreating footstep had died away she turned to the sofa and stood gazing in fixed and almost stupefied silence on the face of her senseless husband  at once she realized the whole of her fearful lot she saw before her the blight of her own affections the ruin of her helpless children the disgrace and misery of her husband she looked around her in helpless despair for she well knew the power of the vice whose deadly seal was set upon her husband as one who is struggling and sinking in the waters casts a last dizzy glance at the green sunny banks and distant trees which seem sliding from his view so did all the scenes of her happy days pass in a moment before her and she groaned aloud in bitterness of spirit great god help me help me she prayed save himo save my husband  augusta was a woman of no common energy of spirit and when the first wild burst of anguish was over she resolved not to be wanting to her husband and children in a crisis so dreadful  when he awakes she mentally exclaimed i will warn and implore i will pour out my whole soul to save him my poor husband you have been misledbetrayed but you are too good too generous too noble to be sacrificed without a struggle  it was late the next morning before the stupor in which edward was plunged began to pass off he slowly opened his eyes started up wildly gazed hurriedly around the room till his eye met the fixed and sorrowful gaze of his wife the past instantly flashed upon him and a deep flush passed over his countenance there was a dead a solemn silence until augusta yielding to her agony threw herself into his arms and wept  then you do not hate me augusta said he sorrowfully  hate younever but o edward edward what has beguiled you  my wifeyou once promised to be my guardian in virtuesuch you are and will be o augusta you have looked on what you shall never see againneverneverso help me god said he looking up with solemn earnestness  and augusta as she gazed on the noble face the ardent expression of sincerity and remorse could not doubt that her husband was saved but edwards plan of reformation had one grand defect it was merely modification and retrenchment and not entire abandonment he could not feel it necessary to cut himself off entirely from the scenes and associations where temptation had met him he considered not that when the temperate flow of the blood and the even balance of the nerves have once been destroyed there is ever after a double and fourfold liability which often makes a man the sport of the first untoward chance  he still contrived to stimulate sufficiently to prevent the return of a calm and healthy state of the mind and body and to make constant selfcontrol and watchfulness necessary  it is a great mistake to call nothing intemperance but that degree of physical excitement which completely overthrows the mental powers there is a state of nervous excitability resulting from what is often called moderate stimulation which often long precedes this and is in regard to it like the premonitory warnings of the fatal choleraan unsuspected draught on the vital powers from which at any moment they may sink into irremediable collapse  it is in this state often that the spirit of gambling or of wild speculation is induced by the morbid cravings of an overstimulated system unsatisfied with the healthy and regular routine of business and the laws of gradual and solid prosperity the excited and unsteady imagination leads its subjects to daring risks with the alternative of unbounded gain on the one side or of utter ruin on the other and when as is too often the case that ruin comes unrestrained and desperate intemperance is the wretched resort to allay the ravings of disappointment and despair  such was the case with edward he had lost his interest in his regular business and he embarked the bulk of his property in a brilliant scheme then in vogue and when he found a crisis coming threatening ruin and beggary he had recourse to the fatal stimulus which alas he had never wholly abandoned  at this time he spent some months in a distant city separated from his wife and family while the insidious power of temptation daily increased as he kept up by artificial stimulus the flagging vigor of his mind and nervous system  it came at lastthe blow which shattered alike his brilliant dreams and his real prosperity the large fortune brought by his wife vanished in a moment so that scarcely a pittance remained in his hands from the distant city where he had been to superintend his schemes he thus wrote to his too confiding wife  augusta all is over expect no more from your husbandbelieve no more of his promisesfor he is lost to you and you to him augusta our property is gone your property which i have blindly risked is all swallowed up but is that the worst no no augusta i am lostlost body and soul and as irretrievably as the perishing riches i have squandered once i had energyhealthnerveresolution but all are gone yes yes i have yieldedi do yield daily to what is at once my tormentor and my temporary refuge from intolerable misery you remember the sad hour you first knew your husband was a drunkard your look on that morning of miseryshall i ever forget it yet blind and confiding as you were how soon did your illjudged confidence in me return vain hopes i was even then past recoveryeven then sealed over to blackness of darkness forever  alas my wife my peerless wife why am i your husband why the father of such children as you have given me is there nothing in your unequalled lovelinessnothing in the innocence of our helpless babes that is powerful enough to recall me no there is not  augusta you know not the dreadful gnawing the intolerable agony of this master passion i walk the floori think of my own dear home my high hopes my proud expectations my children my wife my own immortal soul i feel that i am sacrificing allfeel it till i am withered with agony but the hour comesthe burning hour and all is in vain i shall return to you no more augusta all the little wreck i have saved i send you have friends relativesabove all you have an energy of mind a capacity of resolute action beyond that of ordinary women and you shall never be boundthe living to the dead true you will suffer thus to burst the bonds that unite us but be resolute for you will suffer more to watch from day to day the slow workings of death and ruin in your husband would you stay with me to see every vestige of what you once loved passing awayto endure the caprice the moroseness the delirious anger of one no longer master of himself would you make your children victims and fellowsufferers with you no dark and dreadful is my path i will walk it alone no one shall go with me  in some peaceful retirement you may concentrate your strong feelings upon your children and bring them up to fill a place in your heart which a worthless husband has abandoned if i leave you now you will remember me as i have beenyou will love me and weep for me when dead but if you stay with me your love will be worn out i shall become the object of disgust and loathing therefore farewell my wifemy first best love farewell with you i part with hope            and with hope farewell fear     farewell remorse all good to me is lost     evil be thou my good  this is a wild strain but fit for me do not seek for me do not write nothing can save me  thus abruptly began and ended the letter that conveyed to augusta the death doom of her hopes there are moments of agony when the most worldly heart is pressed upward to god even as a weight will force upward the reluctant water augusta had been a generous a highminded an affectionate woman but she had lived entirely for this world her chief good had been her husband and her children these had been her pride her reliance her dependence strong in her own resources she had never felt the need of looking to a higher power for assistance and happiness but when this letter fell from her trembling hand her heart died within her at its wild and reckless bitterness  in her desperation she looked up to god what have i to live for now was the first feeling of her heart  but she repressed this inquiry of selfish agony and besought almighty assistance to nerve her weakness and here first began that practical acquaintance with the truths and hopes of religion which changed her whole character  the possibility of blind confiding idolatry of any earthly object was swept away by the fall of her husband and with the full energy of a decided and desolate spirit she threw herself on the protection of an almighty helper she followed her husband to the city whither he had gone found him and vainly attempted to save  there were the usual alternations of shortlived reformations exciting hopes only to be destroyed there was the gradual sinking of the body the decay of moral feeling and principlethe slow but sure approach of disgusting animalism which marks the progress of the drunkard  it was some years after that a small and partly ruinous tenement in the outskirts of a received a new family the group consisted of four children whose wan and wistful countenances and still unchildlike deportment testified an early acquaintance with want and sorrow there was the mother faded and careworn whose dark and melancholy eyes pale cheeks and compressed lips told of years of anxiety and endurance there was the father with haggard face unsteady step and that callous reckless air that betrayed long familiarity with degradation and crime who that had seen edward howard in the morning and freshness of his days could have recognized him in this miserable husband and father or who in this worn and woestricken woman would have known the beautiful brilliant and accomplished augusta yet such changes are not fancy as many a bitter and broken heart can testify  augusta had followed her guilty husband through many a change and many a weary wandering all hope of reformation had gradually faded away her own eyes had seen her ears had heard all those disgusting details too revolting to be portrayed for in drunkenness there is no royal roadno salvo for greatness of mind refinement of taste or tenderness of feeling all alike are merged in the corruption of a moral death  the traveller who met edward reeling by the roadside was sometimes startled to hear the fragments of classical lore or wild bursts of halfremembered poetry mixing strangely with the imbecile merriment of intoxication but when he stopped to gaze there was no further mark on his face or in his eye by which he could be distinguished from the loathsome and lowest drunkard  augusta had come with her husband to a city where they were wholly unknown that she might at least escape the degradation of their lot in the presence of those who had known them in better days the long and dreadful struggle that annihilated the hopes of this life had raised her feelings to rest upon the next and the habit of communion with god induced by sorrows which nothing else could console had given a tender dignity to her character such as nothing else could bestow  it is true she deeply loved her children but it was with a holy chastened love such as inspired the sentiment once breathed by him who was made perfect through sufferings  for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified  poverty deep poverty had followed their steps but yet she had not fainted talents which in her happier days had been nourished merely as luxuries were now stretched to the utmost to furnish a support while from the resources of her own reading she drew that which laid the foundation for early mental culture in her children  augusta had been here but a few weeks before her footsteps were traced by her only brother who had lately discovered her situation and urged her to forsake her unworthy husband and find refuge with him  augusta my sister i have found you he exclaimed as he suddenly entered one day while she was busied with the work of her family  henry my dear brother there was a momentary illumination of countenance accompanying these words which soon faded into a mournful quietness as she cast her eyes around on the scanty accommodations and mean apartment  i see how it is augusta step by step you are sinkingdragged down by a vain sense of duty to one no longer worthy i cannot bear it any longer i have come to take you away  augusta turned from him and looked abstractedly out of the window her features settled in thought their expression gradually deepened from their usual tone of mild resigned sorrow to one of keen anguish  henry said she turning towards him never was mortal woman so blessed in another as i once was in him how can i forget it who knew him in those days that did not admire and love him they tempted and insnared him and even i urged him into the path of danger he fell and there was none to help i urged reformation and he again and again promised resolved and began but again they tempted himeven his very best friends yes and that too when they knew his danger they led him on as far as it was safe for them to go and when the sweep of his more excitable temperament took him past the point of safety and decency they stood by and coolly wondered and lamented how often was he led on by such heartless friends to humiliating falls and then driven to desperation by the cold look averted faces and cruel sneers of those whose medium temperament and cooler blood saved them from the snares which they saw were enslaving him what if i had forsaken him then what account should i have rendered to god every time a friend has been alienated by his comrades it has seemed to seal him with another seal i am his wifeand mine will be the last henry when i leave him i know his eternal ruin is sealed i cannot do it now a little longera little longer the hour i see must come i know my duty to my children forbids me to keep them here take themthey are my last earthly comforts henrybut you must take them away it may beo godperhaps it must be that i shall soon follow but not till i have tried once more what is this present life to one who has suffered as i have nothing but eternity o henry eternityhow can i abandon him to everlasting despair under the breaking of my heart i have borne up i have borne up under all that can try a woman but this thought she stopped and seemed struggling with herself but at last borne down by a tide of agony she leaned her head on her hands the tears streamed through her fingers and her whole frame shook with convulsive sobs  her brother wept with her nor dared he again to touch the point so solemnly guarded the next day augusta parted from her children hoping something from feelings that possibly might be stirred by their absence in the bosom of their father  it was about a week after this that augusta one evening presented herself at the door of a rich mr l whose princely mansion was one of the ornaments of the city of a it was not till she reached the sumptuous drawing room that she recognized in mr l one whom she and her husband had frequently met in the gay circles of their early life altered as she was mr l did not recognize her but compassionately handed her a chair and requested her to wait the return of his lady who was out and then turning he resumed his conversation with another gentleman  now dallas said he you are altogether excessive and intemperate in this matter society is not to be reformed by every man directing his efforts towards his neighbor but by every man taking care of himself it is you and i my dear sir who must begin with ourselves and every other man must do the same and then society will be effectually reformed now this modern way by which every man considers it his duty to attend to the spiritual matters of his nextdoor neighbor is taking the business at the wrong end altogether it makes a vast deal of appearance but it does very little good  but suppose your neighbor feels no disposition to attend to his own improvementwhat then  why then it is his own concern and not mine what my maker requires is that i do my duty and not fret about my neighbors  but my friend that is the very question what is the duty your maker requires does it not include some regard to your neighbor some care and thought for his interest and improvement  well well i do that by setting a good example i do not mean by example what you dothat is that i am to stop drinking wine because it may lead him to drink brandy any more than that i must stop eating because he may eat too much and become a dyspepticbut that i am to use my wine and every thing else temperately and decently and thus set him a good example  the conversation was here interrupted by the return of mrs l it recalled in all its freshness to the mind of augusta the days when both she and her husband had thus spoken and thought  ah how did these sentiments appear to her nowlonely helpless forlornthe wife of a ruined husband the mother of more than orphan children how different from what they seemed when secure in ease in wealth in gratified affections she thoughtlessly echoed the common phraseology why must people concern themselves so much in their neighbors affairs let every man mind his own business  augusta received in silence from mrs l the fine sewing for which she came and left the room  ellen said mr l to his wife that poor woman must be in trouble of some kind or other you must go some time and see if any thing can be done for her  how singular said mrs l she reminds me all the time of augusta howard you remember her my dear  yes poor thing and her husband too that was a shocking affair of edward howards i hear that he became an intemperate worthless fellow who could have thought it  but you recollect my dear said mrs l i predicted it six months before it was talked of you remember at the wine party which you gave after marys wedding he was so excited that he was hardly decent i mentioned then that he was getting into dangerous ways but he was such an excitable creature that two or three glasses would put him quite beside himself and there is george eldon who takes off his ten or twelve glasses and no one suspects it  well it was a great pity replied mr l howard was worth a dozen george eldons  do you suppose said dallas who had listened thus far in silence that if he had moved in a circle where it was the universal custom to banish all stimulating drinks he would thus have fallen  i cannot say said mr l perhaps not  mr dallas was a gentleman of fortune and leisure and of an ardent and enthusiastic temperament whatever engaged him absorbed his whole soul and of late years his mind had become deeply engaged in schemes of philanthropy for the improvement of his fellowmen he had in his benevolent ministrations often passed the dwelling of edward and was deeply interested in the pale and patient wife and mother he made acquaintance with her through the aid of her children and in one way and another learned particulars of their history that awakened the deepest interest and concern none but a mind as sanguine as his would have dreamed of attempting to remedy such hopeless misery by the reformation of him who was its cause but such a plan had actually occurred to him the remarks of mr and mrs l recalled the idea and he soon found that his intended protégé was the very edward howard whose early history was thus disclosed he learned all the minutiæ from these his early associates without disclosing his aim and left them still more resolved upon his benevolent plan  he watched his opportunity when edward was free from the influence of stimulus and it was just after the loss of his children had called forth some remains of his better nature gradually and kindly he tried to touch the springs of his mind and awaken some of its buried sensibilities  it is in vain mr dallas to talk thus to me said edward when one day with the strong eloquence of excited feeling he painted the motives for attempting reformation you might as well attempt to reclaim the lost in hell do you think he continued in a wild determined mannerdo you think i do not know all you can tell me i have it all by heart sir no one can preach such discourses as i can on this subject i know allbelieve allas the devils believe and tremble  ay but said dallas to you there is hope you are not to ruin yourself forever  and who the devil are you to speak to me in this way said edward looking up from his sullen despair with a gleam of curiosity if not of hope  gods messenger to you edward howard said dallas fixing his keen eye upon him solemnly to you edward howard who have thrown away talents hope and healthwho have blasted the heart of your wife and beggared your suffering children to you i am the messenger of your godby me he offers health and hope and selfrespect and the regard of your fellowmen you may heal the broken heart of your wife and give back a

cheerful wife and smiling little ones think how you could repay your poor wife for all her tears what hinders you from gaining all this  just what hindered the rich man in hellbetween us there is a great gulf fixed it lies between me and all that is good my wife my children my hope of heaven are all on the other side  ay but this gulf can be passed howard what would you give to be a temperate man  what would i give said howard he thought for a moment and burst into tears  ah i see how it is said dallas you need a friend and god has sent you one  what can you do for me mr dallas said edward in a tone of wonder at the confidence of his assurances  i will tell you what i can do i can take you to my house and give you a room and watch over you until the strongest temptations are pasti can give you business again i can do all for you that needs to be done if you will give yourself to my care  o god of mercy exclaimed the unhappy man is there hope for me i cannot believe it possible but take me where you choosei will follow and obey  a few hours witnessed the transfer of the lost husband to one of the retired apartments in the elegant mansion of dallas where he found his anxious and grateful wife still stationed as his watchful guardian  medical treatment healthful exercise useful employment simple food and pure water were connected with a personal supervision by dallas which while gently and politely sustained at first amounted to actual imprisonment  for a time the reaction from the sudden suspension of habitual stimulus was dreadful and even with tears did the unhappy man entreat to be permitted to abandon the undertaking but the resolute steadiness of dallas and the tender entreaties of his wife prevailed it is true that he might be said to be saved so as by fire for a fever and a long and fierce delirium wasted him almost to the borders of the grave  but at length the struggle between life and death was over and though it left him stretched on the bed of sickness emaciated and weak yet he was restored to his right mind and was conscious of returning health let any one who has laid a friend in the grave and known what it is to have the heart fail with longing for them day by day imagine the dreamy and unreal joy of augusta when she began again to see in edward the husband so long lost to her it was as if the grave had given back the dead  augusta said he faintly as after a long and quiet sleep he awoke free from delirium she bent over him augusta i am redeemedi am savedi feel in myself that i am made whole  the high heart of augusta melted at these words she trembled and wept her husband wept also and after a pause he continued  it is more than being restored to this lifei feel that it is the beginning of eternal life it is the savior who sought me out and i know that he is able to keep me from falling  but we will draw a veil over a scene which words have little power to paint  pray dallas said mr l one day who is that finelooking young man whom i met in your office this morning i thought his face seemed familiar  it is a mr howarda young lawyer whom i have lately taken into business with me  strange impossible said mr l surely this cannot be the howard that i once knew  i believe he is said mr dallas  why i thought he was gonedead and done over long ago with intemperance  he was so few have ever sunk lower but he now promises even to outdo all that was hoped of him  strange why dallas what did bring about this change  i feel a delicacy in mentioning how it came about to you mr l as there undoubtedly was a great deal of interference with other mens matters in the business in short the young man fell in the way of one of those meddlesome fellows who go prowling about distributing tracts forming temperance societies and all that sort of stuff  come come dallas said mr l smiling i must hear the story for all that  first call with me at this house said dallas stopping before the door of a neat little mansion they were soon in the parlor the first sight that met their eyes was edward howard who with a cheek glowing with exercise was tossing aloft a blooming boy while augusta was watching his motions her face radiant with smiles  mr and mrs howard this is mr l an old acquaintance i believe  there was a moment of mutual embarrassment and surprise soon dispelled however by the frank cordiality of edward mr l sat down but could scarce withdraw his eyes from the countenance of augusta in whose eloquent face he recognized a beauty of a higher cast than even in her earlier days  he glanced about the apartment it was simply but tastefully furnished and wore an air of retired domestic comfort there were books engravings and musical instruments above all there were four happy healthylooking children pursuing studies or sports at the farther end of the room  after a short call they regained the street  dallas you are a happy man said mr l that family will be a mine of jewels to you  he was right every soul saved from pollution and ruin is a jewel to him that reclaims it whose lustre only eternity can disclose and therefore it is written they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever     cousin william   in a stately red house in one of the villages of new england lived the heroine of our story she had every advantage of rank and wealth for her father was a deacon of the church and owned sheep and oxen and exceeding much substance there was an appearance of respectability and opulence about all the demesnes the house stood almost concealed amid a forest of apple trees in spring blushing with blossoms and in autumn golden with fruit and near by might be seen the garden surrounded by a red picket fence enclosing all sorts of magnificence there in autumn might be seen abundant squash vines which seemed puzzled for room where to bestow themselves and bright golden squashes and fullorbed yellow pumpkins looking as satisfied as the evening sun when he has just had his face washed in a shower and is sinking soberly to bed there were superannuated seed cucumbers enjoying the pleasures of a contemplative old age and indian corn nicely done up in green silk with a specimen tassel hanging at the end of each ear the beams of the summer sun darted through rows of crimson currants abounding on bushes by the fence while a sulky black currant bush sat scowling in one corner a sort of garden curiosity  but time would fail us were we to enumerate all the wealth of deacon israel taylor he himself belonged to that necessary class of beings who though remarkable for nothing at all are very useful in filling up the links of society far otherwise was his sisterinlaw mrs abigail evetts who on the demise of the deacons wife had assumed the reins of government in the household  this lady was of the same opinion that has animated many illustrious philosophers namely that the affairs of this world need a great deal of seeing to in order to have them go on prosperously and although she did not like them engage in the supervision of the universe she made amends by unremitting diligence in the department under her care in her mind there was an evident necessity that every one should be up and doing monday because it was washing day tuesday because it was ironing day wednesday because it was baking day thursday because tomorrow was friday and so on to the end of the week then she had the care of reminding all in the house of every thing each was to do from weeks end to weeks end and she was so faithful in this respect that scarcely an original act of volition took place in the family the poor deacon was reminded when he went out and when he came in when he sat down and when he rose up so that an act of omission could only have been committed through sheer malice prepense  but the supervision of a whole family of children afforded to a lady of her active turn of mind more abundant matter of exertion to see that their faces were washed their clothes mended and their catechism learned to see that they did not pick the flowers nor throw stones at the chickens nor sophisticate the great house dog was an accumulation of care that devolved almost entirely on mrs abigail so that by her own account she lived and throve by a perpetual miracle  the eldest of her charge at the time this story begins was a girl just arrived at young ladyhood and her name was mary now we know that people very seldom have stories written about them who have not sylphlike forms and glorious eyes or at least a certain inexpressible charm diffused over their whole person but stories have of late so much abounded that they actually seem to have used up all the eyes hair teeth lips and forms necessary for a heroine so that no one can now pretend to find an original collection wherewith to set one forth these things considered i regard it as fortunate that my heroine was not a beauty she looked neither like a sylph nor an oread nor a fairy she had neither lair distingué nor lair magnifique but bore a great resemblance to a real mortal girl such as you might pass a dozen of without any particular commentone of those appearances which though common as water may like that be colored any way by the associations you connect with it accordingly a faultless taste in dress a perfect ease and gayety of manner a constant flow of kindly feeling seemed in her case to produce all the effect of beauty her manners had just dignity enough to repel impertinence without destroying the careless freedom and sprightliness in which she commonly indulged no person had a merrier run of stories songs and village traditions and all those odds and ends of character which form the materials for animated conversation she had read too every thing she could find rollins history and scotts family bible that stood in the glass bookcase in the best room and an odd volume of shakspeare and now and then one of scotts novels borrowed from a somewhat literary family in the neighborhood she also kept an album to write her thoughts in and was in a constant habit of cutting out all the pretty poetry from the corners of the newspapers besides drying forgetmenots and rosebuds in memory of different particular friends with a number of other little sentimental practices to which young ladies of sixteen and thereabout are addicted she was also endowed with great constructiveness so that in these days of ladies fairs there was nothing from bellowsneedlebooks down to webfooted pincushions to which she could not turn her hand her sewing certainly was extraordinary we think too little is made of this in the accomplishments of heroines her stitching was like rows of pearls and her crossstitching was fairylike and for sewing over and over as the village schoolmaam hath it she had not her equal and what shall we say of her pies and puddings they would have converted the most reprobate old bachelor in the world and then her sweeping and dusting many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all  and now what do you suppose is coming next why a young gentleman of course for about this time comes to settle in the village and take charge of the academy a certain william barton now if you wish to know more particularly who he was we only wish we could refer you to mrs abigail who was most accomplished in genealogies and old wifes fables and she would have told you that her granther ike evetts married a wife who was second cousin to peter scranton who was great uncle to polly mosely whose daughter mary married william bartons father just about the time old squire peters house was burned down and then would follow an account of the domestic history of all branches of the family since they came over from england be that as it may it is certain that mrs abigail denominated him cousin and that he came to the deacons to board and he had not been there more than a week and made sundry observations on miss mary before he determined to call her cousin too which he accomplished in the most natural way in the world  mary was at first somewhat afraid of him because she had heard that he had studied through all that was to be studied in greek and latin and german too and she saw a library of books in his room that made her sigh every time she looked at them to think how much there was to be learned of which she was ignorant but all this wore away and presently they were the best friends in the world he gave her books to read and he gave her lessons in french nothing puzzled by that troublesome verb which must be first conjugated whether in french latin or english then he gave her a deal of good advice about the cultivation of her mind and the formation of her character all of which was very improving and tended greatly to consolidate their friendship but unfortunately for mary william made quite as favorable an impression on the female community generally as he did on her having distinguished himself on certain public occasions such as delivering lectures on botany and also at the earnest request of the fourth of july committee pronounced an oration which covered him with glory he had been known also to write poetry and had a retired and romantic air greatly bewitching to those who read bulwers novels in short it was morally certain according to all rules of evidence that if he had chosen to pay any lady of the village a dozen visits a week she would have considered it as her duty to entertain him  william did visit for like many studious people he found a need for the excitement of society but whether it was party or singing school he walked home with mary of course in as steady and domestic a manner as any man who has been married a twelvemonth his air in conversing with her was inevitably more confidential than with any other one and this was cause for envy in many a gentle breast and an interesting diversity of reports with regard to her manner of treating the young gentleman went forth into the village  i wonder mary taylor will laugh and joke so much with william barton in company said one her manners are altogether too free said another it is evident she has designs upon him remarked a third and she cannot even conceal it pursued a fourth  some sayings of this kind at length reached the ears of mrs abigail who had the best heart in the world and was so indignant that it might have done your heart good to see her still she thought it showed that the girl needed advising and she should talk to mary about the matter  but she first concluded to advise with william on the subject and therefore after dinner the same day while he was looking over a treatise on trigonometry or conic sections she commenced upon him  our mary is growing up a fine girl  william was intent on solving a problem and only understanding that something had been said mechanically answered yes  a little wild or so said mrs abigail  i know it said william fixing his eyes earnestly on e f b c  perhaps you think her a little too talkative and free with you sometimes you know girls do not always think what they do  certainly said william going on with his problem  i think you had better speak to her about it said mrs abigail  i think so too said william musing over his completed work till at length he arose put it in his pocket and went to school  o this unlucky concentrativeness how many shocking things a man may indorse by the simple habit of saying yes and no when he is not hearing what is said to him  the next morning when william was gone to the academy and mary was washing the breakfast things aunt abigail introduced the subject with great tact and delicacy by remarking  mary i guess you had better be rather less free with william than you have been  free said mary starting and nearly dropping the cup from her hand why aunt what do you mean  why mary you must not always be around so free in talking with him at home and in company and every where it wont do the color started into marys cheek and mounted even to her forehead as she answered with a dignified air  i have not been too free i know what is right and proper i have not been doing any thing that was improper  now when one is going to give advice it is very troublesome to have its necessity thus called in question and mrs abigail who was fond of her own opinion felt called upon to defend it  why yes you have mary every body in the village notices it  i dont care what every body in the village says i shall always do what i think proper retorted the young lady i know cousin william does not think so  well i think he does from some things i have heard him say  o aunt what have you heard him say said mary nearly upsetting a chair in the eagerness with which she turned to her aunt  mercy on us you need not knock the house down mary i dont remember exactly about it only that his way of speaking made me think so  o aunt do tell me what it was and all about it said mary following her aunt who went around dusting the furniture  mrs abigail like most obstinate people who feel that they have gone too far and yet are ashamed to go back took refuge in an obstinate generalization and only asserted that she had heard him say things as if he did not quite like her ways  this is the most consoling of all methods in which to leave a matter of this kind for a person of active imagination of course in five minutes mary had settled in her mind a list of remarks that would have been suited to any of her village companions as coming from her cousin all the improbability of the thing vanished in the absorbing consideration of its possibility and after a moments reflection she pressed her lips together in a very firm way and remarked that mr barton would have no occasion to say such things again  it was very evident from her heightened color and dignified air that her state of mind was very heroical as for poor aunt abigail she felt sorry she had vexed her and addressed herself most earnestly to her consolation remarking mary i dont suppose william meant any thing he knows you dont mean any thing wrong  dont mean any thing wrong said mary indignantly  why child he thinks you dont know much about folks and things and if you have been a little  but i have not been it was he that talked with me first it was he that did every thing first he called me cousinand he is my cousin  no child you are mistaken for you remember his grandfather was  i dont care who his grandfather was he has no right to think of me as he does  now mary dont go to quarrelling with him he cant help his thoughts you know  i dont care what he thinks said mary flinging out of the room with tears in her eyes  now when a young lady is in such a state of affliction the first thing to be done is to sit down and cry for two hours or more which mary accomplished in the most thorough manner in the mean while making many reflections on the instability of human friendships and resolving never to trust any one again as long as she lived and thinking that this was a cold and hollowhearted world together with many other things she had read in books but never realized so forcibly as at present but what was to be done of course she did not wish to speak a word to william again and wished he did not board there and finally she put on her bonnet and determined to go over to her other aunts in the neighborhood and spend the day so that she might not see him at dinner  but it so happened that mr william on coming home at noon found himself unaccountably lonesome during school recess for dinner and hearing where mary was determined to call after school at night at her aunts and attend her home  accordingly in the afternoon as mary was sitting in the parlor with two or three cousins mr william entered  mary was so anxious to look just as if nothing was the matter that she turned away her head and began to look out of the window just as the young gentleman came up to speak to her so after he had twice inquired after her health she drew up very coolly and said  did you speak to me sir  william looked a little surprised at first but seating himself by her to be sure said he and i came to know why you ran away without leaving any message for me  it did not occur to me said mary in the dry tone which in a lady means i will excuse you from any further conversation if you please william felt as if there was something different from common in all this but thought that perhaps he was mistaken and so continued  what a pity now that you should be so careless of me when i was so thoughtful of you i have come all this distance to see how you do  i am sorry to have given you the trouble said mary  cousin are you unwell today said william  no sir said mary going on with her sewing  there was something so marked and decisive in all this that william could scarcely believe his ears he turned away and commenced a conversation with a young lady and mary to show that she could talk if she chose commenced relating a story to her cousins and presently they were all in a loud laugh  mary has been full of her knickknacks today said her old uncle joining them  william looked at her she never seemed brighter or in better spirits and he began to think that even cousin mary might puzzle a man sometimes  he turned away and began a conversation with old mr zachary coan on the raising of buckwheata subject which evidently required profound thought for he never looked more grave not to say melancholy  mary glanced that way and was struck with the sad and almost severe expression with which he was listening to the details of mr zachary and was convinced that he was no more thinking of buckwheat than she was  i never thought of hurting his feelings so much said she relenting after all he has been very kind to me but he might have told me about it and not somebody else and hereupon she cast another glance towards him  william was not talking but sat with his eyes fixed on the snuffertray with an intense gravity of gaze that quite troubled her and she could not help again blaming herself  to be sure aunt was right he could not help his thoughts i will try to forget it thought she  now you must not think mary was sitting still and gazing during this soliloquy no she was talking and laughing apparently the most unconcerned spectator in the room so passed the evening till the little company broke up  i am ready to attend you home said william in a tone of cold and almost haughty deference  i am obliged to you said the young lady in a similar tone but i shall stay all night then suddenly changing her tone she said no i cannot keep it up any longer i will go home with you cousin william  keep up what said william with surprise  mary was gone for her bonnet she came out took his arm and walked on a little way  you have advised me always to be frank cousin said mary and i must and will be so i shall tell you all though i dare say it is not according to rule  all what said william  cousin said she not at all regarding what he said i was very much vexed this afternoon  so i perceived mary  well it is vexatious she continued though after all we cannot expect people to think us perfect but i did not think it quite fair in you not to tell me  tell you what mary  here they came to a place where the road turned through a small patch of woods it was green and shady and enlivened by a lively chatterbox of a brook there was a mossy trunk of a tree that had fallen beside it and made a pretty seat the moonlight lay in little patches upon it as it streamed down through the branches of the trees it was a fairylooking place and mary stopped and sat down as if to collect her thoughts after picking up a stick and playing a moment in the water she began  after all cousin it was very natural in you to say so if you thought so though i should not have supposed you would think so  well i should be glad if i could know what it is said william in a tone of patient resignation  o i forgot that i had not told you said she pushing back her hat and speaking like one determined to go through with the thing why cousin i have been told that you spoke of my manners towards yourself as being freermoreobtrusive than they should be and now said she her eyes flashing you see it was not a very easy thing to tell you but i began with being frank and i will be so for the sake of satisfying myself  to this william simply replied who told you this mary  my aunt  did she say i said it to her  yes and i do not so much object to your saying it as to your thinking it for you know i did not force myself on your notice it was you who sought my acquaintance and won my confidence and that you above all others should think of me in this way  i never did think so mary said william quietly  nor ever said so  never i should think you might have known it mary  but said mary  but said william firmly aunt abigail is certainly mistaken  well i am glad of it said mary looking relieved and gazing in the brook then looking up with warmth and cousin you never must think so i am ardent and i express myself freely but i never meant i am sure i never should mean any thing more than a sister might say  and are you sure you never could if all my happiness depended on it mary  she turned and looked up in his face and saw a look that brought conviction she rose to go on and her hand was taken and drawn into the arm of her cousin and that was the end of the first and the last difficulty that ever arose between them     the ministration of our departed friends  a new years revery       it is a beautiful belief         that ever round our head     are hovering on viewless wings         the spirits of the dead  while every year is taking one and another from the ranks of life and usefulness or the charmed circle of friendship and love it is soothing to remember that the spiritual world is gaining in riches through the poverty of this  in early life with our friends all around ushearing their voices cheered by their smilesdeath and the spiritual world are to us remote misty and halffabulous but as we advance in our journey and voice after voice is hushed and form after form vanishes from our side and our shadow falls almost solitary on the hillside of life the soul by a necessity of its being tends to the unseen and spiritual and pursues in another life those it seeks in vain in this  for with every friend that dies dies also some especial form of social enjoyment whose being depended on the peculiar character of that friend till late in the afternoon of life the pilgrim seems to himself to have passed over to the unseen world in successive portions half his own spirit and poor indeed is he who has not familiarized himself with that unknown whither despite himself his soul is earnestly tending  one of the deepest and most imperative cravings of the human heart as it follows its beloved ones beyond the veil is for some assurance that they still love and care for us could we firmly believe this bereavement would lose half its bitterness as a german writer beautifully expresses it our friend is not wholly gone from us we see across the river of death in the blue distance the smoke of his cottage hence the heart always creating what it desires has ever made the guardianship and ministration of departed spirits a favorite theme of poetic fiction  but is it then fiction does revelation which gives so many hopes which nature had not give none here is there no sober certainty to correspond to the inborn and passionate craving of the soul do departed spirits in verity retain any knowledge of what transpires in this world and take any part in its scenes all that revelation says of a spiritual state is more intimation than assertion it has no distinct treatise and teaches nothing apparently of set purpose but gives vague glorious images while now and then some accidental ray of intelligence looks out      like eyes of cherubs shining       from out the veil that hid the ark  but out of all the different hints and assertions of the bible we think a better inferential argument might be constructed to prove the ministration of departed spirits than for many a doctrine which has passed in its day for the height of orthodoxy  first then the bible distinctly says that there is a class of invisible spirits who minister to the children of men are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation it is said of little children that their angels do always behold the face of our father which is in heaven this last passage from the words of our savior taken in connection with the wellknown tradition of his time fully recognizes the idea of individual guardian spirits for gods government over mind is it seems throughout one of intermediate agencies and these not chosen at random but with the nicest reference to their adaptation to the purpose intended not even the allseeing allknowing one was deemed perfectly adapted to become a human savior without a human experience knowledge intuitive gained from above of human wants and woes was not enoughto it must be added the homeborn certainty of consciousness and memory the head of all mediation must become human is it likely then that in selecting subordinate agencies this so necessary a requisite of a human life and experience is overlooked while around the throne of god stand spirits now sainted and glorified yet thrillingly conscious of a past experience of sin and sorrow and trembling in sympathy with temptations and struggles like their own is it likely that he would pass by these souls thus burning for the work and commit it to those bright abstract beings whose knowledge and experience are comparatively so distant and so cold  it is strongly in confirmation of this idea that in the transfiguration scenewhich seems to have been intended purposely to give the disciples a glimpse of the glorified state of their masterwe find him attended by two spirits of earth moses and elias which appeared with him in glory and spake of his death which he should accomplish at jerusalem it appears that these so long departed ones were still mingling in deep sympathy with the tide of human affairsnot only aware of the present but also informed as to the future in coincidence with this idea are all those passages which speak of the redeemed of earth as being closely and indissolubly identified with christ members of his body of his flesh and his bones it is not to be supposed that those united to jesus above all others by so vivid a sympathy and community of interests are left out as instruments in that great work of human regeneration which so engrosses him and when we hear christians spoken of as kings and priests unto god as those who shall judge angels we see it more than intimated that they are to be the partners and actors in that great work of spiritual regeneration of which jesus is the head  what then may we look among the band of ministering spirits for our own departed ones whom would god be more likely to send us have we in heaven a friend who knew us to the hearts core a friend to whom we have unfolded our soul in its most secret recesses to whom we have confessed our weaknesses and deplored our griefs if we are to have a ministering spirit who better adapted have we not memories which correspond to such a belief when our soul has been cast down has never an invisible voice whispered there is lifting up have not gales and breezes of sweet and healing thought been wafted over us as if an angel had shaken from his wings the odors of paradise many a one we are confident can remember such thingsand whence come they why do the children of the pious mother whose grave has grown green and smooth with years seem often to walk through perils and dangers fearful and imminent as the crossing mohammeds fiery gulf on the edge of a drawn sword yet walk unhurt ah could we see that attendant form that face where the angel conceals not the mother our question would be answered  it may be possible that a friend is sometimes taken because the divine one sees that his ministry can act more powerfully from the unseen world than amid the infirmities of mortal intercourse here the soul distracted and hemmed in by human events and by bodily infirmities often scarce knows itself and makes no impression on others correspondent to its desires the mother would fain electrify the heart of her child she yearns and burns in vain to make her soul effective on its soul and to inspire it with a spiritual and holy life but all her own weaknesses faults and mortal cares cramp and confine her till death breaks all fetters and then first truly alive risen purified and at rest she may do calmly sweetly and certainly what amid the tempests and tossings of life she labored for painfully and fitfully so also to generous souls who burn for the good of man who deplore the shortness of life and the little that is permitted to any individual agency on earth does this belief open a heavenly field think not father or brother long laboring for man till thy sun stands on the western mountainsthink not that thy day in this world is over perhaps like jesus thou hast lived a human life and gained a human experience to become under and like him a savior of thousands thou hast been through the preparation but thy real work of good thy full power of doing is yet to begin  but again there are some spirits and those of earths choicest to whom so far as enjoyment to themselves or others is concerned this life seems to have been a total failure a hard hand from the first and all the way through life seems to have been laid upon them they seem to live only to be chastened and crushed and we lay them in the grave at last in mournful silence to such what a vision is opened by this belief this hard discipline has been the school and taskwork by which their soul has been fitted for their invisible labors in a future life and when they pass the gates of the grave their course of benevolent acting first begins and they find themselves delighted possessors of what through many years they have sighed forthe power of doing good the year just past like all other years has taken from a thousand circles the sainted the just and the beloved there are spots in a thousand graveyards which have become this year dearer than all the living world but in the loneliness of sorrow how cheering to think that our lost ones are not wholly gone from us they still may move about in our homes shedding around an atmosphere of purity and peace promptings of good and reproofs of evil we are compassed about by a cloud of witnesses whose hearts throb in sympathy with every effort and struggle and who thrill with joy at every success how should this thought check and rebuke every worldly feeling and unworthy purpose and enshrine us in the midst of a forgetful and unspiritual world with an atmosphere of heavenly peace they have overcomehave risenare crowned glorified but still they remain to us our assistants our comforters and in every hour of darkness their voice speaks to us so we grieved so we struggled so we fainted so we doubted but we have overcome we have obtained we have seen we have foundand in our victory behold the certainty of thy own     mrs a and mrs b  or what she thinks about it   mrs a and mrs b were nextdoor neighbors and intimate friendsthat is to say they took tea with each other very often and in confidential strains discoursed of stockings and pocket handkerchiefs of puddings and carpets of cookery and domestic economy through all its branches  i think on the whole said mrs a with an air of profound reflection that gingerbread is the cheapest and healthiest cake one can make i make a good deal of it and let my children have as much as they want of it  i used to do so said mrs b but i havent had any made these two months  ah why not said mrs a  why it is some trouble and then though it is cheap it is cheaper not to have any and on the whole the children are quite as well contented without it and so we are fallen into the way of not having any  but one must keep some kind of cake in the house said mrs a  so i have always heard and thought and practised said mrs b but really of late i have questioned the need of it  the conversation gradually digressed from this point into various intricate speculations on domestic economy and at last each lady went home to put her children to bed  a fortnight after the two ladies were again in conclave at mrs bs tea table which was graced by some unusually nice gingerbread  i thought you had given up making gingerbread said mrs a you told me so a fortnight ago at my house  so i had said mrs a but since that conversation i have been making it again  why so  o i thought that since you thought it economical enough certainly i might and that if you thought it necessary to keep some sort of cake in the closet perhaps it was best i should  mrs a laughed  well now said she i have not made any gingerbread or cake of any kind since that same conversation  indeed  no i said to myself if mrs b thinks it will do to go without cake in the house i suppose i might as she says it is some additional expense and trouble and so i gave it up  both ladies laughed and you laugh too my dear lady reader but have you never done the same thing have you never altered your dress or your arrangements or your housekeeping because somebody else was of a different way of thinking or managingand may not that very somebody at the same time have been moved to make some change through a similar observation on you  a large party is to be given by the young lads of n to the young lassies of the same place they are to drive out together to a picnic in the woods and to come home by moonlight the weather is damp and uncertain the ground chill and young people as in all ages before the flood and since not famous for the grace of prudence for all which reasons almost every mamma hesitates about her daughters goingthinks it a very great pity the thing has been started  i really dont like this thing says mrs g its not a kind of thing that i approve of and if mrs x was not going to let her daughters go i should set myself against it how mrs x who is so very nice in her notions can sanction such a thing i cannot see i am really surprised at mrs x  all this time poor unconscious mrs x is in a similar tribulation  this is a very disagreeable affair to me she says i really have almost a mind to say that my girls shall not go but mrs gs daughters are going and mrs cs and mrs ws and of course it would be idle for me to oppose it i should not like to cast any reflections on a course sanctioned by ladies of such prudence and discretion  in the same manner mrs a b and c and the good matrons through the alphabet generally with doleful lamentations each one consents to the thing that she allows not and the affair proceeds swimmingly to the great satisfaction of the juveniles  now and then it is true some individual sort of body who might be designated by the angular and decided letters k or l says to her son or daughter no i dont approve of the thing and is deaf to the ofturged mrs a b and c do so  i have nothing to do with mrs a b and cs arrangements says this impracticable mrs k or l i only know what is best for my children and they shall not go  again mrs g is going to give a party and now shall she give wine or not mrs g has heard an abundance of temperance speeches and appeals heard the duties of ladies in the matter of sanctioning temperance movements aptly set forth but none of these things move her half so much as another consideration she has heard that mrs d introduced wine into her last soirée mrs ds husband has been a leading orator of the temperance society and mrs d is no less a leading member in the circles of fashion now mrs gs soul is in great perplexity if she only could be sure that the report about mrs d is authentic why then of course the thing is settled regret it as much as she may she cannot get through her party without the wine and so at last come the party and the wine mrs d who was incorrectly stated to have had the article at her last soirée has it at her next one and quotes discreet mrs g as her precedent mrs p is greatly scandalized at this because mrs g is a member of the church and mr d a leading temperance orator but since they will do it it is not for her to be nice and so she follows the fashion  mrs n comes home from church on sunday rolling up her eyes with various appearances of horror and surprise  well i am going to give up trying to restrain my girls from dressing extravagantly its of no use tryingno use in the world  why mother whats the matter exclaimed the girls aforesaid delighted to hear such encouraging declarations  why didnt you see mrs ks daughters sitting in the pew before us with feathers in their bonnets if mrs k is coming out in this way i shall give up i shant try any longer i am going to get just what i want and dress as much as ive a mind to girls you may get those visites that you were looking at at mr bs store last week  the next sunday mrs ks girls in turn begin  there mamma you are always lecturing us about economy and all that and wanting us to wear our old mantillas another winter and there are mrs ns girls shining out in new visites  mamma looks sensible and judicious and tells the girls they ought not to see what people are wearing in church on sundays but it becomes evident before the week is through that she has not forgotten the observation she is anxiously pricing visites and looking thoughtful as one on the eve of an important determination and the next sunday the girls appear in full splendor with new visites to the increasing horror of mrs n  so goes the shuttlecock back and forward kept up on both sides by most judicious hands  in like manner at a modern party a circle of matrons sit in edifying conclave and lament the degeneracy of the age  these parties that begin at nine oclock and end at two or three in the morning are shameful things says fat mrs q complacently fanning herself n b mrs q is plotting to have one the very next week and has come just to see the fashions  o dreadful dreadful exclaim in one chorus meek mrs m and tall mrs f and stiff mrs j  they are very unhealthy says mrs f  they disturb all family order says mrs j  they make one so sleepy the next day says mrs m  they are very laborious to get up and entirely useless says mrs q at the same time counting across the room the people that she shall invite next week  mrs m and mrs f diverge into a most edifying strain of moral reflections on the improvement of time the necessity of sobriety and moderation the evils of conformity to the world till one is tempted to feel that the tract society ought to have their remarks for general circulation were one not damped by the certain knowledge that before the winter is out each of these ladies will give exactly such another party  and now are all these respectable ladies hypocritical or insincere by no meansthey believe every word they say but a sort of necessity is laid upon thema spell and before the breath of the multitude their individual resolution melts away as the frosty tracery melts from the window panes of a crowded room  a great many do this habitually resignedly as a matter of course ask them what they think to be right and proper and they will tell you sensibly coherently and quite to the point in one direction ask them what they are going to do ah that is quite another matter  they are going to do what is generally donewhat mrs a b and c do they have long since made over their conscience to the keeping of the publicthat is to say of good societyand are thus rid of a troublesome burden of responsibility  again there are others who mean in general to have an opinion and will of their own but imperceptibly as one and another take a course opposed to their own sense of right and propriety their resolution quietly melts and melts till every individual outline of it is gone and they do as others do  yet is this influence of one human being over anotherin some sense godappointeda necessary result of the human constitution there is scarcely a human being that is not varied and swerved by it as the trembling needle is swerved by the approaching magnet oppose conflict with it as one may at a distance yet when it breathes on us through the breath and shines on us through the eye of an associate it possesses an invisible magnetic power he who is not at all conscious of such impressibility can scarce be amiable or human nevertheless one of the most important habits for the acquisition of a generous and noble character is to learn to act individually unswerved by the feelings and opinions of others it may help us to do this to reflect that the very person whose opinion we fear may be in equal dread of ours and that the person to whom we are looking for a precedent may at that very time be looking to us  in short mrs a if you think that you could spend your money more like a christian than in laying it out on a fashionable party go forward and do it and twenty others whose supposed opinion you fear will be glad of your example for a precedent and mrs b if you do think it would be better for your children to observe early hours and form simple habits than to dress and dance and give and go to juvenile balls carry out your opinion in practice and many an anxious mother who is of the same opinion will quote your example as her shield and defence  and for you young ladies let us pray you to reflectindividuality of character maintained with womanly sweetness is an irresistible grace and adornment have some principles of taste for yourself and do not adopt every fashion of dress that is in vogue whether it suits you or notwhether it is becoming or notbut without a startling variation from general form let your dress show something of your own taste and opinions have some principles of right and wrong for yourself and do not do every thing that every one else does because every one else does it  nothing is more tedious than a circle of young ladies who have got by rote a certain set of phrases and opinionsall admiring in the same terms the same things and detesting in like terms certain otherswith anxious solicitude each dressing thinking and acting one as much like another as is possible a genuine original opinion even though it were so heretical as to assert that jenny lind is a little lower than the angels or that shakspeare is rather dull reading would be better than such a universal dead sea of acquiescence  these remarks have borne reference to the female sex principally because they are the dependent the acquiescent sexfrom nature and habit and position most exposed to be swayed by opinionand yet too in a certain very wide department they are the lawgivers and custommakers of society if amid the multiplied schools whose advertisements now throng our papers purporting to teach girls every thing both ancient and modern high and low from playing on the harp and working pincushions up to civil engineering surveying and navigation there were any which could teach them to be womento have thoughts opinions and modes of action of their ownsuch a school would be worth having if one half of the good purposes which are in the hearts of the ladies of our nation were only acted out without fear of any bodys opinion we should certainly be a step nearer the millennium     christmas or the good fairy   o dear christmas is coming in a fortnight and i have got to think up presents for every body said young ellen stuart as she leaned languidly back in her chair dear me its so tedious every body has got every thing that can be thought of  o no said her confidential adviser miss lester in a soothing tone you have means of buying every thing you can fancy and when every shop and store is glittering with all manner of splendors you cannot surely be at a loss  well now just listen to begin with theres mamma what can i get for her i have thought of ever so many things she has three card cases four gold thimbles two or three gold chains two writing desks of different patterns and then as to rings brooches boxes and all other things i should think she might be sick of the sight of them i am sure i am said she languidly gazing on her white and jewelled fingers  this view of the case seemed rather puzzling to the adviser and there was silence for a few moments when ellen yawning resumed  and then theres cousins jane and mary i suppose they will be coming down on me with a whole load of presents and mrs b will send me somethingshe did last year and then theres cousins william and tomi must get them something and i would like to do it well enough if i only knew what to get  well said eleanors aunt who had been sitting quietly rattling her knitting needles during this speech its a pity that you had not such a subject to practise on as i was when i was a girl presents did not fly about in those days as they do now i remember when i was ten years old my father gave me a most marvellously ugly sugar dog for a christmas gift and i was perfectly delighted with it the very idea of a present was so new to us  dear aunt how delighted i should be if i had any such fresh unsophisticated body to get presents for but to get and get for people that have more than they know what to do with now to add pictures books and gilding when the centre tables are loaded with them now and rings and jewels when they are a perfect drug i wish myself that i were not sick and sated and tired with having every thing in the world given me  well eleanor said her aunt if you really do want unsophisticated subjects to practise on i can put you in the way of it i can show you more than one family to whom you might seem to be a very good fairy and where such gifts as you could give with all ease would seem like a magic dream  why that would really be worth while aunt  look over in that back alley said her aunt you see those buildings  that miserable row of shanties yes  well i have several acquaintances there who have never been tired of christmas gifts or gifts of any other kind i assure you you could make quite a sensation over there  well who is there let us know  do you remember owen that used to make your shoes  yes i remember something about him  well he has fallen into a consumption and cannot work any more and he and his wife and three little children live in one of the rooms  how do they get along  his wife takes in sewing sometimes and sometimes goes out washing poor owen i was over there yesterday he looks thin and wasted and his wife was saying that he was parched with constant fever and had very little appetite she had with great selfdenial and by restricting herself almost of necessary food got him two or three oranges and the poor fellow seemed so eager after them  poor fellow said eleanor involuntarily  now said her aunt suppose owens wife should get up on christmas morning and find at the door a couple of dozen of oranges and some of those nice white grapes such as you had at your party last week dont you think it would make a sensation  why yes i think very likely it might but who else aunt you spoke of a great many  well on the lower floor there is a neat little room that is always kept perfectly trim and tidy it belongs to a young couple who have nothing beyond the husbands day wages to live on they are nevertheless as cheerful and chipper as a couple of wrens and she is up and down half a dozen times a day to help poor mrs owen she has a baby of her own about five months old and of course does all the cooking washing and ironing for herself and husband and yet when mrs owen goes out to wash she takes her baby and keeps it whole days for her  im sure she deserves that the good fairies should smile on her said eleanor one baby exhausts my stock of virtues very rapidly  but you ought to see her baby said aunt e so plump so rosy and goodnatured and always clean as a lily this baby is a sort of household shrine nothing is too sacred or too good for it and i believe the little thrifty woman feels only one temptation to be extravagant and that is to get some ornaments to adorn this little divinity  why did she ever tell you so  no but one day when i was coming down stairs the door of their room was partly open and i saw a pedler there with open box john the husband was standing with a little purple cap on his hand which he was regarding with mystified admiring air as if he didnt quite comprehend it and trim little mary gazing at it with longing eyes  i think we might get it said john  o no said she regretfully yet i wish we could its so pretty  say no more aunt i see the good fairy must pop a cap into the window on christmas morning indeed it shall be done how they will wonder where it came from and talk about it for months to come  well then continued her aunt in the next street to ours there is a miserable building that looks as if it were just going to topple over and away up in the third story in a little room just under the eaves live two poor lonely old women they are both nearly on to ninety i was in there day before yesterday one of them is constantly confined to her bed with rheumatism the other weak and feeble with failing sight and trembling hands totters about her only helper and they are entirely dependent on charity  cant they do any thing cant they knit said eleanor  you are young and strong eleanor and have quick eyes and nimble fingers how long would it take you to knit a pair of stockings  i said eleanor what an idea i never tried but i think i could get a pair done in a week perhaps  and if somebody gave you twentyfive cents for them and out of this you had to get food and pay room rent and buy coal for your fire and oil for your lamp  stop aunt for pitys sake  well i will stop but they cant they must pay so much every month for that miserable shell they live in or be turned into the street the meal and flour that some kind person sends goes off for them just as it does for others and they must get more or starve and coal is now scarce and high priced  o aunt im quite convinced im sure dont run me down and annihilate me with all these terrible realities what shall i do to play good fairy to these poor old women  if you will give me full power eleanor i will put up a basket to be sent to them that will give them something to remember all winter  o certainly i will let me see if i cant think of something myself  well eleanor suppose then some fifty or sixty years hence if you were old and your father and mother and aunts and uncles now so thick around you lay cold and silent in so many gravesyou have somehow got away off to a strange city where you were never knownyou live in a miserable garret where snow blows at night through the cracks and the fire is very apt to go out in the old cracked stoveyou sit crouching over the dying embers the evening before christmasnobody to speak to you nobody to care for you except another poor old soul who lies moaning in the bed now what would you like to have sent you  o aunt what a dismal picture  and yet ella all poor forsaken old women are made of young girls who expected it in their youth as little as you do perhaps  say no more aunt ill buylet me seea comfortable warm shawl for each of these poor women and ill send themlet me seeo some teanothing goes down with old women like tea and ill make john wheel some coal over to them and aunt it would not be a very bad thought to send them a new stove i remember the other day when mamma was pricing stoves i saw some such nice ones for two or three dollars  for a new hand ella you work up the idea very well said her aunt  but how much ought i to give for any one case to these women say  how much did you give last year for any single christmas present  why six or seven dollars for some those elegant souvenirs were seven dollars that ring i gave mrs b was twenty  and do you suppose mrs b was any happier for it  no really i dont think she cared much about it but i had to give her something because she had sent me something the year before and i did not want to send a paltry present to one in her circumstances  then ella give the same to any poor distressed suffering creature who really needs it and see in how many forms of good such a sum will appear that one hard cold glittering ring that now cheers nobody and means nothing that you give because you must and she takes because she must might if broken up into smaller sums send real warm and heartfelt gladness through many a cold and cheerless dwelling through many an aching heart  you are getting to be an orator aunt but dont you approve of christmas presents among friends and equals  yes indeed said her aunt fondly stroking her head i have had some christmas presents that did me a world of gooda little book mark for instance that a certain niece of mine worked for me with wonderful secrecy three years ago when she was not a young lady with a purse full of moneythat book mark was a true christmas present and my young couple across the way are plotting a profound surprise to each other on christmas morning john has contrived by an hour of extra work every night to lay by enough to get mary a new calico dress and she poor soul has bargained away the only thing in the jewelry line she ever possessed to be laid out on a new hat for him  i know too a washerwoman who has a poor lame boya patient gentle little fellowwho has lain quietly for weeks and months in his little crib and his mother is going to give him a splendid christmas present  what is it pray  a whole orange dont laugh she will pay ten whole cents for it for it shall be none of your common oranges but a picked one of the very best going she has put by the money a cent at a time for a whole month and nobody knows which will be happiest in it willie or his mother these are such christmas presents as i like to think ofgifts coming from love and tending to produce love these are the appropriate gifts of the day  but dont you think that its right for those who have money to give expensive presents supposing always as you say they are given from real affection  sometimes undoubtedly the savior did not condemn her who broke an alabaster box of ointmentvery precioussimply as a proof of love even although the suggestion was made this might have been sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor i have thought he would regard with sympathy the fond efforts which human love sometimes makes to express itself by gifts the rarest and most costly how i rejoiced with all my heart when charles elton gave his poor mother that splendid chinese shawl and gold watch because i knew they came from the very fulness of his heart to a mother that he could not do too much fora mother that has done and suffered every thing for him in some such cases when resources are ample a costly gift seems to have a graceful appropriateness but i cannot approve of it if it exhausts all the means of doing for the poor it is better then to give a simple offering and to do something for those who really need it  eleanor looked thoughtful her aunt laid down her knitting and said in a tone of gentle seriousness whose birth does christmas commemorate ella  our saviors certainly aunt  yes said her aunt and when and how was he born in a stable laid in a manger thus born that in all ages he might be known as the brother and friend of the poor and surely it seems but appropriate to commemorate his birthday by an especial remembrance of the lowly the poor the outcast and distressed and if christ should come back to our city on a christmas day where should we think it most appropriate to his character to find him would he be carrying splendid gifts to splendid dwellings or would he be gliding about in the cheerless haunts of the desolate the poor the forsaken and the sorrowful  and here the conversation ended                                       what sort of christmas presents is ella buying said cousin tom as the waiter handed in a portentouslooking package which had been just rung in at the door  lets open it said saucy will upon my word two great gray blanket shawls these must be for you and me tom and whats this a great bolt of cotton flannel and gray yarn stockings  the door bell rang again and the waiter brought in another bulky parcel and deposited it on the marbletopped centre table  whats here said will cutting the cord whew a perfect nest of packages oolong tea oranges grapes white sugar bless me ella must be going to housekeeping  or going crazy said tom and on my word said he looking out of the window theres a drayman ringing at our door with a stove with a teakettle set in the top of it  ellas cook stove of course said will and just at this moment the young lady entered with her purse hanging gracefully over her hand  now boys you are too bad she exclaimed as each of the mischievous youngsters were gravely marching up and down attired in a gray shawl  didnt you get them for us we thought you did said both  ella i want some of that cotton flannel to make me a pair of pantaloons said tom  i say ella said will when are you going to housekeeping your cooking stove is standing down in the street pon my word john is loading some coal on the dray with it  ella isnt that going to be sent to my office said tom do you know i do so languish for a new stove with a teakettle in the top to heat a fellows shaving water  just then another ring at the door and the grinning waiter handed in a small brown paper parcel for miss ella tom made a dive at it and staving off the brown paper developed a jaunty little purple velvet cap with silver tassels  my smoking cap as i live said he only i shall have to wear it on my thumb instead of my headtoo small entirely said he shaking his head gravely  come you saucy boys said aunt e entering briskly what are you teasing ella for  why do see this lot of things aunt what in the world is ella going to do with them  o i know  you know then i can guess aunt it is some of your charitable works you are going to make a juvenile lady bountiful of el eh  ella who had colored to the roots of her hair at the exposé of her very unfashionable christmas preparations now took heart and bestowed a very gentle and salutary little cuff on the saucy head that still wore the purple cap and then hastened to gather up her various purchases  laugh away said she gayly and a good many others will laugh too over these things i got them to make people laughpeople that are not in the habit of laughing  well well i see into it said will and i tell you i think right well of the idea too there are worlds of money wasted at this time of the year in getting things that nobody wants and nobody cares for after they are got and i am glad for my part that you are going to get up a variety in this line in fact i should like to give you one of these stray leaves to help on said he dropping a ten dollar note into her paper i like to encourage girls to think of something besides breastpins and sugar candy  but our story spins on too long if any body wants to see the results of ellas first attempts at good fairyism they can call at the doors of two or three old buildings on christmas morning and they shall hear all about it     earthly care a heavenly discipline       why should these cares my heart divide       if thou indeed hast set me free     why am i thus if thou hast died       if thou hast died to ransom me  nothing is more frequently felt and spoken of as a hinderance to the inward life of devotion than the cares of life and even upon the showing of our lord himself the cares of the world are the thorns that choke the word and it becometh unfruitful  and yet if this is a necessary and inevitable result of worldly care why does the providence of god so order things that it forms so large and unavoidable a part of every human experience why is the physical system of man arranged with such daily oftrecurring wants why does his nature in its full development tend to that state of society in which wants multiply and the business of supply becomes more complicated and requiring constantly more thought and attention and bringing the outward and seen into a state of constant friction and pressure on the inner and spiritual  has god arranged an outward system to be a constant diversion from the inwarda weight on its wheelsa burden on its wingsand then commanded a strict and rigid inwardness and spirituality why placed us where the things that are seen and temporal must unavoidably have so much of our thoughts and time and care yet said to us set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth love not the world neither the things of the world and why does one of our brightest examples of christian experience as it should be say while we look not on the things which are seen but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal  the bible tells us that our whole existence here is a disciplinary one that this whole physical system by which our spirit is enclosed with all the joys and sorrows hopes and fears and wants which form a part of it are designed as an education to fit the soul for its immortality and as worldly care forms the greater part of the staple of every human life there must be some mode of viewing and meeting it which converts it from an enemy of spirituality into a means of grace and spiritual advancement  why then do we so often hear the lamentation it seems to me as if i could advance to the higher stages of christian life if it were not for the pressure of my business and the multitude of my worldly cares is it not god o christian who in ordering thy lot has laid these cares upon thee and who still holds them about thee and permits no escape from them and as his great undivided object is thy spiritual improvement is there not some misapprehension or wrong use of these cares if they do not tend to advance it is it not even as if a scholar should say i could advance in science were it not for all the time and care which lessons and books and lectures require  how then shall earthly care become heavenly discipline how shall the disposition of the weight be altered so as to press the spirit upward towards god instead of downward and away how shall the pillar of cloud which rises between us and him become one of fire to reflect upon us constantly the light of his countenance and to guide us over the sands of lifes desert  it appears to us that the great radical difficulty is an intellectual one and lies in a wrong belief there is not a genuine and real belief of the presence and agency of god in the minor events and details of life which is necessary to change them from secular cares into spiritual blessings  it is true there is much loose talk about an overruling providence and yet if fairly stated the belief of a great many christians might be thus expressed god has organized and set in operation certain general laws of matter and mind which work out the particular results of life and over these laws he exercises a general supervision and care so that all the great affairs of the world are carried on after the counsel of his own will and in a certain general sense all things are working together for good to those that love god but when some simpleminded childlike christian really proceeds to refer all the smaller events of life to gods immediate care and agency there is a smile of incredulity and it is thought that the good brother displays more christian feeling than sound philosophy  but as life for every individual is made up of fractions and minute atomsas those things which go to affect habits and character are small and hourly recurring it comes to pass that a belief in providence so very wide and general is altogether inefficient for consecrating and rendering sacred the great body of what comes in contact with the mind in the experience of life only once in years does the christian with this kind of belief hear the voice of the lord god speaking to him when the hand of death is laid on his child or the bolt strikes down the brother by his side then indeed he feels that god is drawing near he listens humbly for the inward voice that shall explain the meaning and need of this discipline when by some unforeseen occurrence the whole of his earthly property is swept awayhe becomes a poor manthis event in his eyes assumes sufficient magnitude to have come from god and to have a design and meaning but when smaller comforts are removed smaller losses are encountered and the petty everyday vexations and annoyances of life press about him he recognizes no god and hears no voice and sees no design hence john newton says many christians who bear the loss of a child or the destruction of all their property with the most heroic christian fortitude are entirely vanquished and overcome by the breaking of a dish or the blunders of a servant and show so unchristian a spirit that we cannot but wonder at them  so when the breath of slander or the pressure of human injustice comes so heavily on a man as really to threaten loss of character and destruction of his temporal interests he seems forced to recognize the hand and voice of god through the veil of human agencies and in timehonored words to say      when men of spite against me join     they are the sword the hand is thine  but the smaller injustice and faultfinding which meet every one more or less in the daily intercourse of life the overheard remark the implied censure too petty perhaps to be even spoken of these daily recurring sources of disquietude and unhappiness are not referred to gods providence nor considered as a part of his probation and discipline those thousand vexations which come upon us through the unreasonableness the carelessness the various constitutional failings or illadaptedness of others to our peculiarities of character form a very large item of the disquietudes of life and yet how very few look beyond the human agent and feel these are trials coming from god yet it is true in many cases that these so called minor vexations form the greater part and in many cases the only discipline of life and to those that do not view them as ordered individually by god and coming upon them by specified design their affliction really cometh of the dust and their trouble springs out of the ground it is sanctified and relieved by no divine presence and aid but borne alone and in a mere human spirit and by mere human reliances it acts on the mind as a constant diversion and hinderance instead of a moral discipline  hence too come a coldness and generality and wandering of mind in prayer the things that are on the heart that are distracting the mind that have filled the soul so full that there is no room for any thing else are all considered too small and undignified to come within the pale of a prayer and so with a wandering mind and a distracted heart the christian offers up his prayer for things which he thinks he ought to want and makes no mention of those which he does he prays that god would pour out his spirit on the heathen and convert the world and build up his kingdom every where when perhaps a whole set of little anxieties and wants and vexations are so distracting his thoughts that he hardly knows what he has been saying a faithless servant is wasting his property a careless or blundering workman has spoiled a lot of goods a child is vexatious or unruly a friend has made promises and failed to keep them an acquaintance has made unjust or satirical remarks some new furniture has been damaged or ruined by carelessness in the household but all this trouble forms no subject matter for prayer though there it is all the while lying like lead on the heart and keeping it down so that it has no power to expand and take in any thing else but were god known and regarded as the souls familiar friend were every trouble of the heart as it rises breathed into his bosom were it felt that there is not one of the smallest of lifes troubles that has not been permitted by him and permitted for specific good purpose to the soul how much more would these be in prayer how constant how daily might it become how it might settle and clear the atmosphere of the soul how it might so dispose and lay away many anxieties which now take up their place there that there might be room for the higher themes and considerations of religion  many sensitive and fastidious natures are worn away by the constant friction of what are called little troubles without any great affliction they feel that all the flower and sweetness of their life have faded their eye grows dim their cheek careworn and their spirit loses hope and elasticity and becomes bowed with premature age and in the midst of tangible and physical comfort they are restless and unhappy the constant undercurrent of little cares and vexations which is slowly wearing on the finer springs of life is seen by no one scarce ever do they speak of these things to their nearest friends yet were there a friend of a spirit so discerning as to feel and sympathize in all these things how much of this repressed electric restlessness would pass off through such a sympathizing mind  yet among human friends this is all but impossible for minds are so diverse that what is a trial and a care to one is a matter of sport and amusement to another and all the inner world breathed into a human ear only excites a surprised or contemptuous pity whom then shall the soul turn to who will feel that to be affliction which each spirit feels to be so if the soul shut itself within itself it becomes morbid the fine chords of the mind and nerves by constant wear become jarring and discordant hence fretfulness discontent and habitual irritability steal over the sincere christian  but to the christian that really believes in the agency of god in the smallest events of life that confides in his love and makes his sympathy his refuge the thousand minute cares and perplexities of life become each one a fine affiliating bond between the soul and its god god is known not by abstract definition and by highraised conceptions of the souls aspiring hours but known as a man knoweth his friend he is known by the hourly wants he supplies known by every care with which he momentarily sympathizes every apprehension which he relieves every temptation which he enables us to surmount we learn to know god as the infant child learns to know its mother and its father by all the helplessness and all the dependence which are incident to this commencement of our moral existence and as we go on thus year by year and find in every changing situation in every reverse in every trouble from the lightest sorrow to those which wring our soul from its depths that he is equally present and that his gracious aid is equally adequate our faith seems gradually almost to change to sight and gods existence his love and care seem to us more real than any other source of reliance and multiplied cares and trials are only new avenues of acquaintance between us and heaven  suppose in some bright vision unfolding to our view in tranquil evening or solemn midnight the glorified form of some departed friend should appear to us with the announcement this year is to be to you one of especial probation and discipline with reference to perfecting you for a heavenly state weigh well and consider every incident of your daily life for not one shall fall out by accident but each one is to be a finished and indispensable link in a bright chain that is to draw you upward to the skies  with what new eyes should we now look on our daily lot and if we found in it not a single changethe same old cares the same perplexities the same uninteresting drudgeries stillwith what new meaning would every incident be invested and with what other and sublimer spirit could we meet them yet if announced by one rising from the dead with the visible glory of a spiritual world this truth could be asserted no more clearly and distinctly than jesus christ has stated it already not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our father not one of them is forgotten by him and we are of more value than many sparrows yea even the hairs of our head are all numbered not till belief in these declarations in their most literal sense becomes the calm and settled habit of the soul is life ever redeemed from drudgery and dreary emptiness and made full of interest meaning and divine significance not till then do its grovelling wants its wearing cares its stinging vexations become to us ministering spirits each one by a silent but certain agency fitting us for a higher and perfect sphere     conversation on conversation        for every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account      thereof in the day of judgment  a very solemn sermon said miss b shaking her head impressively as she sat down to table on sunday noon then giving a deep sigh she added i am afraid that if an account is to be rendered for all our idle words some people will have a great deal to answer for  why cousin anna replied a sprightly young lady opposite what do you mean by idle words  all words that have not a strictly useful tendency helen replied miss b  i dont know what is to become of me then answered helen for i never can think of any thing useful to say i sit and try sometimes but it always stops my talking i dont think any thing in the world is so doleful as a set of persons sitting round all trying to say something useful like a parcel of old clocks ticking at each other i think one might as well take the vow of entire silence like the monks of la trappe  it is probable said miss b that a greater part of our ordinary conversation had better be dispensed with in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin for my own part my conscience often reproaches me with the sins of my tongue  im sure you dont sin much that way i must say said helen but cousin i really think it is a freezing business sitting still and reflecting all the time when friends are together and after all i cant bring myself to feel as if it were wrong to talk and chatter away a good part of the time just for the sake of talking for instance if a friend comes in of a morning to make a call i talk about the weather my roses my canary birds or any thing that comes uppermost  and about lace and bonnet patterns and the last fashions added miss b sarcastically  well supposing we do wheres the harm  wheres the good said miss b  the good why it passes time agreeably and makes us feel kindly towards each other  i think helen said miss b if you had a higher view of christian responsibility you would not be satisfied with merely passing time agreeably or exciting agreeable feelings in others does not the very text we are speaking of show that we have an account to give in the day of judgment for all this trifling useless conversation  i dont know what that text does mean replied helen looking seriously but if it means as you say i think it is a very hard strait rule  well replied miss b is not duty always hard and strait strait is the gate and narrow is the way you know  helen sighed  what do you think of this uncle c she said after some pause the uncle of the two young ladies had been listening thus far in silence  i think he replied that before people begin to discuss they should be quite sure as to what they are talking about and i am not exactly clear in this case you say anna said he turning to miss b that all conversation is idle which has not a directly useful tendency now what do you mean by that are we never to say any thing that has not for its direct and specific object to benefit others or ourselves  yes replied miss b i suppose not  well then when i say good morning sir tis a pleasant day i have no such object are these then idle words  why no not exactly replied miss b in some cases it is necessary to say something so as not to appear rude  very well replied her uncle you admit then that some things which are not instructive in themselves considered are to be said to keep up the intercourse of society  certainly some things said miss b  well now in the case mentioned by helen when two or three people with whom you are in different degrees of intimacy call upon you i think she is perfectly right as she said in talking of roses and canary birds and even of bonnet patterns and lace or any thing of the kind for the sake of making conversation it amounts to the same thing as good morning and good evening and the other courtesies of society this sort of small talk has nothing instructive in it and yet it may be useful in its place it makes people comfortable and easy promotes kind and social feelings and making people comfortable by any innocent means is certainly not a thing to be despised  but is there not great danger of becoming light and trifling if one allows this said miss b doubtfully  to be sure there is always danger of running every innocent thing to excess one might eat to excess or drink to excess yet eating and drinking are both useful in their way now our lively young friend helen here might perhaps be in some temptation of this sort but as for you anna i think you in more danger of another extreme  and what is that  of overstraining your mind by endeavoring to keep up a constant fixed state of seriousness and solemnity and not allowing yourself the relaxation necessary to preserve its healthy tone in order to be healthy every mind must have variety and amusement and if you would sit down at least one hour a day and join your friends in some amusing conversation and indulge in a good laugh i think my dear that you would not only be a happier person but a better christian  my dear uncle said miss b this is the very thing that i have been most on my guard against i can never tell stories or laugh and joke without feeling condemned for it afterwards  but my dear you must do the thing in the testimony of a good conscience before you can do it to any purpose you must make up your mind that cheerful and entertaining conversationconversation whose first object is to amuseis useful conversation in its place and then your conscience will not be injured by joining in it  but what good does it do uncle  do you not often complain of coldness and deadness in your religious feelings of lifelessness and want of interest  yes uncle  well this coldness and lifelessness is the result of forcing your mind to one set of thoughts and feelings you become worn outyour feelings exhausteddeadness and depression ensues now turn your mind off from these subjectsdivert it by a cheerful and animated conversation and you will find after a while that it will return to them with new life and energy  but are not foolish talking and jesting expressly forbidden  that text if you will look at the connections does not forbid jesting in the abstract but jesting on immodest subjectswhich are often designated in the new testament by the phraseology there employed i should give the sense of itneither filthiness nor foolish talking nor indelicate jests the kind of sprightly and amusing conversation to which i referred i should not denominate foolish by any means at proper times and places  yet people often speak of gayety as inconsistent in christianseven worldly people said miss b  yes because in the first place they often have wrong ideas as to what christianity requires in this respect and suppose christians to be violating their own principles in indulging in it in the second place there are some especially among young people who never talk in any other waywith whom this kind of conversation is not an amusement but a habitgiving the impression that they never think seriously at all but i think that if persons are really possessed by the tender affectionate benevolent spirit of christianityif they regulate their temper and their tongue by it and in all their actions show an evident effort to conform to its precepts they will not do harm by occasionally indulging in sprightly and amusing conversationthey will not make the impression that they are not sincerely christians  besides said helen are not people sometimes repelled from religion by a want of cheerfulness in its professors  certainly replied her uncle and the difference is just this if a person is habitually trifling and thoughtless it is thought that they have no religion if they are ascetic and gloomy it is attributed to their religion and you know what miss e smith saysthat to be good and disagreeable is high treason against virtue the more sincerely and earnestly religious a person is the more important it is that they should be agreeable  but uncle said helen what does that text mean that we began with what are idle words  my dear if you will turn to the place where the passage is matt xii and read the whole page you will see the meaning of it christ was not reproving any body for trifling conversation at the time but for a very serious slander the pharisees in their bitterness accused him of being in league with evil spirits it seems by what follows that this was a charge which involved an unpardonable sin they were not indeed conscious of its full guiltthey said it merely from the impulse of excited and envious feelingbut he warns them that in the day of judgment god will hold them accountable for the full consequences of all such language however little they may have thought of it at the time of uttering it the sense of the passage i take to be god will hold you responsible in the day of judgment for the consequences of all you have said in your most idle and thoughtless moments  for example said helen if one makes unguarded and unfounded assertions about the bible which excite doubt and prejudice  there are many instances said her uncle that are quite in point suppose in conversation either under the influence of envy or ill will or merely from love of talking you make remarks and statements about another person which may be true or may notyou do not stop to inquireyour unguarded words set reports in motion and unhappiness and hard feeling and loss of character are the result you spoke idly it is true but nevertheless you are held responsible by god for all the consequences of your words so professors of religion often make unguarded remarks about each other which lead observers to doubt the truth of all religion and they are responsible for every such doubt they excite parents and guardians often allow themselves to speak of the faults and weaknesses of their ministers in the presence of children and younger peoplethey do it thoughtlesslybut in so doing they destroy an influence which might otherwise have saved the souls of their children they are responsible for it people of cultivated minds and fastidious taste often allow themselves to come home from church and criticize a sermon and unfold all its weak points in the presence of others on whom it may have made a very serious impression while the critic is holding up the bad arrangement and setting in a ludicrous point of view the lame figures perhaps the servant behind his chair who was almost persuaded to be a christian by that very discourse gives up his purposes in losing his respect for the sermon this was thoughtlessbut the evil is done and the man who did it is responsible for it  i think said helen that a great deal of evil is done to children in this way by our not thinking of what we are saying  it seems to me said miss b that this view of the subject will reduce us to silence almost as much as the other how is one ever to estimate the consequences of their words people are affected in so many different ways by the same thing  i suppose said her uncle we are only responsible for such results as by carefulness and reflection we might have foreseen it is not for illjudged words but for idle words that we are to be judgedwords uttered without any consideration at all and producing bad results if a person really anxious to do right misjudges as to the probable effect of what he is about to say on others it is quite another thing  but uncle will not such carefulness destroy all freedom in conversation said helen  if you are talking with a beloved friend helen do you not use an instinctive care to avoid all that might pain that friend  certainly  and do you find this effort a restraint on your enjoyment  certainly not  and you from your own feelings avoid what is indelicate and impure in conversation and yet feel it no restraint  certainly  well i suppose the object of christian effort should be so to realize the character of our savior and conform our tastes and sympathies to his that we shall instinctively avoid all in our conversation that would be displeasing to him a person habitually indulging jealous angry or revengeful feelinga person habitually worldly in his spirita person allowing himself in sceptical and unsettled habits of thought cannot talk without doing harm this is our saviors account of the matter in the verses immediately before the passage we were speaking ofhow can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things the highest flow of animal spirits would never hurry a pureminded person to say any thing indelicate or gross and in the same manner if a person is habitually christian in all his habits of thought and feeling he will be able without irksome watchfulness to avoid what may be injurious even in the most unrestrained conversation     how do we know   it was a splendid room rich curtains swept down to the floor in graceful folds half excluding the light and shedding it in soft hues over the fine old paintings on the walls and over the broad mirrors that reflect all that taste can accomplish by the hand of wealth books the rarest and most costly were around in every form of gorgeous binding and gilding and among them glittering in ornament lay a magnificent biblea bible too beautiful in its appointments too showy too ornamental ever to have been meant to be reada bible which every visitor should take up and exclaim what a beautiful edition what superb bindings and then lay it down again  and the master of the house was lounging on a sofa looking over a late reviewfor he was a man of leisure taste and readingbut then as to reading the biblethat forms we suppose no part of the pretensions of a man of letters the biblecertainly he considered it a very respectable booka fine specimen of ancient literaturean admirable book of moral precepts but then as to its divine origin he had not exactly made up his mind some parts appeared strange and inconsistent to his reasonothers were revolting to his taste true he had never studied it very attentively yet such was his general impression about it but on the whole he thought it well enough to keep an elegant copy of it on his drawing room table  so much for one picture now for another  come with us into this little dark alley and up a flight of ruinous stairs it is a bitter night and the wind and snow might drive through the crevices of the poor room were it not that careful hands have stopped them with paper or cloth but for all this carefulness the room is bitter coldcold even with those few decaying brands on the hearth which that sorrowful woman is trying to kindle with her breath do you see that pale little thin girl with large bright eyes who is crouching so near her motherharkhow she coughs now listen  mary my dear child says the mother do keep that shawl close about you you are cold i know and the woman shivers as she speaks  no mother not very replies the child again relapsing into that hollow ominous cough i wish you wouldnt make me always wear your shawl when it is cold mother  dear child you need it most how you cough tonight replies the mother it really dont seem right for me to send you up that long cold street now your shoes have grown so poor too i must go myself after this  o mother you must stay with the babywhat if he should have one of those dreadful fits while you are gone no i can go very well i have got used to the cold now  but mother im cold says a little voice from the scanty bed in the corner maynt i get up and come to the fire  dear child it would not warm you it is very cold here and i cant make any more fire tonight  why cant you mother there are four whole sticks of wood in the box do put one on and lets get warm once  no my dear little henry says the mother soothingly that is all the wood mother has and i havent any money to get more  and now wakens the sick baby in the cradle and mother and daughter are both for some time busy in attempting to supply its little wants and lulling it again to sleep  and now look you well at that mother six months ago she had a husband whose earnings procured for her both the necessaries and comforts of life her children were clothed fed and schooled without thoughts of hers but husbandless friendless and alone in the heart of a great busy city with feeble health and only the precarious resource of her needle she has gone down from comfort to extreme poverty look at her now as she is tonight she knows full well that the pale brighteyed girl whose hollow cough constantly rings in her ears is far from well she knows that cold and hunger and exposure of every kind are daily and surely wearing away her life and yet what can she do poor soul how many times has she calculated all her little resources to see if she could pay a doctor and get medicine for maryyet all in vain she knows that timely medicine ease fresh air and warmth might save her but she knows that all these things are out of the question for her she feels too as a mother would feel when she sees her once rosy happy little boy becoming pale and anxious and fretful and even when he teases her most she only stops her work a moment and strokes his little thin cheeks and thinks what a laughing happy little fellow he once was till she has not a heart to reprove him and all this day she has toiled with a sick and fretful baby in her lap and her little shivering hungry boy at her side whom marys patient artifices cannot always keep quiet she has toiled over the last piece of work which she can procure from the shop for the man has told her that after this he can furnish no more and the little money that is to come from this is already portioned out in her own mind and after that she has no human prospect of support  but yet that womans face is patient quiet firm nay you may even see in her suffering eye something like peace and whence comes it i will tell you  there is a bible in that room as well as in the rich mans apartment not splendidly bound to be sure but faithfully reada plain homely muchworn book  hearken now while she says to her children listen to me dear children and i will read you something out of this book let not your heart be troubled in my fathers house are many mansions so you see my children we shall not always live in this little cold dark room jesus christ has promised to take us to a better home  shall we be warm there all day says the little boy earnestly and shall we have enough to eat  yes dear child says the mother listen to what the bible says they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes  i am glad of that said little mary for mother i never can bear to see you cry  but mother says little henry wont god send us something to eat tomorrow  see says the mother what the bible says seek ye not what ye shall eat nor what ye shall drink neither be of anxious mind for your father knoweth that ye have need of these things  but mother says little mary if god is our father and loves us what does he let us be so poor for  nay says the mother our dear lord jesus christ was as poor as we are and god certainly loved him  was he mother  yes children you remember how he said the son of man hath not where to lay his head and it tells us more than once that jesus was hungry when there was none to give him food  o mother what should we do without the bible says mary  now if the rich man who had not yet made up his mind what to think of the bible should visit this poor woman and ask her on what she grounded her belief of its truth what could she answer could she give the arguments from miracles and prophecy could she account for all the changes which might have taken place in it through translators and copyists and prove that we have a genuine and uncorrupted version not she but how then does she know that it is true how say you how does she know that she has warm life blood in her heart how does she know that there is such a thing as air and sunshine she does not believe these thingsshe knows them and in like manner with a deep heart consciousness she is certain that the words of her bible are truth and life is it by reasoning that the frightened child bewildered in the dark knows its mothers voice no nor is it only by reasoning that the forlorn and distressed human heart knows the voice of its savior and is still     which is the liberal man   it was a beaming and beautiful summer morning and the little town of v was alive with all the hurry and motion of a college commencement rows of carriages lined the rural streets and groups of welldressed auditors were thronging to the hall of exhibition all was gayety and animation  and among them all what heart beat higher with hope and gratified ambition than that of james stanton young buoyant prepossessing in person and manners he was this day in the presence of all the world to carry off the highest palm of scholarship in his institution and to receive on the threshold of the great world the utmost that youthful ambition can ask before it enters the arena of actual life did not his pulse flutter and his heart beat thick when he heard himself announced in the crowded house as the valedictorian of the day when he saw aged men and fair youthful faces ruddy childhood and sober calculating manhood alike bending in hushed and eager curiosity to listen to his words nay did not his heart rise in his throat as he caught the gleam of his fathers eye while bending forward on his staff with white reverend locks falling about his face he listened to the voice of his pridehis first born and did he not see the glistening tears in his mothers eye as with rapt ear she hung upon his every word ah the young mans first triumph when full of confidence and hope he enters the field of life all his white glistening as yet unsoiled by the dust of the combat the unproved world turning towards him with flatteries and promises in both hands what other triumph does life give so fresh so full so replete with hope and joy so felt james stanton this day when he heard his father congratulated on having a son of such promise when old men revered for talents and worth shook hands with him and bade him warmly god speed in the course of life when bright eyes cast glances of favor and from among the fairest were overheard whispers of admiration  your son is designed for the bar i trust said the venerable judge l to the father of james at the commencement dinner i have seldom seen a turn of mind better fitted for success in the legal profession and then his voice his manner let him go to the bar sir and i prophesy that he will yet outdo us all  and this was said in jamess hearing and by one whose commendation was not often so warmly called forth it was not in any young heart not to beat quicker at such prospects honor station wealth political ambition all seemed to offer themselves to his grasp but long ere this in the solitude of retirement in the stillness of prayer and selfexamination the young graduate had vowed himself to a different destiny and if we may listen to a conversation a few evenings after commencement with a classmate we shall learn more of the secret workings of his mind  and so stanton said george lennox to him as they sat by their evening fireside you have not yet decided whether to accept judge ls offer or not  i have decided that matter long ago said james  so then you choose the ministry  yes  well for my part replied george lennox i choose the law there must be christians you know in every vocation the law seems to suit my turn of mind i trust it will be my effort to live as becomes a christian whatever be my calling  i trust so replied james  but really stanton added the other after some thought it seems a pity to cast away such prospects as open before you you know your tuition is offered gratis and then the patronage of judge l and such influences as he can command to secure your successpray do not these things seem to you like a providential indication that the law is to be your profession besides here in these new england states the ministry is overflowed alreadyministers enough and too many if one may judge by the number of applicants for every unoccupied place  nay replied james my place is not here i know if all accounts are true that my profession is not overflowed in our western states and there i mean to go  and is it possible that you can contemplate such an entire sacrifice of your talents your manners your literary and scientific tastes your capabilities for refined society as to bury yourself in a log cabin in one of our new states you will never be appreciated there your privations and sacrifices will be entirely disregarded and you placed on a level with the coarsest and most uneducated sectaries i really do not think you are called to this  who then is called replied james  why men with much less of all these good thingsmen with real coarse substantial backwoods furniture in their minds who will not appreciate and of course not feel the want of all the refinements and comforts which you must sacrifice  and are there enough such men ready to meet the emergencies in our western world so that no others need be called upon replied james men of the class you speak of may do better than i but if after all their efforts i still am needed and can work well ought i not to go must those only be drafted for religious enterprises to whom they involve no sacrifice  well for my part replied the other i trust i am willing to do any thing that is my duty yet i never could feel it to be my duty to bury myself in a new state among stumps and log cabins my mind would rust itself out and missing the stimulus of such society as i have been accustomed to i should run down completely and be useless in body and in mind  if you feel so it would be so replied james if the work there to be done would not be stimulus and excitement enough to compensate for the absence of all other stimulusif the business of the ministry the saving of human souls is not the one allabsorbing purpose and desire and impulse of the whole beingthen woe to the man who goes to preach the gospel where there is nothing but human souls to be gained by it  well stanton replied the other after a pause of some seriousness i cannot say that i have attained to this yet i dont know but i might be brought to it but at present i must confess it is not so we ought not to rush into a state and employment which we have not the moral fortitude to sustain well in short for myself i may make a respectable and i trust not useless man in the law when i could do nothing in the circumstances which you choose however i respect your feelings and heartily wish that i could share them myself  a few days after this conversation the young friends parted for their several destinationsthe one to a law school the other to a theological seminary                                       it was many years after this that a middleaged man of somewhat threadbare appearance and restricted travelling conveniences was seen carefully tying his horse at the outer enclosure of an elegant mansion in the town of  in one of our western states which being done he eyed the house rather inquisitively as people sometimes do when they are doubtful as to the question of entering or not entering the house belonged to george lennox esq a lawyer reputed to be doing a more extensive business than any other in the state and the threadbare gentleman who plies the knocker at the front door is the reverend mr stanton a name widely spread in the ecclesiastical circles of the land the door opens and the old college acquaintances meet with a cordial grasp of the hand and mr stanton soon finds himself pressed to the most comfortable accommodations in the warm parlor of his friend and even the slight uneasiness which the wisest are not always exempt from when conscious of a little shabbiness in exterior was entirely dissipated by the evident cordiality of his reception since the conversation we have alluded to the two friends pursued their separate courses with but few opportunities of personal intercourse in the true zeal of the missionary james stanton had thrown himself into the field where it seemed hardest and darkest and where labor seemed most needed in neighborhoods without churches without school houses without settled roads among a population of disorganized and heterogeneous material he had exhorted from house to house labored individually with one after another till he had in place after place brought together the elements of a christian church far from all ordinances means of grace or christian brotherhood or coöperation he had seemed to himself to be merely the lonely solitary voice of one crying in the wilderness as unassisted and to human view as powerless with poverty and cold and physical fatigue he had daily been familiar and where no vehicle could penetrate the miry depths of the forest where it was impracticable even to guide a horse he had walked miles and miles through mud and rain to preach with a wife in delicate health and a young and growing family he had more than once seen the year when fifty dollars was the whole amount of money that had passed through his hands and the whole of the rest of his support had come in disconnected contributions from one and another of his people he had lived without books without newspapers except as he had found them by chance snatches here and there1 and felt as one so circumstanced only can feel the difficulty of maintaining intellectual vigor and energy in default of all those stimulants to which cultivated minds in more favorable circumstances are so much indebted at the time that he is now introduced to the reader he had been recently made pastor in one of the most important settlements in the state and among those who so far as worldly circumstances were concerned were able to afford him a competent support but among communities like those at the west settled for expressly moneymaking purposes and by those who have for years been taught the lesson to save and have scarcely begun to feel the duty to give a minister however laborious however eloquent and successful may often feel the most serious embarrassments of poverty too often is his salary regarded as a charity which may be given or retrenched to suit every emergency of the times and his family expenditures watched with a jealous and censorious eye  footnote 1 those particulars the writer heard stated personally as a part of the experience of one of the most devoted ministers of ohio  on the other hand george lennox the lawyer had by his talents and efficiency placed himself at the head of his profession and was realizing an income which brought all the comforts and elegances of life within his reach he was a member of the christian church in the place where he lived irreproachable in life and conduct from natural generosity of disposition seconded by principle he was a liberal contributor to all religious and benevolent enterprises and was often quoted and referred to as an example in good works surrounded by an affectionate and growing family with ample means for providing in the best manner both for their physical and mental development he justly regarded himself as a happy man and was well satisfied with the world he lived in  now there is nothing more trying to the christianity or the philosophy which teaches the vanity of riches than a few hours domestication in a family where wealth is employed not for purposes of ostentation but for the perfecting of home comfort and the gratification of refined intellectual tastes and as mr stanton leaned back slippered and gowned in one of the easiest of chairs and began to look over periodicals and valuable new books from which he had long been excluded he might be forgiven for giving a half sigh to the reflection that he could never be a rich man have you read this review said his companion handing him one of the leading periodicals of the day across the table  i seldom see reviews said mr stanton taking it  you lose a great deal replied the other if you have not seen those by this authoraltogether the ablest series of literary efforts in our time you clerical gentlemen ought not to sacrifice your literary tastes entirely to your professional cares a moderate attention to current literature liberalizes the mind and gives influence that you could not otherwise acquire  literary taste is an expensive thing to a minister said mr stanton smiling for the mind as well as the body we must forego all luxuries and confine ourselves simply to necessaries  i would always indulge myself with books and periodicals even if i had to scrimp elsewhere said mr lennox and he spoke of scrimping with all the serious good faith with which people of two or three thousand a year usually speak of these matters  mr stanton smiled and waived the subject wondering mentally where his friend would find an elsewhere to scrimp if he had the management of his concerns the conversation gradually flowed back to college days and scenes and the friends amused themselves with tracing the history of their various classmates  and so alsop is in the senate said mr stanton strange we did not at all expect it of him but do you know any thing of george bush  o yes replied the other he went into mercantile life and the last i heard he had turned a speculation worth thirty thousanda shrewd fellow i always knew he would make his way in the world  but what has become of langdon  o he is doing well he is professor of languages in  college and i hear he has lately issued a latin grammar that promises to have quite a run  and smithson  smithson has an office at washington and was there living in great style the last time i saw him  it may be questioned whether the minister sank to sleep that night amid the many comfortable provisions of his friends guest chamber without rebuking in his heart a certain rising of regret that he had turned his back on all the honors and distinctions and comforts which lay around the path of others who had not in the opening of the race half the advantages of himself see said the insidious voicewhat have you gained see your early friends surrounded by riches and comfort while you are pinched and harassed by poverty have they not many of them as good a hope of heaven as you have and all this besides could you not have lived easier and been a good man after all the reflection was only silenced by remembering that the only being who ever had the perfect power of choosing his worldly condition chose of his own accord a poverty deeper than that of any of his servants had christ consented to be rich what check could there have been to the desire of it among his followers but he chose to stoop so low that none could be lower and that in extremest want none could ever say i am poorer than was my savior and god  the friends at parting the next morning shook hands warmly and promised a frequent renewal of their resumed intercourse nor was the bill for twenty dollars which the minister found in his hand at all an unacceptable addition to the pleasures of his visit and though the november wind whistled keenly through a dull comfortless sky he turned his horses head homeward with a lightened heart                                       mothers sick and im akeeping house said a little flaxenheaded girl in all the importance of seven years as her father entered the dwelling  your mother sick whats the matter inquired mr stanton  she caught cold washing yesterday while you were gone and when the minister stood by the bedside of his sick wife saw her flushed face and felt her feverish pulse he felt seriously alarmed she had scarcely recovered from a dangerous fever when he left home and with reason he dreaded a relapse  my dear why have you done so was the first expostulation why did you not send for old agnes to do your washing as i told you  i felt so well i thought i was quite able was the reply and you know it will take all the money we have now in hand to get the childrens shoes before cold weather comes and nobody knows when we shall have any more  well mary comfort your heart as to that i have had a present today of twenty dollarsthat will last us some time god always provides when need is greatest and so after administering a little to the comfort of his wife the minister addressed himself to the business of cooking something for dinner for himself and his little hungry flock  there is no bread in the house he exclaimed after a survey of the ways and means at his disposal  i must try and sit up long enough to make some said his wife faintly  you must try to be quiet replied the husband we can do very well on potatoes but yet he added i think if i bring the things to your bedside and you show me how to mix them i could make some bread  a burst of laughter from the young fry chorused his proposal nevertheless as mr stanton was a man of decided genius by help of much showing and of strong arms and good will the feat was at length accomplished in no unworkmanlike manner and while the bread was put down to the fire to rise and the potatoes were baking in the oven mr stanton having enjoined silence on his noisy troop sat down pencil in hand by his wifes bed to prepare a sermon  we would that those ministers who feel that they cannot compose without a study and that the airiest and pleasantest room in the house where the floor is guarded by the thick carpet the light carefully relieved by curtains where papers are filed and arranged neatly in conveniences purposely adjusted with books of reference standing invitingly around could once figure to themselves the process of composing a sermon in circumstances such as we have painted mr stanton had written his text and jotted down something of an introduction when a circumstance occurred which is almost inevitable in situations where a person has any thing else to attend tothe baby woke the little interloper was to be tied into a chair while the flaxenheaded young housekeeper was now installed into the office of waiter in ordinary to her majesty and by shaking a newspaper before her face plying a rattle or other arts known only to the initiate to prevent her from indulging in any unpleasant demonstrations while mr stanton proceeded with his train of thought  papa papa the teakettle only look cried all the younger ones just as he was again beginning to abstract his mind  mr stanton rose and adapting part of his sermon paper to the handle of the teakettle poured the boiling water on some herb drink for his wife and then recommenced  i shant have much of a sermon he soliloquized as his youngest but one with the ingenuity common to children of her standing had contrived to tip herself over in her chair and cut her under lip which for the time being threw the whole settlement into commotion and this conviction was strengthened by finding that it was now time to give the children their dinner  i fear mrs stanton is imprudent in exerting herself said the medical man to the husband as he examined her symptoms  i know she is replied her husband but i cannot keep her from it  it is absolutely indispensable that she should rest and keep her mind easy said the doctor  rest and keep easyhow easily the words are said yet how they fall on the ear of a mother who knows that her whole flock have not yet a garment prepared for winter that hiring assistance is out of the question and that the work must all be done by herselfwho sees that while she is sick her husband is perplexed and kept from his appropriate duties and her children despite his wellmeant efforts suffering for the want of those attentions that only a mother can give will not any mother so tried rise from her sick bed before she feels able to be again prostrated by overexertion until the vigor of the constitution year by year declines and she sinks into an early grave yet this is the true history of many a wife and mother who in consenting to share the privations of a western minister has as truly sacrificed her life as did ever martyr on heathen shores the graves of harriet newell and mrs judson are hallowed as the shrines of saints and their memory made as a watchword among christians yet the western valley is full of green and nameless graves where patient longenduring wives and mothers have lain down worn out by the privations of as severe a missionary field and no man knoweth the place of their sepulchre  the crisp air of a november evening was enlivened by the fire that blazed merrily in the bar room of the tavern in l while a more than usual number crowded about the hearth owing to the session of the county court in that place  mr lennox is a pretty smart lawyer began an old gentleman who sat in one of the corners in the half interrogative tone which indicated a wish to start conversation  yes sir no mistake about that was the reply does the largest business in the statevery smart man sir and honesta church member too and one of the tallest kinds of christians they saygives more money for building meeting houses and all sorts of religious concerns than any man around  well he can afford it said a man with a thin caretaking visage and a nervous anxious twitch of the hand as if it were his constant effort to hold on to somethinghe can afford it for he makes money hand over hand it is not every body can afford to do as he does  a sly look of intelligence pervaded the company for the speaker one of the most substantial householders in the settlement was always taken with distressing symptoms of poverty and destitution when any allusion to public or religious charity was made  mr c is thinking about parish matters said a wicked wag of the company you see sir our minister urged pretty hard last sunday to have his salary paid up he has had sickness in his family and nothing on hand for winter expenses  i dont think mr stanton is judicious in making such public statements said the former speaker nervously he ought to consult his friends privately and not bring temporalities into the pulpit  that is to say starve decently and make no fuss replied the other  nonsense who talks of starving when provision is as plenty as blackberries i tell you i understand this matter and know how little a man can get along with ive tried it myself when i first set out in life my wife and i had not a pair of andirons or a shovel and tongs for two or three years and we never thought of complaining the times are hard we are all losing and must get along as we can and mr stanton must bear some rubs as well as the rest of us  it appears to me mr c said the waggish gentleman aforesaid that if youd put mr stanton into your good brick house and give him your furniture and income he would be well satisfied to rub along as you do  mr stanton isnt so careful in his expenses as he might be said mr c petulantly disregarding the idea started by his neighbor he buys things i should not think of buying now i was in his house the other day and he had just given three dollars for a single book  perhaps it was a book he needed in his studies suggested the old gentleman who began the conversation  whats the use of book larnin to a minister if hes got the real spirit in him chimed in a roughlooking man in the farthest corner only wish you could have heard elder north give it offthere was a real genuine preacher for you couldnt even read his text in the bible yet sir he would get up and reel it off as smooth and fast as the best of them that come out of the colleges my notion is its the spirit thats the thing after all  several of the auditors seemed inclined to express their approbation of this doctrine though some remarked that mr stanton was a smarter preacher than elder north for all his book larnin  some of the more intelligent of the circle here exchanged smiles but declined entering the lists in favor of larnin  o for my part resumed mr c i am for having a minister study and have books and all that if he can afford it but in hard times like these books are neither meat drink nor fire and i know i cant afford them now im as willing to contribute my part to the ministers salary and every other charity as any body when i can get money to do it but in these times i cant get it  the elderly gentleman here interrupted the conversation by saying abruptly i am a townsman of mr stantons and it is my opinion that he has impoverished himself by giving in religious charity  giving in charity exclaimed several voices where did he ever get any thing to give  yet i think i speak within bounds said the old gentleman when i say that he has given more than the amount of two thousand dollars yearly to the support of the gospel in this state and i think i can show it to be so  the eyes of the auditors were now enlarged to their utmost limits while the old gentleman after the fashion of shrewd old gentlemen generally screwed up his mouth in a very dry twist and looked in the fire without saying a word  come now pray tell us how this is said several of the company  well sir said the old man addressing himself to mr c you are a man of business and will perhaps understand the case as i view it you were speaking this evening of lawyer lennox he and your minister were both from my native place and both there and in college your minister was always reckoned the smartest of the two and went ahead in every thing they undertook now you see mr lennox out of his talents and education makes say three thousand a year mr stanton had more talent and more education and might have made even more but by devoting himself to the work of the ministry in your state he gains we will say about four hundred dollars does he not therefore in fact give all the difference between four hundred and three thousand to the cause of religion in this state if during the business season of the year you mr c should devote your whole time to some benevolent enterprise would you not feel that you had virtually given to that enterprise all the money you would otherwise have made instead therefore of calling it a charity for you to subscribe to your ministers support you ought to consider it a very expensive charity for him to devote his existence in preaching to you to bring the gospel to your state he has given up a reasonable prospect of an income of two or three thousand and contents himself with the least sum which will keep soul and body together without the possibility of laying up a cent for his family in case of his sickness and death this sir is what i call giving in charity     the elders feast  a tradition of laodicea   at a certain time in the earlier ages there lived in the city of laodicea a christian elder of some repute named onesiphorus the world had smiled on him and though a christian he was rich and full of honors all men even the heathen spoke well of him for he was a man courteous of speech and mild of manner  his wife a fair ionian lady but half reclaimed from idolatry though baptized and accredited as a member of the christian church still lingered lovingly on the confines of old heathenism and if she did not believe still cherished with pleasure the poetic legends of apollo and venus of jove and diana  a large and fair family of sons and daughters had risen around these parents but their education had been much after the rudiments of this world and not after christ though according to the customs of the church they were brought to the font of baptism and sealed in the name of the father and the son and holy ghost and although daily instead of libations to the penates or flower offerings to diana and juno the name of jesus was invoked yet the spirit of jesus was wanting the chosen associates of all these children as they grew older were among the heathen and daily they urged their parents by their entreaties to conform in one thing after another to heathen usage why should we be singular mother said the darkeyed myrrah as she bound her hair and arranged her dress after the fashion of the girls in the temple of venus why may we not wear the golden ornaments and images which have been consecrated to heathen goddesses said the sprightly thalia surely none others are to be bought and are we to do altogether without and why may we not be at feasts where libations are made to apollo or jupiter said the sons so long as we do not consent to it or believe in it will our faith be shaken thereby how are we ever to reclaim the heathen if we do not mingle among them said another son did not our master eat with publicans and sinners  it was however to be remarked that no conversions of the heathen to christianity ever took place through the means of these complying sons and daughters or any of the number who followed their example instead of withdrawing any from the confines of heathenism they themselves were drawn so nearly over that in certain situations and circumstances they would undoubtedly have been ranked among them by any but a most scrutinizing observer if any in the city of laodicea were ever led to unite themselves with jesus it was by means of a few who observed the full simplicity of the ancient faith and who though honest tender and courteous in all their dealings with the heathen still went not a step with them in conformity to any of their customs  in time though the family we speak of never broke off from the christian church yet if you had been in it you might have heard much warm and earnest conversation about things that took place at the baths or in feasts to various divinities but if any one spoke of jesus there was immediately a cold silence a decorous chilling respectful pause after which the conversation with a bound flew back into the old channel again                                       it was now night and the house of onesiphorus the elder was blazing with torches alive with music and all the hurry and stir of a sumptuous banquet all the wealth and fashion of laodicea were there christian and heathen and all that the classic voluptuousness of oriental greece could give to shed enchantment over the scene was there in ancient times the festivals of christians in laodicea had been regulated in the spirit of the command of jesus as recorded by luke whose classical greek had made his the established version in asia minor and thou when thou makest a feast call not thy friends and thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbors lest they also bid thee and a recompense be made thee but when thou makest a feast call the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just  that very day before the entertainment had this passage been quoted in the ears of the family by cleon the youngest son who different from all his family had cherished in his bosom the simplicity of the old belief  how ridiculous how absurd had been the reply of the more thoughtless members of the family when cleon cited the above passage as in point to the evenings entertainment the darkeyed mother looked reproof on the levity of the younger children and decorously applauded the passage which she said had no application to the matter in hand  but mother even if the passage be not literally taken it must mean something what did the lord jesus intend by it if we christians may make entertainments with all the parade and expense of our heathen neighbors and thus spend the money that might be devoted to charity what does this passage mean  your father gives in charity as handsomely as any christian in laodicea said his mother warmly  nay mother that may be but i bethink me now of two or three times when means have been wanting for the relieving of the poor and the ransoming of captives and the support of apostles when we have said that we could give no more  my son said his mother you do not understand the ways of the world  nay how should he said thalia shut up day and night with that old papyrus of st luke and pauls epistles one may have too much of a good thing  but does not the holy paul say be not conformed to this world  certainly said the elder that means that we should be baptized and not worship in the heathen temples  my dear son said his mother you intend well doubtless but you have not sufficient knowledge of life to estimate our relations to society entertainments of this sort are absolutely necessary to sustain our position in the world if we accept we must return them  but not to dwell on this conversation let us suppose ourselves in the rooms now glittering with lights and gay with every costly luxury of wealth and taste here were statues to diana and apollo and to the household junonot meant for worshipof course notbut simply to conform to the general usages of good society and so far had this complaisance been carried that the shrine of a peerless venus was adorned with garlands and votive offerings and an exquisitely wrought silver censer diffused its perfume on the marble altar in front this complaisance on the part of some of the younger members of the family drew from the elder a gentle remonstrance as having an unseemly appearance for those bearing the christian name but they readily answered has not paul said we know that an idol is nothing where is the harm of an elegant statue considered merely as a consummate work of art as for the flowers are they not simply the most appropriate ornament and where is the harm of burning exquisite perfume and is it worse to burn it in one place than another  upon my sword said one of the heathen guests as he wandered through the gay scene how liberal and accommodating these christians are becoming except in a few small matters in the temple they seem to be with us entirely  ah said another it was not so years back nothing was heard among them then but prayers and alms and visits to the poor and sick and when they met together in their feasts there was so much of their talk of christ and such singing of hymns and prayer that one of us found himself quite out of place  yes said an old man present in those days i quite bethought me of being some day a christian but look you they are grown so near like us now it is scarce worth ones while to change a little matter of ceremony in the temple and offering incense to jesus instead of jupiter when all else is the same can make small odds in a man  but now the ancient legend goes on to say that in the midst of that gay and brilliant evening a stranger of remarkable appearance and manners was noticed among the throng none knew him or whence he came he mingled not in the mirth and seemed to recognize no one present though he regarded all that was passing with a peculiar air of still and earnest attention and wherever he moved his calm penetrating gaze seemed to diffuse a singular uneasiness about him now his eye was fixed with a quiet scrutiny on the idolatrous statues with their votive adornmentsnow it followed earnestly the young forms that were wreathing in the graceful waves of the dance and then he turned towards the tables loaded with every luxury and sparkling with wines where the devotion to bacchus became more than poetic fiction and as he gazed a high indignant sorrow seemed to overshadow the calmness of his majestic face when in thoughtless merriment some of the gay company sought to address him they found themselves shrinking involuntarily from the soft piercing eye and trembling at the low sweet tones in which he replied what he spoke was brief but there was a gravity and tender wisdom in it that strangely contrasted with the frivolous scene and awakened unwonted ideas of heavenly purity even in thoughtless and dissipated minds  the only one of the company who seemed to seek his society was the youngest the fair little child isa she seemed as strangely attracted towards him as others were repelled and when unsolicited in the frank confidence of childhood she pressed to his side and placed her little hand in his the look of radiant compassion and tenderness which beamed down from those eyes was indeed glorious to behold yet here and there as he glided among the crowd he spoke in the ear of some christian words which though soft and low seemed to have a mysterious and startling power for one after another pensive abashed and confounded they drew aside from the gay scene and seemed lost in thought that strangerwho was he who the inquiry passed from mouth to mouth and one and another who had listened to his low earnest tones looked on each other with a troubled air ere long he had glided hither and thither in the crowd he had spoken in the ear of every christianand suddenly again he was gone and they saw him no more each had felt the heart thrill withineach spirit had vibrated as if the finger of its creator had touched it and shrunk conscious as if an omniscient eye were upon it each heart was stirred from its depths vain sophistries worldly maxims making the false look true all appeared to rise and clear away like a mist and at once each one seemed to see as god sees the true state of the inner world the true motive and reason of action and in the instinctive pause that passed through the company the banquet was broken up and deserted  and what if their god were present said one of the heathen members of the company next day why did they all look so blank a most favorable omen we should call it to have ones patron divinity at a feast  besides said another these christians hold that their god is always every where present so at most they have but had their eyes opened to see him who is always there                                       what is practically the meaning of the precept be not conformed to the world in its everyday results it presents many problems difficult of solution there are so many shades and blendings of situation and circumstances so many things innocent and graceful in themselves which like flowers and incense on a heathen altar become unchristian only through position and circumstances that the most honest and wellintentioned are often perplexed  that we must conform in some things is conceded yet the whole tenor of the new testament shows that this conformity must have its limitsthat christians are to be transformed so as to exhibit to the world a higher and more complete style of life and thus prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god  but in many particulars as to style of living and modes of social intercourse there can be no definite rules laid down and no christian can venture to judge another by his standard  one christian condemns dress adornment and the whole application of taste to the usages of life as a sinful waste of time and money another perceiving in every work of god a love and appreciation of the beautiful believes that there is a sphere in which he is pleased to see the same trait in his children if the indulgence do not become excessive and thus interfere with higher duties  one condemns all time and expense laid out in social visiting as so much waste another remembers that jesus when just entering on the most vast and absorbing work turned aside to attend a wedding feast and wrought his first miracle to enhance its social enjoyment again there are others who because some indulgence of taste and some exercise for the social powers are admissible go all lengths in extravagance and in company dress and the externals of life  in the same manner with regard to style of life and social entertainmentmost of the items which go to constitute what is called style of living or the style of particular parties may be in themselves innocent and yet they may be so interwoven and combined with evils that the whole effect shall be felt to be decidedly unchristian both by christians and the world how then shall the welldisposed person know where to stop and how to strike the just medium  we know of but one safe rule read the life of jesus with attentionstudy itinquire earnestly with yourself what sort of a person in thought in feeling in action was my saviorlive in constant sympathy and communion with himand there will be within a kind of instinctive rule by which to try all things a young man who was to be exposed to the temptations of one of the most dissipated european capitals carried with him his fathers picture and hung it in his apartment before going out to any of the numerous resorts of the city he was accustomed to contemplate this picture and say to himself would my father wish to see me in the place to which i am going and thus was he saved from many a temptation in like manner the christian who has always by his side the beautiful ideal of his savior finds it a holy charm by which he is gently restrained from all that is unsuitable to his profession he has but to inquire of any scene or employment should i be well pleased to meet my savior there would the trains of thought i should there fall into the state of mind that would there be induced be such as would harmonize with an interview with him thus protected and defended social enjoyment might be like that of mary and john and the disciples when under the mild approving eye of the son of god they shared the festivities of cana     little fred the canal boy   part i  in the outskirts of the little town of toledo in ohio might be seen a small onestory cottage whose external architecture no way distinguished it from dozens of other residences of the poor by which it was surrounded but over this dwelling a presiding air of sanctity and neatness of quiet and repose marked it out as different from every other  the little patch before the door instead of being a loafing ground for swine and a receptacle of litter and filth was trimly set with flowers weeded watered and fenced with dainty care the scarlet bignonia clambered over the mouldering logs of the sides shrouding their roughness in its gorgeous mantle of green and crimson and the good oldfashioned morning glory laced across the window unfolded every day tints whose beauty though cheap and common the finest french milliner might in vain seek to rival  when in travelling the western country you meet such a dwelling do you not instinctively know what you shall see inside of it do you not seem to see the trimlysanded floor the wellkept furniture the snowy muslin curtain are you not sure that on a neat stand you shall see as on an altar the dear old family bible brought like the ancient ark of the covenant into the far wilderness and ever overshadowed as a bright cloud with remembered prayers and counsels of father and mother in a far off new england home  and in this cottage there was such a bible brought from the wild hills of new hampshire and its middle page recorded the marriage of james sandford to mary irving and alas after it another record traced in a trembling handthe death of james sandford at toledo and this fair thin woman in the black dress with soft brown hair parted over a pale forehead with calm patient blue eyes and fading cheek is the once energetic buoyant lighthearted new hampshire girl who has brought with her the strongest religious faith the active practical knowledge the skilful welltrained hand and clear head with which cold new england portions her daughters she had left all and come to the western wilds with no other capital than her husbands manly heart and active brainhe young strong full of hope prompt energetic and skilled to acquireshe careful prudent steady no less skilled to save and between the two no better firm for acquisition and prospective success could be desired every body prophesied that james sandford would succeed and mary heard these praises with a quiet exultation but alas that whole capital of hersthat one strong young heart that ready helpful handtwo weeks of the countrys fever sufficed to lay them cold and low forever  and mary yet lived with her babe in her arms and one bright little boy by her side and this boy is our little browneyed fredthe hero of our story but few years had rolled over his curly head when he first looked weeping and wondering on the face of death ah one look on that awful face adds years at once to the age of the heart and little fred felt manly thoughts aroused in him by the cold stillness of his father and the deep calm anguish of his mother  o mamma dont cry so dont said the little fellow i am alive and i can take care of you dear mamma i pray for you every day and mary was comforted even in her tears and thought as she looked into those clear loving brown eyes that her little intercessor would not plead in vain for saith jesus their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven  in a few days she learned to look her sorrows calmly in the face like a brave true woman as she was she was a widow and out of the sudden wreck of her husbands plans but a pittance remained to her and she cast about with busy hand and head for some means to eke it out she took in sewingshe took in washing and ironing and happy did the young exquisite deem himself whose shirts came with such faultless plaits such snowy freshness from the slender hands of mary with that matchless gift which old yankee housewives call faculty mary kept together all the ends of her ravelled skein of life and began to make them wind smoothly her baby was the neatest of all babies as it was assuredly the prettiest and her little fred the handiest and most universal genius of all boys it was fred that could wring out all the stockings and hang out all the small clothes that tended the baby by night and by day that made her a wagon out of an old soap box in which he drew her in triumph and at their meals he stood reverently in his fathers place and with folded hands repeated bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his mercies and his mothers heart responded amen to the simple prayer then he learned with manifold puffing and much haggling to saw wood quite decently and to swing an axe almost as big as himself in wood splitting and he ran of errands and did business with an air of bustling importance that was edifying to see he knew the prices of lard butter and dried apples as well as any man about and as the storekeeper approvingly told him was a smart chap at a bargain fred grew three inches higher the moment he heard it  in the evenings after the baby was asleep fred sat by his mother with slate and book deep in the mysteries of reading writing and ciphering and then the mother and son talked over their little plans and hallowed their nightly rest by prayer and when before retiring his mother knelt with him by his little bed and prayed the child often sobbed with a strange emotion for which he could give no reason something there is in the voice of real prayer that thrills a childs heart even before he understands it the holy tones are a kind of heavenly music and far off in distant years the callous and worldly man often thrills to his hearts core when some turn of life recalls to him his mothers prayer  so passed the first years of the life of fred meanwhile his little sister had come to toddle about the cottage floor full of insatiable and immeasurable schemes of mischief it was she that upset the clothes basket and pulled over the molasses pitcher on to her own astonished head and with incredible labor upset every pail of water that by momentary thoughtlessness was put within reach it was she that was found stuffing poor solemn old pussy head first into the water jar that wiped up the floor with her mothers freshlyironed clothes and jabbered meanwhile in most unexampled babylonish dialect her own vindications and explanations of these misdemeanors every day her mother declared that she must begin to get that child into some kind of order but still the merry little curly pate contemned law and order and laughed at all ideas of retributive justice and fred and his mother laughed and deplored in the same invariable succession the various direful results of her activity and enterprise  but still as mary toiled on heavy cares weighed down her heart her boy grew larger and larger and her own health grew feebler in proportion as it needed to be stronger sometimes a whole week at a time found her scarce able to crawl from her bed shaking with ague or burning with fever and when there is little or nothing with which to replace them how fast food seems to be consumed and clothing to be worn out and so at length it came to pass that notwithstanding the labors of the most tireless of needles and the cutting clipping and contriving of the most ingenious of hands the poor mother was forced to own to herself that her darlings looked really shabby and kind neighbors one by one hinted and said that she must do something with her boythat he was old enough to earn his own living and the same idea occurred to the spirited little fellow himself  he had often been along by the side of the canal and admired the horses for between a horse and fred there was a perfect magnetic sympathy and no lot in life looked to him so bright and desirable as to be able to sit on a horse and drive all day long and when captain w pleased with the boys bright face and prompt motions sought to enlist him as one of his drivers he found a delighted listener if he could only persuade mother there was nothing like it for many nights after the matter was proposed mary only cried and all freds eloquence and his brave promises of never doing any thing wrong and being the best of all supposable boys were insufficient to console her  every time she looked at the neat pure little bed beside her own that bed hallowed by so many prayers and saw her boy with his glowing cheeks and long and dark lashes sleeping so innocently and trustfully her heart died within her as she thought of a dirty berth on the canal boat and rough boatmen swearing chewing tobacco and drinking and should she take her darling from her bosom and throw him out among these ah happy mother look at your little son of ten years and ask yourself if you were obliged to do this should you not tremble give god thanks therefore you can hold your child to your heart till he is old enough to breast the dark wave of life the poor must throw them in to sink or swim as happens not for easenot for freedom from carenot for commodious house and fine furniture and all that competence gives should you thank god so much as for this that you are able to shelter guide restrain and educate the helpless years of your children  mary yielded at last to that master who can subdue all willsnecessity sorrowfully yet with hope in god she made up the little package for her boy and communicated to him with renewed minuteness her parting counsels and instructions fred was bright and full of hope he was sure of the great point about which his mothers anxiety clusteredhe should be a good boy he knew he should he never should swear he never should touch a drop of spirits no matter who asked himthat he was sure of then he liked horses so much he should ride all day and never get tired and he would come back and bring her some money and so the boy and his mother parted  physical want or hardship is not the great thing which a mother need dread for her child in our country there is scarce any situation in america where a child would not receive as a matter of course good food and shelter nor is he often overworked in these respects a general spirit of good nature is perceptible among employers so that our fred meets none of the harrowing adventures of an oliver twist in his new situation  to be sure he soon found it was not as good fun to ride a horse hour after hour and day after day as it was to prance and caper about for the first few minutes at first his back ached and his little hands grew stiff and he wished his turn were out hours before the time but time mended all this he grew healthy and strong and though occasionally kicked and tumbled about rather unceremoniously by the rough men among whom he had been cast yet as they said he was a chap that always came down on his feet throw him which way you would and for this reason he was rather a favorite among them the fat black cook who piqued himself particularly on making corn cake and singing methodist hymns in a style of unsurpassed excellence took fred into particular favor and being equally at home in kitchen and camp meeting lore not only put by for him various dainty scraps and fragments but also undertook to further his moral education by occasional luminous exhortations and expositions of scripture which somewhat puzzled poor fred and greatly amused the deck hands  often after driving all day fred sat on deck beside his fat friend while the boat glided on through miles and miles of solemn unbroken old woods and heard him sing about de new jerusalem about good old moses and paul and silas with a kind of dreamy wild pleasure to be sure it was not like his mothers singing but then it had a sort of good sound although he never could very precisely make out the meaning  as to being a good boy fred to do him justice certainly tried to very considerable purpose he did not swear as yet although he heard so much of it daily that it seemed the most natural thing in the world and although one and another of the hands often offered him tempting portions of their potations as they said to make a man of him yet fred faithfully kept his little temperance pledge to his mother many a weary hour as he rode and rode and rode through hundreds of miles of unvarying forest he strengthened his good resolutions by thoughts of home and its scenes  there sat his mother there stood his own little bed there his baby sister toddling about in her night gown and he repeated the prayers and sung the hymns his mother taught him and thus the good seed still grew within him in fact with no very distinguished adventures fred achieved the journey to cincinnati and back and proud of his laurels and with his wages in his pocket found himself again at the familiar door  poor fred a sad surprise awaited him the elfin shadow that was once ever flitting about the dwelling was gone the little pattering footsteps the tireless busy fingers all gone and his mother paler sicker sadder than before clasped him to her bosom and called him her only comfort fred had brought a pocket full of sugar plums and the brightest of yellow oranges to his little pet alas how mournfully he regarded them now  how little do we realize when we hear that such and such a poor woman has lost her baby how much is implied to her in the loss she is poor she must work hard the child was a great addition to her cares and even pitying neighbors say it was better for her poor thing and for the child too but perhaps this very child was the only flower of a life else wholly barren and desolate there is often even in the humblest and most uncultured nature an undefined longing and pining for the beautiful it expresses itself sometimes in the love of birds and of flowers and one sees the rosebush or the canary bird in a dwelling from which is banished every trace of luxury but the little child with its sweet spiritual eyes its thousand birdlike tones its prattling endearing ways its guileless loving heart is a full and perfect answer to the most ardent craving of the soul it is a whole little eden of itself and the poor woman whose whole life else is one dreary waste of toil clasps her babe to her bosom and feels proud and rich and happy truly said the son of god of such are the kingdom of heaven  poor mary how glad she was to see her boy againmost of all that they could talk together of their lost one how they discoursed for hours about her how they cried together over the little faded bonnet that once could scarce be kept for a moment on the busy curly head how they treasured as relics the small finger marks on the doors and consecrated with sacred care even the traces of her merry mischief about the cottage and never tired of telling over to each other with smiles and tears the record of the past gleesome pranks  but the fact was that mary herself was fast wearing away she had borne up bravely against life but she had but a gentle nature and gradually she sank from day to day fred was her patient unwearied nurse and neighborsnever wanting in such kindnesses as they can understandsupplied her few wants the child never wanted for food and the mantle shelf was filled with infallible specifics each one of which was able according to the showing to insure perfect recovery in every case whatever and yet strange to tell she still declined at last one still autumn morning fred awoke and started at the icy coldness of the hand clasped in his own he looked in his mothers face it was sweet and calm as that of a sleeping infant but he knew in his heart that she was dead   part ii  months afterwards a cold december day found fred turned loose in the streets of cincinnati since his mothers death he had driven on the canal boat but now the boat was to lie by for winter and the hands of course turned loose to find employment till spring fred was told that he must look up a place every body was busy about their own affairs and he must shift for himself and so with half his wages in his pocket and promises for the rest he started to seek his fortune  it was a cold cheerless grayeyed day with an air that pinched fingers and toes and seemed to penetrate ones clothes like snow watersuch a day as it needs the brightest fire and the happiest heart to get along at all with and unluckily fred had neither christmas was approaching and all the shops had put on their holiday dresses the confectioners windows were glittering with sparkling pyramids of candy with frosted cake and unfading fruits and flowers of the very best of sugar there too was santa claus large as life with queer wrinkled visage and back bowed with the weight of all desirable knickknacks going down chimney in sight of all the children of cincinnati who gathered around the shop with constantlyrenewed acclamations on all sides might be seen the little people thronging gazing chattering while anxious papas and mammas in the shops were gravely discussing tin trumpets dolls spades wheelbarrows and toy wagons  fred never had heard of the man who said how sad a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes but he felt something very like it as he moved through the gay and bustling streets where every body seemed to be finding what they wanted but himself  he had determined to keep up a stout heart but in spite of himself all this bustling show and merriment made him feel sadder and sadder and lonelier and lonelier he knocked and rang at door after door but nobody wanted a boy nobody ever does want a boy when a boy is wanting a place he got tired of ringing door bells and tried some of the shops no they didnt want him one said if he was bigger he might do another wanted to know if he could keep accounts one thought that the man around the corner wanted a boy and when fred got there he had just engaged one weary disappointed and discouraged he sat down by the iron railing that fenced a showy house and thought what he should do it was almost five in the afternoon cold dismal leadengray was the skythe darkness already coming on fred sat listlessly watching the great snow feathers as they slowly sailed down from the sky now he heard gay laughs as groups of merry children passed and then he started as he saw some woman in a black bonnet and thought she looked like his mother but all passed and nobody looked at him nobody wanted him nobody noticed him  just then a patter of little feet was heard behind him on the flagstones and a soft baby voice said how do oo do fred turned in amazement and there stood a plump rosy little creature of about two years with dimpled cheek ruby lips and long fair hair curling about her sweet face she was dressed in a blue pelisse trimmed with swans down and her complexion was so exquisitely fair her eyes so clear and sweet that fred felt almost as if it were an angel the little thing toddled up to him and holding up before him a new wax doll all splendid in silk and lace seemed quite disposed to make his acquaintance fred thought of his lost sister and his eyes filled up with tears the little one put up one dimpled hand to wipe them away while with the other holding up before him the wax doll she said coaxingly no no ky  just then the house door opened and a lady richly dressed darted out exclaiming why mary you little rogue how came you out here then stopping short and looking narrowly on fred she said somewhat sharply whose boy are you and how came you here  im nobodys boy said fred getting up with a bitter choking in his throat my mothers dead i only sat down here to rest me for a while  well run away from here said the lady but the little girl pressed before her mother and jabbering very earnestly in unimaginable english seemed determined to give fred her wax doll in which she evidently thought resided every possible consolation  the lady felt in her pocket and found a quarter which she threw towards fred there my boy that will get you lodging and supper and tomorrow you can find some place to work i dare say and she hurried in with the little girl and shut the door  it was not money that fred wanted just then and he picked up the quarter with a heavy heart the sky looked darker and the street drearier and the cold wind froze the tear on his cheeks as he walked listlessly down the street in the dismal twilight  i can go back to the canal boat and find the cook he thought to himself he told me i might sleep with him tonight if i couldnt find a place and he quickened his steps with this determination just as he was passing a brightlylighted coffee house familiar voices hailed him and fred stopped he would be glad even to see a dog he had ever met before and of course he was glad when two boys old canal boat acquaintances hailed him and invited him into the coffee house the blazing fire was a brave light on that dismal night and the faces of the two boys were full of glee and they began rallying fred on his doleful appearance and insisting on it that he should take something warm with them  fred hesitated a moment but he was tired and desperate and the steaming wellsweetened beverage was too tempting who cares for me thought he and why should i care and down went the first spirituous liquor the boy had ever tasted and in a few moments he felt a wonderful change he was no longer a timid cold disheartened heartsick boy but felt somehow so brave so full of hope and courage that he began to swagger to laugh very loud and to boast in such high terms of the money in his pocket and of his future intentions and prospects that the two boys winked significantly at each other they proposed after sitting a while to walk out and see the shop windows all three of the boys had taken enough to put them to extra merriment but fred who was entirely unused to the stimulant was quite beside himself if they sung he shouted if they laughed he screamed and he thought within himself he never had heard and thought so many witty things as on that very evening at last they fell in with quite a press of boys who were crowding round a confectionery window and as usual in such cases there began an elbowing and scuffling contest for places in which fred was quite conspicuous at last a big boy presumed on his superior size to edge in front of our hero and cut off his prospect and fred without more ado sent him smashing through the shop window there was a general scrabble every one ran for himself and fred never having been used to the business was not very skilful in escaping and of course was caught and committed to an officer who with small ceremony carried him off and locked him up in the watch house from which he was the next morning taken before the mayor and after examination sent to jail  this sobered fred he came to himself as out of a dream and he was overwhelmed with an agony of shame and selfreproach he had broken his promise to his dead motherhe had been drinking and his heart failed him when he thought of the horrors that his mother had always associated with that word and then he was in jailthat place that his mother had always represented as an almost impossible horror the climax of shame and disgrace the next night the poor boy stretched himself on his hard lonely bed and laid under his head his little bundle containing his few clothes and his mothers bible and then sobbed himself to sleep  cold and gray dawned the following morning on little fred as he slowly and heavily awoke and with a bitter chill of despair recalled the events of the last two nights and looked up at the irongrated window and round on the cheerless walls and as if in bitter contrast arose before him an image of his lost homethe neat quiet room the white curtains and snowy floor his mothers bed with his own little cot beside it and his mothers mild blue eyes as they looked upon him only six months ago mechanically he untied the check handkerchief which contained his few clothes and worldly possessions and relics of home  there was the small cleanprinted bible his mother had given him with so many tears on their first parting there was a lock of her soft brown hair there too were a pair of little worn shoes and stockings a babys rattle and a curl of golden hair which he had laid up in memory of his lost little pet fred laid his head down over all these his forlorn treasures and sobbed as if his heart would break  after a while the jailer came in and really seemed affected by the distress of the child and said what he could to console him and in the course of the day as the boy seemed to be so lonesome like he introduced another boy into the room as company for him this was a cruel mercy for while the child was alone with himself and the memories of the past he was if sad at least safe and in a few hours after this new introduction he was neither his new companion was a tall boy of fourteen with small cunning gray eyes to which a slight cast gave an additional expression of shrewdness and drollery he was a young gentleman of great natural talentin a certain linewith very precocious attainments in all that kind of information which a boy gains by running at large for several years in a citys streets without any thing particular to do or any body in particular to obeyany conscience any principle any fear either of god or man we should not say that he had never seen the inside of a church for he had been for various purposes into every one of the city and to every camp meeting for miles around and so much had he profited by these exercises that he could mimic to perfection every minister who had any perceptible peculiarity could caricature every species of psalmsinging and give ludicrous imitations of every form of worship then he was au fait in all coffee house lore and knew the names and qualities of every kind of beverage therein compounded and as to smoking and chewing the first elements of which he mastered when he was about six years old he was now a connoisseur in the higher branches he had been in jail dozens of timesrather liked the fun had served one term on the chaingangnot so bad eithershouldnt mind anotherlearned a good many prime things there  at first fred seemed inclined to shrink from his new associate an instinctive feeling like the warning of an invisible angel seemed to whisper beware but he was alone with a heart full of bitter thoughts and the sight of a fellowface was some comfort then his companion was so dashing so funny so free and easy and seemed to make such a comfortable matter of being in jail that freds heart naturally buoyant began to come up again in his breast dick jones soon drew out of him his simple history as to how he came there and finding that he was a raw hand seemed to feel bound to patronize and take him under his wing he laughed quite heartily at freds story and soon succeeded in getting him to laugh at it too  how strangethe very scenes that in the morning he looked at only with bitter anguish and remorse this noon he was laughing at as good jokesso much for the influence of good society an instinctive feeling soon after dick jones came in led fred to push his little bundle into the farthest corner under the bed far out of sight or inquiry and the same reason led him to suppress all mention of his mother and all the sacred part of his former life he did this more studiously because having once accidentally remarked how his mother used to forbid him certain things the welleducated dick broke out  well for my part i could whip my mother when i want higher than that with a significant gesture  whip your mother exclaimed fred with a face full of horror  to be sure greenie why not precious fun it was in those times i used to slip in and steal the old womans whiskey and sugar when she was just too far over to walk a crackshed throw the tongs at me and id throw the shovel at her and so it went square and square  goethe says somewhere miserable is that man whose mother has not made all other mothers venerable our new acquaintance bade fair to come under this category  freds education under this talented instructor made progress he sat hours and hours laughing at his storiessometimes obscene sometimes profane but always so full of life drollery and mimicry that a more steady head than freds was needed to withstand the contagion dick had been to the theatreknew it all like a book and would take fred there as soon as they got out then he had a firstrate pack of cards and he could teach fred to play and the gay tempters were soon spread out on their bed and fred and his instructor sat hour after hour absorbed in what to him was a new world of interest he soon learned could play for small stakes and felt in himself the first glimmering of that fire which when fully kindled many waters cannot quench nor floods drown  dick was as we said precocious he had the cool eye and steady hand of an experienced gamester and in a few days he won of course all freds little earnings but then he was quite liberal and free with his money he added to their prison fare such various improvements as his abundance of money enabled him to buy he had brought with him the foundation of good cheer in a capacious bottle which emerged the first night from his pocket for he said he never went to jail without his provision then hot water and sugar and lemons and peppermint drops were all forthcoming for money and fred learned once and again and again the fatal secret of hushing conscience and memory and bitter despair in delirious happiness and as dick said was getting to be a right jolly un that would make something yet  and was it all gone all washed away by this sudden wave of evilevery trace of prayer and hope and sacred memory in this poor childs heart no not all for many a night when his tempter slept by his side the child lived over the past again he kneeled in prayer and felt his mothers guardian hand on his head and he wept tears of bitter remorse and wondered at the dread change that had come over him then he dreamed and he saw his mother and sister walking in white fair as angels and would go to them but between him and them was a great gulf fixed which widened and widened and grew darker and darker till he could see them no more and he awoke in utter misery and despair  again and again he resolved in the darkness of the night that tomorrow he would not drink and he would not speak a wicked word and he would not play cards nor laugh at dicks bad stories ah how many such midnight resolves have evil angels sneered at and good ones sighed over for with daylight back comes the old temptation and with it the old mind and with daylight came back the inexorable prison walls which held fred and his successful tempter together  at last he gave himself up no he could not be good with dickthere was no use in tryingand he made no more midnight resolves and drank more freely of the dreadful remedy for unquiet thoughts  and now is fred growing in truth a wicked boy in a little while more and he shall be such a one as you will on no account take under your roof lest he corrupt your own children and yet father mother look at your son of twelve years your bright darling boy and think of him shut up for a month with such a companion in such a cell and ask yourselves if he would be any better  and was there no eye heavenly or earthly to look after this lost one was there no eye which could see through all the traces of sin the yet lingering drops of that baptism and early prayer and watchfulness which consecrated it yes he whose mercy extends to the third and fourth generations of those who love him sent a friend to our poor boy in his last distress  it is one of the most refined and characteristic modifications of christianity that those who are themselves sheltered guarded fenced by good education knowledge and competence appoint and sustain a pastor and guardian in our large cities to be the shepherd of the wandering and lost and of them who in the scripture phrase have none to help justly is he called the city missionary for what is more truly missionary ground in the hospital among the old the sick the friendless the forlornin the prison among the hardened the blasphemingamong the discouraged and despairing still holding with unsteady hand on to some forlorn fragment of virtue and selfrespect goes this missionary to stir the dying embers of good to warn entreat implore to adjure by sacred recollections of father mother and home the fallen wanderers to return he finds friends and places and employment for some and by timely aid and encouragement saves many a one from destruction  in this friendly shape appeared a man of prayer to visit the cell in which fred was confined dick listened to his instructions with cool complacency rolling his tobacco from side to side in his mouth and meditating on him as a subject for some future histrionic exercise of his talent  but his voice was as welcome to poor fred as daylight in a dungeon all the smothered remorse and despair of his heart burst forth in bitter confessions as with many tears he poured forth his story to the friendly man it needs not to prolong our story for now the day has dawned and the hour of release is come  it is not needful to carry our readers through all the steps by which fred was transferred first to the fireside of the friendly missionary and afterwards to the guardian care of a good old couple who resided on a thriving farm not far from cincinnati set free from evil influences the first carefully planted and watered seeds of good began to grow again and he became as a son to the kind family who had adopted him     the canal boat   of all the ways of travelling which obtain among our locomotive nation this said vehicle the canal boat is the most absolutely prosaic and inglorious there is something picturesque nay almost sublime in the lordly march of your wellbuilt highbred steamboat go take your stand on some overhanging bluff where the blue ohio winds its thread of silver or the sturdy mississippi tears its path through unbroken forests and it will do your heart good to see the gallant boat walking the waters with unbroken and powerful tread and like some fabled monster of the wave breathing fire and making the shores resound with its deep respirations then there is something mysterious even awful in the power of steam see it curling up against a blue sky some rosy morninggraceful floating intangible and to all appearance the softest and gentlest of all spiritual things and then think that it is this fairy spirit that keeps all the world alive and hot with motion think how excellent a servant it is doing all sorts of gigantic works like the genii of old and yet if you let slip the talisman only for a moment what terrible advantage it will take of you and you will confess that steam has some claims both to the beautiful and the terrible for our own part when we are down among the machinery of a steamboat in full play we conduct ourself very reverently for we consider it as a very serious neighborhood and every time the steam whizzes with such redhot determination from the escape valve we start as if some of the spirits were after us but in a canal boat there is no power no mystery no danger one cannot blow up one cannot be drowned unless by some special effort one sees clearly all there is in the casea horse a rope and a muddy strip of waterand that is all  did you ever try it reader if not take an imaginary trip with us just for experiment theres the boat exclaims a passenger in the omnibus as we are rolling down from the pittsburg mansion house to the canal where exclaim a dozen of voices and forthwith a dozen heads go out of the window why down there under that bridge dont you see those lights what that little thing exclaims an inexperienced traveller dear me we cant half of us get into it we indeed says some old hand in the business i think youll find it will hold us and a dozen more loads like us impossible say some youll see say the initiated and as soon as you get out you do see and hear too what seems like a general breaking loose from the tower of babel amid a perfect hail storm of trunks boxes valises carpet bags and every describable and indescribable form of what a westerner calls plunder  thats my trunk barks out a big round man thats my bandbox screams a heartstricken old lady in terror for her immaculate sunday caps wheres my little red box i had two carpet bags and amy trunk had a scarlehalloo where are you going with that portmanteau husband husband do see after the large basket and the little hair trunko and the babys little chair go belowgo below for mercys sake my dear ill see to the baggage at last the feminine part of creation perceiving that in this particular instance they gain nothing by public speaking are content to be led quietly under hatches and amusing is the look of dismay which each new comer gives to the confined quarters that present themselves those who were so ignorant of the power of compression as to suppose the boat scarce large enough to contain them and theirs find with dismay a respectable colony of old ladies babies mothers big baskets and carpet bags already established mercy on us says one after surveying the little room about ten feet long and six high where are we all to sleep tonight o me what a sight of children says a young lady in a despairing tone poh says an initiated traveller children scarce any here lets see one the woman in the corner two that child with the bread and butter three and then theres that other woman with two really its quite moderate for a canal boat however we cant tell till they have all come  all for mercys sake you dont say there are any more coming exclaim two or three in a breath they cant come there is not room  notwithstanding the impressive utterance of this sentence the contrary is immediately demonstrated by the appearance of a very corpulent elderly lady with three wellgrown daughters who come down looking about them most complacently entirely regardless of the unchristian looks of the company what a mercy it is that fat people are always good natured  after this follows an indiscriminate raining down of all shapes sizes sexes and agesmen women children babies and nurses the state of feeling becomes perfectly desperate darkness gathers on all faces we shall be smothered we shall be crowded to death we cant stay here are heard faintly from one and another and yet though the boat grows no wider the walls no higher they do live and do stay there in spite of repeated protestations to the contrary truly as sam slick says theres a sight of wear in human natur  but meanwhile the children grow sleepy and divers interesting little duets and trios arise from one part or another of the cabin  hush johnny be a good boy says a pale nursing mamma to a great bristling whiteheaded phenomenon who is kicking very much at large in her lap  i wont be a good boy neither responds johnny with interesting explicitness i want to go to bed and soooo and johnny makes up a mouth as big as a teacup and roars with good courage and his mamma asks him if he ever saw pa do so and tells him that he is mammas dear good little boy and must not make a noise with various observations of the kind which are so strikingly efficacious in such cases meanwhile the domestic concert in other quarters proceeds with vigor mamma im tired bawls a child wheres the babys night gown calls a nurse do take peter up in your lap and keep him still pray get out some biscuits to stop their mouths meanwhile sundry babies strike in con spirito as the music books have it and execute various flourishes the disconsolate mothers sigh and look as if all was over with them and the young ladies appear extremely disgusted and wonder what business women have to be travelling round with babies  to these troubles succeeds the turningout scene when the whole caravan is ejected into the gentlemens cabin that the beds may be made the red curtains are put down and in solemn silence all the last mysterious preparations begin at length it is announced that all is ready forthwith the whole company rush back and find the walls embellished by a series of little shelves about a foot wide each furnished with a mattress and bedding and hooked to the ceiling by a very suspiciously slender cord direful are the ruminations and exclamations of inexperienced travellers particularly young ones as they eye these very equivocal accommodations what sleep up there i wont sleep on one of those top shelves i know the cords will certainly break the chambermaid here takes up the conversation and solemnly assures them that such an accident is not to be thought of at all that it is a natural impossibilitya thing that could not happen without an actual miracle and since it becomes increasingly evident that thirty ladies cannot all sleep on the lowest shelf there is some effort made to exercise faith in this doctrine nevertheless all look on their neighbors with fear and trembling and when the stout lady talks of taking a shelf she is most urgently pressed to change places with her alarmed neighbor below points of location being after a while adjusted comes the last struggle every body wants to take off a bonnet or look for a shawl to find a cloak or get a carpet bag and all set about it with such zeal that nothing can be done maam youre on my foot says one will you please to move maam says somebody who is gasping and struggling behind you move you echo indeed i should be very glad to but i dont see much prospect of it chambermaid calls a lady who is struggling among a heap of carpet bags and children at one end of the cabin maam echoes the poor chambermaid who is wedged fast in a similar situation at the other wheres my cloak chambermaid id find it maam if i could move chambermaid my basket chambermaid my parasol chambermaid my carpet bag mamma they push me so hush child crawl under there and lie still till i can undress you at last however the various distresses are over the babies sink to sleep and even that muchenduring being the chambermaid seeks out some corner for repose tired and drowsy you are just sinking into a doze when bang goes the boat against the sides of a lock ropes scrape men run and shout and up fly the heads of all the top shelfites who are generally the more juvenile and airy part of the company  whats that whats that flies from mouth to mouth and forthwith they proceed to awaken their respective relations mother aunt hannah do wake up what is this awful noise o only a lock pray be still groan out the sleepy members from below  a lock exclaim the vivacious creatures ever on the alert for information and what is a lock pray  dont you know what a lock is you silly creatures do lie down and go to sleep  but say there aint any danger in a lock is there respond the querists danger exclaims a deaf old lady poking up her head whats the matter there haint nothin burst has there no no no exclaim the provoked and despairing opposition party who find that there is no such thing as going to sleep till they have made the old lady below and the young ladies above understand exactly the philosophy of a lock after a while the conversation again subsides again all is still you hear only the trampling of horses and the rippling of the rope in the water and sleep again is stealing over you you doze you dream and all of a sudden you are started by a cry chambermaid wake up the lady that wants to be set ashore up jumps chambermaid and up jump the lady and two children and forthwith form a committee of inquiry as to ways and means wheres my bonnet says the lady half awake and fumbling among the various articles of that name i thought i hung it up behind the door cant you find it says poor chambermaid yawning and rubbing her eyes o yes here it is says the lady and then the cloak the shawl the gloves the shoes receive each a separate discussion at last all seems ready and they begin to move off when lo peters cap is missing now where can it be soliloquizes the lady i put it right here by the table leg maybe it got into some of the berths at this suggestion the chambermaid takes the candle and goes round deliberately to every berth poking the light directly in the face of every sleeper here it is she exclaims pulling at something black under one pillow no indeed those are my shoes says the vexed sleeper maybe its here she resumes darting upon something dark in another berth no thats my bag responds the occupant the chambermaid then proceeds to turn over all the children on the floor to see if it is not under them in the course of which process they are most agreeably waked up and enlivened and when every body is broad awake and most uncharitably wishing the cap and peter too at the bottom of the canal the good lady exclaims well if this isnt lucky here i had it safe in my basket all the time and she departs amid thewhat shall i sayexecrationsof the whole company ladies though they be  well after this follows a hushing up and wiping up among the juvenile population and a series of remarks commences from the various shelves of a very edifying and instructive tendency one says that the woman did not seem to know where any thing was another says that she has waked them all up a third adds that she has waked up all the children too and the elderly ladies make moral reflections on the importance of putting your things where you can find thembeing always ready which observations being delivered in an exceedingly doleful and drowsy tone form a sort of subbass to the lively chattering of the upper shelfites who declare that they feel quite wide awakethat they dont think they shall go to sleep again tonightand discourse over every thing in creation until you heartily wish you were enough related to them to give them a scolding  at last however voice after voice drops off you fall into a most refreshing slumber it seems to you that you sleep about a quarter of an hour when the chambermaid pulls you by the sleeve will you please to get up maam we want to make the beds you start and stare sure enough the night is gone so much for sleeping on board canal boats  let us not enumerate the manifold perplexities of the morning toilet in a place where every lady realizes most forcibly the condition of the old woman who lived under a broom all she wanted was elbow room let us not tell how one glass is made to answer for thirty fair faces one ewer and vase for thirty lavations andtell it not in gathone towel for a company let us not intimate how ladies shoes have in a night clandestinely slid into the gentlemens cabin and gentlemens boots elbowed or rather toed their way among ladies gear nor recite the exclamations after runaway property that are heard i cant find nothin of johnnys shoe heres a shoe in the water pitcheris this it my side combs are gone exclaims a nymph with dishevelled curls massy do look at my bonnet exclaims an old lady elevating an article crushed into as many angles as there are pieces in a minced pie i never did sleep so much together in my life echoes a poor little french lady whom despair has driven into talking english  but our shortening paper warns us not to prolong our catalogue of distresses beyond reasonable bounds and therefore we will close with advising all our friends who intend to try this way of travelling for pleasure to take a good stock both of patience and clean towels with them for we think that they will find abundant need for both     feeling   there is one way of studying human nature which surveys mankind only as a set of instruments for the accomplishment of personal plans there is another which regards them simply as a gallery of pictures to be admired or laughed at as the caricature or the beau ideal predominates a third way regards them as human beings having hearts that can suffer and enjoy that can be improved or be ruined as those who are linked to us by mysterious reciprocal influences by the common dangers of a present existence and the uncertainties of a future one as presenting wherever we meet them claims on our sympathy and assistance  those who adopt the last method are interested in human beings not so much by present attractions as by their capabilities as intelligent immortal beings by a high belief of what every mind may attain in an immortal existence by anxieties for its temptations and dangers and often by the perception of errors and faults which threaten its ruin the first two modes are adopted by the great mass of society the last is the office of those few scattered stars in the sky of life who look down on its dark selfishness to remind us that there is a world of light and love  to this class did he belong whose rising and setting on earth were for the healing of the nations and to this class has belonged many a pure and devoted spirit like him shining to cheer like him fading away into the heavens to this class many a one wishes to belong who has an eye to distinguish the divinity of virtue without the resolution to attain it who while they sweep along with the selfish current of society still regret that society is not differentthat they themselves are not different if this train of thought has no very particular application to what follows it was nevertheless suggested by it and of its relevancy others must judge  look into this school room it is a warm sleepy afternoon in july there is scarcely air enough to stir the leaves of the tall buttonwood tree before the door or to lift the loose leaves of the copy book in the window the sun has been diligently shining into those curtainless west windows ever since three oclock upon those blotted and mangled desks and those decrepit and tottering benches and that great arm chair the high place of authority  you can faintly hear about the door the craw craw of some neighboring chickens which have stepped around to consider the dinner baskets and pick up the crumbs of the noons repast for a marvel the busy school is still because in truth it is too warm to stir you will find nothing to disturb your meditation on character for you cannot hear the beat of those little hearts nor the bustle of all those busy thoughts  now look around who of these is the most interesting is it that tall slender hazeleyed boy with a glance like a falcon whose elbows rest on his book as he gazes out on the great buttonwood tree and is calculating how he shall fix his squirrel trap when school is out or is it that curlyheaded little rogue who is shaking with repressed laughter at seeing a chicken roll over in a dinner basket or is it that arch boy with black eyelashes and deep mischievous dimple in his cheeks who is slyly fixing a fish hook to the skirts of the masters coat yet looking as abstracted as archimedes whenever the good man turns his head that way no these are intelligent bright beautiful but it is not these  perhaps then it is that sleepy little girl with golden curls and a mouth like a halfblown rosebud see the small brass thimble has fallen to the floor her patchwork drops from her lap her blue eyes close like two sleepy violets her little head is nodding and she sinks on her sisters shoulder surely it is she no it is not  but look in that corner do you see that boy with such a gloomy countenanceso vacant yet so ill natured he is doing nothing and he very seldom does any thing he is surly and gloomy in his looks and actions he never showed any more aptitude for saying or doing a pretty thing than his straight white hair does for curling he is regularly blamed and punished every day and the more he is blamed and punished the worse he grows none of the boys and girls in school will play with him or if they do they will be sorry for it and every day the master assures him that he does not know what to do with him and that he makes him more trouble than any boy in school with similar judicious information that has a striking tendency to promote improvement that is the boy to whom i apply the title of the most interesting one  he is interesting because he is not pleasing because he has bad habits because he does wrong because under present influences he is always likely to do wrong he is interesting because he has become what he is now by means of the very temperament which often makes the noblest virtue it is feeling acuteness of feeling which has given that countenance its expression that character its moroseness  he has no father and that longsuffering friend his mother is gone too yet he has relations and kind ones too and in the compassionate language of worldly charity it may be said of him he would have nothing of which to complain if he would only behave himself  his little sister is always bright always pleasant and cheerful and his friends say why should not he be so too he is in exactly the same circumstances no he is not in one circumstance they differ he has a mind to feel and remember every thing that can pain she can feel and remember but little if you blame him he is exasperated gloomy and cannot forget it if you blame her she can say she has done wrong in a moment and all is forgotten her mind can no more be wounded than the little brook where she loves to play the bright waters close again and smile and prattle as merry as before  which is the most desirable temperament it would be hard to say the power of feeling is necessary for all that is noble in man and yet it involves the greatest risks they who catch at happiness on the bright surface of things secure a portion such as it is with more certainty those who dive for it in the waters of deeper feeling if they succeed will bring up pearls and diamonds but if they sink they are lost forever  but now comes saturday and school is just out can any one of my readers remember the rapturous prospect of a long bright saturday afternoon where are you going will you come and see me we are going a fishing let us go a strawberrying may be heard rising from the happy group but no one comes near the illhumored james and the little party going to visit his sister wish james was out of the way he sees every motion hears every whisper knows suspects feels it all and turns to go home more sullen and ill tempered than common the world looks darknobody loves himand he is told that it is all his own fault and that makes the matter still worse  when the little party arrive he is suspicious and irritable and of course soon excommunicated then as he stands in disconsolate anger looking over the garden fence at the gay group making dandelion chains and playing baby house under the trees he wonders why he is not like other children he wishes he were different and yet he does not know what to do he looks around and every thing is blooming and bright his little bed of flowers is even brighter and sweeter than ever before and a new rose is just opening on his rosebush  there goes pussy too racing and scampering with little ellen after her in among the alleys and flowers and the birds are singing in the trees and the soft winds brush the blossoms of the sweet pea against his cheek and yet though all nature looks on him so kindly he is wretched  let us now change the scene why is that crowded assembly so attentiveso silent who is speaking it is our old friend the little disconsolate schoolboy but his eyes are flashing with intellect his face fervent with emotion his voice breathes like music and every mind is enchained  again it is a splendid sunset and yonder enthusiast meets it face to face as a friend he is silentrapthappy he feels the poetry which god has written he is touched by it as god meant that the feeling spirit should be touched  again he is watching by the bed of sickness and it is blessed to have such a watcher anticipating every want relieving not in a cold uninterested way but with the quick perceptions the tenderness the gentleness of an angel  follow him into the circle of friendship and why is he so loved and trusted why can you so easily tell to him what you can say to no one else besides why is it that all around him feel that he can understand appreciate be touched by all that touches them  and when heaven uncloses its doors of light when all its knowledge its purity its bliss rises on the eye and passes into the soul who then will be looked on as the one who might be enviedhe who can or he who cannot feel     the seamstress      few save the poor feel for the poor       the rich know not how hard     it is to be of needful food       and needful rest debarred      their paths are paths of plenteousness       they sleep on silk and down     they never think how wearily       the weary head lies down      they never by the window sit       and see the gay pass by     yet take their weary work again       and with a mournful eye      l e l   however fine and elevated in a sentimental point of view may have been the poetry of this gifted writer we think we have never seen any thing from this source that ought to give a better opinion of her than the little ballad from which the above verses are taken  they show that the accomplished authoress possessed not merely a knowledge of the dreamy ideal wants of human beings but the more pressing and homely ones which the fastidious and poetical are often the last to appreciate the sufferings of poverty are not confined to those of the common squalid every day inured to hardships and ready with open hand to receive charity let it come to them as it will there is another class on whom it presses with still heavier powerthe generous the decent the selfrespecting who have struggled with their lot in silence bearing all things hoping all things and willing to endure all things rather than breathe a word of complaint or to acknowledge even to themselves that their own efforts will not be sufficient for their own necessities  pause with me a while at the door of yonder room whose small window overlooks a little court below it is inhabited by a widow and her daughter dependent entirely on the labors of the needle and those other slight and precarious resources which are all that remain to woman when left to struggle her way through the world alone it contains all their small earthly store and there is scarce an article of its little stock of furniture that has not been thought of and toiled for and its price calculated over and over again before every thing could be made right for its purchase every article is arranged with the utmost neatness and care nor is the most costly furniture of a fashionable parlor more sedulously guarded from a scratch or a rub than is that brightlyvarnished bureau and that neat cherry tea table and bedstead the floor too boasted once a carpet but old time has been busy with it picking a hole here and making a thin place there and though the old fellow has been followed up by the most indefatigable zeal in darning the marks of his mischievous fingers are too plain to be mistaken it is true a kindly neighbor has given a bit of faded baize which has been neatly clipped and bound and spread down over an entirely unmanageable hole in front of the fireplace and other places have been repaired with pieces of different colors and yet after all it is evident that the poor carpet is not long for this world  but the best face is put upon every thing the little cupboard in the corner that contains a few china cups and one or two antiquated silver spoons relics of better days is arranged with jealous neatness and the white muslin window curtain albeit the muslin be old has been carefully whitened and starched and smoothly ironed and put up with exact precision and on the bureau covered by a snowy cloth are arranged a few books and other memorials of former times and a faded miniature which though it have little about it to interest a stranger is more precious to the poor widow than every thing besides  mrs ames is seated in her rocking chair supported by a pillow and busy cutting out work while her daughter a slender sicklylooking girl is sitting by the window intent on some fine stitching  mrs ames in former days was the wife of a respectable merchant and the mother of an affectionate family but evil fortune had followed her with a steadiness that seemed like the stern decree of some adverse fate rather than the ordinary dealings of a merciful providence first came a heavy run of losses in business then long and expensive sickness in the family and the death of children then there was the selling of the large house and elegant furniture to retire to a humbler style of living and finally the sale of all the property with the view of quitting the shores of a native land and commencing life again in a new one but scarcely had the exiled family found themselves in the port of a foreign land when the father was suddenly smitten down by the hand of death and his lonely grave made in a land of strangers the widow brokenhearted and discouraged had still a wearisome journey before her ere she could reach any whom she could consider as her friends with her two daughters entirely unattended and with her finances impoverished by detention and sickness she performed the tedious journey  arrived at the place of her destination she found herself not only without immediate resources but considerably in debt to one who had advanced money for her travelling expenses with silent endurance she met the necessities of her situation her daughters delicately reared and hitherto carefully educated were placed out to service and mrs ames sought for employment as a nurse the younger child fell sick and the hard earnings of the mother were all exhausted in the care of her and though she recovered in part she was declared by her physician to be the victim of a disease which would never leave her till it terminated her life  as soon however as her daughter was so far restored as not to need her immediate care mrs ames resumed her laborious employment scarcely had she been able in this way to discharge the debts for her journey and to furnish the small room we have described when the hand of disease was laid heavily on herself too resolute and persevering to give way to the first attacks of pain and weakness she still continued her fatiguing employment till her system was entirely prostrated thus all possibility of pursuing her business was cut off and nothing remained but what could be accomplished by her own and her daughters dexterity at the needle it is at this time we ask you to look in upon the mother and daughter  mrs ames is sitting up the first time for a week and even today she is scarcely fit to do so but she remembers that the month is coming round and her rent will soon be due and in her feebleness she will stretch every nerve to meet her engagements with punctilious exactness  wearied at length with cutting out and measuring and drawing threads she leans back in her chair and her eye rests on the pale face of her daughter who has been sitting for two hours intent on her stitching  ellen my child your head aches dont work so steadily  o no it dont ache much said she too conscious of looking very much tired poor girl had she remained in the situation in which she was born she would now have been skipping about and enjoying life as other young girls of fifteen do but now there is no choice of employments for herno youthful companionsno visitingno pleasant walks in the fresh air evening and morning it is all the same headache or sideache it is all one she must hold on the same unvarying taska wearisome thing for a girl of fifteen  but see the door opens and mrs amess face brightens as her other daughter enters mary has become a domestic in a neighboring family where her faithfulness and kindness of heart have caused her to be regarded more as a daughter and a sister than as a servant here mother is your rent money she exclaimed so do put up your work and rest a while i can get enough to pay it next time before the month comes around again  dear child i do wish you would ever think to get any thing for yourself said mrs ames i cannot consent to use up all your earnings as i have done lately and all ellens too you must have a new dress this spring and that bonnet of yours is not decent any longer  o no mother i have made over my blue calico and you would be surprised to see how well it looks and my best frock when it is washed and darned will answer some time longer and then mrs grant has given me a ribbon and when my bonnet is whitened and trimmed it will look very well and so she added i brought you some wine this afternoon you know the doctor says you need wine  dear child i want to see you take some comfort of your money yourself  well i do take comfort of it mother it is more comfort to be able to help you than to wear all the finest dresses in the world                                       two months from this dialogue found our little family still more straitened and perplexed mrs ames had been confined all the time with sickness and the greater part of ellens time and strength was occupied with attending to her  very little sewing could the poor girl now do in the broken intervals that remained to her and the wages of mary were not only used as fast as earned but she anticipated two months in advance  mrs ames had been better for a day or two and had been sitting up exerting all her strength to finish a set of shirts which had been sent in to make the money for them will just pay our rent sighed she and if we can do a little more this week  dear mother you are so tired said ellen do lie down and not worry any more till i come back  ellen went out and passed on till she came to the door of an elegant house whose damask and muslin window curtains indicated a fashionable residence  mrs elmore was sitting in her splendidlyfurnished parlor and around her lay various fancy articles which two young girls were busily unrolling what a lovely pink scarf said one throwing it over her shoulders and skipping before a mirror while the other exclaimed do look at these pocket handkerchiefs mother what elegant lace  well girls said mrs elmore these handkerchiefs are a shameful piece of extravagance i wonder you will insist on having such things  la mamma every body has such now laura seymour has half a dozen that cost more than these and her father is no richer than ours  well said mrs elmore rich or not rich it seems to make very little odds we do not seem to have half as much money to spare as we did when we lived in the little house in spring street what with new furnishing the house and getting every thing you boys and girls say you must have we are poorer if any thing than we were then  maam here is mrs amess girl come with some sewing said the servant  show her in said mrs elmore  ellen entered timidly and handed her bundle of work to mrs elmore who forthwith proceeded to a minute scrutiny of the articles for she prided herself on being very particular as to her sewing but though the work had been executed by feeble hands and aching eyes even mrs elmore could detect no fault in it  well it is very prettily done said she what does your mother charge  ellen handed a neatlyfolded bill which she had drawn for her mother i must say i think your mothers prices are very high said mrs elmore examining her nearly empty purse every thing is getting so dear that one hardly knows how to live ellen looked at the fancy articles and glanced around the room with an air of innocent astonishment ah said mrs elmore i dare say it seems to you as if persons in our situation had no need of economy but for my part i feel the need of it more and more every day as she spoke she handed ellen the three dollars which though it was not a quarter the price of one of the handkerchiefs was all that she and her sick mother could claim in the world  there said she tell your mother i like her work very much but i do not think i can afford to employ her if i can find any one to work cheaper  now mrs elmore was not a hardhearted woman and if ellen had come as a beggar to solicit help for her sick mother mrs elmore would have fitted out a basket of provisions and sent a bottle of wine and a bundle of old clothes and all the et cetera of such occasions but the sight of a bill always aroused all the instinctive sharpness of her businesslike education she never had the dawning of an idea that it was her duty to pay any body any more than she could possibly help nay she had an indistinct notion that it was her duty as an economist to make every body take as little as possible when she and her daughters lived in spring street to which she had alluded they used to spend the greater part of their time at home and the family sewing was commonly done among themselves but since they had moved into a large house and set up a carriage and addressed themselves to being genteel the girls found that they had altogether too much to do to attend to their own sewing much less to perform any for their father and brothers and their mother found her hands abundantly full in overlooking her large house in taking care of expensive furniture and in superintending her increased train of servants the sewing therefore was put out and mrs elmore felt it a duty to get it done the cheapest way she could nevertheless mrs elmore was too notable a lady and her sons and daughters were altogether too fastidious as to the make and quality of their clothing to admit the idea of its being done in any but the most complete and perfect manner  mrs elmore never accused herself of want of charity for the poor but she had never considered that the best class of the poor are those who never ask charity she did not consider that by paying liberally those who were honestly and independently struggling for themselves she was really doing a greater charity than by giving indiscriminately to a dozen applicants  dont you think mother she says we charge too high for this work said ellen when she returned i am sure she did not know how much work we put in those shirts she says she cannot give us any more work she must look out for somebody that will do it cheaper i do not see how it is that people who live in such houses and have so many beautiful things can feel that they cannot afford to pay for what costs us so much  well child they are more apt to feel so than people who live plainer  well i am sure said ellen we cannot afford to spend so much time as we have over these shirts for less money  never mind my dear said the mother soothingly here is a bundle of work that another lady has sent in and if we get it done we shall have enough for our rent and something over to buy bread with  it is needless to carry our readers over all the process of cutting and fitting and gathering and stitching necessary in making up six fine shirts suffice it to say that on saturday evening all but one were finished and ellen proceeded to carry them home promising to bring the remaining one on tuesday morning the lady examined the work and gave ellen the money but on tuesday when the child came with the remaining work she found her in great ill humor upon reëxamining the shirts she had discovered that in some important respects they differed from directions she meant to have given and supposed she had given and accordingly she vented her displeasure on ellen  why didnt you make these shirts as i told you said she sharply  we did said ellen mildly mother measured by the pattern every part and cut them herself  your mother must be a fool then to make such a piece of work i wish you would just take them back and alter them over and the lady proceeded with the directions of which neither ellen nor her mother till then had had any intimation unused to such language the frightened ellen took up her work and slowly walked homeward  o dear how my head does ache thought she to herself and poor mother she said this morning she was afraid another of her sick turns was coming on and we have all this work to pull out and do over  see here mother said she with a disconsolate air as she entered the room mrs rudd says take out all the bosoms and rip off all the collars and fix them quite another way she says they are not like the pattern she sent but she must have forgotten for here it is look mother it is exactly as we made them  well my child carry back the pattern and show her that it is so  indeed mother she spoke so cross to me and looked at me so that i do not feel as if i could go back  i will go for you then said the kind maria stephens who had been sitting with mrs ames while ellen was out i will take the pattern and shirts and tell her the exact truth about it i am not afraid of her maria stephens was a tailoress who rented a room on the same floor with mrs ames a cheerful resolute goforward little body and ready always to give a helping hand to a neighbor in trouble so she took the pattern and shirts and set out on her mission  but poor mrs ames though she professed to take a right view of the matter and was very earnest in showing ellen why she ought not to distress herself about it still felt a shivering sense of the hardness and unkindness of the world coming over her the bitter tears would spring to her eyes in spite of every effort to suppress them as she sat mournfully gazing on the little faded miniature before mentioned when he was alive i never knew what poverty or trouble was was the thought that often passed through her mind and how many a poor forlorn one has thought the same  poor mrs ames was confined to her bed for most of that week the doctor gave absolute directions that she should do nothing and keep entirely quieta direction very sensible indeed in the chamber of ease and competence but hard to be observed in poverty and want  what pains the kind and dutiful ellen took that week to make her mother feel easy how often she replied to her anxious questions that she was quite well or that her head did not ache much and by various other evasive expedients the child tried to persuade herself that she was speaking the truth and during the times her mother slept in the day or evening she accomplished one or two pieces of plain work with the price of which she expected to surprise her mother  it was towards evening when ellen took her finished work to the elegant dwelling of mrs page i shall get a dollar for this said she enough to pay for mothers wine and medicine  this work is done very neatly said mrs page and here is some more i should like to have finished in the same way  ellen looked up wistfully hoping mrs page was going to pay her for the last work but mrs page was only searching a drawer for a pattern which she put into ellens hands and after explaining how she wanted her work done dismissed her without saying a word about the expected dollar  poor ellen tried two or three times as she was going out to turn round and ask for it but before she could decide what to say she found herself in the street  mrs page was an amiable kindhearted woman but one who was so used to large sums of money that she did not realize how great an affair a single dollar might seem to other persons for this reason when ellen had worked incessantly at the new work put into her hands that she might get the money for all together she again disappointed her in the payment  ill send the money round tomorrow said she when ellen at last found courage to ask for it but tomorrow came and ellen was forgotten and it was not till after one or two applications more that the small sum was paid  but these sketches are already long enough and let us hasten to close them mrs ames found liberal friends who could appreciate and honor her integrity of principle and loveliness of character and by their assistance she was raised to see more prosperous days and she and the delicate ellen and warmhearted mary were enabled to have a home and fireside of their own and to enjoy something like the return of their former prosperity  we have given these sketches drawn from real life because we think there is in general too little consideration on the part of those who give employment to those in situations like the widow here described the giving of employment is a very important branch of charity inasmuch as it assists that class of the poor who are the most deserving it should be looked on in this light and the arrangements of a family be so made that a suitable compensation can be given and prompt and cheerful payment be made without the dread of transgressing the rules of economy  it is better to teach our daughters to do without expensive ornaments or fashionable elegances better even to deny ourselves the pleasure of large donations or direct subscriptions to public charities rather than to curtail the small stipend of her whose candle goeth not out by night and who labors with her needle for herself and the helpless dear ones dependent on her exertions     old father morris  a sketch from nature   of all the marvels that astonished my childhood there is none i remember to this day with so much interest as the old man whose name forms my caption when i knew him he was an aged clergyman settled over an obscure village in new england he had enjoyed the advantages of a liberal education had a strong original power of thought an omnipotent imagination and much general information but so early and so deeply had the habits and associations of the plough the farm and country life wrought themselves into his mind that his after acquirements could only mingle with them forming an unexampled amalgam like unto nothing but itself  he was an ingrain new englander and whatever might have been the source of his information it came out in yankee form with the strong provinciality of yankee dialect  it is in vain to attempt to give a full picture of such a genuine unique but some slight and imperfect dashes may help the imagination to a faint idea of what none can fully conceive but those who have seen and heard old father morris  suppose yourself one of half a dozen children and you hear the cry father morris is coming you run to the window or door and you see a tall bulky old man with a pair of saddle bags on one arm hitching his old horse with a fumbling carefulness and then deliberately stumping towards the house you notice his tranquil florid fullmoon face enlightened by a pair of great round blue eyes that roll with dreamy inattentiveness on all the objects around and as he takes off his hat you see the white curling wig that sets off his round head he comes towards you and as you stand staring with all the children around he deliberately puts his great hand on your head and with deep rumbling voice inquires  how dye do my darter is your daddy at home my darter usually makes off as fast as possible in an unconquerable giggle father morris goes into the house and we watch him at every turn as with the most liberal simplicity he makes himself at home takes off his wig wipes down his great face with a checked pocket handkerchief helps himself hither and thither to whatever he wants and asks for such things as he cannot lay his hands on with all the comfortable easiness of childhood  i remember to this day how we used to peep through the crack of the door or hold it half ajar and peer in to watch his motions and how mightily diverted we were with his deep slow manner of speaking his heavy cumbrous walk but above all with the wonderful faculty of hemming which he possessed  his deep thundering protracted ahemem was like nothing else that ever i heard and when once as he was in the midst of one of these performances the parlor door suddenly happened to swing open i heard one of my roguish brothers calling in a suppressed tone charles charles father morris has hemmed the door openand then followed the signs of a long and desperate titter in which i sincerely sympathized  but the morrow is sunday the old man rises in the pulpit he is not now in his own humble little parish preaching simply to the hoers of corn and planters of potatoes but there sits governor d and there is judge r and counsellor p and judge g in short he is before a refined and literary audience but father morris rises he thinks nothing of this he cares nothing he knows nothing as he himself would say but jesus christ and him crucified he takes a passage of scripture to explain perhaps it is the walk to emmaus and the conversation of jesus with his disciples immediately the whole start out before you living and picturesque the road to emmaus is a new england turnpike you can see its mile stones its mullein stalks its toll gates next the disciples rise and you have before you all their anguish and hesitation and dismay talked out to you in the language of your own fireside you smile you are amused yet you are touched and the illusion grows every moment you see the approaching stranger and the mysterious conversation grows more and more interesting emmaus rises in the distance in the likeness of a new england village with a white meeting house and spire you follow the travellers you enter the house with them nor do you wake from your trance until with streaming eyes the preacher tells you that they saw it was the lord jesusand what a pity it was they could not have known it before  it was after a sermon on this very chapter of scripture history that governor griswold in passing out of the house laid hold on the sleeve of his first acquaintance pray tell me said he who is this minister  why it is old father morris  well he is an oddityand a genius too i declare he continued i have been wondering all the morning how i could have read the bible to so little purpose as not to see all these particulars he has presented  i once heard him narrate in this picturesque way the story of lazarus the great bustling city of jerusalem first rises to view and you are told with great simplicity how the lord jesus used to get tired of the noise and how he was tired of preaching again and again to people who would not mind a word he said and how when it came evening he used to go out and see his friends in bethany then he told about the house of martha and mary a little white house among the trees he said you could just see it from jerusalem and there the lord jesus and his disciples used to go and sit in the evenings with martha and mary and lazarus  then the narrator went on to tell how lazarus died describing with tears and a choking voice the distress they were in and how they sent a message to the lord jesus and he did not come and how they wondered and wondered and thus on he went winding up the interest by the graphic minutiæ of an eye witness till he woke you from the dream by his triumphant joy at the resurrection scene  on another occasion as he was sitting at a tea table unusually supplied with cakes and sweetmeats he found an opportunity to make a practical allusion to the same family story he said that mary was quiet and humble sitting at her saviors feet to hear his words but martha thought more of what was to be got for tea martha could not find time to listen to christ no she was cumbered with much servingaround the house frying fritters and making gingerbread  among his own simple people his style of scripture painting was listened to with breathless interest but it was particularly in those rustic circles called conference meetings that his whole warm soul unfolded and the bible in his hands became a gallery of new england paintings  he particularly loved the evangelists following the footsteps of jesus christ dwelling upon his words repeating over and over again the stories of what he did with all the fond veneration of an old and favored servant  sometimes too he would give the narration an exceedingly practical turn as one example will illustrate  he had noticed a falling off in his little circle that met for social prayer and took occasion the first time he collected a tolerable audience to tell concerning the conference meeting that the disciples attended after the resurrection  but thomas was not with them thomas not with them said the old man in a sorrowful voice why what could keep thomas away perhaps said he glancing at some of his backward auditors thomas had got coldhearted and was afraid they would ask him to make the first prayer or perhaps said he looking at some of the farmers thomas was afraid the roads were bad or perhaps he added after a pause thomas had got proud and thought he could not come in his old clothes thus he went on significantly summing up the common excuses of his people and then with great simplicity and emotion he added but only think what thomas lost for in the middle of the meeting the lord jesus came and stood among them how sorry thomas must have been this representation served to fill the vacant seats for some time to come  at another time father morris gave the details of the anointing of david to be king he told them how samuel went to bethlehem to jesses house and went in with a how dye do jesse and how when jesse asked him to take a chair he said he could not stay a minute that the lord had sent him to anoint one of his sons for a king and how when jesse called in the tallest and handsomest samuel said he would not do and how all the rest passed the same test and at last how samuel says why have not you any more sons jesse and jesse says why yes there is little david down in the lot and how as soon as ever samuel saw david he slashed the oil right on to him and how jesse said he never was so beat in all his life  father morris sometimes used his illustrative talent to very good purpose in the way of rebuke he had on his farm a fine orchard of peaches from which some of the ten and twelveyearold gentlemen helped themselves more liberally than even the old mans kindness thought expedient  accordingly he took occasion to introduce into his sermon one sunday in his little parish an account of a journey he took and how he was very warm and very dry and how he saw a fine orchard of peaches that made his mouth water to look at them so says he i came up to the fence and looked all around for i would not have touched one of them without leave for all the world at last i spied a man and says i mister wont you give me some of your peaches so the man came and gave me nigh about a hat full and while i stood there eating i said mister how do you manage to keep your peaches keep them said he and he stared at me what do you mean yes sir said i dont the boys steal them boys steal them said he no indeed why sir said i i have a whole lot full of peaches and i cannot get half of themhere the old mans voice grew tremulousbecause the boys in my parish steal them so why sir said he dont their parents teach them not to steal and i grew all over in a cold sweat and i told him i was afeard they didnt why how you talk says the man do tell me where you live then said father morris the tears running over i was obliged to tell him i lived in the town of g after this father morris kept his peaches  our old friend was not less original in the logical than in the illustrative portions of his discourses his logic was of that familiar colloquial kind which shakes hands with common sense like an old friend sometimes too his great mind and great heart would be poured out on the vast themes of religion in language which though homely produced all the effects of the sublime he once preached a discourse on the text the high and holy one that inhabiteth eternity and from the beginning to the end it was a train of lofty and solemn thought with his usual simple earnestness and his great rolling voice he told about the great godthe great jehovahand how the people in this world were flustering and worrying and afraid they should not get time to do this and that and tother but he added with fullhearted satisfaction the lord is never in a hurry he has it all to do but he has time enough for he inhabiteth eternity and the grand idea of infinite leisure and almighty resources was carried through the sermon with equal strength and simplicity  although the old man never seemed to be sensible of any thing tending to the ludicrous in his own mode of expressing himself yet he had considerable relish for humor and some shrewdness of repartee one time as he was walking through a neighboring parish famous for its profanity he was stopped by a whole flock of the youthful reprobates of the place  father morris father morris the devils dead  is he said the old man benignly laying his hand on the head of the nearest urchin you poor fatherless children  but the sayings and doings of this good old man as reported in the legends of the neighborhood are more than can be gathered or reported he lived far beyond the common age of man and continued when age had impaired his powers to tell over and over again the same bible stories that he had told so often before  i recollect hearing of the joy that almost broke the old mans heart when after many years diligent watching and nurture of the good seed in his parish it began to spring into vegetation sudden and beautiful as that which answers the patient watching of the husbandman many a hard worldlyhearted manmany a sleepy inattentive hearermany a listless idle young person began to give ear to words that had long fallen unheeded a neighboring minister who had been sent for to see and rejoice in these results describes the scene when on entering the little church he found an anxious crowded auditory assembled around their venerable teacher waiting for direction and instruction the old man was sitting in his pulpit almost choking with fulness of emotion as he gazed around father said the youthful minister i suppose you are ready to say with old simeon now lord lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen thy salvation sartin sartin said the old man while the tears streamed down his cheeks and his whole frame shook with emotion  it was not many years after that this simple and loving servant of christ was gathered in peace unto him whom he loved his name is fast passing from remembrance and in a few years his memory like his humble grave will be entirely grown over and forgotten among men though it will be had in everlasting remembrance by him who forgetteth not his servants and in whose sight the death of his saints is precious     the two altars  or two pictures in one   i the altar of liberty or 1776  the wellsweep of the old house on the hill was relieved dark and clear against the reddening sky as the early winter sun was going down in the west it was a brisk clear metallic evening the long drifts of snow blushed crimson red on their tops and lay in shades of purple and lilac in the hollows and the old wintry wind brushed shrewdly along the plain tingling peoples noses blowing open their cloaks puffing in the back of their necks and showing other unmistakable indications that he was getting up steam for a real roistering night  hurrah how it blows said little dick ward from the top of the mossy wood pile  now dick had been sent to said wood pile in company with his little sister grace to pick up chips which every body knows was in the olden time considered a wholesome and gracious employment and the peculiar duty of the rising generation but said dick being a boy had mounted the wood pile and erected there a flagstaff on which he was busily tying a little red pocket handkerchief occasionally exhorting grace to be sure and pick up fast  o yes i will said grace but you see the chips have got ice on em and make my hands so cold  o dont stop to suck your thumbs who cares for ice pick away i say while i set up the flag of liberty  so grace picked away as fast as she could nothing doubting but that her cold thumbs were in some mysterious sense an offering on the shrine of liberty while soon the red handkerchief duly secured fluttered and snapped in the brisk evening wind  now you must hurrah gracie and throw up your bonnet said dick as he descended from the pile  but wont it lodge down in some place in the wood pile suggested grace thoughtfully  o never fear give it to me and just holler now gracie hurrah for liberty and well throw up your bonnet and my cap and well play you know that we are a whole army and im general washington  so grace gave up her little red hood and dick swung his cap and up they both went into the air and the children shouted and the flag snapped and fluttered and altogether they had a merry time of it but then the windgood for nothing roguish fellowmade an ungenerous plunge at poor graces little hood and snipped it up in a twinkling and whisked it off off offfluttering and bobbing up and down quite across a wide waste snowy field and finally lodged it on the top of a tall strutting rail that was leaning very independently quite another way from all the other rails of the fence  now see do see said grace there goes my bonnet what will aunt hitty say and grace began to cry  dont you cry gracie you offered it up to liberty you know its glorious to give up every thing for liberty  o but aunt hitty wont think so  well dont cry gracie you foolish girl do you think i cant get it now only play that that great rail is a fort and your bonnet is a prisoner in it and see how quick ill take the fort and get it and dick shouldered a stick and started off                                       what upon airth keeps those children so long i should think they were making chips said aunt mehetabel the fires just a going out under the tea kettle  by this time grace had lugged her heavy basket to the door and was stamping the snow off her little feet which were so numb that she needed to stamp to be quite sure they were yet there aunt mehetabels shrewd face was the first that greeted her as the door opened  graciewhat upon airthwipe your nose child your hands are frozen where alive is dickand whats kept you out all this timeand wheres your bonnet  poor grace stunned by this cataract of questions neither wiped her nose nor gave any answer but sidled up into the warm corner where grandmamma was knitting and began quietly rubbing and blowing her fingers while the tears silently rolled down her cheeks as the fire made the former ache intolerably  poor little dear said grandmamma taking her hands in hers hitty shant scold you grandma knows youve been a good girlthe wind blew poor gracies bonnet away and grandmamma wiped both eyes and nose and gave her moreover a stalk of dried fennel out of her pocket whereat grace took heart once more  mother always makes fools of roxys children said mehetabel puffing zealously under the tea kettle theres a little maple sugar in that saucer up there mother if you will keep giving it to her she said still vigorously puffing and now gracie she said when after a while the fire seemed in tolerable order will you answer my question where is dick  gone over in the lot to get my bonnet  how came your bonnet off said aunt mehetabel i tied it on firm enough  dick wanted me to take it off for him to throw up for liberty said grace  throw up for fiddlestick just one of dicks cutups and you was silly enough to mind him  why he put up a flagstaff on the wood pile and a flag to liberty you know that papas fighting for said grace more confidently as she saw her quiet blueeyed mother who had silently walked into the room during the conversation  graces mother smiled and said encouragingly and what then  why he wanted me to throw up my bonnet and he his cap and shout for liberty and then the wind took it and carried it off and he said i ought not to be sorry if i did lose itit was an offering to liberty  and so i did said dick who was standing as straight as a poplar behind the group and i heard it in one of fathers letters to mother that we ought to offer up every thing on the altar of libertyand so i made an altar of the wood pile  good boy said his mother always remember every thing your father writes he has offered up every thing on the altar of liberty true enough and i hope you son will live to do the same  only if i have the hoods and caps to make said aunt hitty i hope he wont offer them up every weekthats all  o well aunt hitty ive got the hood let me alone for that it blew clear over into the daddy ward pasture lot and there stuck on the top of the great rail and i played that the rail was a fort and besieged it and took it  o yes youre always up to taking forts and any thing else that nobody wants done ill warrant now you left gracie to pick up every blessed one of them chips  picking up chips is girls work said dick and taking forts and defending the country is mens work  and pray mister pomp how long have you been a man said aunt hitty  if i aint a man i soon shall be my head is most up to my mothers shoulder and i can fire off a gun too i tried the other day when i was up to the store mother i wish youd let me clean and load the old gun so that if the british should come  well if you are so big and grand just lift me out that table sir said aunt hitty for its past supper time  dick sprang and had the table out in a trice with an abundant clatter and put up the leaves with quite an air his mother with the silent and gliding motion characteristic of her quietly took out the table cloth and spread it and began to set the cups and saucers in order and to put on the plates and knives while aunt hitty bustled about the tea  ill be glad when the wars over for one reason said she im pretty much tired of drinking sage tea for one i know  well aunt hitty how you scolded that pedler last week that brought along that real tea  to be sure i did spose id be taking any of his old tea bought of the britishfling every teacup in his face first  well mother said dick i never exactly understood what it was about the tea and why the boston folks threw it all overboard  because there was an unlawful tax laid upon it that the government had no right to lay it wasnt much in itself but it was a part of a whole system of oppressive meanness designed to take away our rights and make us slaves of a foreign power  slaves said dick straightening himself proudly father a slave  but they would not be slaves they saw clearly where it would all end and they would not begin to submit to it in ever so little said the mother  i wouldnt if i was they said dick  besides said his mother drawing him towards her it wasnt for themselves alone they did it this is a great country and it will be greater and greater and its very important that it should have free and equal laws because it will by and by be so great this country if it is a free one will be a light of the worlda city set on a hill that cannot be hid and all the oppressed and distressed from other countries shall come here to enjoy equal rights and freedom this dear boy is why your father and uncles have gone to fight and why they do stay and fight though god knows what they suffer and and the large blue eyes of the mother were full of tears yet a strong bright beam of pride and exultation shone through those tears  well well roxy you can always talk every body knows said aunt hitty who had been not the least attentive listener of this little patriotic harangue but you see the tea is getting cold and yonder i see the sleigh is at the door and johns come so lets set up our chairs for supper  the chairs were soon set up when john the eldest son a lad of about fifteen entered with a letter there was one general exclamation and stretching out of hands towards it john threw it into his mothers lap the tea table was forgotten and the tea kettle sang unnoticed by the fire as all hands crowded about mothers chair to hear the news it was from captain ward then in the american army at valley forge mrs ward ran it over hastily and then read it aloud a few words we may extract  there is still it said much suffering i have given away every pair of stockings you sent me reserving to myself only one for i will not be one whit better off than the poorest soldier that fights for his country poor fellows it makes my heart ache sometimes to go round among them and see them with their worn clothes and torn shoes and often bleeding feet yet cheerful and hopeful and every one willing to do his very best often the spirit of discouragement comes over them particularly at night when weary cold and hungry they turn into their comfortless huts on the snowy ground then sometimes there is a thought of home and warm fires and some speak of giving up but next morning out come washingtons general orderslittle short note but its wonderful the good it does and then they all resolve to hold on come what may there are commissioners going all through the country to pick up supplies if they come to you i need not tell you what to do i know all that will be in your hearts  there children see what your father suffers said the mother and what it costs these poor soldiers to gain our liberty  ephraim scranton told me that the commissioners had come as far as the three mile tavern and that he rather spected theyd be along here tonight said john as he was helping round the baked beans to the silent company at the tea table  tonightdo tell now said aunt hitty then its time we were awake and stirring lets see what can be got  ill send my new overcoat for one said john that old one isnt cut up yet is it aunt hitty  no said aunt hitty i was laying out to cut it over next wednesday when desire smith could be here to do the tailoring  theres the south room said aunt hitty musing that bed has the two old aunt ward blankets on it and the great blue quilt and two comforters then mothers and my room two pairfour comforterstwo quiltsthe best chamber has got  o aunt hitty send all thats in the best chamber if any company comes we can make it up off from our beds said john i can send a blanket or two off from my bed i knowcant but just turn over in it so many clothes on now  aunt hitty take a blanket off from our bed said grace and dick at once  well well well see said aunt hitty bustling up  up rose grandmamma with great earnestness now and going into the next room and opening a large cedar wood chest returned bearing in her arms two large snow white blankets which she deposited flat on the table just as aunt hitty was whisking off the table cloth  mortal mother what are you going to do said aunt hitty  there she said i spun those every thread of em when my name was mary evans those were my wedding blankets made of real nice wool and worked with roses in all the corners ive got them to give and grandmamma stroked and smoothed the blankets and patted them down with great pride and tenderness it was evident she was giving something that lay very near her heart but she never faltered  la mother theres no need of that said aunt hitty use them on your own bed and send the blankets off from that they are just as good for the soldiers  no i shant said the old lady waxing warm tisnt a bit too good for em ill send the very best ive got before they shall suffer send em the best and the old lady gestured oratorically  they were interrupted by a rap at the door and two men entered and announced themselves as commissioned by congress to search out supplies for the army now the plot thickens aunt hitty flew in every directionthrough entry passage meal room milk room down cellar up chamberher cap border on end with patriotic zeal and followed by john dick and grace who eagerly bore to the kitchen the supplies that she turned out while mrs ward busied herself in quietly sorting and arranging in the best possible travelling order the various contributions that were precipitately launched on the kitchen floor  aunt hitty soon appeared in the kitchen with an armful of stockings which kneeling on the floor she began counting and laying out  there she said laying down a large bundle on some blankets that leaves just two pair apiece all round  la said john whats the use of saving two pair for me i can do with one pair as well as father  sure enough said his mother besides i can knit you another pair in a day  and i can do with one pair said dick  yours will be too small young master i guess said one of the commissioners  no said dick ive got a pretty good foot of my own and aunt hitty will always knit my stockings an inch too long cause she says i grow so see herethese will do and the boy shook his triumphantly  and mine too said grace nothing doubting having been busy all the time in pulling off her little stockings  here she said to the man who was packing the things into a widemouthed sack heres mine and her large blue eyes looked earnestly through her tears  aunt hitty flew at her good land the childs crazy dont think the men could wear your stockingstake em away  grace looked around with an air of utter desolation and began to cry i wanted to give them something said she id rather go barefoot on the snow all day than not send em any thing  give me the stockings my child said the old soldier tenderly there ill take em and show em to the soldiers and tell them what the little girl said that sent them and it will do them as much good as if they could wear them theyve got little girls at home too grace fell on her mothers bosom completely happy and aunt hitty only muttered  every body does spile that child and no wonder neither  soon the old sleigh drove off from the brown house tightly packed and heavily loaded and grace and dick were creeping up to their little beds  theres been something put on the altar of liberty tonight hasnt there dick  yes indeed said dick and looking up to his mother he said but mother what did you give  i said the mother musingly  yes you mother what have you given to the country  all that i have dears said she laying her hands gently on their headsmy husband and my children   ii the altar of  or 1850  the setting sun of chill december lighted up the solitary front window of a small tenement on  street in boston which we now have occasion to visit as we push gently aside the open door we gain sight of a small room clean as busy hands can make it where a neat cheerful young mulatto woman is busy at an ironing table a basket full of glossybosomed shirts and faultless collars and wristbands is beside her into which she is placing the last few items with evident pride and satisfaction a bright blackeyed boy just come in from school with his satchel of books over his shoulder stands cap in hand relating to his mother how he has been at the head of his class and showing his school tickets which his mother with untiring admiration deposits in the little real china tea potwhich as being their most reliable article of gentility is made the deposit of all the money and most especial valuables of the family  now henry says the mother look out and see if father is coming along the street and she begins filling the little black tea kettle which is soon set singing on the stove  from the inner room now daughter mary a wellgrown girl of thirteen brings the baby just roused from a nap and very impatient to renew his acquaintance with his mamma  bless his bright eyesmother will take him ejaculates the busy little woman whose hands are by this time in a very floury condition in the incipient stages of wetting up biscuitin a minute and she quickly frees herself from the flour and paste and deputing mary to roll out her biscuit proceeds to the consolation and succor of young master  now henry says the mother youll have time before supper to take that basket of clothes up to mr sheldins put in that nice bill that you made out last night i shall give you a cent for every bill you write out for me what a comfort it is now for ones children to be gettin learnin so  henry shouldered the basket and passed out the door just as a neatlydressed colored man walked up with his pail and whitewash brushes  o youve come father have you mary are the biscuits in you may as well set the table now well george whats the news  nothing only a pretty smart days work ive brought home five dollars and shall have as much as i can do these two weeks and the man having washed his hands proceeded to count out his change on the ironing table  well it takes you to bring in the money said the delighted wife nobody but you could turn off that much in a day  well they do saythose thats had me oncethat they never want any other hand to take hold in their rooms i spose its a kinder practice ive got and kinder natural  tell ye what said the little woman taking down the family strong boxto wit the china tea pot aforenamedand pouring the contents on the table were getting mighty rich now we can afford to get henry his new sunday cap and mary her mousselinedelaine dresstake care baby you rogue she hastily interposed as young master made a dive at a dollar bill for his share in the proceeds  he wants something too i suppose said the father let him get his hand in while hes young  the baby gazed with round astonished eyes while mother with some difficulty rescued the bill from his grasp but before any one could at all anticipate his purpose he dashed in among the small change with such zeal as to send it flying all over the table  hurrah bobs a smasher said the father delighted hell make it fly he thinks and taking the baby on his knee he laughed merrily as mary and her mother pursued the rolling coin all over the room  he knows now as well as can be that hes been doing mischief said the delighted mother as the baby kicked and crowed uproariously hes such a forward child now to be only six months old o youve no idea father how mischievous he grows and therewith the little woman began to roll and tumble the little mischief maker about uttering divers frightful threats which appeared to contribute in no small degree to the general hilarity  come come mary said the mother at last with a sudden burst of recollection you mustnt be always on your knees fooling with this child look in the oven at them biscuits  theyre done exactly motherjust the brown and with the word the mother dumped baby on to his fathers knee where he sat contentedly munching a very ancient crust of bread occasionally improving the flavor thereof by rubbing it on his fathers coat sleeve  what have you got in that blue dish there said george when the whole little circle were seated around the table  well now what do you suppose said the little woman delighted a quart of nice oystersjust for a treat you know i wouldnt tell you till this minute said she raising the cover  well said george we both work hard for our money and we dont owe any body a cent and why shouldnt we have our treats now and then as well as rich folks  and gayly passed the supper hour the tea kettle sung the baby crowed and all chatted and laughed abundantly  ill tell you said george wiping his mouth wife these times are quite another thing from what it used to be down in georgia i remember then old masr used to hire me out by the year and one time i remember i came and paid him in two hundred dollarsevery cent id taken he just looked it over counted it and put it in his pocket book and said you are a good boy georgeand he gave me half a dollar  i want to know now said his wife  yes he did and that was every cent i ever got of it and i tell you i was mighty bad off for clothes them times  well well the lord be praised theyre over and you are in a free country now said the wife as she rose thoughtfully from the table and brought her husband the great bible the little circle were ranged around the stove for evening prayers  henry my boy you must readyou are a better reader than your fatherthank god that let you learn early  the boy with a cheerful readiness read the lord is my shepherd and the mother gently stilled the noisy baby to listen to the holy words then all kneeled while the father with simple earnestness poured out his soul to god  they had but just risenthe words of christian hope and trust scarce died on their lipswhen lo the door was burst open and two men entered and one of them advancing laid his hand on the fathers shoulder this is the fellow said he  you are arrested in the name of the united states said the other  gentlemen what is this said the poor man trembling  are you not the property of mr b of georgia said the officer  gentlemen ive been a free hardworking man these ten years  yes but you are arrested on suit of mr b as his slave  shall we describe the leave takingthe sorrowing wife the dismayed children the tears the anguish that simple honest kindly home in a moment so desolated ah ye who defend this because it is law think for one hour what if this that happens to your poor brother should happen to you                                       it was a crowded court room and the man stood there to be triedfor lifeno but for the life of lifefor liberty  lawyers hurried to and fro buzzing consulting bringing authoritiesall anxious zealous engagedfor what to save a fellowman from bondage no anxious and zealous lest he might escape full of zeal to deliver him over to slavery the poor mans anxious eyes follow vainly the busy course of affairs from which he dimly learns that he is to be sacrificedon the altar of the union and that his heartbreak and anguish and the tears of his wife and the desolation of his children are in the eyes of these wellinformed men only the bleat of a sacrifice bound to the horns of the glorious american altar                                       again it is a bright day and business walks brisk in this market senator and statesman the learned and patriotic are out this day to give their countenance to an edifying and impressive and truly american spectaclethe sale of a man all the preliminaries of the scene are there duskybrowed mothers looking with sad eyes while speculators are turning round their children looking at their teeth and feeling of their arms a poor old trembling woman helpless half blind whose last child is to be sold holds on to her bright boy with trembling hands husbands and wives sisters and friends all soon to be scattered like the chaff of the threshing floor look sadly on each other with poor natures last tears and among them walk briskly glib oily politicians and thriving men of law letters and religion exceedingly sprightly and in good spiritsfor whyit isnt they that are going to be sold its only somebody else and so they are very comfortable and look on the whole thing as quite a matterofcourse affair and as it is to be conducted today a decidedly valuable and judicious exhibition  and now after so many hearts and souls have been knocked and thumped this way and that way by the auctioneers hammer comes the instructive part of the whole and the husband and father whom we saw in his simple home reading and praying with his children and rejoicing in the joy of his poor ignorant heart that he lived in a free country is now set up to be admonished of his mistake  now there is great excitement and pressing to see and exultation and approbation for it is important and interesting to see a man put down that has tried to be a free man  thats he is it couldnt come it could he says one  no and he will never come it thats more says another triumphantly  i dont generally take much interest in scenes of this nature says a grave representative but i came here today for the sake of the principle  gentlemen says the auctioneer weve got a specimen here that some of your northern abolitionists would give any price for but they shant have him no weve looked out for that the man that buys him must give bonds never to sell him to go north again  go it shout the crowd good good hurrah an impressive idea says a senator a noble maintaining of principle and the man is bid off and the hammer falls with a last crash on his heart his hopes his manhood and he lies a bleeding wreck on the altar of liberty  such was the altar in 1776 such is the altar in 1850     a scholars adventures in the country   if we could only live in the country said my wife how much easier it would be to live  and how much cheaper said i  to have a little place of our own and raise our own things said my wife dear me i am heart sick when i think of the old place at home and fathers great garden what peaches and melons we used to have what green peas and corn now one has to buy every cents worth of these thingsand how they taste such wilted miserable corn such peas then if we lived in the country we should have our own cow and milk and cream in abundance our own hens and chickens we could have custard and ice cream every day  to say nothing of the trees and flowers and all that said i  the result of this little domestic duet was that my wife and i began to ride about the city of  to look up some pretty interesting cottage where our visions of rural bliss might be realized country residences near the city we found to bear rather a high price so that it was no easy matter to find a situation suitable to the length of our purse till at last a judicious friend suggested a happy expedient  borrow a few hundred he said and give your note you can save enough very soon to make the difference when you raise every thing you eat you know it will make your salary go a wonderful deal further  certainly it will said i and what can be more beautiful than to buy places by the simple process of giving ones notetis so neat and handy and convenient  why pursued my friend there is mr b my next door neighbortis enough to make one sick of life in the city to spend a week out on his farm such princely living as one gets and he assures me that it costs him very littlescarce any thing perceptible in fact  indeed said i few people can say that  why said my friend he has a couple of peach trees for every month from june till frost that furnish as many peaches as he and his wife and ten children can dispose of and then he has grapes apricots etc and last year his wife sold fifty dollars worth from her strawberry patch and had an abundance for the table besides out of the milk of only one cow they had butter enough to sell three or four pounds a week besides abundance of milk and cream and madam has the butter for her pocket money this is the way country people manage  glorious thought i and my wife and i could scarce sleep all night for the brilliancy of our anticipations  to be sure our delight was somewhat damped the next day by the coldness with which my good old uncle jeremiah standfast who happened along at precisely this crisis listened to our visions  youll find it pleasant children in the summer time said the hardfisted old man twirling his bluechecked pocket handkerchief but im sorry youve gone in debt for the land  o but we shall soon save thatits so much cheaper living in the country said both of us together  well as to that i dont think it is to citybred folks  here i broke in with a flood of accounts of mr bs peach trees and mrs bs strawberries butter apricots etc etc to which the old gentleman listened with such a long leathery unmoved quietude of visage as quite provoked me and gave me the worst possible opinion of his judgment i was disappointed too for as he was reckoned one of the best practical farmers in the county i had counted on an enthusiastic sympathy with all my agricultural designs  i tell you what children he said a body can live in the country as you say amazin cheap but then a body must know howand my uncle spread his pocket handkerchief thoughtfully out upon his knees and shook his head gravely  i thought him a terribly slow stupid old body and wondered how i had always entertained so high an opinion of his sense  he is evidently getting old said i to my wife his judgment is not what it used to be  at all events our place was bought and we moved out well pleased the first morning in april not at all remembering the ill savor of that day for matters of wisdom our place was a pretty cottage about two miles from the city with grounds that had been tastefully laid out there was no lack of winding paths arbors flower borders and rosebushes with which my wife was especially pleased there was a little green lot strolling off down to a brook with a thick grove of trees at the end where our cow was to be pastured  the first week or two went on happily enough in getting our little new pet of a house into trimness and good order for as it had been long for sale of course there was any amount of little repairs that had been left to amuse the leisure hours of the purchaser here a door step had given away and needed replacing there a shutter hung loose and wanted a hinge abundance of glass needed setting and as to painting and papering there was no end to that then my wife wanted a door cut here to make our bed room more convenient and a china closet knocked up there where no china closet before had been we even ventured on throwing out a bay window from our sitting room because we had luckily lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actual saving of money to employ him and to be sure our darling little cottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this garnishing and furbishing i got up early every morning and nailed up the rosebushes and my wife got up and watered geraniums and both flattered ourselves and each other on our early hours and thrifty habits but soon like adam and eve in paradise we found our little domain to ask more hands than ours to get it into shape so says i to my wife i will bring out a gardener when i come next time and he shall lay the garden out and get it into order and after that i can easily keep it by the work of my leisure hours  our gardener was a very sublime sort of manan englishman and of course used to laying out noblemens placesand we became as grasshoppers in our own eyes when he talked of lord this and thats estate and began to question us about our carriage drive and conservatory and we could with difficulty bring the gentleman down to any understanding of the humble limits of our expectations merely to dress out the walks and lay out a kitchen garden and plant potatoes turnips beets and carrots was quite a descent for him in fact so strong were his æsthetic preferences that he persuaded my wife to let him dig all the turf off from a green square opposite the bay window and to lay it out into divers little triangles resembling small pieces of pie together with circles mounds and various other geometrical ornaments the planning and planting of which soon engrossed my wifes whole soul the planting of the potatoes beets carrots etc was intrusted to a raw irishman for as to me to confess the truth i began to fear that digging did not agree with me it is true that i was exceedingly vigorous at first and actually planted with my own hands two or three long rows of potatoes after which i got a turn of rheumatism in my shoulder which lasted me a week stooping down to plant beets and radishes gave me a vertigo so that i was obliged to content myself with a general superintendence of the garden that is to say i charged my englishman to see that my irishman did his duty properly and then got on to my horse and rode to the city but about one part of the matter i must say i was not remiss and that is in the purchase of seed and garden utensils not a day passed that i did not come home with my pockets stuffed with choice seeds roots etc and the variety of my garden utensils was unequalled there was not a pruning hook of any pattern not a hoe rake or spade great or small that i did not have specimens of and flower seeds and bulbs were also forthcoming in liberal proportions in fact i had opened an account at a thriving seed store for when a man is driving business on a large scale it is not always convenient to hand out the change for every little matter and buying things on account is as neat and agreeable a mode of acquisition as paying bills with ones notes  you know we must have a cow said my wife the morning of our second week our friend the gardener who had now worked with us at the rate of two dollars a day for two weeks was at hand in a moment in our emergency we wanted to buy a cow and he had one to sella wonderful cow of a real english breed he would not sell her for any money except to oblige particular friends but as we had patronized him we should have her for forty dollars how much we were obliged to him the forty dollars were speedily forthcoming and so also was the cow  what makes her shake her head in that way said my wife apprehensively as she observed the interesting beast making sundry demonstrations with her horns i hope shes gentle  the gardener fluently demonstrated that the animal was a pattern of all the softer graces and that this headshaking was merely a little nervous affection consequent on the embarrassment of a new position we had faith to believe almost any thing at this time and therefore came from the barn yard to the house as much satisfied with our purchase as job with his three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen her quondam master milked her for us the first evening out of a delicate regard to her feelings as a stranger and we fancied that we discerned forty dollars worth of excellence in the very quality of the milk  but alas the next morning our irish girl came in with a most rueful face and is it milking that baste youd have me be after she said sure and she wont let me come near her  nonsense biddy said i you frightened her perhaps the cow is perfectly gentle and with the pail on my arm i sallied forth the moment madam saw me entering the cow yard she greeted me with a very expressive flourish of her horns  this wont do said i and i stopped the lady evidently was serious in her intentions of resisting any personal approaches i cut a cudgel and putting on a bold face marched towards her while biddy followed with her milking stool apparently the beast saw the necessity of temporizing for she assumed a demure expression and biddy sat down to milk i stood sentry and if the lady shook her head i shook my stick and thus the milking operation proceeded with tolerable serenity and success  there said i with dignity when the frothing pail was full to the brim that will do biddy and i dropped my stick dump came madams heel on the side of the pail and it flew like a rocket into the air while the milky flood showered plentifully over me and a new broadcloth ridingcoat that i had assumed for the first time that morning whew said i as soon as i could get my breath from this extraordinary shower bath whats all this my wife came running towards the cow yard as i stood with the milk streaming from my hair filling my eyes and dropping from the tip of my nose and she and biddy performed a recitative lamentation over me in alternate strophes like the chorus in a greek tragedy such was our first mornings experience but as we had announced our bargain with some considerable flourish of trumpets among our neighbors and friends we concluded to hush the matter up as much as possible  these very superior cows are apt to be cross said i we must bear with it as we do with the eccentricities of genius besides when she gets accustomed to us it will be better  madam was therefore installed into her pretty pasture lot and my wife contemplated with pleasure the picturesque effect of her appearance reclining on the green slope of the pasture lot or standing ankle deep in the gurgling brook or reclining under the deep shadows of the trees she was in fact a handsome cow which may account in part for some of her sins and this consideration inspired me with some degree of indulgence towards her foibles  but when i found that biddy could never succeed in getting near her in the pasture and that any kind of success in the milking operations required my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening the matter wore a more serious aspect and i began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive it is very well to talk of the pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly rainy morning and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot rope in hand at the heels of such a termagant as mine in fact madam established a regular series of exercises which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured as first she would station herself plump in the middle of a marsh which lay at the lower part of the lot and look very innocent and absentminded as if reflecting on some sentimental subject suke suke suke i ejaculate cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh and holding out an ear of corn the lady looks gracious and comes forward almost within reach of my hand i make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns and away she goes kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight while i losing my balance tumble forward into the marsh i pick myself up and full of wrath behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side with the meekest air imaginable as who should say i hope you are not hurt sir i dash through swamp and bog furiously resolving to carry all by a coup de main then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging scampering and bopeeping among the trees of the grove interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid i always wondered how i caught her every day and when i had tied her head to one post and her heels to another i wiped the sweat from my brow and thought i was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius a genius she certainly was for besides her surprising agility she had other talents equally extraordinary there was no fence that she could not take down nowhere that she could not go she took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure using her horns as handily as i could use a claw hammer whatever she had a mind to whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden or a run in the corn patch or a foraging expedition into the flower borders she made herself equally welcome and at home such a scampering and driving such cries of suke here and suke there as constantly greeted our ears kept our little establishment in a constant commotion at last when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat and carried off one flap on her horns my patience gave out and i determined to sell her  as however i had made a good story of my misfortunes among my friends and neighbors and amused them with sundry whimsical accounts of my various adventures in the cowcatching line i found when i came to speak of selling that there was a general coolness on the subject and nobody seemed disposed to be the recipient of my responsibilities in short i was glad at last to get fifteen dollars for her and comforted myself with thinking that i had at least gained twentyfive dollars worth of experience in the transaction to say nothing of the fine exercise  i comforted my soul however the day after by purchasing and bringing home to my wife a fine swarm of bees  your bee now says i is a really classical insect and breathes of virgil and the augustan ageand then she is a domestic tranquil placid creature how beautiful the murmuring of a hive near our honeysuckle of a calm summer evening then they are tranquilly and peacefully amassing for us their stores of sweetness while they lull us with their murmurs what a beautiful image of disinterested benevolence  my wife declared that i was quite a poet and the beehive was duly installed near the flower plots that the delicate creatures might have the full benefit of the honeysuckle and mignonette my spirits began to rise i bought three different treatises on the rearing of bees and also one or two new patterns of hives and proposed to rear my bees on the most approved model i charged all the establishment to let me know when there was any indication of an emigrating spirit that i might be ready to receive the new swarm into my patent mansion  accordingly one afternoon when i was deep in an article that i was preparing for the north american review intelligence was brought me that a swarm had risen i was on the alert at once and discovered on going out that the provoking creatures had chosen the top of a tree about thirty feet high to settle on now my books had carefully instructed me just how to approach the swarm and cover them with a new hive but i had never contemplated the possibility of the swarm being like hamans gallows forty cubits high i looked despairingly upon the smoothbark tree which rose like a column full twenty feet without branch or twig what is to be done said i appealing to two or three neighbors at last at the recommendation of one of them a ladder was raised against the tree and equipped with a shirt outside of my clothes a green veil over my head and a pair of leather gloves on my hands i went up with a saw at my girdle to saw off the branch on which they had settled and lower it by a rope to a neighbor similarly equipped who stood below with the hive  as a result of this manoeuvre the fastidious little insects were at length fairly installed at housekeeping in my new patent hive and rejoicing in my success i again sat down to my article  that evening my wife and i took tea in our honeysuckle arbor with our little ones and a friend or two to whom i showed my treasures and expatiated at large on the comforts and conveniences of the new patent hive  but alas for the hopes of man the little ungrateful wretcheswhat must they do but take advantage of my oversleeping myself the next morning to clear out for new quarters without so much as leaving me a p p c such was the fact at eight oclock i found the new patent hive as good as ever but the bees i have never seen from that day to this  the rascally little conservatives said i i believe they have never had a new idea from the days of virgil down and are entirely unprepared to appreciate improvements  meanwhile the seeds began to germinate in our garden when we found to our chagrin that between john bull and paddy there had occurred sundry confusions in the several departments radishes had been planted broadcast carrots and beets arranged in hills and here and there a whole paper of seed appeared to have been planted bodily my good old uncle who somewhat to my confusion made me a call at this time was greatly distressed and scandalized by the appearance of our garden but by a deal of fussing transplanting and replanting it was got into some shape and order my uncle was rather troublesome as careful old people are apt to beannoying us by perpetual inquiries of what we gave for this and that and running up provoking calculations on the final cost of matters and we began to wish that his visits might be as short as would be convenient  but when on taking leave he promised to send us a fine young cow of his own raising our hearts rather smote us for our impatience  taint any of your new breeds nephew said the old man yet i can say that shes a gentle likely young crittur and better worth forty dollars than many a one thats cried up for ayrshire or durham and you shall be quite welcome to her  we thanked him as in duty bound and thought that if he was full of oldfashioned notions he was no less full of kindness and good will  and now with a new cow with our garden beginning to thrive under the gentle showers of may with our flower borders blooming my wife and i began to think ourselves in paradise but alas the same sun and rain that warmed our fruit and flowers brought up from the earth like sulky gnomes a vast array of purpleleaved weeds that almost in a night seemed to cover the whole surface of the garden beds our gardeners both being gone the weeding was expected to be done by meone of the anticipated relaxations of my leisure hours  well said i in reply to a gentle intimation from my wife when my article is finished ill take a day and weed all up clean  thus days slipped by till at length the article was despatched and i proceeded to my garden amazement who could have possibly foreseen that any thing earthly could grow so fast in a few days there were no bounds no alleys no beds no distinction of beet and carrot nothing but a flourishing congregation of weeds nodding and bobbing in the morning breeze as if to say we hope you are well sirweve got the ground you see i began to explore and to hoe and to weed ah did any body ever try to clean a neglected carrot or beet bed or bend his back in a hot sun over rows of weedy onions he is the man to feel for my despair how i weeded and sweat and sighed till when high noon came on as the result of all my toils only three beds were cleaned and how disconsolate looked the good seed thus unexpectedly delivered from its sheltering tares and laid open to a broiling july sun every juvenile beet and carrot lay flat down wilted and drooping as if like me they had been weeding instead of being weeded  this weeding is quite a serious matter said i to my wife the fact is i must have help about it  just what i was myself thinking said my wife my flower borders are all in confusion and my petunia mounds so completely overgrown that nobody would dream what they were meant for  in short it was agreed between us that we could not afford the expense of a fullgrown man to keep our place yet we must reënforce ourselves by the addition of a boy and a brisk youngster from the vicinity was pitched upon as the happy addition this youth was a fellow of decidedly quick parts and in one forenoon made such a clearing in our garden that i was delighted bed after bed appeared to view all cleared and dressed out with such celerity that i was quite ashamed of my own slowness until on examination i discovered that he had with great impartiality pulled up both weeds and vegetables  this hopeful beginning was followed up by a succession of proceedings which should be recorded for the instruction of all who seek for help from the race of boys such a loser of all tools great and small such an invariable leaveropen of all gates and letterdown of bars such a personification of all manner of anarchy and ill luck had never before been seen on the estate his time while i was gone to the city was agreeably diversified with roosting on the fence swinging on the gates making poplar whistles for the children hunting eggs and eating whatever fruit happened to be in season in which latter accomplishment he was certainly quite distinguished after about three weeks of this kind of joint gardening we concluded to dismiss master tom from the firm and employ a man  things must be taken care of said i and i cannot do it tis out of the question and so the man was secured  but i am making a long story and may chance to outrun the sympathies of my readers time would fail me to tell of the distresses manifold that fell upon meof cows dried up by poor milkers of hens that wouldnt set at all and hens that despite all law and reason would set on one egg of hens that having hatched families straightway led them into all manner of high grass and weeds by which means numerous young chicks caught premature colds and perished and how when i with manifold toil had driven one of these inconsiderate gadders into a coop to teach her domestic habits the rats came down upon her and slew every chick in one night how my pigs were always practising gymnastic exercises over the fence of the sty and marauding in the garden i wonder that fourier never conceived the idea of having his garden land ploughed by pigs for certainly they manifest quite a decided elective attraction for turning up the earth  when autumn came i went soberly to market in the neighboring city and bought my potatoes and turnips like any other man for between all the various systems of gardening pursued i was obliged to confess that my first horticultural effort was a decided failure but though all my rural visions had proved illusive there were some very substantial realities my bill at the seed store for seeds roots and tools for example had run up to an amount that was perfectly unaccountable then there were various smaller items such as horse shoeing carriage mendingfor he who lives in the country and does business in the city must keep his vehicle and appurtenances i had always prided myself on being an exact man and settling every account great and small with the going out of the old year but this season i found myself sorely put to it in fact had not i received a timely lift from my good old uncle i should have made a complete break down the old gentlemans troublesome habit of ciphering and calculating it seems had led him beforehand to foresee that i was not exactly in the moneymaking line nor likely to possess much surplus revenue to meet the note which i had given for my place and therefore he quietly paid it himself as i discovered when after much anxiety and some sleepless nights i went to the holder to ask for an extension of credit  he was right after all said i to my wife to live cheap in the country a body must know how     woman behold thy son   the golden rays of a summer afternoon were streaming through the windows of a quiet apartment where every thing was the picture of orderly repose gently and noiselessly they glide gilding the glossy old chairs polished by years of care fluttering with flickering gleam on the bookcases by the fire and the antique china vases on the mantel and even coqueting with sparkles of fanciful gayety over the face of the perpendicular sombre old clock which though at times apparently coaxed almost to the verge of a smile still continued its inevitable tick as for a century before  on the hearth rug lay outstretched a great lazylooking maltese cat evidently enjoying the golden beam that fell upon his sober sides and sleepily opening and shutting his great green eyes as if lost in luxurious contemplation  but the most characteristic figure in the whole picture was that of an aged woman who sat quietly rocking to and fro in a great chair by the side of a large round table covered with books there was a quiet beauty in that placid facethat silvery hair brushed neatly under the snowy border of the cap every line in that furrowed face told some tale of sorrow long assuaged and passions hushed to rest as on the calm ocean shore the goldenfurrowed sand shows traces of storms and fluctuations long past  on the round greencovered table beside her lay the quiet companion of her age the large bible whose pages like the gates of the celestial city were not shut at all by day a few old standard books and the pleasant rippling knitting whose dreamy irresponsible monotony is the best music of age  a fair girlish form was seated by the table the dress bonnet had fallen back on her shoulders the soft cheeks were suffused and earnest the long lashes and the veiled eyes were eloquent of subdued feeling as she read aloud from the letter in her hand it was from our harry a name to both of them comprising all that was dear and valued on earth for he was the only son of his mother and she a widow yet had he not been always an only one flower after flower on the tree of her life had bloomed and died and gradually as waters cut off from many channels the streams of love had centred deeper in this last and only one  and in truth harry sargeant was all that a mother might desire or be proud of generous highminded witty and talented and with a strong and noble physical development he seemed born to command the love of women the only trouble with him was in common parlance that he was too clever a fellow he was too social too impressible too versatile too attractive and too much in demand for his own good he always drew company about him as honey draws flies and was indispensable every where and to every body and it needs a steady head and firm nerves for such a one to escape ruin  harrys course in college though brilliant in scholarship had been critical and perilous he was a decided favorite with the faculty and students yet it required a great deal of hard winking and adroit management on the part of his instructors to bring him through without infringement of college laws and proprieties not that he ever meant the least harm in his life but that some extra generous impulse some quixotic generosity was always tumbling him neck and heels into somebodys scrapes and making him part and parcel in every piece of mischief that was going on  with all this premised there is no need to say that harry was a special favorite with ladies in truth it was a confessed fact among his acquaintances that whereas dozens of creditable respectable welltodo young men might besiege female hearts with every proper formality waiting at the gates and watching at the posts of the doors in vain yet before him all gates and passages seemed to fly open of their own accord nevertheless there was in his native village one quiet maiden who held alone in her hand the key that could unlock his heart in return and carried silently in her own the spell that could fetter that brilliant restless spirit and she it was of the thoughtful brow and downcast eyes whom we saw in our picture bending over the letter with his mother  that mother harry loved to idolatry she was to his mind an impersonation of all that was lovely in womanhood hallowed and sainted by age by wisdom by sorrow and his love for her was a beautiful union of protective tenderness with veneration and to his ellen it seemed the best and most sacred evidence of the nobleness of his nature and of the worth of the heart which he had pledged to her  nevertheless there was a danger overhanging the heads of the threea little cloud no bigger than a mans hand rising in the horizon of their hopes yet destined to burst upon them dark and dreadful in a future day  in those scenes of college hilarity where harry had been so indispensable the bright poetic wine cup had freely circulated and often amid the flush of conversation and the genial excitement of the hour he had drank freer and deeper than was best  he said it is true that he cared nothing for it that it was nothing to him that it never affected him and all those things that young men always say when the cup of circe is beginning its work with them friends were annoyed became anxious remonstrated but he laughed at their fears and insisted on knowing himself best at last with a sudden start and shiver of his moral nature he was awakened to a dreadful perception of his danger and resolved on decided and determinate resistance during this period he came to cincinnati to establish himself in business and as at this time the temperance reformation was in full tide of success there he found every thing to strengthen his resolution temperance meetings and speeches were all the mode young men of the first standing were its patrons and supporters wine was quite in the vocative and seemed really in danger of being voted out of society in such a turn of affairs to sign a temperance pledge and keep it became an easy thing temptation was scarce presented or felt he was offered the glass in no social circle met its attraction nowhere and flattered himself that he had escaped so great a danger easily and completely  his usual fortune of social popularity followed him and his visiting circle became full as large and importunate as a young man with any thing else to do need desire he was diligent in his application to business began to be mentioned with approbation by the magnates as a rising young man and had prospects daily nearing of competence and home and all that man desiresvisions alas never to be realized  for after a while the tide that had risen so high began imperceptibly to decline men that had made eloquent speeches on temperance had now other things to look to fastidious persons thought that matters had perhaps been carried too far and ladies declared that it was old and threadbare and getting to be cant and stuff and the everready wine cup was gliding back into many a circle as if on sober second thoughts the community was convinced that it was a friend unjustly belied  there is no point in the history of reform either in communities or individuals so dangerous as that where danger seems entirely past as long as a man thinks his health failing he watches he diets and will undergo the most heroic selfdenial but let him once set himself down as cured and how readily does he fall back to one soft indulgent habit after another all tending to ruin every thing that he has before done  so in communities let intemperance rage and young men go to ruin by dozens and the very evil inspires the remedy but when the trumpet has been sounded and the battle set in array and the victory only said and sung in speeches and newspaper paragraphs and temperance odes and processions then comes the return wave people cry enough the community vastly satisfied lies down to sleep in its laurels and then comes the hour of danger  but let not the man who has once been swept down the stream of intemperate excitement almost to the verge of ruin dream of any point of security for him he is like one who has awakened in the rapids of niagara and with straining oar and wild prayers to heaven forced his boat upward into smoother water where the draught of the current seems to cease and the banks smile and all looks beautiful and weary from rowing lays by his oar to rest and dream he knows not that under that smooth water still glides a current that while he dreams is imperceptibly but surely hurrying him back whence there is no return  harry was just in this perilous point he viewed danger as long past his selfconfidence was fully restored and in his security he began to neglect those lighter outworks of caution which he must still guard who does not mean at last to surrender the citadel                                       now girls and boys said mrs g to her sons and daughters who were sitting round a centre table covered with notes of invitation and all the preliminary et cetera of a party what shall we have on friday nighttea coffee lemonade wine of course not  and why not wine mamma said the young ladies the people are beginning to have it they had wine at mrs as and mrs bs  well your papa thinks it wont dothe boys are members of the temperance societyand i dont think girls it will do myself  there are many good sort of people by the by who always view moral questions in this style of phraseologynot what is right but what will do  the girls made an appropriate reply to this view of the subject by showing that mrs a and mrs b had done the thing and nobody seemed to make any talk  the boys who thus far in the conversation had been thoughtfully rapping their boots with their canes now interposed and said that they would rather not have wine if it wouldnt look shabby  but it will look shabby said miss fanny lemons you know are scarce to be got for any price and as for lemonade made of sirup its positively vulgar and detestable it tastes just like cream of tartar and spirits of turpentine  for my part said emma i never did see the harm of wine even when people were making the most fuss about it to be sure rum and brandy and all that are bad but wine  and so convenient to get said fanny and no decent young man ever gets drunk at parties so it cant do any harm besides one must have something and as i said it will look shabby not to have it  now there is no imputation that young men are so much afraid of especially from the lips of ladies as that of shabbiness and as it happened in this case as most others that the young ladies were the most efficient talkers the question was finally carried on their side  mrs g was a mild and a motherly woman just the one fitted to inspire young men with confidence and that home feeling which all men desire to find somewhere her house was a free and easy ground social for most of the young people of her acquaintance and harry was a favorite and domesticated visitor  during the height of the temperance reform fathers and brothers had given it their open and decided support and mrs galways easily enlisted for any good movementsympathized warmly in their endeavors the great fault was that too often incident to the gentleness of womana want of selfreliant principle her virtue was too much the result of mere sympathy too little of her own conviction hence when those she loved grew cold towards a good cause they found no sustaining power in her and those who were relying on her judgment and opinions insensibly controlled them notwithstanding she was a woman that always acquired a great influence over young men and harry had loved and revered her with something of the same sentiment that he cherished towards his own mother  it was the most brilliant party of the season every thing was got up in faultless taste and mrs g was in the very spirit of it the girls were looking beautifully the rooms were splendid there was enough and not too much of light and warmth and all were doing their best to please and be cheerful harry was more brilliant than usual and in fact outdid himself wit and mind were the spirit of the hour  just taste this tokay said one of the sisters to him it has just been sent us from europe and is said to be a genuine article  you know im not in that line said harry laughing and coloring  why not said another young lady taking a glass  o the temperance pledge you know i am one of the pillars of the order a very apostle it will never do for me  pshaw those temperance pledges are like the proverb something musty said a gay girl  well but you said you had a headache the beginning of the evening and you really look pale you certainly need it as a medicine said fanny ill leave it to mamma and she turned to mrs g who stood gayly entertaining a group of young people  nothing more likely replied she gayly i think harry you have looked pale lately a glass of wine might do you good  had mrs g known all of harrys past history and temptations and had she not been in just the inconsiderate state that very good ladies sometimes get into at a party she would sooner have sacrificed her right hand than to have thrown this observation into the scales but she did and they turned the balance for him  you shall be my doctor he said as laughing and coloring he drank the glassand where was the harm one glass of wine kills nobody and yet if a man falls and knows that in that glass he sacrifices principle and conscience every drop may be poison to the soul and body  harry felt at that very time that a great internal barrier had given way nor was that glass the only one that evening another and another and another followed his spirits rose with the wild and feverish gayety incident to his excitable temperament and what had been begun in the society of ladies was completed late at night in the gentlemens saloon  nobody ever knew or thought or recognized that that one party had forever undone this young man and yet so it was from that night his struggle of moral resistance was fatally impaired not that he yielded at once and without desperate efforts and struggles but gradually each struggle grew weaker each reform shorter each resolution more inefficient yet at the close of the evening all those friends mother brother and sister flattered themselves that every thing had gone on so well that the next week mrs h thought that it would do to give wine at the party because mrs g had done it last week and no harm had come of it  in about a year after the gs began to notice and lament the habits of their young friend and all unconsciously to wonder how such a fine young man should be so led astray  harry was of a decided and desperate nature his affections and his moral sense waged a fierce war with the terrible tyrantthe madness that had possessed him and when at last all hope died out he determined to avoid the anguish and shame of a drunkards life by a suicides death then came to the trembling heartstricken mother and beloved one a wild incoherent letter of farewell and he disappeared from among the living  in the same quiet parlor where the sunshine still streams through flickering leaves it now rested on the polished sides and glittering plate of a coffin there at last lay the weary at rest the soft shining gray hair was still gleaming as before but deeper furrows on the wan cheek and a weary heavy languor over the pale peaceful face told that those gray hairs had been brought down in sorrow to the grave sadder still was the story on the cloudless cheek and lips of the young creature bending in quiet despair over her poor ellen her lifes thread woven with these two beloved ones was broken  and may all this happennay does it not happenjust such things happen to young men among us every day and do they not lead in a thousand ways to sorrows just like these and is there not a responsibility on all who ought to be the guardians of the safety and purity of the other sex to avoid setting before them the temptation to which so often and so fatally manhood has yielded what is a paltry consideration of fashion compared to the safety of sons brothers and husbands the greatest fault of womanhood is slavery to custom and yet who but woman makes custom are not all the usages and fashions of polite society more her work than that of man and let every mother and sister think of the mothers and sisters of those who come within the range of their influence and say to themselves when in thoughtlessness they discuss questions affecting their interests behold thy brotherbehold thy son     the coral ring   there is no time of life in which young girls are so thoroughly selfish as from fifteen to twenty said edward ashton deliberately as he laid down a book he had been reading and leaned over the centre table  you insulting fellow replied a tall brilliantlooking creature who was lounging on an ottoman hard by over one of dickenss last works  truth coz for all that said the gentleman with the air of one who means to provoke a discussion  now edward this is just one of your wholesale declarations for nothing only to get me into a dispute with you you know replied the lady on your conscience now if you have one is it not so  my conscience feels quite easy cousin in subscribing to that sentiment as my confession of faith replied the gentleman with provoking sang froid  pshaw its one of your fusty old bachelor notions see what comes now of your living to your time of life without a wifedisrespect for the sex and all that really cousin your symptoms are getting alarming  nay now cousin florence said edward you are a girl of moderately good sense with all your nonsense now dont you i know you do think just so too  think just so toodo you hear the creature replied florence no sir you can speak for yourself in this matter but i beg leave to enter my protest when you speak for me too  well now where is there coz among all our circle a young girl that has any sort of purpose or object in life to speak of except to make herself as interesting and agreeable as possible to be admired and to pass her time in as amusing a way as she can where will you find one between fifteen and twenty that has any serious regard for the improvement and best welfare of those with whom she is connected at all or that modifies her conduct in the least with reference to it now cousin in very serious earnest you have about as much real character as much earnestness and depth of feeling and as much good sense when one can get at it as any young lady of them all and yet on your conscience can you say that you live with any sort of reference to any bodys good or to any thing but your own amusement and gratification  what a shocking adjuration replied the lady prefaced too by a threestory compliment well being so adjured i must think to the best of my ability and now seriously and soberly i dont see as i am selfish i do all that i have any occasion to do for any body you know that we have servants to do every thing that is necessary about the house so that there is no occasion for my making any display of housewifery excellence and i wait on mamma if she has a headache and hand papa his slippers and newspaper and find uncle johns spectacles for him twenty times a day no small matter that and then  but after all what is the object and purpose of your life  why i havent any i dont see how i can have anythat is as i am made now you know ive none of the fussing babytending herbteamaking recommendations of aunt sally and divers others of the class commonly called useful indeed to tell the truth i think useful persons are commonly rather fussy and stupid they are just like the boneset and hoarhound and catnipvery necessary to be raised in a garden but not in the least ornamental  and you charming young ladies who philosophize in kid slippers and french dresses are the tulips and rosesvery charming and delightful and sweet but fit for nothing on earth but parlor ornaments  well parlor ornaments are good in their way said the young lady coloring and looking a little vexed  so you give up the point then said the gentleman that you girls are good forjust to amuse yourselves amuse others look pretty and be agreeable  well and if we behave well to our parents and are amiable in the familyi dont knowand yet said florence sighing i have often had a sort of vague idea of something higher that we might become yet really what more than this is expected of us what else can we do  i used to read in oldfashioned novels about ladies visiting the sick and the poor replied edward you remember coelebs in search of a wife  yes truly that is to say i remember the story part of it and the love scenes but as for all those everlasting conversations of dr barlow mr stanley and nobody knows who else i skipped those of course but really this visiting and tending the poor and all that seems very well in a story where the lady goes into a picturesque cottage half overgrown with honeysuckle and finds an emaciated but still beautiful woman propped up by pillows but come to the downright matter of fact of poking about in all these vile dirty alleys and entering little dark rooms amid troops of grinning children and smelling codfish and onions and nobody knows whatdear me my benevolence always evaporates before i get through id rather pay any body five dollars a day to do it for me than do it myself the fact is that i have neither fancy nor nerves for this kind of thing  well granting then that you can do nothing for your fellowcreatures unless you are to do it in the most genteel comfortable and picturesque manner possible is there not a great field for a woman like you florence in your influence over your associates with your talents for conversation your tact and selfpossession and ladylike gift of saying any thing you choose are you not responsible in some wise for the influence you exert over those by whom you are surrounded  i never thought of that replied florence  now you remember the remarks that mr fortesque made the other evening on the religious services at church  yes i do and i thought then he was too bad  and i do not suppose there was one of you ladies in the room that did not think so too but yet the matter was all passed over with smiles and with not a single insinuation that he had said any thing unpleasing or disagreeable  well what could we do one does not want to be rude you know  do could you not florence you who have always taken the lead in society and who have been noted for always being able to say and do what you pleasecould you not have shown him that those remarks were unpleasing to you as decidedly as you certainly would have done if they had related to the character of your father or brother to my mind a woman of true moral feeling should consider herself as much insulted when her religion is treated with contempt as if the contempt were shown to herself do you not know the power which is given to you women to awe and restrain us in your presence and to guard the sacredness of things which you treat as holy believe me florence that fortesque infidel as he is would reverence a woman with whom he dared not trifle on sacred subjects  florence rose from her seat with a heightened color her dark eyes brightening through tears  i am sure what you say is just cousin and yet i have never thought of it before i willi am determined to begin after this to live with some better purpose than i have done  and let me tell you florence in starting a new course as in learning to walk taking the first step is every thing now i have a first step to propose to you  well cousin  well you know i suppose that among your train of adorers you number colonel elliot  florence smiled  and perhaps you do not know what is certainly true that among the most discerning and cool part of his friends elliot is considered as a lost man  good heavens edward what do you mean  simply this that with all his brilliant talents his amiable and generous feelings and his success in society elliot has not selfcontrol enough to prevent his becoming confirmed in intemperate habits  i never dreamed of this replied florence i knew that he was spirited and free fond of society and excitable but never suspected any thing beyond  elliot has tact enough never to appear in ladies society when he is not in a fit state for it replied edward but yet it is so  but is he really so bad  he stands just on the verge florence just where a word fitly spoken might turn him he is a noble creature full of all sorts of fine impulses and feelings the only son of a mother who dotes on him the idolized brother of sisters who love him as you love your brother florence and he stands where a word a lookso they be of the right kindmight save him  and why then do you not speak to him said florence  because i am not the best person florence there is another who can do it better one whom he admires who stands in a position which would forbid his feeling angry a person cousin whom i have heard in gayer moments say that she knew how to say any thing she pleased without offending any body  o edward said florence coloring do not bring up my foolish speeches against me and do not speak as if i ought to interfere in this matter for indeed i cannot do it i never could in the world i am certain i could not  and so said edward you whom i have heard say so many things which no one else could say or dared to sayyou who have gone on with your laughing assurance in your own powers of pleasing shrink from trying that power when a noble and generous heart might be saved by it you have been willing to venture a great deal for the sake of amusing yourself and winning admiration but you dare not say a word for any high or noble purpose do you not see how you confirm what i said of the selfishness of you women  but you must remember edward this is a matter of great delicacy  that word delicacy is a charming coverall in all these cases florence now here is a fine noblespirited young man away from his mother and sisters away from any family friend who might care for him tempted betrayed almost to ruin and a few words from you said as a woman knows how to say them might be his salvation but you will coldly look on and see him go to destruction because you have too much delicacy to make the effortlike the man that would not help his neighbor out of the water because he had never had the honor of an introduction  but edward consider how peculiarly fastidious elliot ishow jealous of any attempt to restrain and guide him  and just for that reason it is that men of his acquaintance cannot do any thing with him but what are you women made with so much tact and power of charming for if it is not to do these very things that we cannot do it is a delicate mattertrue and has not heaven given to you a fine touch and a fine eye for just such delicate matters have you not seen a thousand times that what might be resented as an impertinent interference on the part of a man comes to us as a flattering expression of interest from the lips of a woman  well but cousin what would you have me do how would you have me do it said florence earnestly  you know that fashion which makes so many wrong turns and so many absurd ones has at last made one good one and it is now a fashionable thing to sign the temperance pledge elliot himself would be glad to do it but he foolishly committed himself against it in the outset and now feels bound to stand to his opinion he has too been rather rudely assailed by some of the apostles of the new state of things who did not understand the peculiar points of his character in short i am afraid that he will feel bound to go to destruction for the sake of supporting his own opinion now if i should undertake with him he might shoot me but i hardly think there is any thing of the sort to be apprehended in your case just try your enchantments you have bewitched wise men into doing foolish things before now try now if you cant bewitch a foolish man into doing a wise thing  florence smiled archly but instantly grew more thoughtful  well cousin she said i will try though you are liberal in your ascriptions of power yet i can put the matter to the test of experiment                                       florence elmore was at the time we speak of in her twentieth year born of one of the wealthiest families in  highly educated and accomplished idolized by her parents and brothers she had entered the world as one born to command with much native nobleness and magnanimity of character with warm and impulsive feelings and a capability of every thing high or great she had hitherto lived solely for her own amusement and looked on the whole brilliant circle by which she was surrounded with all its various actors as something got up for her special diversion the idea of influencing any one for better or worse by any thing she ever said or did had never occurred to her the crowd of admirers of the other sex who as a matter of course were always about her she regarded as so many sources of diversion but the idea of feeling any sympathy with them as human beings or of making use of her power over them for their improvement was one that had never entered her head  edward ashton was an old bachelor cousin of florences who having earned the title of oddity in general society availed himself of it to exercise a turn for telling the truth to the various young ladies of his acquaintance especially to his fair cousin florence we remark by the by that these privileged truth tellers are quite a necessary of life to young ladies in the full tide of society and we really think it would be worth while for every dozen of them to unite to keep a person of this kind on a salary for the benefit of the whole however that is nothing to our present purpose we must return to our fair heroine whom we left at the close of the last conversation standing in deep revery by the window  its more than half true she said to herselfmore than half here am i twenty years old and never have thought of any thing never done any thing except to amuse and gratify myself no purpose no object nothing high nothing dignified nothing worth living for only a parlor ornamentheigh ho well i really do believe i could do something with this elliot and yet how dare i try  now my good readers if you are anticipating a love story we must hasten to put in our disclaimer you are quite mistaken in the case our fair brilliant heroine was at this time of speaking as heartwhole as the diamond on her bosom which reflected the light in too many sparkling rays ever to absorb it she had to be sure half in earnest half in jest maintained a bantering platonic sort of friendship with george elliot she had danced ridden sung and sketched with him but so had she with twenty other young men and as to coming to any thing tender with such a quick brilliant restless creature elliot would as soon have undertaken to sentimentalize over a glass of soda water no there was decidedly no love in the case  what a curious ring that is said elliot to her a day or two after as they were reading together  it is a knights ring said she playfully as she drew it off and pointed to a coral cross set in the gold a ring of the redcross knights come now ive a great mind to bind you to my service with it  do lady fair said elliot stretching out his hand for the ring  know then said she if you take this pledge that you must obey whatever commands i lay upon you in its name  i swear said elliot in the mock heroic and placed the ring on his finger  an evening or two after elliot attended florence to a party at mrs bs every thing was gay and brilliant and there was no lack either of wit or wine elliot was standing in a little alcove spread with refreshments with a glass of wine in his hand i forbid it the cup is poisoned said a voice in his ear he turned quickly and florence was at his side every one was busy with laughing and talking around and nobody saw the sudden start and flush that these words produced as elliot looked earnestly in the ladys face she smiled and pointed playfully to the ring but after all there was in her face an expression of agitation and interest which she could not repress and elliot felt however playful the manner that she was in earnest and as she glided away in the crowd he stood with his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the spot where she disappeared  is it possible that i am suspectedthat there are things said of me as if i were in danger were the first thoughts that flashed through his mind how strange that a man may appear doomed given up and lost to the eye of every looker on before he begins to suspect himself this was the first time that any defined apprehension of loss of character had occurred to elliot and he was startled as if from a dream  what the deuse is the matter with you elliot you look as solemn as a hearse said a young man near by  has miss elmore cut you said another  come man have a glass said a third  let him alonehes bewitched said a fourth i saw the spell laid on him none of us can say but our turn may come next  an hour later that evening florence was talking with her usual spirit to a group who were collected around her when suddenly looking up she saw elliot standing in an abstracted manner at one of the windows that looked out into the balcony  he is offended i dare say she thought but what do i care for once in my life i have tried to do a right thinga good thing i have risked giving offence for less than this many a time still florence could not but feel tremulous when a few moments after elliot approached her and offered his arm for a promenade they walked up and down the room she talking volubly and he answering yes and no till at length as if by accident he drew her into the balcony which overhung the garden the moon was shining brightly and every thing without in its placid quietness contrasted strangely with the busy hurrying scene within  miss elmore said elliot abruptly may i ask you sincerely had you any design in a remark you made to me in the early part of the evening  florence paused and though habitually the most practised and selfpossessed of women the color actually receded from her cheek as she answered  yes mr elliot i must confess that i had  and is it possible then that you have heard any thing  i have heard mr elliot that which makes me tremble for you and for those whose life i know is bound up in you and tell me were it well or friendly in me to know that such things were said that such danger existed and not to warn you of it  elliot stood for a few moments in silence  have i offended have i taken too great a liberty said florence gently  hitherto elliot had only seen in florence the selfpossessed assured lighthearted woman of fashion but there was a reality and depth of feeling in the few words she had spoken to him in this interview that opened to him entirely a new view in her character  no miss elmore replied he earnestly after some pause i may be pained offended i cannot be to tell the truth i have been thoughtless excited dazzled my spirits naturally buoyant have carried me often too far and lately i have painfully suspected my own powers of resistance i have really felt that i needed help but have been too proud to confess even to myself that i needed it you miss elmore have done what perhaps no one else could have done i am overwhelmed with gratitude and i shall bless you for it to the latest day of my life i am ready to pledge myself to any thing you may ask on this subject  then said florence do not shrink from doing what is safe and necessary and right for you to do because you have once said you would not do it you understand me  precisely replied elliot and you shall be obeyed  it was not more than a week before the news was circulated that even george elliot had signed the pledge of temperance there was much wondering at this sudden turn among those who had known his utter repugnance to any measure of the kind and the extent to which he had yielded to temptation but few knew how fine and delicate had been the touch to which his pride had yielded     art and nature   now girls said mrs ellis grey to her daughters here is a letter from george somers and he is to be down here next week so i give you fair warning  warning said fanny grey looking up from her embroidery what do you mean by that mamma  now thats just you fanny said the elder sister laughing you dear little simplicity you can never understand any thing unless it is stated as definitely as the multiplication table  but we need no warning in the case of cousin george im sure said fanny  cousin george to be sure do you hear the little innocent said isabella the second sister i suppose fanny you never heard that he had been visiting all the courts of europe seeing all the fine women stone picture and real that are to be found such an amateur and connoisseur  besides having received a fortune of a million or so said emma i dare say now fanny you thought he was coming home to make dandelion chains and play with button balls as he used to do when he was a little boy  fanny will never take the world as it is said mrs grey i do believe she will be a child as long as she lives mrs grey said this as if she were sighing over some radical defect in the mind of her daughter and the delicate cheek of fanny showed a tint somewhat deeper as she spoke and she went on with her embroidery in silence  mrs grey had been left by the death of her husband sole guardian of the three girls whose names have appeared on the page she was an active busy ambitious woman one of the sort for whom nothing is ever finished enough or perfect enough without a few touches and dashes and emendations and as such people always make a mighty affair of education mrs grey had made it a lifes enterprise to order adjust and settle the character of her daughters and when we use the word character as mrs grey understood it we mean it to include both face figure dress accomplishments as well as those more unessential items mind and heart  mrs grey had determined that her daughters should be something altogether out of the common way and accordingly she had conducted the training of the two eldest with such zeal and effect that every trace of an original character was thoroughly educated out of them all their opinions feelings words and actions instead of gushing naturally from their hearts were according to the most approved authority diligently compared and revised emma the eldest was an imposing showy girl of some considerable talent and she had been assiduously trained to make a sensation as a woman of ability and intellect her mind had been filled with information on all sorts of subjects much faster than she had power to digest or employ it and the standard which her ambitious mother had set for her being rather above the range of her abilities there was a constant sensation of effort in her keeping up to it in hearing her talk you were constantly reminded i am a woman of intellecti am entirely above the ordinary level of woman and on all subjects she was so anxiously and laboriously well and circumstantially informed that it was enough to make ones head ache to hear her talk  isabella the second daughter was par excellence a beautya tall sparkling cleopatralooking girl whose rich color dazzling eyes and superb figure might have bid defiance to art to furnish an extra charm nevertheless each grace had been as indefatigably drilled and manoeuvred as the members of an artillery company eyes lips eyelashes all had their lesson and every motion of her sculptured limbs every intonation of her silvery voice had been studied considered and corrected till even her fastidious mother could discern nothing that was wanting then were added all the graces of belles lettresall the approved rules of being delighted with music painting and poetryand last of all came the tour of the continent travelling being generally considered a sort of pumice stone for rubbing down the varnish and giving the very last touch to character  during the time that all this was going on miss fanny whom we now declare our heroine had been growing up in the quietude of her mothers country seat and growing as girls are apt to much faster than her mother imagined she was a fair slender girl with a purity and simplicity of appearance which if it be not in itself beauty had all the best effect of beauty in interesting and engaging the heart  she looked not so much beautiful as lovable her character was in precise correspondence with her appearance its first and chief element was feeling and to this add fancy fervor taste enthusiasm almost up to the point of genius and just common sense enough to keep them all in order and you will have a very good idea of the mind of fanny grey  delightfully passed the days with fanny during the absence of her mother while without thought of rule or compass she sang her own songs painted flowers and sketched landscapes from nature visited sociably all over the village where she was a great favorite ran about through the fields over fences or in the woods with her little cottage bonnet and above all built her own little castles in the air without any body to help pull them down which we think about the happiest circumstance in her situation  but affairs wore a very different aspect when mrs grey with her daughters returned from europe as full of foreign tastes and notions as people of an artificial character generally do return  poor fanny was deluged with a torrent of new ideas she heard of styles of appearance and styles of beauty styles of manner and styles of conversation this that and the other air a general effect and a particular effect and of four hundred and fifty ways of producing an impressionin short it seemed to her that people ought to be of wonderful consequence to have so many things to think and to say about the how and why of every word and action  mrs grey who had no manner of doubt of her own ability to make over a character undertook the point with fanny as systematically as one would undertake to make over an old dress poor fanny who had an unconquerable aversion to trying on dresses or settling points in millinery went through with most exemplary meekness an entire transformation as to all externals but when mrs grey set herself at work upon her mind and tastes and opinions the matter became somewhat more serious for the buoyant feeling and fanciful elements of her character were as incapable of being arranged according to rule as the sparkling water drops are of being strung into necklaces and earrings or the gay clouds of being made into artificial flowers some warm natural desire or taste of her own was forever interfering with her mothers régime some obstinate little fannyism would always put up its head in defiance of received custom and as her mother and sisters pathetically remarked do what you would with her she would always come out herself after all  after trying laboriously to conform to the pattern which was daily set before her she came at last to the conclusion that some natural inferiority must forever prevent her aspiring to accomplish any thing in that way  if i cant be what my mother wishes ill at least be myself said she one day to her sisters for if i try to alter i shall neither be myself nor any body else and on the whole her mother and sisters came to the same conclusion and in truth they found it a very convenient thing to have one in the family who was not studying effect or aspiring to be any thing in particular  it was very agreeable to mrs grey to have a daughter to sit with her when she had the sick headache while the other girls were entertaining company in the drawing room below it was very convenient to her sisters to have some one whose dress took so little time that she had always a head and a pair of hands at their disposal in case of any toilet emergency then she was always loving and affectionate entirely willing to be outtalked and outshone on every occasion and that was another advantage  as to isabella and emma the sensation that they made in society was enough to have gratified a dozen ordinary belles all that they said and did and wore was instant and unquestionable precedent and young gentlemen all starch and perfume twirled their laced pocket handkerchiefs and declared on their honor that they knew not which was the most overcoming the genius and wit of miss emma or the bright eyes of miss isabella though it was an agreed point that between them both not a heart in the gay world remained in its owners possessiona thing which might have a serious sound to one who did not know the character of these articles often the most trifling item in the inventory of worldly possessions and all this while all that was said of our heroine was something in this way i believe there is another sisteris there not  yes there is a quiet little blueeyed lady who never has a word to say for herselfquite amiable im told  now it was not a fact that miss fanny never had a word to say for herself if people had seen her on a visit at any one of the houses along the little green street of her native village they might have learned that her tongue could go fast enough  but in lighted drawing rooms and among buzzing voices and surrounded by people who were always saying things because such things were proper to be said fanny was always dizzy and puzzled and unready and for fear that she would say something that she should not she concluded to say nothing at all nevertheless she made good use of her eyes and found a very quiet amusement in looking on to see how other people conducted matters                                       well mr george somers is actually arrived at mrs greys country seat and there he sits with miss isabella in the deep recess of that window where the white roses are peeping in so modestly  to be sure thought fanny to herself as she quietly surveyed him looming up through the shade of a pair of magnificent whiskers and heard him passing the shuttlecock of compliment back and forth with the most assured and practised air in the worldto be sure i was a child in imagining that i should see cousin george somers im sure this magnificent young gentleman full of all utterance and knowledge is not the cousin that i used to feel so easy with no indeed and fanny gave a half sigh and then went out into the garden to water her geraniums  for some days mr somers seemed to feel put upon his reputation to sustain the character of gallant savant connoisseur etc which every one who makes the tour of the continent is expected to bring home as a matter of course for there is seldom a young gentleman who knows he has qualifications in this line who can resist the temptation of showing what he can do accordingly he discussed tragedies and reviews and ancient and modern customs with miss emma and with miss isabella retouched her drawings and exhibited his own sported the most choice and recherché style of compliment at every turn and in short flattered himself perhaps justly that he was playing the irresistible in a manner quite equal to that of his fair cousins  now all this while miss fanny was mistaken in one point for mr george somers though an exceedingly fine gentleman had after all quite a substratum of reality about him of real heart real feeling and real opinion of his own and the consequence was that when tired of the effort of conversing he really longed to find somebody to talk to and in this mood he one evening strolled into the library leaving the gay party in the drawing room to themselves miss fanny was there quite intent upon a book of selections from the old english poets  really miss fanny said mr somers you are very sparing of the favor of your company to us this evening  o i presume my company is not much missed said fanny with a smile  you must have a poor opinion of our taste then said mr somers  come come mr somers replied fanny you forget the person you are talking to it is not at all necessary for you to compliment me nobody ever doesso you may feel relieved of that trouble  nobody ever does miss fanny pray how is that  because im not the sort of person to say such things to  and pray what sort of person ought one to be in order to have such things said replied mr somers  why like sister isabella or like emma you understand i am a sort of little nobody if any one wastes fine words on me i never know what to make of them  and pray what must one say to you said mr somers quite amused  why what they really think and really feel and i am always puzzled by any thing else  accordingly about a half an hour afterwards you might have seen the much admired mr somers once more transformed into the cousin george and he and fanny engaged in a very interesting têteàtête about old times and things  now you may skip across a fortnight from this evening and then look in at the same old library just as the setting sun is looking in at its western window and you will see fanny sitting back a little in the shadow with one straggling ray of light illuminating her pure childish face and she is looking up at mr george somers as if in some sudden perplexity and dear me if we are not mistaken our young gentleman is blushing  why cousin george says the lady what do you mean  i thought i spoke plainly enough fanny replied cousin george in a tone that might have made the matter plain enough to be sure  fanny laughed outright and the gentleman looked terribly serious  indeed now dont be angry said she as he turned away with a vexed and mortified air indeed now i cant help laughing it seems to me so odd what will they all think of you  its of no consequence to me what they think said mr somers i think fanny if you had the heart i gave you credit for you might have seen my feelings before now  now do sit down my dear cousin said fanny earnestly drawing him into a chair and tell me how could i poor little miss fanny nobody how could i have thought any such thing with such sisters as i have i did think that you liked me that you knew more of my real feelings than mamma and sisters but that you shouldthat you ever shouldwhy i am astonished that you did not fall in love with isabella  that would have met your feelings then said george eagerly and looking as if he would have looked through her eyes soul and all  no no indeed she said turning away her head but added she quickly youll lose all your credit for good taste now tell me seriously what do you like me for  well then fanny i can give you the best reason i like you for being a real sincere natural girlfor being simple in your tastes and simple in your appearance and simple in your manners and for having heart enough left as i hope to love plain george somers with all his faults and not mr somerss reputation or mr somerss establishment  well this is all very reasonable to me of course said fanny but it will be so much greek to poor mamma  i dare say your mother could never understand how seeing the very acme of cultivation in all countries should have really made my eyes ache and long for something as simple as green grass or pure water to rest them on i came down here to find it among my cousins and i found in your sisters only just such women as i have seen and admired all over europe till i was tired of admiring your mother has achieved what she aimed at perfectly i know of no circle that could produce higher specimens but it is all art triumphant art after all and i have so strong a current of natural feeling running through my heart that i could never be happy except with a fresh simple impulsive character  like me you are going to say said fanny laughing well ill admit that you are right it would be a pity that you should not have one vote at least     children  a little child shall lead them   one cold market morning i looked into a milliners shop and there i saw a hale hearty wellbrowned young fellow from the country with his long cart whip and lionshag coat holding up some little matter and turning it about on his great fist and what do you suppose it was a babys bonnet a little soft blue satin hood with a swans down border white as the newfallen snow with a frill of rich blonde around the edge  by his side stood a very pretty woman holding with no small pride the babyfor evidently it was the baby any one could read that fact in every glance as they looked at each other and then at the large unconscious eyes and fat dimpled cheeks of the little one  it was evident that neither of them had ever seen a baby like that before  but really mary said the young man isnt three dollars very high  mary very prudently said nothing but taking the little bonnet tied it on the little head and held up the baby the man looked and without another word down went the three dollarsall the avails of last weeks butter and as they walked out of the shop it is hard to say which looked the most delighted with the bargain  ah thought i a little child shall lead them  another day as i was passing a carriage factory along one of our principal back streets i saw a young mechanic at work on a wheel the rough body of a carriage stood beside him and there wrapped up snugly all hooded and cloaked sat a little darkeyed girl about a year old playing with a great shaggy dog as i stopped the man looked up from his work and turned admiringly towards his little companion as much as to say see what i have got here  yes thought i and if the little lady ever gets a glance from admiring swains as sincere as that she will be lucky  ah these children little witches pretty even in all their faults and absurdities see for example yonder little fellow in a naughty fit he has shaken his long curls over his deepblue eyes the fair brow is bent in a frown the rose leaf lip is pursed up in infinite defiance and the white shoulder thrust angrily forward can any but a child look so pretty even in its naughtiness  then comes the instant change flashing smiles and tears as the good comes back all in a rush and you are overwhelmed with protestations promises and kisses they are irresistible too these little ones they pull away the scholars pen tumble about his paper make somersets over his books and what can he do they tear up newspapers litter the carpets break pull and upset and then jabber unheardof english in selfdefence and what can you do for yourself  if i had a child says the precise man you should see  he does have a child and his child tears up his papers tumbles over his things and pulls his nose like all other children and what has the precise man to say for himself nothing he is like every body else a little child shall lead him  the hardened heart of the worldly man is unlocked by the guileless tones and simple caresses of his son but he repays it in time by imparting to his boy all the crooked tricks and callous maxims which have undone himself  go to the jail to the penitentiary and find there the wretch most sullen brutal and hardened then look at your infant son such as he is to you such to some mother was this man that hard hand was soft and delicate that rough voice was tender and lisping fond eyes followed him as he played and he was rocked and cradled as something holy there was a time when his heart soft and unworn might have opened to questionings of god and jesus and been sealed with the seal of heaven but harsh hands seized it fierce goblin lineaments were impressed upon it and all is over with him forever  so of the tender weeping child is made the callous heartless man of the allbelieving child the sneering sceptic of the beautiful and modest the shameless and abandoned and this is what the world does for the little one  there was a time when the divine one stood on earth and little children sought to draw near to him but harsh human beings stood between him and them forbidding their approach ah has it not always been so do not even we with our hard and unsubdued feelings our worldly and unspiritual habits and maxims stand like a dark screen between our little child and its savior and keep even from the choice bud of our hearts the sweet radiance which might unfold it for paradise suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not is still the voice of the son of god but the cold world still closes around and forbids when of old disciples would question their lord of the higher mysteries of his kingdom he took a little child and set him in the midst as a sign of him who should be greatest in heaven that gentle teacher remains still to us by every hearth and fireside jesus still sets the little child in the midst of us  wouldst thou know o parent what is that faith which unlocks heaven go not to wrangling polemics or creeds and forms of theology but draw to thy bosom thy little one and read in that clear trusting eye the lesson of eternal life be only to thy god as thy child is to thee and all is done blessed shalt thou be indeed when a little child shall lead thee     how to make friends with mammon   it was four oclock in the afternoon of a dull winter day that mr h sat in his counting room the sun had nearly gone down and in fact it was already twilight beneath the shadows of the tall dusky stores and the close crooked streets of that quarter of boston hardly light enough struggled through the dusky panes of the counting house for him to read the entries in a muchthumbed memorandum book which he held in his hand  a small thin boy with a pale face and anxious expression significant of delicacy of constitution and a too early acquaintance with want and sorrow was standing by him earnestly watching his motions  ah yes my boy said mr h as he at last shut up the memorandum book yes ive got the place now im apt to be forgetful about these things come now lets go how is it havent you brought the basket  no sir said the boy timidly the grocer said hed let mother have a quarter for it and she thought shed sell it  thats bad said mr h as he went on tying his throat with a long comforter of some yards in extent and as he continued this operation he abstractedly repeated thats bad thats bad till the poor little boy looked quite dismayed and began to think that somehow his mother had been dreadfully out of the way  she didnt want to send for help so long as she had any thing she could sell said the little boy in a deprecating tone  o yes quite right said mr h taking from a pigeon hole in the desk a large pocket book and beginning to turn it over and as before abstractedly repeating quite right quite right till the little boy became reassured and began to think although he didnt know why that his mother had done something quite meritorious  well said mr h after he had taken several bills from the pocket book and transferred them to a wallet which he put into his pocket now were ready my boy but first he stopped to lock up his desk and then he said abstractedly to himself i wonder if i hadnt better take a few tracts  now it is to be confessed that this mr h whom we have introduced to our reader was in his way quite an oddity he had a number of singular little penchants and peculiarities quite his own such as a passion for poking about among dark alleys at all sorts of seasonable and unseasonable hours fishing out troops of dirty neglected children and fussing about generally in the community till he could get them into schools or otherwise provided for he always had in his pocket book a note of some dozen poor widows who wanted tea sugar candles or other things such as poor widows always will be wanting and then he had a most extraordinary talent for finding out all the sick strangers that lay in outoftheway upper rooms in hotels who every body knows have no business to get sick in such places unless they have money enough to pay their expenses which they never do  besides this all mr hs kinsmen and cousins to the third fourth and fortieth remove were always writing him letters which among other pleasing items generally contained the intelligence that a few hundred dollars were just then exceedingly necessary to save them from utter ruin and they knew of nobody else to whom to look for it  and then mr h was up to his throat in subscriptions to every charitable society that ever was made or imagined had a hand in building all the churches within a hundred miles occasionally gave four or five thousand dollars to a college offered to be one of six to raise ten thousand dollars for some benevolent purpose and when four of the six backed out quietly paid the balance himself and said no more about it another of his innocent fancies was to keep always about him any quantity of tracts and good books little and big for children and grownup people which he generally diffused in a kind of gentle shower about him wherever he moved  so great was his monomania for benevolence that it could not at all confine itself to the streets of boston the circle of his relatives or even the united states of america mr h was fully posted up in the affairs of india burmah china and all those odd outoftheway places which no sensible man ever thinks of with any interest unless he can make some money there and money it is to be confessed mr h didnt make there though he spent an abundance for getting up printing presses in ceylon for chinese type for boxes of clothing and what not to be sent to the sandwich islands for school books for the greeks and all other nonsense of that sort mr h was without a parallel no wonder his rich brother merchants sometimes thought him something of a bore since his heart being full of all these matters he was rather apt to talk about them and sometimes to endeavor to draw them into fellowship to an extent that was not to be thought of  so it came to pass often that though mr h was a thriving business man with some ten thousand a year he often wore a pretty threadbare coat the seams whereof would be trimmed with lines of white and he would sometimes need several pretty plain hints on the subject of a new hat before he would think he could afford one now it is to be confessed the world is not always grateful to those who thus devote themselves to its interests and mr h had as much occasion to know this as any other man people got so used to his giving that his bounty became as common and as necessary as that of a higher benefactor who maketh his sun to rise upon the evil and the good and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust and so it came to pass that people took them as they do the sunshine and the rain quite as matters of course not thinking much about them when they came but particularly apt to scold when they did not come  but mr h never cared for that he did not give for gratitude he did not give for thanks nor to have his name published in the papers as one of six who had given fifty thousand to do so and so but he gave because it was in him to give and we all know that it is an old rule in medicine as well as morals that what is in a man must be brought out then again he had heard it reported that there had been one of distinguished authority who had expressed the opinion that it was more blessed to give than to receive and he very much believed itbelieved it because the one who said it must have known since for mans sake he once gave away all  and so when some thriftless distant relation whose debts he had paid a dozen times over gave him an overhauling on the subject of liberality and seemed inclined to take him by the throat for further charity he calmed himself down by a chapter or two from the new testament and half a dozen hymns and then sent him a good brotherly letter of admonition and counsel with a bank note to enforce it and when some querulous old woman who had had a tenement of him rent free for three or four years sent him word that if he didnt send and mend the water pipes she would move right out he sent and mended them people said that he was foolish and that it didnt do any good to do for ungrateful people but mr h knew that it did him good he loved to do it and he thought also on some words that ran to this effect do good and lend hoping for nothing again he literally hoped for nothing again in the way of reward either in this world or in heaven beyond the present pleasure of the deed for he had abundant occasion to see how favors are forgotten in this world and as for another he had in his own soul a standard of benevolence so high so pure so ethereal that but one of mortal birth ever reached it he felt that do what he might he fell ever so far below the life of that spotless onethat his crown in heaven must come to him at last not as a reward but as a free eternal gift  but all this while our friend and his little companion have been pattering along the wet streets in the rain and sleet of a bitter cold evening till they stopped before a grocery here a large crosshandled basket was first bought and then filled with sundry packages of tea sugar candles soap starch and various other matters a barrel of flour was ordered to be sent after him on a dray mr h next stopped at a dry goods store and bought a pair of blankets with which he loaded down the boy who was happy enough to be so loaded and then turning gradually from the more frequented streets the two were soon lost to view in one of the dimmest alleys of the city  the cheerful fire was blazing in his parlor as returned from his long wet walk he was sitting by it with his feet comfortably incased in slippers the astral was burning brightly on the centre table and a group of children were around it studying their lessons  papa said a little boy what does this verse mean its in my sunday school lesson make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations  you ought to have asked your teacher my son  but he said he didnt know exactly what it meant he wanted me to look this week and see if i could find out  mr hs standing resource in all exegetical difficulties was dr scotts family bible therefore he now got up and putting on his spectacles walked to the glass bookcase and took down a volume of that worthy commentator and opening it read aloud the whole exposition of the passage together with the practical reflections upon it and by the time he had done he found his young auditor fast asleep in his chair  mother said he this child plays too hard he cant keep his eyes open evenings its time he was in bed  i wasnt asleep pa said master henry starting up with that air of injured innocence with which gentlemen of his age generally treat an imputation of this kind  then can you tell me now what the passage means that i have been reading to you  theres so much of it said henry hopelessly i wish youd just tell me in short order father  o read it for yourself said mr h as he pushed the book towards the boy for it was to be confessed that he perceived at this moment that he had not himself received any particularly luminous impression though of course he thought it was owing to his own want of comprehension  mr h leaned back in his rocking chair and on his own private account began to speculate a little as to what he really should think the verse might mean supposing he were at all competent to decide upon it make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness says he thats money very clearly how am i to make friends with it or of it receive me into everlasting habitations thats a singular kind of expression i wonder what it means dr scott makes some very good remarks about itbut somehow im not exactly clear it must be remarked that this was not an uncommon result of mr hs critical investigations in this quarter  well thoughts will wander and as he lay with his head on the back of his rocking chair and his eyes fixed on the flickering blaze of the coal visions of his wet tramp in the city and of the lonely garret he had been visiting and of the poor woman with the pale discouraged face to whom he had carried warmth and comfort all blended themselves together he felt too a little indefinite creeping chill and some uneasy sensations in his head like a commencing cold for he was not a strong man and it is probable his long wet walk was likely to cause him some inconvenience in this way at last he was fast asleep nodding in his chair  he dreamed that he was very sick in bed that the doctor came and went and that he grew sicker and sicker he was going to die he saw his wife sitting weeping by his pillowhis children standing by with pale and frightened faces all things in his room began to swim and waver and fade and voices that called his name and sobs and lamentations that rose around him seemed far off and distant in his ear o eternity eternity i am goingi am going he thought and in that hour strange to tell not one of all his good deeds seemed good enough to lean onall bore some taint or tinge to his purified eye of mortal selfishness and seemed unholy before the all pure i am going he thought there is no time to stay no time to alter to balance accounts and i know not what i am but i know o jesus what thou art i have trusted in thee and shall never be confounded and with that last breath of prayer earth was past  a soft and solemn breathing as of music awakened him as an infant child not yet fully awake hears the holy warblings of his mothers hymn and smiles half conscious so the heavenborn became aware of sweet voices and loving faces around him ere yet he fully woke to the new immortal life  ah he has come at last how long we have waited for him here he is among us now forever welcome welcome said the voices  who shall speak the joy of that latest birth the birth from death to life the sweet calm inbreathing consciousness of purity and rest the certainty that all sin all weakness and error are at last gone forever the deep immortal rapture of reposefelt to be but begunnever to end  so the eyes of the heavenborn opened on the new heaven and the new earth and wondered at the crowd of loving faces that thronged about him fair godlike forms of beauty such as earth never knew pressed round him with blessings thanks and welcome  the man spoke not but he wondered in his heart who they were and whence it came that they knew him and as soon as the inquiry formed itself in his soul it was read at once by his heavenly friends i said one bright spirit was a poor boy whom you found in the streets you sought me out you sent me to school you watched over me and led me to the house of god and now here i am and we said other voices are other neglected children whom you redeemed we also thank you and i said another was a lost helpless girl sold to sin and shame nobody thought i could be saved every body passed me by till you came you built a home a refuge for such poor wretches as i and there i and many like me heard of jesus and here we are and i said another was once a clerk in your store i came to the city innocent but i was betrayed by the tempter i forgot my mother and my mothers god i went to the gaming table and the theatre and at last i robbed your drawer you might have justly cast me off but you bore with me you watched over me you saved me i am here through you this day and i said another was a poor slave girldoomed to be sold on the auction block to a life of infamy and the ruin of soul and body had you not been willing to give so largely for my ransom no one had thought to buy me you stimulated others to give and i was redeemed i lived a christian mother to bring my children up for christthey are all here with me to bless you this day and their children on earth and their childrens children are growing up to bless you and i said another was an unbeliever in the pride of my intellect i thought i could demonstrate the absurdity of christianity i thought i could answer the argument from miracles and prophecy but your patient selfdenying life was an argument i never could answer when i saw you spending all your time and all your money in efforts for your fellowmen undiscouraged by ingratitude and careless of praise then i thought there is something divine in that mans life and that thought brought me here  the man looked around on the gathering congregation and he saw that there was no one whom he had drawn heavenward that had not also drawn thither myriads of others in his lifetime he had been scattering seeds of good around from hour to hour almost unconsciously and now he saw every seed springing up into a widening forest of immortal beauty and glory it seemed to him that there was to be no end of the numbers that flocked to claim him as their longexpected soul friend his heart was full and his face became as that of an angel as he looked up to one who seemed nearer than all and said this is thy love for me unworthy o jesus of thee and to thee and through thee are all things amen  amen as with chorus of many waters and mighty thunderings the sound swept onward and died far off in chiming echoes among the distant stars and the man awoke     a scene in jerusalem   it is now nearly noon the busiest and most bustling hour of the day yet the streets of the holy city seem deserted and silent as the grave the artisan has left his bench the merchant his merchandise the throngs of returned wanderers which this great national festival has brought up from every land of the earth and which have been for the last week carrying life and motion through every street seem suddenly to have disappeared here and there solitary footfalls like the last pattering rain drops after a shower awaken the echoes of the streets and here and there some lonely woman looks from the housetop with anxious and agitated face as if she would discern something in the far distance  alone or almost alone the few remaining priests move like whitewinged solitary birds over the gorgeous pavements of the temple and as they mechanically conduct the ministrations of the day cast significant glances on each other and pause here and there to converse in anxious whispers  ah there is one voice which they have often heard beneath those archesa voice which ever bore in it a mysterious and thrilling charmwhich they know will be hushed today chief priest scribe and doctor have all gone out in the death procession after him and these few remaining ones far from the excitement of the crowd and busied in calm and sacred duties find voices of anxious questioning rising from the depths of their own souls what if this indeed were the christ  but pass we on out of the city and what a surging tide of life and motion meets the eye as if all nations under heaven had dashed their waves of population on this judean shore a noisy wrathful tempestuous mob billow on billow waver and rally round some central object which it conceals from view parthians medes elamites dwellers in mesopotamia and egypt strangers of rome cretes and arabians jew and proselyte convoked from the ends of the earth throng in agitated concourse one on another one theme in every face on every tongue one name in every variety of accent and dialect passing from lip to lip jesus of nazareth  look on that manthe centre and cause of all this outburst he stands there alone the cross is ready it lies beneath his feet the rough hand of a brutal soldier has seized his robe to tear it from him another with stalwart arm is boring the holes gazing upward the while with a face of stupid unconcern there on the ground lie the hammer and the nails the hour the moment of doom is come look on this man as upward with deep sorrowing eyes he gazes towards heaven hears he the roar of the mob feels he the rough hand on his garment nay he sees not feels not from all the rage and tumult of the hour he is rapt away a sorrow deeper more absorbing more unearthly seems to possess him as upward with long gaze he looks to that heaven never before closed to his prayer to that god never before to him invisible that mournful heavensearching glance in its lonely anguish says but one thing lo i come to do thy will o god  through a life of sorrow the realized love of his father has shone like a precious and beautiful talisman in his bosom but now when desolation and anguish have come upon him as a whirlwind this last star has gone out in the darkness and jesus deserted by man and god stands there alone  alone no for undaunted by the cruel mob fearless in the strength of mortal anguish helpless yet undismayed stands the one blessed among women the royal daughter of a noble line the priestess to whose care was intrusted this spotless sacrifice she and her son last of a race of kings stand there despised rejected and disavowed by their nation to accomplish dread words of prophecy which have swept down for far ages to this hour  strange it is in this dark scene to see the likeness between mother and son deepening in every line of those faces as they stand thus thrown out by the dark background of rage and hate which like a storm cloud lowers around the same rapt absorbed calm intensity of anguish in both mother and son save only that while he gazes upward towards god she with like fervor gazes on him what to her is the deriding mob the coarse taunt the brutal abuse of it all she hears she feels nothing she sinks not faints not weeps not her whole being concentrates in the will to suffer by and with him to the last other hearts there are that beat for him others that press into the doomed circle and own him amid the scorn of thousands there may you see the clasped hands and upraised eyes of a magdalen the pale and steady resolve of john the weeping company of women who bewailed and lamented him but none dare press so near or seem so identical with him in his sufferings as this mother  and as we gaze on these two in human form surrounded by other human forms how strange the contrast how is it possible that human features and human lineaments essentially alike can be wrought into such heavenwide contrast man is he who stands there lofty and spotless in bleeding patience men also are those brutal soldiers alike stupidly ready at the word of command to drive the nail through quivering flesh or insensate wood men are those scowling priests and infuriate pharisees men also the shifting figures of the careless rabble who shout and curse without knowing why no visible glory shines round that head yet how spite of every defilement cast upon him by the vulgar rabble seems that form to be glorified what light is that in those eyes what mournful beauty in that face what solemn mysterious sacredness investing the whole form constraining from us the exclamation surely this is the son of god mans voice is breathing vulgar taunt and jeer he saved others himself he cannot save he trusted in god let him deliver him if he will have him and mans also clear sweet unearthly pierces that stormy mob saying father forgive them they know not what they do  but we draw the veil in reverence it is not ours to picture what the sun refused to shine upon and earth shook to behold  little thought those weeping women that stricken disciple that heartbroken mother how on some future day that crossemblem to them of deepest infamyshould blaze in the eye of all nations symbol of triumph and hope glittering on gorgeous fanes embroidered on regal banners associated with all that is revered and powerful on earth the roman ensign that waved on that mournful day symbol of highest earthly power is a thing mouldered and forgotten and over all the high places of old rome herself stands that mystical cross no longer speaking of earthly anguish and despair but of heavenly glory honor and immortality  theologians have endlessly disputed and philosophized on this great fact of atonement the bible tells only that this tragic event was the essential point without which our salvation could never have been secured but where lay the necessity they do not say what was that dread strait that either the divine one must thus suffer or man be lost who knoweth  to this question answer a thousand voices with each a different solution urged with equal confidenceeach solution to its framer as certain and sacred as the dread fact it explainsyet every one perhaps unsatisfactory to the deepquestioning soul the bible as it always does gives on this point not definitions or distinct outlines but imagesimages which lose all their glory and beauty if seized by the harsh hands of metaphysical analysis but inexpressibly affecting to the unlettered human heart which softens in gazing on their mournful and mysterious beauty christ is called our sacrifice our passover our atoning high priest and he himself while holding in his hands the emblem cup says it is my blood shed for many for the remission of sins let us reason on it as we will this story of the cross presented without explanation in the simple metaphor of the bible has produced an effect on human nature wholly unaccountable in every age and clime with every variety of habit thought and feeling from the cannibals of new zealand and madagascar to the most enlightened and scientific minds in christendom one feeling essentially homogeneous in its character and results has arisen in view of this cross there is something in it that strikes one of the great nerves of simple unsophisticated humanity and meets its wants as nothing else will ages ago paul declared to philosophizing greek and scornful roman that he was not ashamed of this gospel and alleged for his reason this very adaptedness to humanity a priori many would have said that paul should have told of christ living christ preaching christ working miracles not omitting also the pathetic history of how he sealed all with his blood but paul declared that he determined to know nothing else but christ crucified he said it was a stumbling block to the jew an absurdity to the greek yet he was none the less positive in his course true there was many then as now who looked on with the most philosophic and cultivated indifference the courtly festus as he settled his purple tunic declared he could make nothing of the matter only a dispute about one jesus who was dead and whom paul affirmed to be alive and perchance some athenian as he reclined on his ivory couch at dinner after the sermon on mars hill may have disposed of the matter very summarily and passed on to criticisms on samian wine and marble vases yet in spite of their disbelief this story of christ has outlived them their age and nation and is to this hour as fresh in human hearts as if it were just published this one jesus which was dead and whom paul affirmed to be alive is nominally at least the object of religious homage in all the more cultivated portions of the globe and to hearts scattered through all regions of the earth this same jesus is now a sacred and living name dearer than all household sounds all ties of blood all sweetest and nearest affections of humanity i am ready not only to be bound but also to die for the name of the lord jesus are words that have found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in every age since then that would if need were find no less echo in thousands now considering christ as a man and his death as a mere pathetic storyconsidering him as one of the great martyrs for truth who sealed it with his bloodthis result is wholly unaccountable other martyrs have died bravely and tenderly in their last hours bearing witness of the godlike that is in man but who so remembers them who so loves them to whom is any one of them a living presence a life an all yet so thousands look on jesus at this hour  nay it is because this story strikes home to every human bosom as an individual concern a thrilling voice speaks from this scene of anguish to every human bosom this is thy savior thy sin hath done this it is the appropriative words thine and mine which make this history different from any other history this was for me is the thought which has pierced the apathy of the greenlander and kindled the stolid clay of the hottentot and no human bosom has ever been found so low so lost so guilty so despairing that this truth once received has not had power to redeem regenerate and disenthrall christ so presented becomes to every human being a friend nearer than the mother who bore him and the more degraded the more hopeless and polluted is the nature the stronger comes on the living reaction if this belief is really and vividly enkindled with it but take away this appropriative individual element and this legend of jesuss death has no more power than any other he is to us no more than washington or socrates or howard and where is there not a touchstone to try every theory of atonement whatever makes a man feel that he is only a spectator an uninterested judge in this matter is surely astray from the idea of the bible whatever makes him feel that his sins have done this deed that he is bound soul and body to this deliverer though it may be in many points philosophically erroneous cannot go far astray  if we could tell the number of the stars and call them forth by name then perhaps might we solve all the mystic symbols by which the bible has shadowed forth the farlying necessities and reachingsforth of this event among principalities and powers and in ages to come but he who knows nothing of all this who shall so present the atonement as to bind and affiance human souls indissolubly to their redeemer does all that could be done by the highest and most perfect knowledge  the great object is accomplished when the soul rapt inspired feels the deep resolve                  remember thee     yea from the table of my memory     ill wipe away all trivial fond records     all saws of books all forms all pressures past     that youth and observation copied there     and thy commandment all alone shall live     within the book and volume of my brain     unmixed with baser matter     the old meeting house  sketch from the note book of an old gentleman   never shall i forget the dignity and sense of importance which swelled my mind when i was first pronounced old enough to go to meeting that eventful sunday i was up long before day and even took my sabbath suit to the window to ascertain by the first light that it actually was there just as it looked the night before with what complacency did i view myself completely dressed how did i count over the rows of yellow gilt buttons on my coat how my good mother grandmother and aunts fussed and twitched and pulled to make every thing set up and set down just in the proper place how my clean starched white collar was turned over and smoothed again and again and my golden curls twisted and arranged to make the most of me and last of all how i was cautioned not to be thinking of my clothes in truth i was in those days a very handsome youngster and it really is no more than justice to let the fact be known as there is nothing in my present appearance from which it could ever be inferred every body in the house successively asked me if i should be a good boy and sit still and not talk nor laugh and my mother informed me in terrorem that there was a tithing man who carried off naughty children and shut them up in a dark place behind the pulpit and that this tithing man mr zephaniah scranton sat just where he could see me this fact impressed my mind with more solemnity than all the exhortations which had preceded ita proof of the efficacy of facts above reason under shadow and power of this weighty truth i demurely took hold of my mothers forefinger to walk to meeting  the traveller in new england as he stands on some eminence and looks down on its rich landscape of golden grain and waving cornfield sees no feature more beautiful than its simple churches whose white taper fingers point upward amid the greenness and bloom of the distant prospects as if to remind one of the overshadowing providence whence all this luxuriant beauty flows and year by year as new ones are added to the number or succeed in the place of old ones there is discernible an evident improvement in their taste and architecture those modest doric little buildings with their white pillars green blinds and neat enclosures are very different affairs from those great uncouth mountains of windows and doors that stood in the same place years before to my childish eye however our old meeting house was an aweinspiring thing to me it seemed fashioned very nearly on the model of noahs ark and solomons temple as set forth in the pictures in my scripture catechismpictures which i did not doubt were authentic copies and what more respectable and venerable architectural precedent could any one desire its double rows of windows of which i knew the number by heart its doors with great wooden quirls over them its belfry projecting out at the east end its steeple and bell all inspired as much sense of the sublime in me as strasbourg cathedral itself and the inside was not a whit less imposing  how magnificent to my eye seemed the turniplike canopy that hung over the ministers head hooked by a long iron rod to the wall above and how apprehensively did i consider the question what would become of him if it should fall how did i wonder at the panels on either side of the pulpit in each of which was carved and painted a flaming red tulip bolt upright with its leaves projecting out at right angles and then at the grape vine bass relieved on the front with its exactly triangular bunches of grapes alternating at exact intervals with exactly triangular leaves to me it was an indisputable representation of how grape vines ought to look if they would only be straight and regular instead of curling and scrambling and twisting themselves into all sorts of slovenly shapes the area of the house was divided into large square pews boxed up with stout boards and surmounted with a kind of baluster work which i supposed to be provided for the special accommodation of us youngsters being the loopholes of retreat through which we gazed on the remarkabilia of the scene it was especially interesting to me to notice the coming in to meeting of the congregation the doors were so contrived that on entering you stepped down instead of upa construction that has more than once led to unlucky results in the case of strangers i remember once when an unlucky frenchman entirely unsuspicious of the danger that awaited him made entrance by pitching devoutly upon his nose in the middle of the broad aisle that it took three bunches of my grandmothers fennel to bring my risibles into any thing like composure such exhibitions fortunately for me were very rare but still i found great amusement in watching the distinctive and marked outlines of the various people that filled up the seats around me a yankee village presents a picture of the curiosities of every generation there from year to year they live on preserved by hard labor and regular habits exhibiting every peculiarity of manner and appearance as distinctly marked as when they first came from the mint of nature and as every body goes punctually to meeting the meeting house becomes a sort of museum of antiquitiesa general muster ground for past and present  i remember still with what wondering admiration i used to look around on the people that surrounded our pew on one side there was an old captain mclean and major mcdill a couple whom the mischievous wits of the village designated as captain mclean and captain mcfat and in truth they were a perfect antithesis a living exemplification of flesh and spirit captain mclean was a mournful lengthy consideratelooking old gentleman with a long face digressing into a long thin horny nose which when he applied his pocket handkerchief gave forth a melancholy minorkeyed sound such as a ghost might make using a pocket handkerchief in the long gallery of some old castle  close at his side was the doughty puffing captain mcdill whose fullorbed jolly visage was illuminated by a most valiant red nose shaped something like an overgrown doughnut and looking as if it had been thrown at his face and happened to hit in the middle then there was old israel peters with a wooden leg which tramped into meeting with undeviating regularity ten minutes before meeting time and there was jedediah stebbins a thin wistful moonshinylooking old gentleman whose mouth appeared as if it had been gathered up with a needle and thread and whose eyes seemed as if they had been bound with red tape and there was old benaiah stephens who used regularly to get up and stand when the minister was about half through his sermon exhibiting his tall figure long singlebreasted coat with buttons nearly as large as a tea plate his large black horn spectacles stretched down on the extreme end of a very long nose and vigorously chewing meanwhile on the bunch of caraway which he always carried in one hand then there was aunt sally stimpson and old widow smith and a whole bevy of little dried old ladies with small straight black bonnets tight sleeves to the elbow long silk gloves and great fans big enough for a windmill and of a hot day it was a great amusement to me to watch the bobbing of the little black bonnets which showed that sleep had got the better of their owners attention and the sputter and rustling of the fans when a more profound nod than common would suddenly waken them and set them to fanning and listening with redoubled devotion there was deacon dundas a great wagon load of an old gentleman whose ample pockets looked as if they might have held half the congregation who used to establish himself just on one side of me and seemed to feel such entire confidence in the soundness and capacity of his pastor that he could sleep very comfortably from one end of the sermon to the other occasionally to be sure one of your officious blue flies who as every body knows are amazingly particular about such matters would buzz into his mouth or flirt into his ears a passing admonition as to the impropriety of sleeping in meeting when the good old gentleman would start open his eyes very wide and look about with a resolute air as much as to say i wasnt asleep i can tell you and then setting himself in an edifying posture of attention you might perceive his head gradually settling back his mouth slowly opening wider and wider till the good man would go off again soundly asleep as if nothing had happened  it was a good orthodox custom of old times to take every part of the domestic establishment to meeting even down to the faithful dog who as he had supervised the labors of the week also came with due particularity to supervise the worship of sunday i think i can see now the fitting out on a sunday morningthe one wagon or two as the case might be tackled up with an old gray or an old bay with a buffalo skin over the seat by way of cushion and all the family in their sunday best packed in for meeting while master bose watch or towser stood prepared to be an outguard and went meekly trotting up hill and down dale in the rear arrived at meeting the canine part of the establishment generally conducted themselves with great decorum lying down and going to sleep as decently as any body present except when some of the businessloving bluebottles aforesaid would make a sortie upon them when you might hear the snap of their jaws as they vainly sought to lay hold of the offender now and then between some of the sixthlies seventhlies and eighthlies you might hear some old patriarch giving himself a rousing shake and pitpatting soberly up the aisles as if to see that every thing was going on properly after which he would lie down and compose himself to sleep again and certainly this was as improving a way of spending sunday as a good christian dog could desire  but the glory of our meeting house was its singers seatthat empyrean of those who rejoiced in the divine mysterious art of fasollaing who by a distinguishing grace and privilege could raise and fall the cabalistical eight notes and move serene through the enchanted region of flats sharps thirds fifths and octaves  there they sat in the gallery that lined three sides of the house treble counter tenor and bass each with its appropriate leaders and supporters there were generally seated the bloom of our young people sparkling modest and blushing girls on one side with their ribbons and finery making the place where they sat as blooming and lively as a flower garden and fiery forward confident young men on the other in spite of its being a meeting house we could not swear that glances were never given and returned and that there was not often as much of an approach to flirtation as the distance and the sobriety of the place would admit certain it was that there was no place where our village coquettes attracted half so many eyes or led astray half so many hearts  but i have been talking of singers all this time and neglected to mention the magnus apollo of the whole concern the redoubtable chorister who occupied the seat of honor in the midst of the middle gallery and exactly opposite to the minister certain it is that the good man if he were alive would never believe it for no person ever more magnified his office or had a more thorough belief in his own greatness and supremacy than zedekiah morse methinks i can see him now as he appeared to my eyes on that first sunday when he shot up from behind the gallery as if he had been sent up by a spring he was a little man whose fieryred hair brushed straight up on the top of his head had an appearance as vigorous and lively as real flame and this added to the ardor and determination of all his motions had obtained for him the surname of the burning bush he seemed possessed with the very soul of song and from the moment he began to sing looked alive all over till it seemed to me that his whole body would follow his hair upwards fairly rapt away by the power of harmony with what an air did he sound the important fasolla in the ears of the waiting gallery who stood with open mouths ready to seize their pitch preparatory to their general set to how did his ascending and descending arm astonish the zephyrs when once he laid himself out to the important work of beating time how did his little head whisk from side to side as now he beat and roared towards the ladies on his right and now towards the gentlemen on his left it used to seem to my astonished vision as if his form grew taller his arm longer his hair redder and his little green eyes brighter with every stave and particularly when he perceived any falling off of time or discrepancy in pitch with what redoubled vigor would he thump the gallery and roar at the delinquent quarter till every mothers son and daughter of them skipped and scrambled into the right place again  o it was a fine thing to see the vigor and discipline with which he managed the business so that if on a hot drowsy sunday any part of the choir hung back or sung sleepily on the first part of a verse they were obliged to bestir themselves in good earnest and sing three times as fast in order to get through with the others kiah morse was no advocate for your dozy drawling singing that one may do at leisure between sleeping and waking i assure you indeed he got entirely out of the graces of deacon dundas and one or two other portly leisurely old gentlemen below who had been used to throw back their heads shut up their eyes and take the comfort of the psalm by prolonging indefinitely all the notes the first sunday after kiah took the music in hand the old deacon really rubbed his eyes and looked about him for the psalm was sung off before he was ready to get his mouth opened and he really looked upon it as a most irreverent piece of business  but the glory of kiahs art consisted in the execution of those good old billowy compositions called fuguing tunes where the four parts that compose the choir take up the song and go racing around one after another each singing a different set of words till at length by some inexplicable magic they all come together again and sail smoothly out into a rolling sea of song i remember the wonder with which i used to look from side to side when treble tenor counter and bass were thus roaring and foamingand it verily seemed to me as if the psalm was going to pieces among the breakersand the delighted astonishment with which i found that each particular verse did emerge whole and uninjured from the storm  but alas for the wonders of that old meeting house how they are passed away even the venerable building itself has been pulled down and its fragments scattered yet still i retain enough of my childish feelings to wonder whether any little boy was gratified by the possession of those painted tulips and grape vines which my childish eye used to covet and about the obtaining of which in case the house should ever be pulled down i devised so many schemes during the long sermons and services of summer days i have visited the spot where it stood but the modern fairlooking building that stands in its room bears no trace of it and of the various familiar faces that used to be seen inside not one remains verily i must be growing old and as old people are apt to spin long stories i check myself and lay down my pen     the newyears gift   the sparkling ice and snow covered hill and valleytree and bush were glittering with diamondsthe broad coarse rails of the fence shone like bars of solid silver while little fringes of icicles glittered between each bar  in the yard of yonder dwelling the scarlet berries of the mountain ash shine through a transparent casing of crystal and the sable spruces and white pines powdered and glittering with the frost have assumed an icy brilliancy the eaves of the house the door knocker the pickets of the fence the honeysuckles and seringas once the boast of summer are all alike polished varnished and resplendent with their winter trappings now gleaming in the last rays of the early sunset  within that large oldfashioned dwelling might you see an ample parlor all whose adjustments and arrangements speak of security warmth and home enjoyment of money spent not for show but for comfort thick crimson curtains descend in heavy folds over the embrasures of the windows and the ample hearth and wide fireplace speak of the customs of the good old times ere that gloomy unpoetic unsocial gnomethe airtighthad monopolized the place of the blazing fireside  no dark airtight however filled our ancient chimney but there was a genuine oldfashioned fire of the most approved architecture with a gallant backlog and forestick supporting and keeping in order a crackling pile of dry wood that was whirring and blazing warm welcome for all whom it might concern occasionally bursting forth into most portentous and earnest snaps which rung through the room with a genuine hospitable emphasis as if the fire was enjoying himself and having a good time and wanted all hands to draw up and make themselves at home with him  so looked that parlor to me when tired with a long days ride i found my way into it just at evening and was greeted with a hearty welcome from my old friend colonel winthrop  in addition to all that i have already described let the reader add if he pleases the vision of a wide and ample tea table covered with a snowy cloth on which the servants are depositing the evening meal  i had not seen winthrop for years but we were old college friends and i had gladly accepted an invitation to renew our ancient intimacy by passing the new years season in his family i found him still the same hale kindly cheery fellow as in days of old though time had taken the same liberty with his handsome head that jack frost had with the cedars and spruces out of doors in giving to it a graceful and becoming sprinkle of silver  here you are my dear fellow said he shaking me by both handsjust in season for the ham and chickenscoffee all smoking my dear he added to a motherlylooking woman who now entered heres john i beg pardon mr stuart as he spoke two bold handsome boys broke into the room accompanied by a huge newfoundland dogall as full of hilarity and abundant animation as an afternoon of glorious skating could have generated  ha tom and nedyou roguesyou dont want any supper tonight i suppose said the father gayly come up here and be introduced to my old friend here they come said he as one by one the opening doors admitted the various children to the summons of the evening meal here presenting a tall young girl is our eldest beginning to think herself a young lady on the strength of being fifteen years old and wearing her hair tucked up and here is eliza said he giving a pull to a blooming roguish girl of ten with large saucy black eyes and here is willie a bashful blushing little fellow in a checked apron and now wheres the little queenwheres her majestywheres ally  a golden head of curls was at this instant thrust timidly in at the door and i caught a passing glimpse of a pair of great blue eyes but the head curls eyes and all instantly vanished though a little fat dimpled hand was seen holding on to the door and swinging it back and forward ally dear come in said the mother in a tone of encouragement come in ally come in was repeated in various tones by each child but brother tom pushed open the door and taking the little recusant in his arms brought her fairly in and deposited her on her fathers knee she took firm hold of his coat and then turned and gazed shyly upon meher large splendid blue eyes gleaming through her golden curls it was evident that this was the pet lamb of the fold and she was just at that age when babyhood is verging into childhoodan age often indefinitely prolonged in a large family where the universal admiration that waits on every look and motion and word of the baby and the multiplied monopolies and privileges of the baby estate seem by universal consent to extend as long and as far as possible and why not thus delay the little bark of the child among the flowery shores of its first edendefer them as we may the hard the real the cold commonplace of life comes on all too soon  this is our new years gift said winthrop fondly caressing the curly head ally tell the gentleman how old you are  i sall be four next new ears said the little one while all the circle looked applause  ally tell the gentleman what you are said brother ned  ally looked coquettishly at me as if she did not know whether she should favor me to that extent and the young princess was further solicited  tell him what ally is said the oldest sister with a patronizing air  papas new ears pesent said my little lady at last  and mammas too said the mother gently amid the applauses of the admiring circle  winthrop looked apologetically at me and said we all spoil herthats a factevery one of us down to rover there who lets her tie tippets round his neck and put bonnets on his head and hug and kiss him to a degree that would disconcert any other dog in the world  if ever beauty and poetic grace was an apology for spoiling it was in this case every turn of the bright head every change of the dimpled face and round and chubby limbs was a picture and within the little form was shrined a heart full of love and running over with compassion and good will for every breathing thing with feelings so sensitive that it was papas delight to make her laugh and cry with stories and to watch in the blue earnest mirror of her eye every change and turn of his narration as he took her through long fairy tales and oldfashioned giant and ghost legends purely for his own amusement and much reprimanded all the way by mamma for filling the childs head with nonsense  it was now however time to turn from the beauty to the substantial realities of the supper table i observed that allys high chair was stationed close by her fathers side and ever and anon while gayly talking he would slip into her rosy little mouth some choice bit from his plate these notices and attentions seeming so instinctive and habitual that they did not for a moment interrupt the thread of the conversation once or twice i caught a glimpse of rovers great rough nose turned anxiously up to the little chair whereat the small white hand forthwith slid something into his mouth though by what dexterity it ever came out from the great black jaws undevoured was a mystery when the supply of meat on the small ladys plate was exhausted i observed the little hand slyly slipping into her fathers provision grounds and with infinite address abstracting small morsels whereat there was much mysterious winking between the father and the other children and considerable tittering among the younger ones though all in marvellous silence as it was deemed best policy not to appear to notice allys tricks lest they should become too obstreperous  in the course of the next day i found myself to all intents and purposes as much part and parcel of the family as if i had been born and bred among them i found that i had come in a critical time when secrets were plenty as blackberries it being new years week all the little hoarded resources of the children both of money and of ingenuity were in brisk requisition getting up new years presents for each other and for father and mother the boys had their little tin savings banks where all the stray pennies of the year had been carefully hoardedall that had been got by blacking papas boots or by piling wood or weeding in the gardenmingled with some fortunate additions which had come as windfalls from some liberal guest or friend all now were poured out daily on tables on chairs on stools and counted over with wonderful earnestness  my friend though in easy circumstances was somewhat oldfashioned in his notions he never allowed his children spending money except such as they fairly earned by some exertions of their own let them do something he would say to make it fairly theirs and their generosity will then have some significanceit is very easy for children to be generous on their parents money great were the comparing of resources and estimates of property at this time tom and ned who were big enough to saw wood and hoe in the garden had accumulated the vast sum of three dollars each and walked about with their hands in their pockets and talked largely of purchases like gentlemen of substance they thought of getting mamma a new muff and papa a writing desk besides trinkets innumerable for sisters and a big doll for ally but after they had made one expedition to a neighboring town to inquire prices i observed that their expectations were greatly moderated as to little willie him of the checked apron his whole earthly substance amounted to thirtyseven cents yet there was not a member of the whole family circle including the servants that he could find it in his heart to leave out of his remembrance i ingratiated myself with him immediately and twenty times a day did i count over his money to him and did sums innumerable to show how much would be left if he got this that or the other article which he was longing to buy for father or mother i proved to him most invaluable by helping him to think of certain small sixpenny and fourpenny articles that would be pretty to give to sisters making out with marbles for tom and ned and a very valiantlooking sugar horse for ally miss emma had the usual resource of young ladies flosses worsted and knitting and crochet needles and busy fingers and she was giving private lessons daily to eliza to enable her to get up some napkin rings and book marks for the allimportant occasion a gentle air of bustle and mystery pervaded the whole circle i was intrusted with so many secrets that i could scarcely make an observation or take a turn about the room without being implored to remembernot to tellnot to let papa know this or mamma that i was not to let papa know how the boys were going to buy him a new inkstand with a pen rack upon it which was entirely to outshine all previous inkstands nor tell mamma about the crochet bag that emma was knitting for her on all sides were mysterious whisperings and showing of things wrapped in brown paper glimpses of which through some inadvertence were always appearing to the public eye there were close counsels held behind doors and in corners and suddenly broken off when some particular member of the family appeared there were flutters of vanishing book marks which were always whisked away when a door opened and incessant ejaculations of admiration and astonishment from one privileged looker or another on things which might not be mentioned to or beheld by others  papa and mamma behaved with the utmost circumspection and discretion and though surrounded on all sides by such pitfalls and labyrinths of mystery moved about with an air of the most unconscious simplicity possible  but little ally from her privileged character became a very spoilsport in the proceedings her small fingers were always pulling open parcels prematurely or lifting pocket handkerchiefs ingeniously thrown down over mysterious articles and thus disconcerting the very profoundest surprises that ever were planned and were it not that she was still within the bounds of the kingly state of babyhood and therefore could be held to do no wrong she would certainly have fallen into general disgrace but then it was ally and that was apology for all things and the exploit was related in half whispers as so funny so cunning that miss curlypate was in nowise disconcerted at the head shakes and naughty allys that visited her offences  what dis said she one morning as she was rummaging over some packages indiscreetly left on the sofa  o emma see ally exclaimed eliza darting forward but too late for the flaxen curls and blue eyes of a wax doll had already appeared  now shell know all about it said eliza despairingly  ally looked in astonishment as dollys visage promptly disappeared from her view and then turned to pursue her business in another quarter of the room where spying something glittering under the sofa she forthwith pulled out and held up to public view a crochet bag sparkling with innumerable steel fringes  o what be dis she exclaimed again  miss emma sprang to the rescue while all the other children with a burst of exclamations turned their eyes on mamma mamma very prudently did not turn her head and appeared to be lost in reflection though she must have been quite deaf not to have heard the loud whispersits mammas bag only think dont you think tom ally pulled out mammas bag and held it right up before her dont you think shell find out  master tom valued himself greatly on the original and profound ways he had of adapting his presents to the tastes of the receiver without exciting suspicion for example he would come up into his mothers room all booted and coated for a ride to town jingling his purse gleefully and begin  mother mother which do you like best pink or blue  that might depend on circumstances my son  well but mother for a neck ribbon for example suppose somebody was going to buy you a neck ribbon  why blue would be the most suitable for me i think  well but mother which should you think was the best a neck ribbon or a book  what book it would depend something on that  why as good a book as a fellow could get for thirtyseven cents says tom  well on the whole i think i should prefer the ribbon  there ned says tom coming down the stairs ive found out just what mother wants without telling her a word about it  but the crowning mystery of all the great family arcana the thing that was going to astonish papa and mamma past all recovery was certain projected book marks that little ally was going to be made to work for them this bold scheme was projected by miss emma and she had armed herself with a whole paper of sugar plums to be used as adjuvants to moral influence in case the discouragements of the undertaking should prove too much for allys patience  as to ally she felt all the dignity of the enterpriseher whole little soul was absorbed in it seated on emmas knee with the needle between her little fat fingers and holding the board very tight as if she was afraid it would run away from her she very gravely and carefully stuck the needle in every place but the rightpricked her pretty fingersate sugar plumsstopping now to pat rover and now to stroke pussyletting fall her thimble and bustling down to pick it upoccasionally taking an episodical race round the room with rover during which time sister emma added a stitch or two to the work  i would not wish to have been required on oath to give in my undisguised opinion as to the number of stitches the little one really put into her present but she had a most genuine and firm conviction that she worked every stitch of it herself and when on returning from a scamper with pussy she found one or two letters finished she never doubted that the whole was of her own execution and of course thought that working book marks was one of the most delightful occupations in the world it was all that her little heart could do to keep from papa and mamma the wonderful secret every evening she would bustle about her father with an air of such great mystery and seek to pique his curiosity by most skilful hints such as  i know somefing but i sant tell you  not tell me o ally why not  o its abouta new ears pes  ally ally resounds from several voices dont you tell  no i santbut you are going to have a new ears pesant and so is mamma and you cant dess what it is  cant i  no and i sant tell you  now ally said papa pretending to look aggrieved  well its going to besomefin worked  ally be careful said emma  yes ill be very tareful its somefinweall prettysomefin to put in a book youll find out about it by and by  i think im in a fair way to said the father  the conversation now digressed to other subjects and the nurse came in to take ally to bed who as she kissed her father in the fulness of her heart added a fresh burst of information papa said she in an earnest whisper that fin is about so longmeasuring on her fat little arm  a fin ally why you are not going to give me a fish are you  i mean that thing said ally speaking the word with great effort and getting quite red in the face  o that thing i beg pardon my lady that puts another face on the communication said the father stroking her head fondly as he bade her good night  the child can talk plainer than she does said the father but we are all so delighted with her little hottentot dialect that i dont know but she will keep it up till she is twenty                                       it now wanted only three days of the new year when a sudden and deadly shadow fell on the dwelling late so busy and joyousa shadow from the grave and it fell on the flower of the gardenthe starthe singing birdthe loved and loving ally  she was stricken down at once in the flush of her innocent enjoyment by a fever which from the first was ushered in with symptoms the most fearful  all the bustle of preparation ceasedthe presents were forgotten or lay about unfinished as if no one now had a heart to put their hand to any thing while up in her little crib lay the beloved one tossing and burning with restless fever and without power to recognize any of the loved faces that bent over her  the doctor came twice a day with a heavy step and a face in which anxious care was too plainly written and while he was there each member of the circle hung with anxious imploring faces about him as if to entreat him to save their darling but still the deadly disease held on its relentless course in spite of all that could be done  i thought myself prepared to meet gods will in any form it might come said winthrop to me but this one thing i had forgotten it never entered into my head that my little ally could die  the evening before new years the deadly disease seemed to be progressing more rapidly than ever and when the doctor came for his evening call he found all the family gathered in mournful stillness around the little crib  i suppose said the father with an effort to speak calmly that this may be her last night with us  the doctor made no answer and the whole circle of brothers and sisters broke out into bitter weeping  it is just possible that she may live till tomorrow said the doctor  tomorrowher birthday said the mother o ally ally  wearily passed the watches of that night each brother and sister had kissed the pale little cheek to bid farewell and gone to their rooms to sob themselves to sleep and the father and mother and doctor alone watched around the bed o what a watch is that which despairing love keeps waiting for death poor rover the companion of allys gayer hours resolutely refused to be excluded from the sick chamber stretched under the little crib he watched with unsleeping eyes every motion of the attendants and as often as they rose to administer medicine or change the pillow or bathe the head he would rise also and look anxiously over the side of the crib as if he understood all that was passing  about an hour past midnight the child began to change her moans became fainter and fainter her restless movements ceased and a deep and heavy sleep settled upon her  the parents looked wistfully on the doctor it is the last change he said she will probably pass away before the daybreak  heavier and deeper grew that sleep and to the eye of the anxious watchers the little face grew paler and paler yet by degrees the breathing became regular and easy and a gentle moisture began to diffuse itself over the whole surface a new hope began to dawn on the minds of the parents as they pointed out these symptoms to the doctor  all things are possible with god said he in answer to the inquiring looks he met and it may be that she will yet live  an hour more passed and the rosy glow of the new years morning began to blush over the snowy whiteness of the landscape far off from the window could be seen the kindling glow of a glorious sunrise looking all the brighter for the dark pines that half veiled it from view and now a straight and glittering beam shot from the east into the still chamber it fell on the golden hair and pale brow of the child lighting it up as if an angel had smiled on it and slowly the large blue eyes unclosed and gazed dreamily around  ally ally said the father bending over her trembling with excitement  you are going to have a new ears pesent whispered the little one faintly smiling  i believe from my heart that you are sir said the doctor who stood with his fingers on her pulse she has passed through the crisis of the disease and we may hope  a few hours turned this hope to glad certainty for with the elastic rapidity of infant life the signs of returning vigor began to multiply and ere evening the little one was lying in her fathers arms answering with languid smiles to the overflowing proofs of tenderness which every member of the family was showering upon her  see my children said the father gently this dear one is our new years present what can we render to god in return     the old oak of andover  a revery   silently with dreamy languor the fleecy snow is falling through the windows flowery with blossoming geranium and heliotrope through the downward sweep of crimson and muslin curtain one watches it as the wind whirls and sways it in swift eddies  right opposite our house on our mount clear is an old oak the apostle of the primeval forest once when this place was all wildwood the man who was seeking a spot for the location of the buildings of phillips academy climbed this oak using it as a sort of green watchtower from whence he might gain a view of the surrounding country age and time since then have dealt hardly with the stanch old fellow his limbs have been here and there shattered his back begins to look mossy and dilapidated but after all there is a piquant decided air about him that speaks the old age of a tree of distinction a kingly oak today i see him standing dimly revealed through the mist of falling snows tomorrows sun will show the outline of his gnarled limbsall rose color with their soft snow burden and again a few months and spring will breathe on him and he will draw a long breath and break out once more for the three hundredth time perhaps into a vernal crown of leaves i sometimes think that leaves are the thoughts of trees and that if we only knew it we should find their lifes experience recorded in them our oak what a crop of meditations and remembrances must he have thrown forth leafing out century after century awhile he spake and thought only of red deer and indians of the trillium that opened its white triangle in his shade of the scented arbutus fair as the pink ocean shell weaving her fragrant mats in the moss at his feet of feathery ferns casting their silent shadows on the checkerberry leaves and all those sweet wild nameless halfmossy things that live in the gloom of forests and are only desecrated when brought to scientific light laid out and stretched on a botanic bier sweet old forest dayswhen blue jay and yellow hammer and bobalink made his leaves merry and summer was a long opera of such music as mozart dimly dreamed but then came human kind bustling beneath wondering fussing exploring measuring treading down flowers cutting down trees scaring bobalinksand andover as men say began to be settled  staunch men were theythese puritan fathers of andover the old oak must have felt them something akin to himself such strong wrestling limbs had they so gnarled and knotted were they yet so outbursting with a green and vernal crown yearly springing of noble and generous thoughts rustling with leaves which shall be for the healing of nations  these men were content with the hard dry crust for themselves that they might sow seeds of abundant food for us their children men out of whose hardness in enduring we gain leisure to be soft and graceful through whose poverty we have become rich like moses they had for their portion only the pain and weariness of the wilderness leaving to us the fruition of the promised land let us cherish for their sake the old oak beautiful in its age as the broken statue of some antique wrestler brown with time yet glorious in its suggestion of past achievement  i think all this the more that i have recently come across the following passage in one of our religious papers the writer expresses a kind of sentiment which one meets very often upon this subject and leads one to wonder what glamour could have fallen on the minds of any of the descendants of the puritans that they should cast nettles on those honored graves where they should be proud to cast their laurels  it is hard he says for a lover of the beautifulnot a mere lover but a believer in its divinity alsoto forgive the puritans or to think charitably of them it is hard for him to keep forefathers day or to subscribe to the plymouth monument hard to look fairly at what they did with the memory of what they destroyed rising up to choke thankfulness for they were as onesided and narrowminded a set of men as ever lived and saw one of truths faces onlythe hard stern practical face without loveliness without beauty and only half dear to god the puritan flew in the face of facts not because he saw them and disliked them but because he did not see them he saw foolishness lying stealing worldlinessthe very mammon of unrighteousness rioting in the world and bearing swayand he ran full tilt against the monster hating it with a very mortal and mundane hatred and anxious to see it bite the dust that his own horn might be exalted it was in truth only another horn of the old dilemma tossing and goring grace and beauty and all the loveliness of life as if they were the enemies instead of the sure friends of god and man  now to those who say this we must ask the question with which socrates of old pursued the sophist what is beauty if beauty be only physical if it appeal only to the senses if it be only an enchantment of graceful forms sweet sounds then indeed there might be something of truth in this sweeping declaration that the puritan spirit is the enemy of beauty  the very root and foundation of all artistic inquiry lies here what is beauty and to this question god forbid that we christians should give a narrower answer than plato gave in the old times before christ arose for he directs the aspirant who would discover the beautiful to consider of greater value the beauty existing in the soul than that existing in the body more gracefully he teaches the same doctrine when he tells us that there are two kinds of venus beauty the one the elder who had no mother and was the daughter of uranus heaven whom we name the celestial the other younger daughter of jupiter and dione whom we call the vulgar  now if disinterestedness faith patience piety have a beauty celestial and divine then were our fathers worshippers of the beautiful if highmindedness and spotless honor are beautiful things they had those what work of art can compare with a lofty and heroic life is it not better to be a moses than to be a michael angelo making statues of moses is not the life of paul a sublimer work of art than raphaels cartoons are not the patience the faith the undying love of mary by the cross more beautiful than all the madonna paintings in the world if then we would speak truly of our fathers we should say that having their minds fixed on that celestial beauty of which plato speaks they held in slight esteem that more common and earthly  should we continue the parable in platos manner we might say that the earthly and visible venus the outward grace of art and nature was ordained of god as a priestess through whom men were to gain access to the divine invisible one but that men in their blindness ever worship the priestess instead of the divinity  therefore it is that great reformers so often must break the shrines and temples of the physical and earthly beauty when they seek to draw men upward to that which is high and divine  christ says of john the baptist what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are clothed in soft raiment are in kings palaces so was it when our fathers came here there were enough wearing soft raiment and dwelling in kings palaces life in papal rome and prelatic england was weighed down with blossoming luxury there were abundance of people to think of pictures and statues and gems and cameos vases and marbles and all manner of deliciousness the world was all drunk with the enchantments of the lower venus and it was needful that these men should come baptistlike in the wilderness in raiment of camels hair we need such men now art they tell us is waking in america a love of the beautiful is beginning to unfold its wings but what kind of art and what kind of beauty are we to fill our houses with pictures and gems and to see that even our drinking cup and vase is wrought in graceful pattern and to lose our reverence for selfdenial honor and faith  is our venus to be the frail insnaring aphrodite or the starry divine urania     our wood lot in winter   our wood lot yes we have arrived at the dignity of owning a wood lot and for us simple folk there is something invigorating in the thought to own even a small spot of our dear old mother earth hath in it a relish of something stimulating to human nature to own a meadow with all its thousandfold fringes of grasses its broidery of monthly flowers and its outriders of birds and bees and goldwinged insectsthis is something that establishes ones heart to own a clover patch or a buckwheat field is like possessing a selfmoving manufactory for perfumes and sweetness but a wood lot rustling with dignified old treesit makes a man rise in his own esteem he might take off his hat to himself at the moment of acquisition  we do not marvel that the landacquiring passion becomes a mania among our farmers and particularly we do not wonder at a passion for wood land that wide deep chasm of conscious selfpoverty and emptiness which lies at the bottom of every human heart making men crave property as something to add to ones own bareness and to ballast ones own specific levity is sooner filled by land than any thing else  your hoary new england farmer walks over his acres with a grim satisfaction he sets his foot down with a hard stamp here is reality no moonshine bank stock no swindling railroads here is his bank and there is no defaulter here all is true solid and satisfactory he seems anchored to this life by it so pope with fine tact makes the old miser making his will on his death bed after parting with every thing die clinging to the possession of his land he disposes with many a groan of this and that house and this and that stock and security but at last the manor is proposed to him            the manor hold he cried     not that i cannot part with thatand died  in such terms we discoursed yesterday herr professor and myself while jogging along in an oldfashioned chaise to inspect a few acres of wood lot the acquisition of which had let us with great freshness into these reflections  does any fair lady shiver at the idea of a drive to the woods on the first of february let me assure her that in the coldest season nature never wants her ornaments full worth looking at  see here for instancelet us stop the old chaise and get out a minute to look at this brookone of our last summers pets what is he doing this winter let us at least say how do you do to him ah here he is and he and jack frost together have been turning the little gap in the old stone wall through which he leaped down to the road into a little grotto of antiparos some old rough rails and boards that dropped over it are sheathed in plates of transparent silver the trunks of the black alders are mailed with crystal and the witchhazel and yellow osiers fringing its sedgy borders are likewise shining through their glossy covering around every stem that rises from the water is a glittering ring of ice the tags of the alder and the red berries of last summers wild roses glitter now like a ladys pendant as for the brook he is wide awake and joyful and where the roof of sheet ice breaks away you can see his yellowbrown waters rattling and gurgling among the stones as briskly as they did last july down he springs over the glossycoated stone wall throwing new sparkles into the fairy grotto around him and widening daily from melting snows and such other godsends he goes chattering off under yonder mossy stone bridge and we lose sight of him it might be fancy but it seemed that our watery friend tipped us a cheery wink as he passed saying fine weather sir and madam nice times these and in april youll find us all right the flowers are making up their finery for the next season theres to be a splendid display in a month or two  then the cloud lights of a wintry sky have a clear purity and brilliancy that no other months can rival the rose tints and the shading of rose tint into gold the flossy filmy accumulation of illuminated vapor that drifts across the sky in a january afternoon are beauties far exceeding those of summer  neither are trees as seen in winter destitute of their own peculiar beauty if it be a gorgeous study in summer time to watch the play of their abundant leafage we still may thank winter for laying bare before us the grand and beautiful anatomy of the tree with all its interlacing network of boughs knotted on each twig with the buds of next years promise the fleecy and rosy clouds look all the more beautiful through the dark lace veil of yonder magnificent elms and the downdrooping drapery of yonder willow hath its own grace of outline as it sweeps the bare snows and these comical old apple trees why in summer they look like so many plump green cushions one as much like another as possible but under the revealing light of winter every characteristic twist and jerk stands disclosed  one might moralize on thishow affliction which strips us of all ornaments and accessories and brings us down to the permanent and solid wood of our nature develops such wide differences in people who before seemed not much distinct  but here our ponys feet are now clinking on the icy path under the shadow of the white pines of our wood lot the path runs in a deep hollow and on either hand rise slopes dark and sheltered with the fragrant white pine white pines are favorites with us for many good reasons we love their balsamic breath the long slender needles of their leaves and above all the constant sibylline whisperings that never cease among their branches in summer the ground beneath them is paved with a soft and cleanly matting of their last years leaves and then their talking seems to be of coolness ever dwelling far up in their fringy waving hollows and now in winter time we find the same smooth floor for the heavy curtains above shut out the snow and the same voices above whisper of shelter and quiet you are welcome they say the north wind is gone to sleep we are rocking him in our cradles sit down and be quiet from the cold at the feet of these slumberous old pines we find many of our last summers friends looking as good as new the small roundleafed partridgeberry weaves its viny mat and lays out its scarlet fruit and here are blackberry vines with leaves still green though with a bluish tint not unlike what invades mortal noses in such weather here too are the bright varnished leaves of the indian pine and the vines of feathery green of which our christmas garlands are made and here undaunted though frozen to the very heart this cold day is many another leafy thing which we met last summer rejoicing each in its own peculiar flower what names they have received from scientific godfathers at the botanic fount we know not we have always known them by fairy nicknames of our ownthe pet names of endearment which lie between natures children and us in her domestic circle  there is something peculiarly sweet to us about a certain mystical dreaminess and obscurity in these wild wood tribes which we never wish to have brought out into the daylight of absolute knowledge every one of them was a selfdiscovered treasure of our childhood as much our own as if god had made it on purpose and presented it and it was ever a part of the joy to think we had found something that no one else knew and so musing on them we gave them names in our heart  we search about amid the sere yellow skeletons of last summers ferns if haply winter have forgotten one green leaf for our home vasein vain we rake freezing our fingers through our fur glovesthere is not one an icicle has pierced every heart and there are no fern leaves except those miniature ones which each plant is holding in its heart to be sent up in next summers hour of joy but here are mossestufts of all sorts the white crisp and crumbling fair as winter frostwork and here the feathery green of which french milliners make moss rose buds and here the cupmossthese we gather with some care frozen as they are to the wintry earth  now stumbling up this ridge we come to a little patch of hemlocks spreading out their green wings and making in the ravine a deep shelter where many a fresh springing thing is standing and where we gain much for our home vases these pines are motherly creatures one can think how it must rejoice the heart of a partridge or a rabbit to come from the dry whistling sweep of a deciduous forest under the homelike shadow of their branches as for the stork the fir trees are her house says the hebrew poet and our fir trees this winter give shelter to much small game often on the lightfallen snow i meet their little footprints they have a naive helpless innocent appearance these little tracks that softens my heart like a childs footprint not one of them is forgotten of our father and therefore i remember them kindly  and now with cold toes and fingers and arms full of leafy treasures we plod our way back to the chaise a pleasant song is in my ears from this old wood lotit speaks of green and cheerful patience in lifes hard weather not a scowling sullen endurance not a despairing handdropping resignation but a heart cheerfulness that holds on to every leaf and twig and flower and bravely smiles and keeps green when frozen to the very heart knowing that the winter is but for a season and that the sunshine and bird singings shall return and the last years dry flower stalk give place to the risen glorified flower     poems  the charmer        socrateshowever you and simmias appear to me as if you      wished to sift this subject more thoroughly and to be afraid like      children lest on the souls departure from the body winds should      blow it away                                                 upon this cebes said endeavor to teach us better socrates         perhaps there is a childish spirit in our breast that has such a      dread let us endeavor to persuade him not to be afraid of death      as of hobgoblins       but you must charm him every day said socrates until you      have quieted his fears       but whence o socrates he said can we procure a skilful      charmer for such a case now you are about to leave us       greece is wide cebes he replied and in it surely there are      skilful men and there are also many barbarous nations all of      which you should search seeking such a charmer sparing neither      money nor toil as there is nothing on which you can more      reasonably spend your moneylast conversation of socrates      with his disciples as narrated by plato in the phædo                                                we need that charmer for our hearts are sore       with longings for the things that may not be     faint for the friends that shall return no more       dark with distrust or wrung with agony      what is this life and what to us is death       whence came we whither go and where are those     who in a moment stricken from our side       passed to that land of shadow and repose      and are they all dust and dust must we become       or are they living in some unknown clime     shall we regain them in that faroff home       and live anew beyond the waves of time      o man divine on thee our souls have hung       thou wert our teacher in these questions high     but ah this day divides thee from our side       and veils in dust thy kindlyguiding eye      where is that charmer whom thou bidst us seek       on what far shores may his sweet voice be heard     when shall these questions of our yearning souls       be answered by the bright eternal word      so spake the youth of athens weeping round       when socrates lay calmly down to die     so spake the sage prophetic of the hour       when earths fair morning star should rise on high      they found him not those youths of soul divine       long seeking wandering

 a fresh and solemn splendor still is given     so doth this blessed consciousness awaking       breathe each day nearness unto thee and heaven      when sinks the soul subdued by toil to slumber       its closing eye looks up to thee in prayer     sweet the repose beneath thy wings oershading       but sweeter still to wake and find thee there      so shall it be at last in that bright morning       when the soul waketh and lifes shadows flee     o in that hour fairer than daylight dawning       shall rise the glorious thought i am with thee     christs voice in the soul        come ye

jarring discords and poor vanity     breathing like music over troubled waters       what gentle voice o christian speaks to thee      it is a strangernot of earth or earthly       by the serene deep

 come leave it all and seek that solitude       where thou shalt learn of me a purer life      when far behind the worlds great tumult dieth       thou shalt look back and wonder at its roar     but its far voice shall seem to thee a dream       its power to vex thy holier life be oer      there shalt thou learn the secret of a power       mine to bestow which heals the ills of living     to overcome by love to live by prayer       to conquer mans worst evils by forgiving   the end
