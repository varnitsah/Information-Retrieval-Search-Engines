6727115	lost leaders by andrew lang   london  kegan paul trench  co 1 paternoster square 1889     preface   these articles are reprinted by the permission of the editor from the daily news  they were selected and arranged by mr pett ridge who with the publishers will perhaps kindly take a share in the responsibility of republishing them     lost leaders   scotch rivers   september is the season of the second and lovelier youth of the river scenery of scotland  spring comes but slowly up that way it is june before the woods have quite clothed themselves  in april the angler or the sketcher is chilled by the east wind whirling showers of hail and even when the riverbanks are sweet with primroses the bluff tops of the border hills are often bleak with late snow  this state of things is less unpropitious to angling than might be expected  a hardy race of trout will sometimes rise freely to the artificial fly when the natural fly is destroyed and the angler is almost blinded with dusty snowflakes all through midsummer the scotch rivers lose their chief attractions  the bracken has not yet changed its green for the fairy gold the hue of its decay the woods wear a uniform and sombre green the waters are low and shrunken and angling is almost impossible  but with september the pleasant season returns for people who love to be quiet and go afishing or asketching  the hills put on a wonderful harmony of colours the woods rival the october splendours of english forests  the bends of the tweed below melrose and round mertouna scene that as scott says the river seems loth to leavemay challenge comparison with anything the thames can show at nuneham or cliefden  the angler too is as fortunate as the lover of the picturesque  the trout that have hidden themselves all summer or at best have cautiously nibbled at the worm bait now rise freely to the fly  wherever a yellow leaf drops from birch tree or elm the great trout are splashing and they are too eager to distinguish very subtly between flies of natures making and flies of fur and feather  it is a time when every one who can manage it should be by the waterside and should take with him if possible the posthumous work of sir thomas dick lauder on the rivers of scotland  this book as the author of rab and his friends tells us in the preface is a republication of articles written in 1848 on the death bed of the author a man of many accomplishments and of a most lovable nature  he would lie and dictate or write in pencil these happy and wistful memories of days passed by the banks of tweed and tyne  he did not care to speak of the northern waters of tay which the roman invaders compared to tiber of laxford the river of salmon or of the thundering spey  nor has he anything to say of the west and of galloway the country out of which young lochinvar came with its soft and broken hills like the lower spurs of the pyrenees and its streams now rushing down defiles of rock now stealing with slow foot through the plains  he confines himself to the limits of the scottish arcadia to the hills near edinburgh where ramsays gentle shepherd loved and sang in a rather affected way and to the main stream and the tributaries of the tweed  he tells with a humour like that of charles lamb in his account of his youthful search for the mysterious fountainhead of the new river how he sought among the pentland hills for the source of the brook that flowed past his own garden  the wandering stream led him through many a scene renowned in border history up to the heights whence marmion surveyed the scottish forces encamped on borough moor before the fatal day of flodden  these scenes are described with spirit and loving interest but it is by tweedside that the tourist will find his most pleasant guide in lauders book  just as cicero said of athens that in every stone you tread on a history so on tweedside by every nook and valley you find the place of a ballad a story or a legend  from tweeds source near the grave of the wizard merlin down to berwick and the sea the border keeps and towers are as frequent as castles on the rhine  each has its tradition its memory of lawless times which have become beautiful in the magic of poetry and the mist of the past  first comes neidpath castle with its vaulted hanging chamber in the roof and the rafter with the iron ring to which prisoners were hanged still remaining to testify to the lawless power of border lords  neidpath has a softer legend of the death of the lady of the house when her lover failed to recognize the features that had wasted with sorrow for his absence  lower down the river comes clovenfords with its memories of christopher north and peebles where king james sings that there was dancing and derray in his time and still lower ashiesteel where scott was young and happy and abbotsford where his fame and his misfortunes found him out  it was on a bright afternoon in late september that he died there and the mourners by his bed heard through the silence the murmuring of tweed how many other associations there are by the tributary rivers what a breath of pastoral melancholy  there is ettrick where the cautious lover in the old song of ettrick banks found a canny place of meeting  oakwood tower where michael scott the wizard wove his spells is a farm buildingthe haunted magicians room is a granary earlstone where thomas the rhymer dwelt and whence the two white deer recalled him to elfland and to the arms of the fairy queen is noted for its shawl manufactory  only yarrow still keeps its ancient quiet and the burn that was tinged by the blood of douglas is unstained by more commonplace dyes  all these changes make the rivers of scotland rather melancholy reading  thirty years have not passed since lauder died and how much he would miss if he could revisit his beloved water  spearing salmon by torchlight is a forbidden thing  the rocks are no longer lit up with the red glow they resound no longer with the shouts and splashing of the yeomen  you might almost as readily find a hart on harthope or a wild cat at catslack or a wolf at wolfcleugh as catch three stoneweight of trout in meggatwater 6  the days of guileless fish and fabulous draughts of trout are over  no sportsman need take three large baskets to the gala now as lauder did and actually filled them with thirtysix dozen of trout  the modern angler must not allow his expectations to be raised too highly by these stories  sport has become much more difficult in these times of rapidly growing population  it is a pleasant sight to see the weavers spending their afternoons beside the tweed it is such a sight as could not be witnessed by the closely preserved rivers of england  but the weavers have taught the trout caution and the dyes and various pollutions of trade have thinned their numbers  mr ruskin sees no hope in this state of things he preaches in the spirit of old hesiod that there is no piety in a race which defiles the holy waters but surely civilization even if it spoil sport and degrade scenery is better than a state of things in which the laird would hang up his foes to an iron ring in the roof  the hill of cowden knowes may be a less eligible place for lovers meetings than it was of old  but in those times the lord of cowden knowes is said by tradition to have had a way of putting his prisoners in barrels studded with iron nails and rolling them down a brae  this is the side of the good old times which should not be overlooked  it may not be pleasant to find blue dye and wool yarn in teviot but it is more endurable than to have to encounter the bandit barnskill who hewed his bed of flint scott says in minto crags  still the reading of the rivers of scotland leaves rather a sad impression on the reader and makes him ask once more if there is no way of reconciling the beauty of rude ages with the comforts and culture of civilization this is a question that really demands an answer though it is often put in a mistaken way  the teachings of mr ruskin and of his followers would bring us back to a time when printing was not and an engineer would have been burned for a wizard 8  but there is a point at which civilization and production must begin to respect the limits of the beautiful on which they so constantly encroach  who is to settle the limit and escape the charge of being either a dilettante and a sentimentalist on the one hand or a philistine on the other    salmonfishing   salmonfishing for this season is over and in spite of the fresh and open weather most anglers will feel that the time has come to close the flybook to wind up the reel and to consign the rod to its winter quarters  salmonfishing ceases to be very enjoyable when the snaw broo or melted snow from the hilltops begins to mix with the brown waters of tweed or tay when the fallen leaves hamper the hook and when the fish are becoming sluggish black and the reverse of comely  now the season of retrospect commences the time of the pleasures of memory and the delights of talking shop dear to anglers most sporting talk is dull to every one but the votaries of the particular amusement  few things can be drearier to the outsider than the conversation of cricketers unless it be the recondite lore which whistplayers bring forth from the depths of their extraordinary memories  but angling talk has a variety recounts an amount of incident and adventure and wakens a feeling of free air in a way with which the records of no other sport except perhaps deerstalking can compete  the salmon is beyond all rivalry the strongest and most beautiful and most cautious and artful of freshwater fishes  to capture him is not a task for slack muscles or an uncertain eye  there is even a slight amount of personal risk in the sport  the fisher must often wade till the water reaches above the waist in cold and rushing streams where his feet are apt to slip on the smooth stones or trip on the rough rocks beneath him  when the salmon takes the fly there is no time for picking steps  the line rushes out so swiftly as to cut the fingers if it touches them and then is the moment when the angler must follow the fish at the top of his speed  to stand still or to go cautiously in pursuit is to allow the salmon to run out with an enormous length of line the line is submergedtechnically speaking drownedin the water the strain of the supple rod is removed from the fish who finds the hook loose in his mouth and rubs it off against the bottom of the river  thus speed of foot in water or over rocks is a necessary quality in the angler at least in the northern angler  by the banks of the usk a contemplative man who likes to take things easily may find pretty sure footing on grassy slopes or on a gravelly bottom  but it is a different thing to hook a large salmon where the tweed foams under the bridge of yair down to the narrows and linns below  if the angler hesitates there he is lost  does he stand still and give the fish line  the astute creature cuts it against the sharp rocks below the bridge and the rod relieved of the weight leaps straight in the fishers hand and in his heart there is a sense of emptiness and sudden desolation  does he try to follow the chances are that his feet slip after one or two wild struggles he is on his back in the water and nearly strangled with his fishingbasket  in either case the fish goes on his way rejoicing and after the manner of his kind leaps out of the water once or twicea maddening sight  adventures like this are among the bitter memories of the angler  the fish that break away are monstrous animals imagination increases their bulk and fond desire paints them cleanrun and bright as silver  there are other chances of the anglers life scarcely less sad than this  when a hook breaks just as the salmon was losing strength was ceasing to struggle and beginning to sway with the mere force of the stream and to show his shining sideswhen a hook breaks at such a moment it is very hard to bear  the oath of ernulphus seems all too weak to express the feelings of the sportsman and his wrath against the wretched tacklemaker  again when the fish is actually conquered when he is being towed gently into some little harbour among the tall slim water grasses or into a pebbly cove or up to a green bank when the bitterness of struggle is past and he seems resigned and almost happy when at this crisis the clumsy gilly with the gaff scratches him rouses him to a last exertion and entangles the line so that the salmon breaks freethat is an experience to which language cannot do justice  the ancient painter drew his veil over the face of agamemnon present at his daughters sacrifice  silence and sympathy are all one can offer to the angler who has toiled all day and in this wise caught nothing  there is yet another very bitter sorrow  it is a hard thing for a man to leave town and hurry to a river in the west a river that perhaps he has known since he fished for minnows with a bent pin in happy childhood  the west is not a dry land effeminate tourists complain that the rain it raineth every day  but the heavy soft rain is the very life of an angler  it keeps the stream of that clear brown hue between porter and amber which he loves and it encourages the salmon to keep rushing from the estuary and the sea right up to the mountain loch where they rest  but suppose there is a dry summerand such things have been even in argyleshire  the heart of the tourist is glad within him but as the river shrinks and shrinks a silver thread among slimy green mosses in the streams a sheet of clear water in the pools the angler repines  day after sultry day goes by and there is no hope  there is a cloud on the distant hill it is only the smoke from some moor that has caught fire  the river grows so transparent that it is easy to watch the lazy fish sulking at the bottom  then comes a terrible temptation  men men calling themselves sportsmen have been known to fish in the innocent dewy morning with worm with black lob worm  worse remains behind  persons of ungoverned passions maddened by the sight of the fish are believed to have poached with rakehooks a cruel apparatus made of three hooks fastened back to back and loaded with lead  these are thrown over the fish and then struck into him with a jerk  but the mind willingly turns away from the contemplation of such actions  it is pleasanter to think of not unsuccessful days by lowland or highland streams when the sun was veiled the sky pearly grey the water as the people say in grand order  there is the artistic excitement of choosing the hook gaudy for a heavy water neat and modest for a clearer stream there is the feverish moment of adjusting rod and line while you mark a fish rising to himself  you begin to cast well above him and come gradually down till the fly lights on the place where he is lying  then there is a slow pull a break in the water a sudden strain at the line which flies through the rings of the rod  it is not well to give too much line best to follow his course as he makes off as if for berwick and the sea  once or twice he leaps clean into the air a flying bar of silver  then he sulks at the bottom a mere dead weight attempting devices only to be conjectured  a common plan now is to tighten the line and tap the butt end of the rod  this humane expedient produces effects not unlike neuralgia it may be supposed for the fish is off in a new fury  but rush after rush grows tamer till he is drawn within reach of the gaff and so on to the grassy bed where a tap on the head ends his sorrows and the colours on his shining side undulate in delicate and beautiful radiance  it may be dreadfully cruel as cruel as nature and human life but those who eat salmon or butchers meat cannot justly protest for they desiring the end have willed the means  as the angler walks home and watches the purple eildon grow grey in the twilight or sees the hills of mull delicately outlined between the faint gold of sky and sea it is not probable that his conscience reproaches him very fiercely  he has spent a day among the most shy and hidden beauties of nature surprising her here and there in places where unless he had gone afishing he might never have penetrated  he has set his skill against the strength and skill of the monarch of rivers and has mastered him among the haunts of fairies and beneath the ruined towers of feudalism  these are some of the delights that today end for a season 16    winter sports   people to whom cold means misery who hate to be braced and shudder at the word seasonable can have little difficulty in accounting for the origin of the sports of winter  they need only adapt to the circumstances that old lydian tradition which says that games of chance were invented during a great famine  men permitted themselves to eat only every second day and tried to forget their hunger in playing at draughts and dice  that is clearly the invention of a southern people which never had occasion to wish it could become oblivious of the weather as too many of us would like to be in england  such shivering and indolent folks may be inclined to say that skating and curling and wildfowlshooting and the other diversions which seduce the ablebodied from the warm precincts of the cheerful fire were only contrived to enable us to forget the state of the thermometer  whether or not that was the purpose of the first northerner who fixed sheepbones beneath his feet to course more smoothly over the frozen sound there can be no doubt that winter sports answer their presumed purpose  they keep up that glow which only exercise in the open air can give and promote the health which shows itself in the complexion  it is the young lady who interprets literally the scotch invitation come into the fire and who spoils the backs of library novels by holding them too near the comfortable hearth she it is who suffers from the ignoble and unbecoming liberties that winter takes with the human countenance  happier and wiser is she who studies the always living and popular dutch roll rather than the grecian bend and who blooms with continual health and good temper  our changeful climate affords so few opportunities of learning to skate that it is really extraordinary to find so much skill and to see feats so difficult and graceful  in canada where frost is a certainty and where the covered rinks make skating an indoor sport it is not odd that great perfection should be attained  but as fast as canadians bring over a new figure or a new trick it is picked up and critics may dispute as to whether the bold and dashing style of the english school of skaters is not preferable to the careful and smooth but somewhat pretty and niggling manner of the colonists  our skating stands to the canadian fashion somewhat as french does to english etching  we have the dash and the chic with skates which frenchmen show with the etchingneedle and the canadian on the other hand is apt to decline into the mere prettiness which is the fault of english etchers  skating has been within the last few years a very progressive art there was a time when mere speed and the grace of speed satisfied most amateurs  the ideal spot for skating in those days must have been the lakes where wordsworth used to listen to the echoes replying from the cold and moonlit hills or such a frozen river as that on which the american skater was pursued by wolves  no doubt such scenes have still their rare charm and few expeditions are more attractive than a moonlight exploration of a winding river  but it is seldom that our frosts make such tours practicable whereas almost every winter it is possible to skate with safety at least on shallow ponds or on places like the icebound floods at oxford  thus figureskating which needs but a surface of a few yards to each performer has come into fashion and it is hard to imagine any exercise more elegant or one that requires more nerve  the novice is theoretically aware that if he throws his body into certain unfamiliar postures which are explained to him the laws of gravitation and of the higher curves will cause him to complete a certain figure  but how much courage and faith it requires to yield to these laws and let the frame swing round subject to the immutable rules of matter  the temptation to stop halfway is almost irresistible and then there occurs a complicated fall which makes the petrified spectator ask where may be the skaters bodywhich are legs and which are arms  of all sports skating has the best claim to adopt dantons motto toujours de laudacethe audacity meant being that of giving ones self up to the laws of motion and not the vulgar quality which carries its owner on to dangerous ice  something may now be learned of figureskating on dry land and the adventure may be renewed of the mythical children who went sliding all on a summer day  in this respect skating has a great advantage over its rival the roaring game of curling  it would be poor fun to curl on asphalte with stones fixed on wheels though the amusement is possible and we recommend the idea which is not copyright to enthusiastic curlers and curlers are almost always enthusiastic  it is pleasant to think how the hills must be ringing with their shouts round many a lonely tarn where the men of one parish meet those of the next in friendly conflict north of the tweed  the exhilarating yell of soop her up whereby the curler who wields a broom is abjured to sweep away the snow in front of the advancing stone will many a time be heard this winter  there is something peculiarly healthy about this sportin the ring with which the heavy stones clash against each other in the voices of the burly plaided men shepherd and farmer and laird in the rough banquet of beef and greens and the copious toddy which close the days exertions  frost brings with it an enforced closeseason for most of furred and feathered kind  the fox is safe enough and if sportsmen are right must be rather wearying for open weather and for the return of his favourite exercise with hounds  but even when the snow hangs out her white flag of truce and goodwill between man and beast the british sportsman is still the british sportsman and is not averse to going out and killing something  to such a one wildfowl shooting is a possibility though as good colonel hawker says some people complain forsooth that it interferes with ease and comfort  we should rather incline to think it does  a black frost with no moon is not precisely the kind of weather that a degenerate sportsman would choose for lying in the frozen mud behind a bush or pushing a small punt set on large skates across the ice to get at birds  few attitudes can be more cramping than that of the gunner who skulks on one knee behind his canoe pushing it with one hand and dragging himself along by the aid of the other  then it is disagreeable to have to use a gun so heavy that the stock is fitted with a horsehair pillow or even with a small bolster  the whistle of widgeon and the shrillsounding pinions of wild geese may be attractive noises and no doubt all shooting is exciting and a form of shooting which stakes all on one shot must offer some thrilling moments of expectation  the quarry has to be measured by number not by size and fifty widgeon at one discharge or a brace of wild swans may almost serve to set against a stag of ten 23  the lover of nature has glimpses in wildfowl shooting such as she gives no other manthe glittering expanse of waters the birds all in a charm all uttering their cry together the musical moan of the tide and the long glories of the winter moon but success is too difficult equipment too costly and rheumatism too certain for wildfowl shooting to be reckoned among popular winter sports    human levitation   why is it that living fish add nothing to the weight of the bucket of water in which they swim charles ii is said to have asked the royal society  a still more extraordinary question has been propounded in the grave pages of the quarterly journal of science edited by mr crookes a fellow of the royal society and the discoverer of the useful metal thallium  the problem set in this learned review does not like that of the merry monarch beg the question of facts  what is the scientific inference from the various accounts modern and traditional of human levitation is the difficulty before the world at this present moment now there may be people who never heard of levitation nor even of thaums a term that frequently occurs in the article we refer to  a slight acquaintance with the dead languages whose shadows reappear in this queer fashion enables the inquirer to decide that levitation means the power of becoming lighter than the surrounding atmosphere and setting at nought the laws of gravitation  thaums again are wonders and there is no very obvious reason why they should not be called wonders  but to return to levitation  most of us have heard how mr home and other gifted people possess the faculty of being raised from the ground and of floating about the room or even out of the window  there are clouds of witnesses who have observed these phenomena which generally occur in the dark  in fact they are part of that vague subject called spiritualism about which opinion is so much divided and views are so vague  it has been said that the human race in regard to this high argument is divided into five classes  there are people who believe people who investigate people who think the matter really ought to be looked into people who dislike the topic but who would believe in the phenomena if they were proved and people of common sense who would not believe in them if they were proved  now the article in the journal of science only deals with one of the phenomena we hear so much ofthat of the sudden suspension of the laws of gravitation in the case of individual men  the author has collected a vast variety of traditions bearing on this subject and his conclusion apparently is that events of this kind though rather rare are natural are peculiar to people of certain temperament and organization and above all bring no proof as to the truth of the doctrines asserted by the persons who exhibit the phenomena  now men of science as a rule and the world at large look on stories of this sort as myths romances false interpretations of subjective feelings pious frauds and absurd nonsense  before expressing an opinion it may be well to look over the facts as they are called which are brought under our notice  what accounts then are there of levitation among the civilized people of the old world  first there is abaris the scythian in the time of pythagoras says our author  well as a matter of evidence abaris may have been levitated in the eighth century before christ or it may have been two hundred and fifty years later  perhaps he was a druid of the hebrides  toland thought so and toland had as good a chance of knowing as any one else  our earliest authority herodotus says he took no earthly food and went with his arrow all round the world without once eating  it seems that he rode on this arrow which mr rawlinson thinks may possibly have been an early tradition of the magnet  all our detailed information about him is of later date than the christian era the fact remains that tradition says he was able to fly in the air pythagoras is said to have had the same power or rather the same faculty came upon him  he was lifted up with no will or conscious exertion of his own  now our evidence as to the power of pythagoras to be like a bird in two places at once is exactly as valuable as that about abaris  it rests on the tradition repeated by superstitious philosophers who lived eight hundred years after his death  to pythagoras therefore as herodotus has it we now say farewell with no further knowledge than that vague tradition says he was levitated  the writer now leaves classical antiquity behind himhe does not repeat a saying of plotinus the mystic of alexandria who lived in the third century of our era  the best known anecdote of him is that his disciples asked him if he were not sometimes levitated and he laughed and said no but he was no fool who persuaded you of this  instead of plotinus we are referred to a mass of jewish and antichristian apocryphal traditions which have the same common pointthe assertion of the existence of the phenomenon of levitation  apollonius of tyana is also said to have been a highly accomplished medium  we are next presented with a list of forty levitated persons canonized or beatified by the church of rome  their dates range from the ninth to the seventeenth century and their histories go to prove that levitation runs in families  perhaps the best known of the collection is st theresa 15151582 and it is only fair to say that the stories about st theresa are very like those repeated about our lady mediums  one of these mrs guppy as every one knows can scatter flowers all over a room flowers of paradise unknown to botanists  fauna rather than flora was st theresas province and she kept a charming pet a little white animal of no recognized species still about her and about her friend st john of the cross the legend runs that they used to be raised off the ground chairs and all and float about in the most soothing way  poor peter of alcantara was levitated in a less pleasant manner he uttered a frightful cry and shot through the air as if he had been fired from a gun  peter had a new form of epilepsythe rising not the falling sickness  joseph copertino again floated about to such good effect that in 1650 prince john of brunswick foreswore the protestant faith  the logical process which converted this prince is not a very obvious one  why do we quote all these old monkish and neoplatonic legends  for some the evidence is obviously nil to other anecdotes many witnesses bear testimony but then we know that an infectious schwarmerei can persuade people that the lion now removed from northumberland house wagged his tail  the fact is that there is really matter for science in all these anecdotes and the question to be asked is thishow does it happen that in ages and societies so distant and so various identical stories are current  what is the pressure that makes neoplatonic gossips of the fourth century circulate the same marvels as spiritualist gossips of the nineteenth  how does it happen that the mediaeval saint the indian medicineman the siberian shaman a suggestive term have nearly identical wonders attributed to them  if people wanted merely to tell a good square lie as the american slang has it invention does not seem to have such pitifully narrow boundaries  it appears to follow that there are contagious nervous illusions about which science has not said the last word  we believe that the life of children with its innocent mixture of dreams and waking facts and fancies could supply odd parallels to the stories we have been treated to  and as we are on the subject we should like as the late president lincoln said to tell a little story  it occurred to a learned divine to meet a pupil who ought by rights to have been in the university of oxford walking in regent street  the youth glided past like a ghost and was lost in the crowd next day his puzzled preceptor received a note dated on the previous day from oxford telling how the pupil had met the teacher by the isis and on inquiry had heard he was in london  here is a case of levitationof double levitation and we leave it to be explained by the followers of abaris and of mr home    a chinamans marriage   the court of assizes at paris has lately been occupied with the case of a chinese gentleman whose personal charms and literary powers make him worthy to be the compatriot of ahsin that astute celestial  tintun ling is the namewe wish we could say with thackerays f b the highly respectable nameof the chinese who has just been acquitted on a charge of bigamy  in china it is said that the more distinguished a man is the shorter is his title and the name of a very victorious general is a mere click or gasp  on this principle the trisyllabic tintunling must have been without much honour in his own country  in paris however he has learned parisian aplomb and when confronted with his judges and his accusers his air we learn was very calm  his smile it was pensive and bland like the heathen chinees and his calm confidence was justified by events  it remains to tell the short though not very simple tale of tintunling  mr ling was born in 1831 in the province of chanli  at the interesting age of eighteen an age at which the intellect awakens and old prejudices lose their grasp he ceased to burn gilt paper on the tombs of his ancestors he ceased to revere their august spirits he gave up the use of the planchette rejected the teachings of confucius and in short became a convert to christianity this might be considered either as a gratifying testimony to the persuasive powers of catholic missionaries or as an example of the wiles of jesuitism if we did not know the inner history of mr lings soul the abysmal depths of his personality  he has not like many other modern converts written a little book such as how i ceased to chinchin joss or from confucius to christianity but he has told madame judith mendes all about it  madame mendes has made a name in literature and english readers may have wondered how the daughter of the poet theophile gautier came to acquire the knowledge of chinese which she has shown in her translations from that language  it now appears that she was the pupil of tintunling who in a moment of expansion confided to her that he adopted the catholic faith that he might eat a morsel of bread he was starving it seems he had eaten nothing for eight days when he threw himself on the charity of the missionaries and received baptism since winckelmann turned renegade and became a roman catholic merely that the expenses of his tour to rome and his maintenance there might be paid there have surely been few more mercenary converts  tintunling was not satisfied with being christened into the church he was also married in catholic rites and here his misfortunes fairly began and he entered on the path which has led him into difficulty and discredit  the french as a nation are not remarkable for their accuracy in the use of foreign proper names and we have a difficulty in believing that the name of mr lings first wife was really quziatomalacer  there is a touch of m hugos famous tom jim jack the british tar about this designation  nevertheless the facts are that tintunling was wedded to quzia and had four children by her  after years of domestic life on which he is said to look back but rarely and with reluctance he got a position as secretary and shoeblack and tutor in chinese to a m callery and left the province of chinli for paris  for three months this devoted man sent quziatomalacer small sums of money and after that his kindness became as douglas jerrold said unremitting  quzia heard of her lord no more till she learned that he had forgotten his marriage vow and was in fact anothers  as to how tintunling contracted a matrimonial alliance in france the evidence is a little confusing  it seems certain that after the death of his first employer callery he was in destitution that m theophile gautier with his wellknown kindness and love of curiosities took him up and got him lessons in chinese and it seems equally certain that in february 1872 he married a certain caroline julie liegeois  in the act of marriage tintunling described himself as a baron which we know that he was not for in his country he did not rejoice in buttons and other insignia of chinese nobility  as caroline julie ling nee liegeois denounced her lord for bigamy in 1873 and succeeded as has been seen in proving that he was husband of quziatomalacer it may seem likely that she found out the spurious honours of the pretended title  but whatever may be thought of the deceitful conduct of ling there is little doubt apparently that caroline is really his  he stated in court that by chinese law a husband who has not heard of his wife for three years may consider that his marriage has legally ceased to be binding  madame mendes proved from the volume ta tsilgleulee the penal code of china that lings law was correct  it also came out in court that quziatomalacer had large feet  the jury on hearing this evidence very naturally acquitted tintunling whom madame mendes embraced it is said with the natural fervour of a preserver of innocence  whether tintunling is now a bachelor or whether he is irrevocably bound to caroline julie is a question that seems to have occurred to no one  the most mysterious point in this dark business is the question how did tintunling who always spoke of his first marriage with terror happen to involve himself in the difficulties of a second  something more than the common weakness of human nature must have been at work here  madame mendes says like a traitor to her sex that tin espoused caroline julie from feelings of compassion  he yielded according to madame mendes to the entreaties of this woman  the story of m gustave lafargue confirms this ungallant tale  according to m lafargue tins bride was a governess and an english governess or at least one who taught english she proposed to marry tin who first resisted and then hesitated  in a matter of this kind the man who hesitates is lost  the english governess flattered tins literary as well as his personal vanity  she proposed to translate the novels which tin composes in his native tongue and which he might expect to prove as popular in france as some other fictions of his fatherland have done in times past  so they were married  tim though on pleasure bent had a frugal mind and after a weddingbreakfast which lasted all day he went to a theatre to ask for two free passes  when he came back his bride was gone  he sought her with all the ardour of the bridegroom in the ballad of the mistletoe bough and with more success  madame ling was reading a novel at home mr carlyle has quoted tobias smollett as to the undesirability of giving the historical muse that latitude which is not uncommon in france and we prefer to leave the tale of lings where mr carlyle left that of brynhilds wedding 37    sieur de montaigne   the french national library has recently as it is said made an acquisition of great value and interest  the books and better still the notes of montaigne the essayist have been bought up at the not very exorbitant price of thirtysix thousand francs  the volumes are the beautiful editions of the sixteenth centurythe age of great scholars and of printers like the estiennes who were at once men of learning and of taste  it is almost certain that they must be enriched with marginal notes of montaignes and the marginal notes of a great man add even more to the value of a book than the scribblings of circulating library readers detract from its beauty  there is always something characteristic in a mans treatment of his books  coleridges marginalia on borrowed works according to lamb were an ornament of value to his friends if they were lucky enough to get the books back again  poes marginalia were of exquisite neatness though in their printed form they were not very interesting  thackerays seem mostly to have taken the shape of slight sketches in illustration of the matter  scaligers notes converted a classic into a new and precious edition of one example casaubons on the other hand were mere scratches and mnemonic lines and blurs with which he marked his passage through a book as roughly as the american woodsman blazes his way through a forest  none could read the comment save himself and the text was disfigured  we may be sure that montaignes marginalia are of a very different value  as he walked up and down in his orchard or in his library beneath the rafters engraved with epicurean maxims he jotted his thoughts hastily on the volume in his handon the pliny or suetonius or livy  his library was probably not a large one for he had but a few favourite authors the latin historians moralists and anecdotists and for mere amusement terence and catullus boccaccio and rabelais  his thoughts fell asleep he says if he was not walking about and his utter want of memory made notes and notebooks necessary to him  he who could not remember the names of the most ordinary tools used in agriculture nor the difference between oats and barley could never keep in his head his enormous stock of classical anecdotes and modern instances  his thoughts got innocently confused with his recollections and his notebooks will probably show whence he drew many of his stories and the quotations that remain untraced  they will add also to our knowledge of the man and of his character though it might seem difficult to give additional traits in the portrait of himself which he has painted with so many minute touches  with the exception of dr johnson there is scarcely any great man of letters whom we are enabled to know so intimately as the sieur de montaigne  he has told us all about himself all about his age as far as it came under his eager and observant eyes all about the whole world as far as it made part of his experience  rousseau is not more frank and not half so worthy of credit for rousseau like topsy in the novel had a taste for fessing offences that he had never committed rather than not fess at all  montaigne strikes no such attitudes he does not pose he does not so much confess as blab  his life stands before the reader as in a picture  we learn that his childhood was a happier one than usually fell to the lot of children in that age when there was but little honey smeared on the cup of learning  we know that his father taught him greek in a kind of sport or game that the same parents relations with the fair sex were remarkable and that he had extraordinary strength in his thumb  for his own part montaigne was so fresh and full of life that simon thomas a great physician said it would make a decrepit old man healthy again to live in his company  one thinks of him as a youth like the irrepressible swiss who amused the ennui of gray  even in his old age montaigne was a gay cheerful untiring traveller always eager to be going on delighted with every place he visited and yet anxious for constant change of scene and for new experience  to be amusingly and simply selfish is ever part of the charm of montaigne  he adds to his readers pleasure in life by the keenness with which he relished his own existence and savoured every little incident as a man relishes the bouquet of wine  without selfishness how can this be managed and without perfect simplicity and the good faith on which he prided himself how could montaigne how could pepys have enriched the world as they have done  his essays are among the few works that really and literally make life more opulent with accumulated experience criticism reflection humour  he gives of his rich nature his lavish exuberance of character out of that fresh and puissant century to this rather weary one just as his society in youth might have been given to the sick old man  besides what he has to give in this manner montaigne seems to express french character to explain the french genius and the french way of looking at life more clearly and completely than any other writer  he has at bottom the intense melancholy the looking forward to the end of all which is the groundnote of the poetry of villon and of ronsard as of the prose of chateaubriand  the panelled library in montaignes chateau was carven with mottoes which were to be charms against too great fear of death  for my part he says if a man could by any means avoid death were it by hanging a calfskin on his limbs i am one that would not be ashamed of the shift  happy it is he thinks that we do not as a rule meet death on a sudden any more than we encounter the death of youth in one day  but this is only the dark background of the enjoyment of life to which montaigne clings as he says even too eagerly  merely to live merely to muse over this spectacle of the world simply to feel even if the thing felt be agony and to reflect on the pain and on how it may best be bornethis is enough for montaigne this is his philosophy reconciling in a way the maxims of the schools that divided the older worlds the theories of the stoic and wiser epicurean  to make each moment yield all that it has of experience and of reflection on that experience is his system of existence  acting on this idea all contrasts of great and petty mean and divine in human nature do not sadden but delight him  it was part of the play to see the division between the king of navarre henri iv and the duke of guise  he told thuanus that he knew the most secret thoughts of both these princes and that he was persuaded that neither of them was of the religion he professed  this scandal gave him no concern compared with his fear that his own castle would suffer in wars of the league  as to the reformation he held it for a hasty conceited movement on the part of persons who did not know what they were meddling with and being a perfect sceptic he was a perfectly good churchman  full of tolerance goodhumour and content cheerful in every circumstance simple and charming yet melancholy in his hour montaigne is a thorough representative of the french spirit in literature  his english translator in 1776 declares that he meets with a much more favourable entertainment in england than in his native country a servile nation that has lost all sense of liberty  like many other notions current in 1776 this theory of montaignes popularity at home and abroad has lost its truth  perhaps it would be more true to say that montaigne is one of the last authors whom modern taste learns to appreciate  he is a mans author not a womans a tired mans not a fresh mans  we all come to him late indeed but at last and rest in his panelled library    thackerays drawings   the advertisements of publishers make a very pleasant sort of reading they offer as it were a distant prospect of the great works of the future looming in a golden haze of expectation  a gentleman or lady may acquire a reputation for wide research by merely making a careful study of the short paragraphs in the literary papers  there are three classes of people who take an interest in letters  there are the persons who read books the much larger class which reads reviews and again they who merely skim over the advertisements of new works  the last set live in a constant enjoyment of the pleasure of expectation they pretend to themselves that some day they will find time to peruse the volumes in the birth of which they are interested but in fact they live in the future  they are a month ahead of their friends who read reviews and six months of the students who actually devour books themselves  not only these eager lovers of literary shop but all friends of english humour must be glad to see that a collection of mr thackerays sketches and drawings has been prepared for publication  when the news spread over england of mr thackerays sudden death it was felt that a personal loss had been sustained by every one who cared for books and for style  other men might write themselves out their invention might become weary and indeed mr thackeray himself felt this fatigue  he wished he could get some one to do the business of his stories he told the world in a roundabout paper  the lovemaking parts of the business annoyed him and made him blush in the privacy of his study as if he were going into an apoplexy  some signs of this distaste for the work of the novelist were obvious perhaps in philip though they did not mar the exquisite tenderness and charm of denis duval  however that might be his inimitable style was as fresh as ever with its passages of melancholy its ease its flexible strength and unlookedfor cadences  it was the talk about life and the tone of that talk which fell silent when thackeray died that we all felt as an irremediable loss  there is an old story that pindar had never in his lifetime written an ode in praise of persephone the goddess of death and the dead and that after he had departed from among living men his shade communicated to the priests a new hymn on the queen of hades  the works of great writers published after their decease have somewhat of the charm of this fabled hymn they are voices familiar and unlocked for out of the silence  they are even stranger when they have such a slight and homelike interest as the trifles that fell unheeded from the pen or pencil of one who has done great things in poetry or art  mr thackerays sketches in the orphan of pimlico are of this qualitycaricatures thrown off to amuse children who are now grown men and women  they have the mark of the old unmistakable style humorous and sad and as last remains they are to be welcomed and treasured  mr thackerays skill with the pencil bore very curious relations to his mastery of the other art in which lay his strength but to which perhaps he never gave his love  everyone has heard how when a young man he was anxious to illustrate pickwick which found more fitting artists in seymour and h k browne  mr thackeray seems to have been well aware of the limitations of his own power as a draughtsman  in one of his roundabout papers he described the methodthe secret so to sayof rubens and then goes on to lament the impotence of his own hand the pitiful niggling that cannot reproduce the bold sweep of rubens brush  thackeray was like theophile gautier who began life as a painter and who has left to posterity a wonderful etching of his own portrait pale romantic with long sweeping moustache and hair falling over his shoulders  both writers found their knowledge of the technique of painting useful in making their appreciation of art and nature more keen and versatile  but mr thackerays powers had another fieldhe really did succeed in illustrating some of his own writings  accomplished his style never was  there was a trace of the old school of caricature in the large noses and thin legs which he gave his figures  nor was his drawing very correct the thin legs of the heroes of the virginians are often strangely contorted  he has even placed a thumb on the wrong side of a hand  for all that he gave to many of his own characters a visible embodiment which another artist would have missed  mr frederick walker for instance drew philip firmin admirablya large rough man with a serious and rather worn face and a huge blonde beard  mr walkers philip has probably become the philip of many readers but he was not mr thackerays  it is delightful to be sure on the other hand that we have the authors own captain costigan before us in his habit as he livedthe unshaven chin the battered hat the high stock the blue cloak the whiskeyfied stare and the swagger  mr thackeray did not do his young men well  arthur pendennis is only himself as he sits with warrington over a morning paper in his white hat and black band at the derby he has not the air of a gentleman  harry foker is either a coarse exaggeration or the modern types of fokers have improved in demeanour on the great prototype  but costigan is always perfect and the nose and wig of major pendennis are ideally correct  in his drawings of women mr thackeray very much confined himself to two types  there was the darkeyed brownhaired brightcomplexioned girl who was his favouritelaura betsinda amelia and the blonde ringletted clever and false girlbecky blanche angelica who was the favourite of the reader  he did not always succeed in making them pretty though there is a beautiful head of amelia in a court dance at pumpernickel but he always made the dark young lady look honest and the fair young minx look a thing all soul and enthusiasm  it was a note of mr thackerays art and probably one among other proofs that the higher fields of art were closed to him that his success by no means corresponded to the amount of pains he took with his work  his drawings which appeared as steel engravings were not unfrequently weak while his sketches on the wood and his lithographs were much more free and masterly  there is indeed a sketch on the steel of poor pen tossing feverishly in his mothers comforting arms which is full of passion and life and sentiment  but it was rare that success attended his ambition and indeed another drawing of pen and his mother admiring a sunset might have come out of a book of fashions of that remote period it was in his initial letters and slight designs that thackeray showed his best powers  there is much wistful tenderness in the little marquises face as she trips down a ropeladder in an initial letter of vanity fair  the bewigged shepherds and powdered shepherdesses of his favourite period are always reproduced with grace and the children of his drawings are almost invariably charming  in the darker moods when man delighted him not nor woman either children did not fail to please him and he sketched them in a hundred pathetic attitudes  there are the little brother and sister of the doomed house of gaunt sitting under the ancestral sword that seems ready to fall  there is little rawdon crawley manly and stout in his great coat watching the thin little cousin pitt whom he was too big a dog to play with  there is the printers devil asleep at pens door and the small boy in dr birch singing in his nightgown to the big boy in bed  there is betsinda dancing with her plumbun in the rose and the ring  the burlesque drawings of that delightful childs book are not its least attraction  not arriving at the prettiness of mr tenniel and the elegance of mr du maurier and falling far short of their ingenious fantasy they are yet manly delineations of great adventures  the count kicking the two black men into space is a powerful design full of action and it would be hard to beat the picture of the fate of gruffanufs husband  these and the rest are old friends and there are hosts of quaint scribblings signed with the mark of a pair of spectacles scattered through the pages of punch    golf   while pheasantshooters are enjoying the first day of the season the votaries of a sport not less noble though less noisy are holding the great festival of their year  the autumn meeting of the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews is in full swing and the words will suggest pleasant memories to many a golfer  golf is not one of the more brilliant and famous pastimes of the day though it yields to none in antiquity and in unassuming merit  the names of the winners of the gold medal and of the silver cross are not telegraphed all over the world as widely as mr tennysons hero wished the news that maud had accepted him to be  the red man may possibly dance beneath his red cedar tree at the tidings of the event of one of our great horseraces or great university matches  at all events even if the red man preserves his usual stoicism of demeanour his neighbours the palefaces like to know all about the result of many english sports the moment they are decided golf as we have said excites less general enthusiasm but in people who love it at all the love is burning consuming they will talk golfshop in season and out of season  few persons perhaps will call golf the very first and queen of games  cricket exercises more faculties of body and even of mind for does not the artful bowler bowl with his head football demands an extraordinary personal courage and implies the existence of a fierce delight in battle with ones peers  tennis with all its merits is a game for the few so rare are tenniscourts and so expensive the pastime  but cricketers footballplayers tennisplayers would all give golf the second place after their favourite exercise and just as themistocles was held to be the best greek general because each of his fellows placed him second so golf may assert a right to be thought the first of games  one great advantage it certainly hasit is a game for men of all ages from eight or even younger to eighty  the links of st andrews are probably cleared just now of the little lads and the veterans they make room for the heroes the medalists the great playersmr mackay mr lamb mr leslie balfour and the rest  but at ordinary times there are always dozens of tiny boys in knickerbockers and scarlet stockings who drive out the first hole in some twenty strokes of their little clubs and who pass much of their time in fishing for their lost balls in the muddy burn  as for the veterans on the threshold of old age it is pleasant to watch their boyish eagerness the swaying of their bodies as they watch the short flight of their longest hits their delight when they do manage to hit further than the sandpit or bunker which is named after the nose of a longdead principal of the university their caution nay their almost tedious delay in the process of putting that is of hitting the ball over the green into the neighbouring hole  they can still do their round or their two rounds five or ten miles walking a day and who can speak otherwise than well of a game which is not too strenuous for healthy age or tender childhood and yet allows an athlete of twentythree to put out all his strength  golf is a thoroughly national game it is as scotch as haggis cockie leekie high cheekbones or rowanberry jam  a spurious imitation or an arrested development of the sport exists in the south of france where a ball is knocked along the roads to a fixed goal  but this is naturally very poor fun compared to the genuine game as played on the short turf beside the grey northern sea on the coast of fife  golf has been introduced of late years into england and is played at westward ho at wimbledon at blackheath the oldest club at liverpool over cowley marsh near oxford and in many other places  it is therefore no longer necessary to say that golf is not a highly developed and scientific sort of hockey or bandyball  still there be some to whom the processes of the sport are a mystery and who would be at a loss to discriminate a niblick from a bunkeriron  the thoroughly equipped golf player needs an immense variety of weapons or implements which are carried for him by his caddiea youth or old man who is as it were his esquire who sympathizes with him in defeat rejoices in his success and aids him with such advice as his superior knowledge of the ground suggests  the class of human beings known as caddies are the offspring of golf and have peculiar traits which distinguish them from the professional cricketer the waterman the keeper the gillie and all other professionals  it is not very easy to account for their little peculiarities  one thing is certainthat when golf was introduced by scotchmen into france and found a home at pau in the shadow of the pyrenees the french caddie sprang so to speak from the ground the perfect likeness of his scottish brother  he was just as sly just as importunate in his demands to be employed just as fond of putting at short holes more profane and every bit as contemptuous of all nongolf playing humanity as the boyish scotch caddie in whom contempt has reversed the usual process and bred familiarity with all beginners  the professional cricketer can instruct an unskilled amateur can take his illguarded wicket and make him give chances all over the field without bursting into yells of unseemly laughter  but the little caddie cannot restrain his joy when the tyro at golf after missing his ball some six times ultimately dashes off the head of his club against the ground  nor is he less exuberant when his patrons ball is deep in a bunker or sandpit where the wretch stands digging at it with an iron hot helpless and wrathful  and yet golf is a sport not learned in a day and caddies might be more considerate  the object of the game is to strike a small guttapercha ball into a hole about five inches wide distant from the striker about three hundred yards and separated from him by rough grass and smooth sandpits furze bushes and perhaps a road or a brook  he who of two players gets his ball into the hole in the smallest number of strokes is the winner of that hole and the party then play towards the next hole  all sorts of skill are neededstrength and adroitness and a certain supple swing of the body are wanted to send the ball sure and far in the driving part of the game  nothing is so pleasant as a clean drive  the sensation is like that of hitting a ball to squareleg fair and full at cricket  then the golfer must have the knack to lift his ball out of deep sand with the iron and to strike it deftly a halfshot up to the hole with the cleek and lastly coolness and a good eye when he putts or hits his ball actually up to the very hole  any degree of skill in these varied feats makes golf a delightful game if the opponents are well matched  nor are the charms of scenery wanting at st andrews the headquarters of the sport  there is no more picturesque town in scotland than the little university city  from the plain of the estuary of the river eden across the long leagues of marsh land and the stretches of golden sand and brown the towers of st andrewsfor it is a town of many towersare seen breaking the skyline built on a windy headland running out to the grey northern sea it reaches the water with an ancient pier of rugged stone  immediately above is the site of a chapel of immemorial age and above that again are the ruins of the cathedralgaunt spires with broken tracery standing where once the burnished roof of copper flashed far across the deep  the high street winds from the cathedral precinct past an old house of queen mary stuart past ruined chapels of st leonards and the university chapel with its lovely spire down to the shores of the bay and along the bay run the famous links where the royal and ancient game has its cradle and home  other links as prestwick or north berwick may vie with those of st andrews in extent or in the smoothness of the putting greens or in the number and hardness of the hazards or difficult places but none offer so wide and varied an extent of scenery from the melancholy stretch of the parallel sands to the hills in the west the golden glitter of the beach beneath the faint aerial blue of the still more distant hills across the firth while behind is the city set on its cliffs and proud with its crown of spires  the reflected sunset lingers on the walls and crags and towers that shine imaged in the wet sands the afterglow hangs over the eastern sky and these have their charm but their charm yields to that of golf  it is a sign that a man has lost heart and hope when he dilates on the beauty of the scenery and abstracts his attention from what alone would interest him were he winningthe lie of his ball  who can stop to think of the beauties of nature when he and his antagonist are equal and there are only two more holes left to play in the match for the medal  it is a serious moment not one of the little crowd of observers the gallery that accompany the players dares to speak or even cough  the caddie who sneezes is lost for he will be accused of distracting his masters attention  the ladies begin to appear in the background ready to greet the players and to tell the truth are not very welcome to the nervous golfer  everything turns on half an inch of leather in a drive or a stiff blade of grass in a putt and the interest is wound up to a really breathless pitch happy he is who does not in his excitement top his ball into the neighbouring brook or heel it and send it devious down to the depths of ocean  happy is he who can hole out the last hole in four beneath the eyes of the ladies  striding victorious into the hospitable club where beer awaits him he need not envy the pheasantslayer who has slain his hundreds    art of dining   there is such a thing as nationality in dining just as mr browning has proved in a brilliant poem that there is nationality in drinks surveying mankind with extensive view the essayist recognizes that the science is not absolutely ignored in turkey where we cannot but think that an archaic school retains too much wool with the mutton and that dining like egyptian art is rather a matter of sacred and immemorial rules than in any worthy sense of the word a science  the chinese and japanese have long been famous for their birdsnest soup and for making the best after his lamented decease of the friend of manthe dog about the australians and new zealanders perhaps the less said the better  many students will feel that our own colonists have neglected to set a proper example to these poor heathen races who save kangaroos have no larger game than rats  the englishman in australia revels in boundless mutton in damper in tea and in the vintages of his adopted soil which he playfully and patriotically compares to those of the rhine  it is impossible on the other hand not to recognize the merits of the russian cuisine where the imported civilization of france has found various good traditional ideas still retained by the sclavonic people and where the caviare with that pale green hue which denotes the absence of salt is not to be overlooked  in melancholy contrast to the native genius of the sclavs is the absolute dearth of taste and sense in gastronomic germany  if a map of the world could be madeand why notin which lands of utter darkness in culinary matters should be coloured black like heathen countries in the missionary atlas and coalfields in the map of physical geography the german empire would be one vast blot on central europe  science might track teutonic blood by the absence of respectable cookery and in england too obvious tokens would be found of that incapacity of the art of dining which we brought from the marshes of holstein  in america nature herself has put the colonists on many schemes for the improvement of dinner and terrapin soup is gratefully associated with memoirs of virginiain the minds of those who like terrapin soup  the canvasbacked duck has been praised as highly as the swopping swopping mallard of a comfortable college in oxford  as to the wild turkey the poet has not yet risen in america who can do justice to the charms of that admirable bird  mr whitman who has much to say about bobalinks and whippoorwills and some other fowl which sing when lilacs bloom in the garden yard has neglected we fear the wild turkey simply because the muse has not given this bird melody and made it like the robinredbreast which goes so well with breadcrumbs an amiable songster  american genius neglects the turkey and positively takes more interest in the migrations of the transatlantic sparrow  if the nobler fowl can cross the water as safely as the beef and mutton of everyday life he will receive the honour he deserves in this country  some students with the deathless thirst of scientific men for acclimatization speak well of the bohemian pheasant which unlike some other denizens of bohemia is fat  but there are probably less familiar birds in america that rival the duck and the wild turkey and excel the bohemian pheasant  the existence of maize however on the western continent has been a snare to american cooks who have yielded to an absorbing passion for hot corncakes  france is of course the land in which the muse of cooking is native if we turn north towards belgium says a modern author we shall find much that is good in cooking and eating known if not universally practised  he has also made the discovery that the belgian air and climate are admirably suited to develop the best qualities of burgundy it is from these favoured and ingenious people that england ought to learn a lesson or rather a good many lessons  to begin at the beginning with soup does not every one know that all domestic soups in england which bear french names are really the same soup just as almost all puddings are or may be called cabinet pudding  the one word julienne covers all the watery chill and tasteless or terribly salt decoctions in which a few shreds of vegetables appear drifting through the illimitable inane  other names are given at will by the help of a cookerybook and a french dictionary but all these soups at bottom are attempts to be julienne soup  the idea of looking on soup as a vehicle for applying to the palate certain herbal flavours is remote indeed from the plain cooks mind  there is a deeply rooted conviction in her inmost soul that all vegetables which are not potatoes or cabbages partake of the nature of evil  as to eating vegetables apart from meat it was once as hard to get english domestics to let you do that as to get a cretan cook to serve woodcock with the trail  kopros is not a thing to be eaten says the cretan according to a traveller and the natural heart of the english race regards vegetables when eaten as a plat apart with equal disfavour  probably the market gardeners ignorance and conservatism are partly in fault  cabbage he knows and potatoes he knows but what are pennyroyal and chervil  he has cauliflower for you but never says here is rue for you and rosemary for you  cooks do not give him botany lessons and a scottish cook deprived of bayleaf has been known to make an experiment in the use of what she called roderick randoms members of the vegetable kingdom which proved to be rhododendron  as for pennyroyal most people have only heard of it through mr bonns crib to aristophanes  when it comes to fish it is allowed that we are not an insular people for nothing  there are other forms of good living that paris knows not of so to speak at first hand native to england  turtle soup turbot and lobster sauce a haunch of venison and a grouse are we may say without chauvinism a truly royal repast  but we incur the contempt of foreigners once more in the matter of wines  to like sherry the coarse and fiery is a matter of habit which would teach us to love betelroot and rejoice in the very peculiar drink of the south sea islanders  some purists include champagne in the same condemnationthe champagne that is of this degenerate day  when the russians drank up the contents of the widow clicquots cellars they found a sweet natural wine to which they have constantly adhered  but western europe all the europe which as m comte puts it synergizes after light and positivism has tended towards champagnes more or less dry  the english serve this grog mousseux as a necessity for social liveliness and have not come back to the sweet wine which was only meant to be drunk with sweets  a quarterly reviewer is very severe in his condemnation of a practice which will only yield to the stress of some european convulsion in politics and society  these matters are like certain large reforms they either come to pass without observation in the slow changes of things or great movements in the world are accompanied by small ones in everyday life  dry champagne came in after the revolution it may go out after a european war which will make wine either expensive or if cheap a palpably spurious article  monotony and base servile imitation may be the bane of eating and drinking in england but the existence of monotony shows that the english really do not care very much about dining considered as a fine art  when they do care they cover their interest in the matter decently with the veil of humorous affectation  they cannot spontaneously and sincerely make a business of it as the french do in all good faith  even if they had a genius for dining we doubt if a critic is right in thinking they should dine at six oclock or seven at latest  whether in the country or in town the business or amusement of the day claims more time  sportsmen for example in early autumn could not possibly return home by six very frequently and in summer six oclock may be so sultry an hour that the thought of food is intolerable still it must be admitted that the unawakened state of the marketgardener and the condition of english soups are matters deserving serious consideration    american humour   one of the most popular of american humorists has elicited from a member of an english audience who did not quite hear him lecture a remark of an amusing sort  the aggrieved listener proclaimed that he had a right to hear  this was one of the turbulent people who should read mazzini and learn that man has no rights worth mentioningonly duties one of which is to hold his tongue in season  if mr bret hartes words did not reach all his audience his writings at least have come home to most english readers  they suggest a consideration of the many points of difference which distinguish american from english humour  the americans are of our own stock yet in their treatment of the ludicrous how unlike us they are  as far as fun goes the race has certainly become differentiated as the philosophers say on the other side of the atlantic  it does not seem probable that the infusion of alien blood has caused the difference  the native redskin can claim few descendants among the civilized americans and the native redskin had no sense of humour  we all remember coopers hawkeye or leather stocking with his peculiar silent laugh  he was obliged to laugh silently for fear of attracting the unfavourable notice of the mingo who might be hiding in the nearest bush  the red men found it simpler and safer not to laugh at all  no it is not from the natives that the people of the states get their peculiar fun  as to the german emigrantsbut why pursue the subject  the abbe bouhours told the bitter truth about german wit though in new conditions and on a fresh soil the teuton has helped to produce hans breitmann  we laugh at hans however and with his creator hans does not make us laugh by conscious efforts of humour  whence then come artemus ward mark twain and mr bret harte who are probably the american humorists whose popularity is widest  mr bret hartes own fun is much more english and less thoroughly yankee than that of his contemporaries  he is a disciple of thackeray and dickens  of all the pupils of dickens he is perhaps the only one who has continued to be himself who has not fallen into a trick of aping his masters mannerisms  his mixture of the serious the earnest the pathetic makes his humour not unlike the melancholy mirth of thackeray and sterne  he is almost the only american humorist with sentiment  it is only the air not the spirit that is changedcoelum non animus  the changed atmosphere the new conditions do however make an immense superficial difference between the humour even of mr bret harte and that of english writers  his fun is derived from the vagaries of huge rough people with the comic cruelty of the old danes and with the unexpected tenderness of a sentimental time  the characters of the great texan and californian drama are like our hackneyed friends the vikings with a touch if we may use the term of spooniness  their humour is often nothing more than a disdainful trifling with death they seize the comic side of manslaughter very promptly and enjoy all the mirth that can be got out of revolvers and grizzly bears  in mr bret hartes poems of the spelling bee and of the breakup of the society upon the stanislaw the fun is of this practical sort  the innate mirthfulness of a chunk of old red sandstone is illustrated and you are introduced to people who not only take delight of battle with their peers but think the said battle the most killing joke in the world  the incongruities of these revels of wild men in a new world their confusion when civilization meets them in the shape of a respectable woman or of a baby their grotesque way of clinging to religion as they understand it make up the transatlantic element in this american humour  the rest of it is european quite though none the worse for that  it is more humane on the whole than the laughable and amazing paradoxes of mark twain or the naivetes of artemus ward  two remarkable features in american humour as it is shown in the great body of comic writers who are represented by mark twain and the genial showman are its rusticity and its puritanism  the fun is the fun of rough villagers who use quaint straightforward words and have developed or carried over in the mayflower a slang of their own  they do not want anything too refined they are not in the least like the farm lad to whose shirt a serpent clung as he was dressing after bathing  many people have read how he fled into the farmyard where the maidens were busy how he did not dare to stop and sought escape not from womans helphe was too modestbut in running so fast that obedient to the laws of centrifugal motion the snake waved out behind him like a flag the village wits are not so shy  the young ladies like betsy ward say if you mean getting hitched im on  the public is not above the most practical jokes and a good deal of the amusement is derived from the extreme dryness the countrified slowness of the narrative  the humorists are puritans at bottom as well as rustics  they have an amazing familiarity with certain religious ideas and certain biblical terms  there is a kind of audacity in their use of the scriptures which reminds one of the freedom of mediaeval mysteryplays  probably this boldness began not in scepticism or in irreverence but in honest familiar faith  it certainly seems very odd to us in england and probably expressions often get a laugh which would pass unnoticed in america  an astounding coolness and freedom of manners probably go for something in the effect produced by american humour  there is nothing of the social flunkeyism in it which too often marks our own satirists artemus wards reports of his own conversations with the mighty of the earth were made highly ludicrous by the homely want of selfconsciousness displayed by the owner of the kangaroo that amoosin little cuss and of the two moral bars  but it is vain to attempt to analyze the fun of artemus ward  why did he make some people laugh till they cried while others were all untouched  his secret probably was almost entirely one of manner a trick of almost idiotic naivete like that of lord dundreary covering real shrewdness  he had his rustic chaff his puritan profanity his manner was the essence of his mirth  it was one of the ultimate constituents of the ludicrous beyond which it is useless to inquire  with mark twain we are on smoother ground  an almost mephistophilean coolness an unwearying search after the comic sides of serious subjects after the mean possibilities of the sublimethese with a native sense of incongruities and a glorious vein of exaggeration make up his stock intrade  the colossal exaggeration is of course natural to a land of oceanlike rivers and almighty tall pumpkins  no one has made such charming use of the trick as mark twain  the dryness of the story of a greenhorns sufferings who had purchased a genuine mexican plug is one of the funniest things in literature  the intense gravity and selfpity of the sufferer the enormous and gargantuan feats of his steed the extreme distress of body thence resulting make up a passage more moving than anything in rabelais  the same contrast between an innocent style of narrative and the huge palpable nonsense of the story told marks the tale of the agricultural newspaper which mr twain edited  to a joker of jokes of this sort a tour through palestine presented irresistible attractions  it is when we read of the innocents abroad that we discern the weak point of american humour when carried to its extreme here indeed is the place where the most peculiarly american fun has always failed  it has lacked reverence and sympathy and so when it was most itself never approached the masterpieces of thackeray and dickens to balance its defect by its merit american humour has always dared to speak out and mark twain especially has hit hard the errors of public opinion and the dishonest compromises of custom    suspended animation   it used to be thought that a man who said he liked dry champagne would say anything  in the same way some persons may hold that a person who could believe in the recurrent australian story of suspended animationartificially produced in animals and prolonged for monthscould believe in anything  it does not do however to be too dogmatic about matters of opinion in this world  perhaps the australian tale of an invention by which sheep and oxen are first made lifeless then rendered stiff ones by freezing and then restored to life and reproduced with gravy may be like the genius of beethoven  very few persons and these artists believed in beethoven at first but now he is often considered to be the greatest of composers  perhaps great discoveries like the works of men of original genius are certain to be received at first with incredulity and mockery  we will not therefore take up a dogmatic position either about the painting or the preserved meats of the future but will hope for the best  the ideally best of course is that the tale from australia may prove true  in that case the poorest will be able to earn three square meals a day like the australians themselves and while english butchers suffer for some one must suffer in all great revolutions smiling plenty will walk through our land studying a cookerybook  there are optimistic thinkers who gravely argue that the serious desires of humanity are the pledges of their own future fulfilment  if that be correct the australian myth may be founded on fact  there is no desire more deeprooted in our perishable nature than that which asks for plenty of beef and mutton at low prices  again humanity has so often turned over the idea of conveniently suspended animation before that there must be something in that conception  if we examine the history of ideas we shall find that they at first exist in the air  they float about beautiful alluring visions ready to be caught and made to serve mortal needs by the right man at the right moment  thus empedocles lucretius and the author of vestiges of creation all found out darwinism before mr darwin  they spied the idea but they left it floating they did not trap it and break it into scientific harness  solomon de caus as all the world has heard was put into a lunatic asylum for inventing the steamengine though no one would have doubted his sanity if he had offered to raise the devil or to produce the philosophers stone or the elixir vitae now these precious possessions have not been more in mens minds than a system of conveniently suspended animation  there is scarcely a peasantry in europe that does not sing the ballad of the dead bride  this lady in the legends always loves the cavalier not selected by her parents the detrimental cavalier  to avoid the wedding which is thrust on her she gets an old witch to do what the australian romancer professes to doto suspend her animation and so she is carried on an open bier to a chapel on the border of her lovers lands  there he rides the right lover with his menatarms the bride revives just in time is lifted on to his saddlebow and they need swift steeds that follow the fugitive pair  the sleeping beauty who is thrown into so long a swoon by the prick of the fairy thorn is another very old example while snowwhite in her glass coffin in the german nursery tale is a third instance  it is not only the early fancy of the balladmongers and fairy taletellers that has dwelt longingly on the idea of suspended animation all the mystics who all follow the same dim track that leads to nothing have believed in various forms of the imaginary australian experiment the seers of most tribes from kamschatka to zululand and thence to australia are feigned to be able to send their souls away while their bodies lie passive in the magical tent  the soul wanders over the earthly world and even to the home of the dead and returns in the shape of a butterfly or of a serpent to the body which has been lying motionless but uncorruptible in apparent death  the indian yogis can attain that third state of being all three being unknown to brahma which is neither sleeping nor waking but trance  to produce this ecstasy to do for themselves what some people at the antipodes pretend to do to sheep and cattle is the ideal aim of the existence of the yogi the neoplatonists were no wiser and greek legend tells a wellknown story of a married mystic whose suspended animation began at last to bore his wife  dear hermotimusthat was his name if we have not forgotten itis quite the most absent of men his spouse would say when her husbands soul left his body and took its walks abroad  on one occasion the philosophers spiritual part remained abroad so long that his lady ceased to expect its return  she therefore went through the usual mourning cut her hair cried and finally burned the body on the funeral pyre  we can do no more for miserable mortals when once the spirit has left their bones says homer  at that very moment the spirit returned and found its uninsured tenement of clay reduced to ashes  the sequel may be found in a poem of the late professor aytouns and in the same volume occurs the wondrous tale of colonel townsend who could suspend his animation at pleasure  there is certainly a good deal of risk as well as of convenience in suspended animation  people do not always welcome rip van winkle when he returns to life as we would all welcome mr jefferson if he revisited the glimpses of the footlights     the hard heir strides about the lands    and will not yield them for a day  there is the horrible chance of being buried alive which was always present to the mind of edgar poe  it occurs in one of his halfhumorous stories where a cataleptic man suddenly waking in a narrow bed in the smell of earthy mould believes he has been interred but finds himself mistaken  in the fall of the house of usher the wretched brother with his nervous intensity of sensation hears his sister for four days stirring in her vault before she makes her escape  in the strange effects of mesmerism on a dying man the animation is mesmerically suspended at the very instant when it was about naturally to cease  the results when the passes were reversed and the half fled life was half restored are described in a passage not to be recommended to sensitive readers  m about uses the same general idea in the fantastic plot of his lhomme a loreille cassee and the risk of breakage was insisted on by m about as well as by the inventive australian reporter  mr clarke russell has also frozen a pirate  thus the idea of suspended animation is in the air is floating among the visions of men of genius  it is perhaps for the great continent beneath the southern cross to realize the dreams of savages of seers of novelists of poets of yogis of plotinus of m about and of swedenborg  swedenborg too was a suspended animationist if we may use the term  what else than suspension of outer life was his internal breathing by which his body existed while his soul was in heaven hell or the ends of the earth when the australian discovery is universally believed in and acted on then and perhaps not till then will be the time for the great unappreciated  they will go quietly to sleep to waken a hundred years hence and learn how posterity likes their pictures and poems  they may not always be satisfied with the results but no artist will disbelieve in the favourable verdict of posterity till the supposed australian method is applied to men as well as to sheep and kangaroos    breaking up   the schools have by this time all broken up if that is still the term which expresses the beginning of their vacation  breaking up is no longer the festival that it was in the good old coaching daysnothing is what it was in the good old coaching days  boys can no longer pass a whole happy day driving through the country and firing peas at the wayfaring man  they have to travel by railway and other voyagers may well pray that their flight be not on breakingup day  the untrammelled spirits of boyhood are very much what they have always been  boys fill the carriages to overflowing  they sing they shout they devour extraordinary quantities of refreshment they buy whole libraries of railway novels and generally speaking behave as if the earth and the fulness of it were their own  this is trying to the mature traveller who has plenty of luggage on his mind and who wishes to sleep or to read the newspaper  boys have an extraordinary knack of losing their own luggage and of appearing at home like the companions of ulysses bearing with them only empty hands  this is usually their first exploit in the holidays  their arrival causes great excitement among their little sisters and in the breasts of their fathers wakens a presentiment of woe  when a little boy comes home his first idea is to indulge in harmless swagger  when tom tulliver went to school he took some percussion caps with him that the other lads might suppose him to be familiar with the use of guns  the schoolboy has other devices for keeping up the manly character in the family circle  the younger ones gather round him while he narrates the adventures of himself and smith minor and walker of briggss house in a truly epic spirit  he has made unheardof expeditions up the river has chaffed a farmer almost into apoplexy has come in fifth in the house paperchase has put the french master to open shame and has got his twentytwo colours  these are the things that make a boy respected by his younger brothers and admired by his still younger sisters  they of course have a good deal to tell him  the setter puppies must be inspected  a match is being got up with the village eleven who are boastful and confident in the possession of a bowling curate  to this the family hero rejoins that he will crump the parson a threat not so awful as it sounds  there is a wasps nest which has been carefully preserved for this eventful hour and which is to be besieged with boiling water gunpowder and other engines of warfare  thus the schoolboys first days at home are a glorious hour of crowded sport  it cannot be denied that as the holidays go on a biggish boy sometimes finds time hang heavy on his hands while his father and mother find him hang heavy on theirs  the first excitement rubs off  the fun of getting up handicap races among children under twelve years of age wears away one cannot always be taking wasps nests  of course there are many happy boys who live in the country and pursue the pleasures of manhood with the zest of extreme youth  before they are fourteen they have a rod on a salmon river a gun on a moor horses and yachts and boats at their will with keepers and gillies to do their bidding  others not so much indulged by fortune and fond parents live at least among hills and streams or by the sea  they are never in the way for they are always in the open air  their summer holidays may be things to look back upon all through life  natural history and the beauty of solitary nature the joys of the swimmer in deep river pools shut in with cool grey walls of rock and fringed with fern the loveliness of the high table lands and the intense hush that follows sunset by the trout streamthese things are theirs and become a part of their consciousness  in later and wearier years these spectacles will flash before their eyes unbidden they will see the water dimpled by rising trout and watch the cattle stealing through the ford and disappearing grey shapes in the grey of the hills  in boyhood the legends that cling to ancient castles where only a shell of stone is standing and to the ashtrees that grow by the feudal gateway and supplied the wood for spear shaftsthese and all the stories of red men that haunt the moors and of kelpies that make their dwelling in the waters become very real to us when standing in the dusk by a moorland loch  if some otter or great fish breaks the water and the stillness with a sudden splash a boy feels a romantic thrill a pause of expectation that later he will never experience  the thoughts of a boy are long long thoughts says the poet he thinks them out by himself on the downs or the hills and tells them to nobody  if we all lived in the country the advent of boys would not be a thing to contemplate with secret dread  it is rather a terrible thing a houseful of boys in a town or in a pretty thickly populated district boys it is true are always a source of pleasure to the humorist and the scientific observer of mankind  they are scarcely our fellowcreatures so to speak they live in a world of their own ruled by eccentric traditional laws  they have their own heroes and are much more interested in mr alan steel or lohmann than in persons like mr arthur balfour whose cricket is only middling  they have rules of conduct which cannot be called immoral but which are certainly relics of a very ancient state of tribal morality  the humour of it is that the modern boy is so grave so selfassured and has such abundance of aplomb  he has acquired an air of mysterious sagacity and occasionally seems to smile at the petty interests with which men divert themselves  in a suburban or city home he can find very little that he thinks worth doing and then he becomes discontented and disagreeable  it is better that he should do that perhaps than that he should aim at being a dandy  the boydandy is an odd and at bottom a slovenly creature  he is fond of varnished boots of pink neckties of lavendercoloured gloves and above all of scent  the quantity of scent that a lad of sixteen will pour on his handkerchief is something perfectly astounding in this stage of his development he is addicted to falling into love or rather into flirtation  he keeps up a correspondence with a young lady in miss pinkertons establishment  they see each other in church when he looks unutterable things from the gallery  this kind of boy is not unlikely to interest himself speculatively in horseraces  he has communications with a bookmaker who finds boulogne a salubrious residence  he would like to know the officers if his home is in a garrison town and he humbly imitates these warriors at an immense distance  he passes much time in trying to colour a pipe  this is not a nice sort of boy to have at home for the holidays nor is it likely that he does much good when he is at school  it is pleasanter to think of the countless jolly little fellows of twelve who are happily busy all day with lawntennis cricket and general diversion in the open air  their appearance their manly frankness their modesty and good temper make their homes happier in the holidays than in the quieter nine months of the year  let us hope that they will not put off their holiday tasks to be learned in the train on their way back to school  this alas is the manner of boyhood    on shaving   a philanthropist has published a little book which interests persons who in civilized society form a respectable minority and in the savage world an overpowering majority  but savage or polite almost all men must shave or must be shaved and the author of a few useful hints on shaving is in his degree a benefactor to his fellowcreatures  the mere existence of the beard may be accounted for in various ways but however we explain it the beard is apt to prove a nuisance to its proprietor  speculators of the old school may explain the beard as part of the punishment entailed on man with the curse of labour  the toilsome day begins with the task of scraping the chin and contemplating as the process goes on a face that day by day grows older and more weary  no race that shaves can shirk the sense of passing time or be unaware of the approach of wrinkles of crowsfeet of greyness  shaving is the most melancholy and to many people the most laborious of labours  it seems therefore more plausible if less scientific to look on the beard as a penalty for some ancient offence of our race than to say with mr grant allen and perhaps other disciples of mr darwin that the beard is the survival of a very primitive decoration  according to this view man was originally very hairy  his hair wore off in patches as he acquired the habits of sleeping on his sides and of sitting with his back against a tree or against the wall of his hut  the hair of dogs is not worn off thus but what of that  after some hundreds of thousands of years had passed our ancestors according to this system awoke to the consciousness that they were patchy and spotty and they determined to eradicate all hair that was not ornamental  the eyebrows moustache and unfortunately the beard seemed to most races worth preserving there are indeed some happy peoples who have no beards or none worth notice  very early in their history they must have taken the great resolve to live down and root out the martial growth that fringes our lips  but among european peoples the absence of a beard has usually been a reproach and the enemies of njal in ancient iceland could find nothing worse to say of him than that he was beardless  mehemet ali bought sham beards for his egyptian grenadiers that they might more closely resemble the european model  the soldiers of harold thought that the normans were all priests because they were shavelings and it is only natural that soldiers should in all countries be bearded  it is almost impossible to shave during a campaign  stendhal the french novelist and critic was remarkable as the best perhaps the only clean shaved man in the french army during the dreadful retreat from moscow  in his time as in that of our fathers ideas of beauty had changed and the smooth chin was as much the mark of a gentleman as the bearded chin had been the token of a man  the idea that shaving is a dutyceremonial as among the egyptian priests or social merely as among ourselvesis older than the invention of steel or even of bronze razors  nothing is more remarkable in savage life than the resolution of the braves who shave with a shell or with a broken piece of glass left by european mariners  a warrior will throw himself upon the ground and while one friend sits on his head and another holds his arms and prevents him from struggling a third will scrape his chin with the shell or the broken bottleglass till he rises bleeding but beardless  macaulay it seems must have shaved almost as badly with the razor of modern life  when he went to a barber and after an easy shave asked what he owed the fellow replied just what you generally give the man who shaves you sir  i generally give him two cuts on each cheek said the historian of england  shaving requires a combination of qualities which rarely meet in one amateur  you should have plenty of razors unlike a prussian ambassador of the stingy frederick  this ambassador according to voltaire cut his throat with the only razor he possessed  the chin of that diplomatist must have been unworthy alike of the court to which he was accredited and of that from which he came  the exquisite shaver who would face the world with a smooth chin requires many razors many strops many brushes odd soaps a light steady hand and perhaps a certain gaiety of temper which prevents edged weapons from offering unholy temptations  possibly the shaver is born not made like the poet it is sure that many men are born with an inability to shave  hence comes the need for the kindly race of barbers a race dear to literature  their shops were the earliest clubs their conversation was all the ancient world knew in the way of society journals  horace george eliot beaumarchais cervantes and scott have appreciated the barber and celebrated his characteristics  if the wearing of the beard ever became universal the world and especially the spanish and italian world would sadly miss the barber and the barbers shop  the energy of the british character our zeal for individual enterprise makes us a selfshaving race the latin peoples are economical but they do not grudge paying for an easy shave americans in this matter are more continental than english in their taste  was it not in marseilles that his friends induced mark twain to be shaved by a barber worthy of the bottleglass or seashell stage of his profession  they pretended that his performances were equal to those of the barber on board the ship that brought them from america  englishmen as a rule shave themselves when they do not wear beards  the author of the little pamphlet before us gives a dozen curious hints which prove the difficulty of the art  almost all razors he seems to think were made to sell  he suggests that razors of tried and trusty character razors whose public form can be depended upon should be purchased of barbers  but it is not every barber who will part with such possessions  razors are like scotch sheep dogs no one would keep a bad one or sell or give away a good one  coelebs did not find the quest of a wife more arduous than all men find that of a really responsible razor you may be unlucky in the important matter of lather  for soap our author gives a recipe which reminds one of waltons quaint prescriptions and queer preparations  shaving soap should be made at home it seems and the mystery of its manufacture is here disclosed  the only way to keep razors set is to persevere in sending them to various barbers till the genius who can set them to your hand is discovered  perhaps he lives at aleppo perhaps like the father of a heroine of comic song at jerusalem  till he is discovered the shaver wins no secure happiness and in the search for the barber who has an elective affinity for the shaver may be found material for an operetta or an epic  the shaver figures as a sort of alastor seeking the ideal setter of razors as shelleys alastor sought ideal beauty in the neighbourhood of afghanistan and in the very home of the central asian question  no razor should be condemned till it has been stropped well and carefully and this brings us to the great topic of strops  some say that soldiers old buff belts make the best strops  the scotch peasantry use a peculiar hard smooth fungus which grows in decaying elm trees  our author has heard that government now demands the return of the old buff belts government cannot want them all for its own use and perhaps will see to it that old buff strops once more find an open market  in the lack of old buff belts you may mix up tallow and the ashes of burnt newspaper and smear this unctuous compound on the strop  people who neglect these tips and who are clumsy like most of us may waste a fortyeighth part of their adult years in shaving  this time is worth economizing and with a little forethought an ideal razorsetter tallow buff belts burnt newspapers and the rest we may shave in five minutes daily    street noises   if any calm a calm despair is the portion of people who would like to reform that is to abolish the street noises of london  these noises are constantly commented upon with much freedom in the columns of various contemporaries  nor is this remarkable for persons who are occupied with what is called brainwork are peculiarly sensitive to the disturbances of the streets  sometimes they cannot sleep till morning sometimes they can only sleep in the earlier watches of the night and as a rule they cannot write novels or articles or treatises they cannot compose comic operas or paint in the midst of a row  now the streets of london are the scenes of rows at every hour of night and day light  it is not the roll of carriages and carts that provokes irritation and drives the sensitive man or woman half mad  even the whistling of the metropolitan trains may perhaps be borne with if the drivers are not too ambitious artists and do not attempt fantasias and variations on their powerful instrument  the noises that ruin health temper and power of work the noises that cause an incalculable waste of time money and power are all voluntary and perhaps preventable  let us examine the working hours of the nervous or irritable musician mathematician man of letters or member of parliament  on second thoughts the last may be omitted as if he cannot sleep in a tedious debate his case is beyond cure     not bromide of potassium    nor all the drowsy speeches in the world  can medicine him to forgetfulness of street noises  for the others the day may be said to begin about five when the voice of the chimneysweep is heard in the land  here we may observe that servants are the real causes of half the most provoking noises in london  people ask why the sweep cannot ring the bell like other people  but the same people remark that even the howl of the sweep does not waken the neighbours servants  of what avail then could his use of the bell prove  it generally takes the sweep twentyfive minutes exactly to bring the servants to open the door  meanwhile the eminent men of letters in the street open their windows and show a very fair command of language understanded by the people  but the sweep only laughs and every three minutes utters a howl which resembles no other noise with which men are acquainted  where do young sweeps learn to make this cry which can only be acquired by long practice  perhaps it is inherited like the music of the damned nightingales as the sleepless political economist called the daulian birds  when the sweep is silent when slumber is stealing over the weary eyelids then traction engines or steamrollers or some other scientific improvement on wheels begin to traverse the streets and shake the houses  this does not last more than a quarter of an hour and then a big bell rings and the working men and women tramp gaily by chatting noisily and in excellent spirits  now comes the milkmans turn  he like the chimneysweep has his own howl softer more flutelike in quality than that of the sweep but still capable of waking any one who is not a domestic servant in hard training  the milkman also cries woa to his horse at every house and accompanies himself on his great tin cans making a noise most tolerable and not to be endured  is it necessary absolutely necessary that the milkman should howl  in some parts of town milkwomen distribute their wares without howling  they do certainly wear very short petticoats but that is matter as aristotle says for a separate disquisition  on the other hand milkwomen exist who howl as loudly as milkmen  we cannot but fear that without these noises it would be difficult to attract the notice of servants  if this pessimistic view be correct sweeps and milkmen will howl while london is a city inhabited  and even if we could secure the services of milkwomen of the silent species that ring the bell could we hope to have female chimneysweeps as well behaved  here at all events is a new opening for female labour  when the milkman has done his worst the watercress people come and mournfully ejaculate  now it is time for the sleepless and nervous to get up and do their work  now too the barrelorgan comes round  there are persons who fortunately for themselves are so indifferent to music that they do not mind the barrelorgan  it is neither better nor worse to them than the notes of patti and from the voice of that siren as from all music they withdraw their attention without difficulty  but other persons cannot work while the dirty grinder and the women that drag his instrument are within hearing  the barrelorgan again is strong in the support of servants especially nurses who find that the music diverts babies  the rest of the day is made hideous by the awful notes of every species of unintelligible and uncalled for costermonger from him who apparently bellows annie erskine to her who cries all ablowing and agrowing  there are miscreants who want to buy bones to sell ferns to sell images wicker chairs and other inutilities while last come the two men who howl in a discordant chorus and attempt to dispose of the second edition of the evening paper at ten oclock at night  at eleven all the neighbours turn out their dogs to bark and the dogs waken the cats which scream like demoniacs  then the public houses close and the people who have been inebriated if not cheered stagger howling by  stragglers yell and swear and use foul language till about four in the morning without attracting the unfavourable notice of the police  two or three half drunken men and women bellow and blaspheme opposite the sufferers house for an hour at a time  and then the chimneysweep renews his rounds and the milkman follows him  the screams of costermongers and of rowdies might surely be suppressed by the police  a system of local option might be introduced  in all decent quarters householders would vote against the licensed bellowings of cads and costermongers  in districts which think a noise pleasant and lively the voting would go the other way  people would know where they could be quiet and where noise would reign  except bologna perhaps no town is so noisy as london but then compared with bologna london is tranquillity itself  it is fair to say that really nervous and irritable people find the country worse than town  the noise of the nightingales is deplorable  the lamentations of a cow deprived of her calf or of a passionstricken cow wailing for her demon lover on the next farm excel anything that the milkman can perpetrate and almost vie with the performances of the sweep  when the cocks are crowing a merry midnight as in the ballad the sleepless patient wishes he could make off as quietly and quickly as the ghostly sons of the wife of ushers well  dogs delight to bark in the country more than in town  leechs picture of the unfortunate victim who left london to avoid noise and found that the country was haunted by cochinchina cocks illustrates the still repose of the rural life  nervous people on the whole are in a minute minority  no one else seems to mind how loud and horrible the noises of london are and therefore we have faint hope of seeing nocturnal arry gagged the drunken drab moved on and the sweep compelled to ring the bell till some one comes and opens the door of the house in whose chimneys he is professionally interested    lending of books   a popular clergyman has found it necessary to appeal to his friends in a very touching way  the friends of the divine are requested to return colenso on the pentateuch and another volume which they have borrowed the advertisement has none of that irony which finds play in the notice the gentleman who took a brown silk umbrella with gold crutch handle and left a blue cotton article is asked to restore the former  the advertiser seems to speak more in sorrow and in hope than in anger and we sincerely trust that he may get his second volume of colenso on the pentateuch  but if he does he will be more fortunate than most owners of books  pitiful are their thoughts as they look round their shelves the silent friends of their youth the acquisitions of their mature age have departed  even popular preachers cannot work miracles like thomas a kempis and pray back their borrowed volumes  as the rev robert elsmere says miracles do not happenat least to bookcollectors  murray sighs oer pope and swift and many a treasure more said cowper when lord mansfields house was burned and we have all had experience of the sorrows of murray  even people who are not bibliophiles nay who class bibliophiles with blueandwhite young men know that a book in several volumes loses an unfair proportion of its usefulness and almost all its value when one or more of the volumes are gone  grotes works or mills carlyles or milmans seem nothing when they are incomplete  it always happens somehow that the very tome you want to consult is that which has fallen among borrowers  even panurge who praised the race of borrowers so eloquently could scarcely have found an excuse for the borrowers of books     tel est le triste sort de tout livre prete    souvent il est perdu toujours il est gate  often lost always spoiled said charles nodier such is the fate of every book one lends  the parisian collector guibert de pixerecourt would lend no books at all to his dearest friends  his motto inscribed above the lintel of his librarydoor was go to them that sell and buy for yourselves  as pixerecourt was the owner of many volumes which they that sell cannot procure or which could only be bought at enormous rates his caution we will not say churlishness was rather inconvenient for men of letters  but if hard pressed and in a strait he would make his friend a gift of the book which was necessary to his studies  this course had the effect of preventing people from wishing to borrow  but many of the great collectors have been more generous than pixerecourt  we forget the name not an illustrious one of the too good natured man who labelled his books not my own but my friends  sibi et amicis his own and his friends property has been the motto of several illustrious amateurs since grolier and maioli stamped it on the beautifully decorated morocco of their bindings  other people have invented bookplates containing fell curses in doggrel latin or the vernacular on the careless or dishonest borrower     aspice pierrot pendut    parceque librum non a rendu  is the kind of macaronic french and latin which schoolboys are accustomed to write under a sketch of the borrower expiating his offences on the gallows  the mischief of borrowing the persistent illluck which cleaves to property thus obtained have been proverbial since the young prophet dropped the axehead in the deep water and cried alas for it is borrowed  the old prophet readily altering the specific gravity of the article enabled his disciple to regain it  but there are no prophets now none at least who can repair our follies and remove their baneful effects by a friendly miracle  what miracle can restore the books we borrow and lose or the books we borrow and spoil with ink or with candlewax or which children scrawl or paint over or which the dog ate like the famous pollbook at an irish election that fell into the broth and ultimately into the jaws of an illiterate animal  books are such delicate things  yet menand still more frequently womenread them so close to the fire that the bindings warp and start and gape like the shells of a moribund oyster  other people never have a paper knife and cut the leaves of books with cards railway tickets scissors their own fingers or any other weapon that chances to seem convenient then books are easily dirtied  a little dust falls into the leaves and is smudged by the fingers  no fuller on earth can cleanse it  the art of man can remove certain sorts of stains but only by stripping the book of its binding and washing leaf by leaf in certain acids an expensive and dangerous process  there are books for use stout everyday articles and books for pious contemplation original editions or tomes that have belonged to great collectors  the borrower who only wants to extract a passage of which he is in momentary need is a person heedless of these distinctions  he enters a friends house or for this sort of borrower thrives at college a friends rooms seizes a first edition of keats or shelley or an aldine homer or elzevir caesar of the good date and hurries away with it leaving a hasty scrawl i have taken your shelley signed with initials  perhaps the owner of the book never sees the note  perhaps he does not recognize the hand  the borrower is just the man to forget the whole transaction  so there is a blank in the shelves a gap among the orderly volumes a blank never to be filled up unless our amateur advertises his woes in the newspapers  all borrowers are bad but in this as in other crimes there are degrees  the man who acts as menage advises in the aphorism which garrick used as a motto on his bookplate the man who reads a book instantly and promptly returns it is the most pardonable borrower  but how few people do this  as a rule the last thing the borrower thinks of is to read the book which he has secured  or rather that is the last thing but one the very last idea that enters his mind is the project of returning the volume  it simply lies about and gets dusty in his rooms  a very bad borrower is he who makes pencil marks on books perhaps he is a little more excusable than the borrower who does not read at all  a clean margin is worth all the marginalia of poe though he to do him justice seems chiefly to have written on volumes that were his own property  de quincey according to mr hill burton appears to have lacked the faculty of mind which recognizes the duty of returning books mr hill burton draws a picture of papaverius living in a sort of cave or den the walls of which were books while books lay around in tubs who was to find a loved and lost tome in this vast accumulation  but de quincey at least made good use of what he borrowed  the common borrower does nothing of the kind  even professor mommsen when he had borrowed manuscripts of great value in his possession allowed his house to get itself set on fire  europe lamented with him but deepest was the wail of a certain college at cambridge which had lent its treasures  even paul louis courier blotted horribly a laurentian ms of daphnis and chloe  when chenier lent his annotated malherbe the borrower spilt a bottle of ink over it  thinking of these things of these terrible irreparable calamities the wonder is not that men still lend but that any one has the courage to borrow  it is more dreadful far to spoil or lose a friends book than to have our own lost or spoiled  stoicism easily submits to the latter sorrow but there is no remedy for a conscience sensible of its own unlucky guilt    club bores   the london club has been sitting in a judicial way on one of its members this member of the club seems to have been what thackerays waiter called a harbitrary gent  the servants of the club had to complain that he did not make their lives so sweet to them that they the servants greatly cared to live if we may parody arthurs address to his erring queen  the club has not made a vacancy in its ranks by requesting the arbitrary member to withdraw  but his conduct was deemed on the report of the committee worthy of being considered by the club  and that is always something  in an age when clubs are really almost universal most men have had occasion to wish that their society would sit occasionally on some of the members  the member who bullies the servants is a not uncommon specimen of the clubbore  he may be called the bore truculent he has been excellently caricatured by thackeray in the book of snobs  there we have the clubbore who makes such a fuss about his chop and scolds the waiter so terribly  look at it sir is it a chop for a gentleman  smell it sir is it fit to put on a club table  these or such as these are the words of the gallant terror of waiters  now it is clearly unjust to make a waiter responsible for the errors however grave of a very different character the cook  but this mistake the arbitrary gent is continually making  the cook is safe in his inaccessible stronghold down below  he cannot be paraded for punishment on the quarterdeck where captain bragg of the gunboat and torpedo club exercises justice  therefore the miserable waiter is rebuked in tones of thunder because the captains steak is underdone or because nature or the market gardener has not made the stalks of asparagus so green and succulent as their charming tops  people who do not know the scolding clubbore at home are apt to be thankful that they are not favoured with his intimate acquaintance and are doubly grateful that they are not members of his family  for if in a large and quiet room full of strangers a man can give loose to his temper without provocation and outroar the thunder what must this noisy person do at home  in an english family says a social critic the father is the man who shouts  how the clubbore must shout when he is in his own castle surrounded only by his trembling kindred and anxious retainers in his castle there is no one to resist or criticise himunless indeed his wife happen to be a lady like clytemnestra of masculine resolution in that case the arbitrary gent may be a father of a family who is not allowed to shout at home but is obliged to give nature free play by shouting abroad  there are plenty of other clubbores besides the man who rates these generally affable and wellbehaved persons the club servants  one of the worst is the man whom you never see anywhere except at the club and whom you never fail to see there  it is bad enough when you have no acquaintance with him  murders have probably been committed by sensitive persons for no better reason often for worse reasons than that they are tired of seeing some one else going about  his voice his manner his cough especially his cough become unendurable  people who cough in clubs are generally amateurs of the art  they are huskier more wheezing more pertinacious in working away at a cough till they have made it a masterpiece than any other mortals  we believe that club asthmats it is quite as good a word as aesthetes practise in the reading room of the british museum where they acquire their extraordinary compass and mastery of various notes  be this as it may the cough which drives every one but its owner out of the room though doubtless an affliction to the proprietor gives him rank as a clubbore of the finest water  the bore who always enters into conversation though he has nothing to say merely because you used to dislike him at school or college or elsewhere is another common annoyance  the man who is engaged apparently on a large work and who rushes about the library hunting for proclus and jamblichus when other occupants of the room wish to be quiet is naturally detested  most men are the bores of some other person  people of watchful mind and intelligent habit who talk in the drawingroom are regarded as bores by fat old gentlemen who wish to sleep there  and as these gentlemen turn the drawingroom into a dormitory which resounds with their snoring they in turn are bores to people who wish to read the papers  but if these students drop the poker with a clang or dash down small tables in order to waken the sleepers they in their turn give a good deal of annoyance  the man who talks about politics at great length is only one of the common bores of the world transported into a club  but the man with a voice which in ordinary conversation pierces through all the hum of voices like a clarion note in battle would be a bore anywhere  if he were in the wilderness of sinai he would annoy the monks in the convent near the top  his voice is one of those terrible inscrutable scourges of nature like the earthquake and the mosquito which tax our poor human wisdom to reconcile with any monistic theory of the benevolent government of the universe  once admit an evil principle however and the thing is clear  the clubbore with the trumpet tones which he cannot moderate is possessed on this theory by a fiend  as men are talking quietly of turnips in one corner of the room of rent in another and of racing in a third his awful notes blend in from the fourth corner with strident remarks on bulgarian philology  the ancient greeks were well accustomed to club life for each of their little cities was only a large club  they had therefore to deal with the problem of bores  some of them consequently had the institution of annually devoting to the infernal gods the most unpopular citizens  these persons were called catharmata which may be freely translated scapegoats  could not clubs annually devote one or more scapebores to the infernal gods  they might ballot for them of course on some merciful and lenient principle  one white ball in ten or twentyblack ones might enable the bore to keep his membership for the next year  the warning if he only escaped this species of ostracism very narrowly might do him a great deal of moral good  of course the process would be unpleasant but it is seldom agreeable to be done good to  occasionally even the most goodnatured members would stand apart not voting or even would place the black ball in the mystic urn  then the scapebore would have his subscription returned to him and would be obliged to seek in other haunts servants to swear at and sofas to snore on  another suggestion that members should be balloted for anew every five years would simply cause clubs to be depopulated  pallmall and st jamess would be desolate mourning their children and refusing comfort  the system would act like a proscription  people would give up their friends that they might purchase aid against their enemies  clubs are more endurable as they are though members do suffer grievously from the garrulity the coughs the slumbrous tendencies and the temper of their fellowmen    phiz   mr hablot k browne better known as phiz was an artist of a departed school to whom we all owe a great deal of amusement  he was not so versatile nor so original as cruickshank he had not the genius nor the geniality still less the sense of beauty of john leech  in his later years his work became more and more unequal till he was sometimes almost as apt to scribble hasty scrawls as constantin guys  m guys was an artist selected by m baudelaire as the fine flower of modern art and the true though hurried designer of the fugitive modern beauty  it is recorded that m guys was once sent to draw a scene of triumph and certain illuminations in london probably about the end of the crimean war  his sketch did not reach the office of the paper for which he worked in time and some one went to see what the man of genius was doing  he was found in bed but he was equal to the occasion  snatching a sheet of paper and a pencil he drew a curve  there said he is the triumphal arch and herescribbling a number of scratches like eccentric cometshere are the fireworks  mr brownes drawings occasionally showed a tendency to approach the rudimentary sort of pictograph rather than give what a dramatic critic calls a solid and studied rendering of events  but many of mr brownes illustrations of dickens are immortal  they are closely bound up with our earliest and latest recollections of the work of the incomparable boz  mr pickwick we believe was not wholly due to the fancy of mr browne but of the unfortunate seymour whom death prevented from continuing the series  every one has heard how mr thackeray then an unknown man wished to illustrate one of mr dickenss early stories and brought mr dickens examples of his skill  fortunately his offer was not accepted mr thackerays pencil was the proper ally of his pen  he saw and drew costigan becky emmy lord steyne as no one else could have drawn them but he had not beheld the creations of boz in the same light of imaginative vision  sometimes too it must be allowed that mr thackeray drew very badly  his peg of limavaddy in the irish sketch book is a most formless lady and by no means justifies the enthusiasm of her poet  thus the task of illustrating pickwick fell to mr browne and he carried on the conceptions of his predecessor with extraordinary vigour  the old vein of exaggerated caricature he inherited from the taste of an elder generation  but making allowance for the exaggeration what can be better than mr pickwick sliding or the awful punishment of stiggins at the hands of the longsuffering weller  we might wish that the young lady in furtopped boots was prettier and indeed more of a lady  but mr browne never had much success we think in drawing pretty faces  he tried to improve in this respect but either his girls had little character or the standard of female beauty has altered  as to this latter change there can be no doubt at all  leechs girls are not like thackerays early pictures of women and mr du mauriers are sometimes sicklied oer with the pale cast of an aesthetic period  it is probable that the influence of mr brownes art reacted in some degree on dickens  in the old times every one whom the author invented the artist was pretty certain to caricature  thus the author may have felt the temptation to keep pace with the frolic humour of the artist mr browne cannot be blamed for a tendency to exaggerate noses and other features which was almost universal in his time  none of us can say what conception would now be entertained of dickenss characters if mr browne had not drawn them  in the later works of dickens when they were illustrated other artists were employed as mr stone and mr fildes these are accomplished painters of established reputation and they of course avoided the old system of caricature the old forced humour  but we doubt whether their designs are so intimately associated with the persons in the stories as are the designs of mr browne  the later artists had this disadvantage that the later novels except great expectations which was not illustrated were neither so good nor so popular as pickwick nicholas nickleby martin chuzzlewit david copperfield or even bleak house  we never can have any mr micawber but phizs indescribably jaunty micawber  his mr pecksniff is not very like a human being but his collars and his eyeglass redeem him and after all pecksniff is a transcendental and incredible tartuffe  tom pinch is even less sympathetic in the drawings than in the novel  jonas chuzzlewit is also too steep as a modern critic has said in modern slang  but in the novel too mr jonas is somewhat precipitous nicholas nickleby is a colourless sort of young man in the illustrations but then he is not very vividly presented in the text  ralph nickleby and arthur gride may pair off with jonas chuzzlewit but who can disparage the immortal mr squeers  from the first moment when we see him at his inn with the starveling little boys through all the story mr squeers is consistently exquisite  in spite of his cruelty coarseness hypocrisy there is a kind of humour in mr squeers which makes him not quite detestable  in david copperfield mr micawber is perhaps the only artistic creation of much permanent merit unless it be the waiter who consumed davids dinner and the landlady who gave him a pint of the regular stunning  in bleak house mr browne made some credible attempts to be tragic and pathetic  jo is remembered and the gateway of the churchyard where the rats were and the ghosts walk in the gloomy domain of lady dedlock  it is a singular and gloomy feature in the character of young ladies and gentlemen of a particular type that they have ceased to care for dickens as they have ceased to care for scott  they say they cannot read dickens  when mr pickwicks adventures are presented to the modern maid she behaves like the cambridge freshman  euclide viso cohorruit et evasit  when he was shown euclid he evinced dismay and sneaked off even so do most young people act when they are expected to read nicholas nickleby and martin chuzzlewit  they call these masterpieces too gutterly gutter they cannot sympathize with this honest humour and conscious pathos  consequently the innumerable references to sam weller and mrs gamp and mr pecksniff and mr winkle which fill our ephemeral literature are written for these persons in an unknown tongue  the number of people who could take a good pass in mr calverleys pickwick examination paper is said to be diminishing  pathetic questions are sometimes put  are we not too much cultivated  can this fastidiousness be anything but a casual passing phase of taste  are all people over thirty who cling to their dickens and their scott old fogies  are we wrong in preferring them to bootles baby and the quick or the dead and the novels of m paul bourget    theory and practice of proposals   there is no subject in the whole range of human affairs so interesting to a working majority of the race as the theory and practice of proposals of marriage  men perhaps cease to be very much concerned about the ordeal when they have been through it  but the topic never loses its charm for the fair though they are presumed only to wait and to listen and never to speak for themselves  that this theory has its exceptions appears to be the conviction of many novelists  they not only make their young ladies lead up to it but heroines occasionally go much further than that and do more than prompt an inexperienced wooer  but all these things are only known to the world through the confessions of novelists who perhaps themselves receive confessions  m goncourt not long ago requested all his fair readers to send him notes of their own private experience  how did you feel when you were confirmed  how did alphonse whisper his passion  these and other questions quite as intimate were set by m goncourt  he meant to use the answers with all discreet reserve in his next novel  do english novelists receive any private information and if they do not how are we to reconcile their knowledgethey are all loveadeptswith the morality of their lives we live like other people only more purely says the author of some private views which is all very well  no man is bound to incriminate himself  but as in the course of his career a successful novelist describes many hundreds of proposals all different are we to believe that he is so prompted merely by imagination  are there no documents as m zola says for all this prodigious deal of lovemaking  these are questions which await a reply in the interests of ethics and of art meanwhile an editor of enterprise has selected fiveandthirty separate examples of popping the question as he calls it from the tomes of british fiction  to begin with an early casewhen tom jones returned to his tolerant sophia he called her madam and she called him mr jones not tom  she asked thomas how she could rely on his constancy when the lover of miss segrim drew a mirror from his pocket like strephon in iolanthe and cried behold that lovely figure that shape those eyes with other compliments can the man who shall be in possession of these be inconstant  sophia was charmed by the man in possession but forced her features into a frown  presently thomas caught her in his arms and the rest was in accordance with what mr trollope and the best authorities recommend  how differently did arthur pendennis carry himself when he proposed to laura and did not want to be accepted  lord farintoshhis affecting adventure is published hereproposed nicely enough but did not behave at all well when he was rejected  by the way when young men in novels are not accepted they invariably ask the lady whether she loves another  only young ladies and young men whom they have rejected know whether this is common in real life  it does not seem quite right  kneeling has probably gone out though mr jingle knelt before the maiden aunt and remained in that attitude for no less than five minutes  in mr howells modern instance kneeling was not necessary and the heroine kept thrusting her face into her lovers necktie so the author tells us  m theophile gautier says that ladies invariably lay their heads on the shoulder of the man who proposes if he is the right man and for this piece of business as we regret to say he considers it he assigns various motives  but he was a frenchman and the cynicism of that nation to parody a speech of tom joness cannot understand the delicacy of ours  mr blackmore in lorna doone lets his lover make quite a neat and appropriate speech but that was in the seventeenth century  when artemus ward began a harangue of this sort betsy jane knocked him off the fence on which he was sitting and first criticising his eloquence in a trenchant style added if you mean being hitched im in it  in other respects the lover of lorna doone behaved as the best authorities recommend  mr whyte melville ventured to describe chastelards proposal to mary stuart but it was not exactly in mr swinburnes manner and where historical opinions disagree no reliance can be placed on speeches which were not taken down by the intelligent reporters  mr slope had his ears boxed when he proposed to mrs bold but such amazonian conduct is probably rare and neither party is apt to boast of it  he also being accepted behaved in the manner to which the highest authorities have lent their sanction or at least he meant to do so when the lady fled like a roe to her chamber  for all widows are not like widow malone ochone renowned in song  when arbaces the magician proposed to ione he did so in the most necromantic and hierophantic manner in which it could be done his properties including a statue of isis an altar and a quick blue darting irregular flame  but his flame quick blue darting and irregular as it was lighted no answering blaze in the icecold breast of the lovely lone  when rejected in spite of a splendid arrangement of magic lanterns then a novelty got up regardless of expense arbaces swore like an intoxicated mariner rather than a necromaunt accustomed to move in the highest circles and pentacles nancy miss broughtons heroine tells her middleaged wooer among other things that she accepts him because i did think it would be nice for the boys but i like you myself besides  after this ardent confession he kissed her with a sort of diffidence  many men would have preferred to go out and kick the boys  mr rochesters proposal to jane eyre should be read in the works both of bret harte and of miss bronte  we own that we prefer bret hartes mr rawjester who wearily ran the poker through his hair and wiped his boots on the dress of his beloved  even in the original authority mr rochester conducted himself rather like a wild beast  he ground his teeth he seemed to devour miss eyre with his flaming glance  miss eyre behaved with sense  i retired to the door  proposals of this desperate and homicidal character are probably rare in real life or at least out of lunatic asylums  to be sure mr rochesters house was a kind of lunatic asylum  adam bedes proposal to dinah was a very thoughtful earnest proposal john inglesant himself could not have been less like that victorious rascal tom jones  colonel jack on the other hand used no great ceremony  but colonel jack like the woman of samaria in the scotch ministers sermon had enjoyed a large and rich matrimonial experience and went straight to the point being married the very day of his successful wooing  some one in a story of mr wilkie collinss asks the fatal question at a croquet party  at lawntennis as nimrod said long ago the pace is too good to inquire into matters of the affections  in sir walters golden prime or rather in the fortyfive as sir walter understood it ladies were in no hurry and could select elegant expressions  thus did flora reply to waverley i can but explain to you with candour the feelings which i now entertain how they might be altered by a train of circumstances too favourable perhaps to be hoped for it were in vain even to conjecture only be assured mr waverley that after my brothers honour and happiness there is none which i shall more sincerely pray for than yours  this love is indeed what sidney smith heard the scotch lady call love in the abstract  mr kingsleys tom thurnall somehow proposed was accepted and was converted all at oncea more complex erototheological performance was never heard of before  many of mr abells thirtyfive cases are selected from novelists of no great mark it would have been more instructive to examine only the treatment of the great masters of romance  but after all this is of little consequence  all day long and every day novelists are teaching the art of love and playing ovid to the time  but what are novels without love  mere waste paper only fit to be reduced to pulp and restored to a whiteness and firmness on which more love lessons may be written 135    master samuel pepys   no man is a hero to his valet and unluckily samuel pepys by way of a valet chose posterity  all the trifles of temper habit vice and social ways which a keeneyed valet may observe in his master samuel pepys carefully recorded about himself and bequeathed to the diversion of future generations  the world knows pepys as the only man who ever wrote honest confessions for rousseau could not possibly be candid for five minutes together and st augustine was heavily handicapped by being a saint  samuel pepys was no saint  we might best define him perhaps by saying that if ever any man was his own boswell that man was samuel pepys  he had bozzys delightful appreciation of life writing in cypher he had bozzys shamelessness and more and he was his own hero  it is for these qualities and achievements that he received a monument honoured in st olaves his favourite church  in st olaves on december 23 1660 samuel went to pray and had his pew all covered with rosemary and baize  thence he went home and with much ado made haste to spit a turkey  here in st olaves he listened to a dull sermon from a stranger  here when a scot preached pepys slept all the sermon as a man who could never be reconciled to the voice of the scot  what an unworthy prejudice  often he writes after a dull sermon of the scotchman home or to church again and there a simple coxcombe preached worse than the scot  frequently have the sacred walls of st olaves where his effigy may be seen echoed to the honest snoring of the clerk of the navy  there pepys lies now his body having been brought in a very honourable and solemn manner from clapham where according to that respected sheet the postboy he expired on may 26 1703  no stone marked the spot when mr mynors brights delightful edition of pepys was published in 1875  now pepys is honoured in that church where he sleeps even sounder than in days when the scot preached worse than usual  but he is rewarded in deathnot it may be feared for his real services to england but because he has amused us all so much  a dead humorist may be better than a living official however honest industrious and careful  in all these higher things pepys was not found wanting  the son of a tailor in the city he yet had connections of good family who were of service to him when he entered public life  samuel pepys was born in 1632  he was educated at magdalene cambridge where he was once common roomed for being scandalously overserved with liquor  through life he retained a friendly admiration of magdalene strong ale  he married a girl of fifteen when he was but twentytwo he entered the service of the state shortly afterwards  he was the chief secretary for naval affairs during many years he defended his department at the bar of the house of commons after de ruyters attack in 1668 and he remained true to the stuart dynasty in heart after james was driven abroad  yet though his contemporary biographer calls pepys the greatest and most useful public servant that ever filled the same situations in england pepys would not now be honoured if he had not kept the most amusing diary in the world samuel was a highly conscientious truly pious man constant in all religious exercises though he did slumber when the scot wagged his pow in a pulpit  at the same time samuel lived in a very fast age an age when pleasure was a business and old rowley the king led the brawls he was young when society was most scandalously diverting  he had a pretty wife poor wretch of whom he stood in some awe and yet this inconsistent naval secretary liked to flit from flower to flower  he was vain greedy wanton fond of the delight of the eye and the pride of life he was loving and loose in his manners he was pious repentant profligate and he deliberately told the whole tale of all his many changes of mood and mistress of piety and pleasure  one cannot open pepys at random without finding him at his delightful old games  on the lords day he goes to church with mr creed and hears a good sermon from the redfaced parson  he came home read divinity dined and he says played the fool and won a quart of sack from mr creed  then to supper at the banquet house and there mr pepys and his wife fell to quarrelling over the beauty of mrs pierce she against and i for says superfluous pepys  no one is in the least likely to suspect that mrs pepys was angry with her lord because he did not think mrs pierce a beauty  how living the whole story is  one can smell the flowers of that sunday in may and the roast beef  the sack seems but newly drawn the red cheeks of mrs pierce as fresh as ever  the flowers grow over them now or the church floor covers them the sack is drunk the roast beef is eaten the quarrel is over the beauty and the redfaced parson the husband and wife they are all with tullus and ancus  pulvis et umbrathat is the moral of pepyss diary  life yet lives so strong in the cyphered pages all the colour all the mirth all the little troubles and sins and vows they are so real they might be of yesterday or today but the end of them came nigh two hundred years ago therefore to read pepys is to enjoy our own brief innings better as men who know that our march is passing where pepys may has flown before and that we shall soon be with him and his wife and the scot and the red faced parson  so fleeting is life whose record outlives it for ever so brief so swift so faint the joys and sorrows and all that we make marvel of in our own fortunes and those of other men  reading pepys is thus like reading montaigne whose cheery scepticism his revelations recall  but pepys has all the advantage of the man living in the busiest world over the recluse in that famed library with the mottoes on the wall  montaigne wrote in a retired and contemplative home viewing life as osman digna has viewed strife from afar almost safe from the shots of fortune  but pepys writes day by day like a war correspondent in the thick of the battle his head full of business as he declares his heart full of many desires many covetings much pride in matters that look small enough  he notes how by chewing tobacco mr chetwynde who was consumptive became very fat  he remarks how a board fell and the dust powdered the ladies heads at the play which made good sport  he records every venisonpasty every flagon of wine every pretty wench whom he encountered in his march through his youth towards the vault in st olaves  he is vexed with mrs pepys and troubled by my aunts base ugly humours  he is full of repentance like the bad man in the ethics and thinks how much he is addicted to expense and pleasure so that now i can hardly reclaim myself  he interests himself in dr williamss remarkable dog which not only killed cats but buried them with punctilious obsequies never leaving the tip of pusss tail out of the ground  then he goes to the play after swearing to my wife that i would never go to the play without her  he remembers one night that he passed with the greatest epicurism of sleep because he was often disturbed and so got out of sleeping more conscious enjoyment  now he sleeps what socrates calls the sweetest slumber of all if it be but dreamless or somewhere he enjoys all new experience with the lusty appetite of old    involuntary bailees   lord tennyson is probably the most extensive involuntary bailee at present living  the term involuntary bailee may or may not be a correct piece of legal terminology at all events it sounds very imposing and can be easily explained  an involuntary bailee is a person to whom people generally unknown to him send things which he does not wish to receive but which they are anxious to have returned  most of us in our humble way are or have been involuntary bailees  when some one you meet at dinner recommends to your notice a book generally of verse and kindly insists on sending it to you next day by post as a loan you are an involuntary bailee  you have the wretched book in your possession no inducement would make you read it and to pack it up and send it back again requires a piece of string energy brown paper and stamps enough to defray the postage  now surely no casual acquaintance or neighbour for an hour at a dinnerparty has any right thus to make demands on a mans energy money time brown paper string and other capital and commodities  if the book be sent as a present the crime is less black though still very culpable  you need take no notice of the present whereby you probably offend the author for life and thus get rid of him anyhow commonly he is a minor poet and sends you his tragedy on john huss or he is a writer on mythological subjects and is anxious to weary you with a theory that jack the giant killer was julius caesar  at the worst you can toss his gift into the wastepaper basket or sell it for fourpence threefarthings or set it on your bookshelf so as to keep the damp away from books of which you are not the involuntary bailee but the unhappy purchaser  the case becomes truly black as we have said when the uncalledfor tribute has to be returned  then it is sure to be lost when the lender writes to say he wishes to recover it  in future he will go about telling people that the recipient stole his best ideas from the manuscript if it was a manuscript which he pretends to have lost  lord tennyson has suffered from all these troubles to an extent which the average bailee can only fancy by looking with his minds eye through patent double million magnifiers  a man so eminent as the laureate is the butt of all the miserable minor poets all the enthusiastic school girls all the autographhunters all the beggingletter writers all the ambitious young tragedians and all the utterly unheardof and imaginary relations in kamschatka or vancouvers island with whom the wide world teems  lord tennyson has endured these people for some fifty years and now he takes a decided line  he will not answer their letters nor return their manuscripts  lord tennyson is perfectly right to assume this attitude only it makes life even more hideous than of old to mr browning and mr swinburne probably these distinguished writers are already sufficiently pestered by the mr tootses of this world whose chief amusement is to address epistles to persons of distinction  mr toots was believed to answer his own letters himself but the beings who fill lord tennysons and mr gladstones and probably mr brownings letterbox expect to receive answers  frightened away from lord tennysons baronial portals they will now crowd thicker than ever round the gates of other poets who have not yet announced that they will prove irresponsive  cannot the company of authors if that be the correct style and title take this matter up and succour the profession  next of course to the baneful publisher and the hopelessly indifferent public most authors suffer more from no one than from the unknown correspondent  the unknown correspondent is very frequently of the fair sex and her bright home is not unusually in the setting sun  dear mr brown she writes to some poor author who never heard of her nor of idaho in the states where she lives i cannot tell you how much i admire your monograph on phonetic decay in its influence on logic  please send me two copies with autograph inscriptions  i hope to see you at home when i visit europe in the fall  every man of letters however humble is accustomed to these salutations and probably lord tennyson receives scores every morning at breakfast like all distinguished poets like scott certainly we presume that he is annoyed with huge parcels of mss  these unless lord tennyson is more fortunate than other singers he is asked to read correct and return with a carefully considered opinion as to the senders chance of having assur banipal a tragedy accepted at the gaiety theatre  rival but unheardof bards will entreat him to use his influence to get their verses published  others all the world knows will send him spiteful letters assuring him that his fame in song has done them much wrong how interesting it would be to ascertain the name of the author of that immortal spiteful letter  probably many persons have felt that they could make a good guess no less probably they have been mistaken  in no way can the recipient avoid making enemies of the authors of all these communications if he is at all an honest irascible man  mr dickens used to reply to total strangers and to poets like miss ada menken with a dignified and sympathetic politeness which disarmed wrath but he probably thereby did but invite fresh trouble of the same kind mr thackeray if a recentlypublished answer was a fair specimen used to answer more briefly and brusquely  one thing is certain  no criticism not entirety laudatory which the involuntary bailee may make of his correspondents ms will be accepted without remonstrance doubtless lord tennyson has at last chosen the only path of safety by declining to answer his unknown correspondents or to return their rubbish any more  of course it is a wholly different affair when the anonymous correspondent sends several brace of grouse or a salmon of noble proportions or rare old books bound by derome or a service of worcester china with the square mark or other tribute of that kind  probably some dozen of rhymers sent lord tennyson amateur congratulatory odes when he was raised to the peerage  if he is at all like other poets he would have preferred a few dozen of extremely curious old port or a villon published by galiot du pre or a gold nugget or some of the produce of the diamond mines to any number of signed congratulations from total strangers  actors seem to receive nicer tributes than poets  two brace of grouse were thrown on the stage when mr irving was acting in a northern town  this is as picturesque as and a great deal more permanently enjoyable than a shower of flowers and wreaths  another day a lady threw a gold cross on the stage and yet another enthusiast contributed rare books appropriately bound  these gifts will not of course be returned by a celebrity who respects himself but they bless him who gives and him who takes much more than tons of manuscript poetry and thousands of entreaties for an autograph and millions of announcements that the writer will be proud to drink your honours noble health    summer nights   if the best of all ways of lengthening our days be to take a few hours from the night many of us are involuntarily prolonging existence at the present hour  macbeth did not murder sleep more effectually than the hot weather does  at best in the sultry nights most people sleep what is called a dogs sleep and by no means the sleep of a lucky dog  as the old english writers say taking a distinction which our language appears to have lost we rather slumber than sleep waking often and full of the foolishest of dreams  this condition of things probably affects politics and society more than the thoughtless suppose  if literature produced in the warm airless fog of july be dull who can marvel thereat  of all gods says pausanias sleep is dearest to the muses and when the child of the muses does not get his regular nine hours rest which he fails to do in warm weather then his verse and prose are certain to bear traces of his languor  it is true that all children of the muses do not require about double the allowance of the saints  five hours was all st jerome took and probably byron did not sleep much more during the season when he wrote childe harold  the moderns who agree with the locrians in erecting altars to sleep can only reply that probably childe harold would have been a better poem if byron had kept more regular hours when he was composing it  so far they will perhaps have mr swinburne with them though that author also has sung before sunrise when he would if the wisdom of the ancients be correct have been better employed in plucking the flower of sleep  leaving literature and looking at society it is certain that the human temper is more lively and more unkind things are said in a sultry than in a temperate season  in the restless nightwatches people have time to brood over small wrongs and wax indignant over tiny slights and unoffered invitations  perhaps politics too are apt to be more rancorous in a heated term  man is very much what his liver makes him  hot weather vexes the unrested soul in nothing more than this that like a revolution in paris it tempts the people to go down into the streets  the streets are cooler at least than stuffy gaslit rooms and if the public would only roam them in a contemplative spirit with eyes turned up to the peaceful constellations the public might fall down an area now and then but would not much disturb the neighbourhood  but the arry that walketh by night thinks of nothing less than admiring with kant the starry heavens and the moral nature of man  he seeks his peers and together in great bands they loiter or run stopping to chaff each other and to jeer at the passerby  their satire is monotonous in character chiefly consisting of the words for using which the famous mr budd beat the baker 152  now the sultry weather makes it absolutely necessary to leave bedroom windows wide open so that he who is courting sleep has all the advantage of studying the dialogue of the slums  these disturbances last till two in the morning in some otherwise quiet districts near the river  when battersea arry has been on the fly in chelsea while chelsea arry has been pursuing pleasure in battersea the homewardfaring bands meet about one in the morning on the embankment then does cheyne walk hear the amoebean dialogues of strayed revellers and knows not whether battersea or chelsea best deserves the pipe the short black pipe for which the rival swains compete in profanity and slang  in music too does this modern dionysiac procession rejoice and kensington echoes like cithaeron when pan was keeping his orgies therepan and the theban nymphs  the music and the song of the london street roamer is excessively harsh crabbed and tuneless  almost as provoking it is in a quiet way when three or four quite harmless people meet under a bedroom window and converse in their usual tone of voice about their private affairs  these little gatherings sometimes seem as if they would never break up and though the persons in the piece mean no harm they are nearly as noxious to sleep as the loud musical waterside rough or publichouse loafer  dogs too like men seem to feel it incumbent on them to howl more than usual in hot weather and to bay the moon with particular earnestness in july  no enemy of sleep is deadlier than a dear good affectionate dog whose owners next door have accidentally shut him out the whole night long he bewails his loneliness in accents charged with profound melancholy  the author of the amusement philosophique would have us believe that animals can speak  nothing makes more for his opinion than the exquisite variety of lyrical howl in which a shutout dog expresses every phrase of blighted affection incommunicable longing and supreme despair  somehow he never literally never wakens his owners  he only keeps all the other people in a fourmile radius wide awake  yet how few have the energy and public spirit to get up and go for that dog with sticks umbrellas and pieces of roadmetal  the most enterprising do little more than shout at him out of the window or take long futile shots at him with bits of coal from the fireplace  when we have a municipal government of london then perhaps measures will be taken with dogs and justice will be meted out to the owners of fowls  at present these fiends in human shape can keep their detestable pets and defy the menaces as they have rejected the prayers of their neighbours the amount of profanity insanity illhealth and general misery which one rooster can cause is far beyond calculation  when london nights are intolerable people think with longing of the cool fragrant country of the jasminemuffled lattices and the groups beneath the dreaming evening star  one dreams of coffee after dinner in the open air as described in in memoriam one longs for the cool the hush the quiet  but try the country on a july night  first you have trouble with all the great big hairy leathery moths and bats which fly in at the jasminemuffled lattice and endeavour to put out your candle you blow the candle out and then a bluebottle fly in good voice comes out too and is accompanied by very fair imitations of mosquitoes probably they are only gnats but in blowing their terrible little trumpets they are of the mosquito kind  next the fact dawns on you that the church clock in the neighbouring spire strikes the quarters and you know that you cannot fall asleep before the chime wakes you up again with its warning another quarter gone  the cocks come forth and crow about four the hens proclaim to a drowsy world that they have fulfilled the duties of maternity  all through the ambrosial night three cows in the meadow under your windows have been lamenting the loss of their calves  of all terrible notes the routing of a bereaved or amorous or homesick cow is the most disturbing  it carries for miles and keeps all who hear itall townbred folk at leastfar from the land of nod at dawn the songbirds begin and hold you awake as they disturbed rufinus long ago but the odds are that they do not inspire you like rufinus with the desire to write poetry  the short and simple language of profanity is more likely to come unbidden to the wakeful lips  thus as john leech found out the country in july is almost as dreadful at night as the town  nay thanks to the cow we think the country may bear away the prize for all that is uncomfortable all that is hostile to sleep and the muses  yet rustics always sleep very well and no more mind the noise of cocks sparrows cows dogs and ducks than the owner of a townbred dog minds when his faithful hound drives a whole street beyond their patience  it is a matter of sound health and untaxed brains  if we always gave our minds a rest none of us would dread the noises of the nights of summer    on hypochondriacs   a nice state we are in according to the medical times  if the secrets of our casebooksthat is we suppose our medical dossiers doctors records of the condition of their patientscould be revealed it would be shown that many clever people have a fancy skeleton in their cupboards  by a fancy skeleton we mean not some dismal secret of crime or shame but a melancholy and apprehensiveness without any ground in outward facts  with the real skeleton doctors have nothing to do  he rather belongs to the province of scotland yard  if a man has compromised himself in some way if he has been found out by some scoundrel if he is compelled to sing as the french say or to pay blackmail then the doctor is not concerned in the business  a detective a revolver or a wellplanned secret flight may be prescribed to the victim  other real skeletons men possess which do not come of their own misdeeds  one of their friends or one of their family may be the skeleton or the consciousness of coming and veritable misfortune pecuniary or whatnot  but the medical times which no doubt ought to know refers purely to cases of vague melancholy and hypochondriac foreboding  apparently the spleen the english disease is as bad now as when green wrote in verse and dr cheyne in prose  prosperous business men literary gents in active employment artists students tradesmen are all visited by melancholy revealed only to their doctors and sometimes to their domestic circle  unhappy domestic circle brooded over by a gloomy parent who thinks that life is too short or faith too much a matter of speculation or that the country is going to the dogs  then the doctor it seems hears his patient and recommends him only to drink a very little whisky and potash water or to take two bottles of port every day or to take to angling or to give up smoking or to work less or to work more or to go to bed early or to get up late or to ride or to fence or to play golf or to go to upper egypt or the engadine or anything that fancy may dictate and opportunity suggest  so the kind physician advises his mournful self tormentor and then he himself flies round the corner and consults some brotherhealer about his own subjective gloom  old ladies in speaking of the misdeeds of youth are apt to recommend a good shaking as a panacea  really those victims of whom our contemporary speaks appear to be persons on whom a good shaking mental or physical would produce a salutary effect  cowardice vanity overweening selfconsciousness are the causes of most melancholy  no doubt it has physical causes too  dr johnson sufferedone of the best and bravest of men  but most of us sufferif suffer we dobecause we overestimate ourselves and our own importance  mr matthew arnold has tried to enforce this lesson  after a horrible murder in a railway carriage mr arnold observed with pain the almost bloodthirsty clinging to life of his fellowpassengers  in vain he pointed out to them that even if they were to depart the great mundane movement would go on as usual  but they refused to be comforted  every man was afraid of meeting his own muller and as to the great mundane movement no one cared a pin  this selfishness is among the chief causes of melancholy  a man persuades himself that he will not live long or that his prospects in this world or the next are gloomy or he takes views as absurdly far reaching as those of the spinsters in the old tale who wept over the hypothetical fate of the child one of them might have had if she had been married  now there is a certain melancholy not unbecoming a man indeed to be without it is hardly to be human  here we do find ourselves indeed like the shipwrecked mariner on the isle of pascals apologue all around us are the unknown seas all about us are the indomitable and eternal processes of generation and corruption  we come like water and like wind we go  life is indeed as the great persian says     a moments halt a momentary taste    of being from the well beside the waste  these just causes of melancholy and of awe have presented themselves to all reflective men at all times  they deeply affect the thought so wholesome and so human of homer  they express themselves in that old english pagans allegory of the bird that flies from the dark into the warm and lighted hall and from the hall into the dark again  not to be capable of these reflections is to be incapable of tasting the noblest poetry  such thoughts actually give zest to our days and sharpen our enjoyment of that which we have only a brief moment to enjoy  such thoughts add their own sweetness and sadness to the song of the nightingale to the fall of the leaves to the coming of the spring  were we exempt from eld and age this noble melancholy could never be ours and we like the ancient classical gods would be incapable of tears what prometheus says in mr bridges poem is true              not in heaven    among our easy gods hath facile time    a touch so keen to wake such love of life    as stirs the frail and careful being of man  such are the benefits of melancholy when she is only an occasional guest and is not pampered or made the object of devotion  but melancholy though an excellent companion for an hour is the most exacting and depressing of mistresses  the man who gives himself up to her who always takes too long views who broods on the future of this planet when the sun has burned out is on the highway to madness  the odds are that he does not travel all the way  he remains a selftormented wretch highly profitable to his medical man and a frightful nuisance to his family  now there are of course cases in which this melancholy has physical causes  it may come of indigestion and then the remedy is known  less dining out indeed no one will ask the abjectly melancholy man out and more exercise may be recommended the melancholy man had better take to angling it is a contemplative pastime but he will find it far from a gloomy one  the sounds and sights of nature will revive and relieve him and if he is only successful the weight of a few pounds of fish on his back will make him toss off that burden which poor christian carried out of the city of destruction  no man can be melancholy when the south wind blows in spring when the soft feathery marchbrowns flit from the alders and fall in the water while the surface boils with the heads and tails of trout  perhaps on the other hand the melancholy one lives too much in the country  then let him go to paris or vienna let him try the palais royal and spend a good deal of money in the shops  a course of this might have cured even obermann whom there was nothing to check or divert while he kept philandering on the mountains with the snows and his woes there are plenty of such cures for a melancholy not yet incurable change of air scene food amusement and occupation being the best  true the romans tried this as seneca and lucretius tells us and found themselves as much bored as ever  no easier nor no quicker passed th impracticable hours  but the romans were very extreme cases  when the cause of melancholy is religious or moral there is little to be done with the victim  in sartor resartus he will read how mr carlyle cured himself if ever he was cured  to be brief he said what then who cares and indeed in more reverent form of expression it is all that can be said  when nicias addressed the doomed and wasted remnant of the athenian expedition to syracuse he told them that others too being men had borne things which had to be endured  that is the whole philosophy of the matter    thackerays london   a house in a highly respectable square where jeames yellowplush was in service had recently the fame of being haunted  no one knew exactly what haunted this desirable mansion or how though a novelist was understood to have supplied a satisfactory legend  the young man who investigated the ghost rang the bell thrice violently and then fell down dead nor could he in any wise satisfy the curiosity of his friends that fable is exploded  it was what is called an aetiological myth by the learned it was merely a story devised to account for the fact that the house was not occupied  the imagination of man confronted by so strange a problem as money running to waste took refuge in the supernatural  much more truly haunted than the house in buckley square are the streets of london which are tenanted by the ghosts that genius created  these having never been born can never die and still we may meet them in the roads and squares where they lived and took their pastime  mr rideing an american author has published with messrs jarvis and son a little volume called thackerays london an account of the places which that great novelist made household words and filled with genial spectres that time can never lay  mr rideings little book does not strike us as being quite complete  surely thackeray especially in the ballads mentions many places not alluded to by the new topographer  besides mr rideing says that thackerays readers forget the localities in which his characters appear  surely this is a calumny on human memory  who but thinks of becky sharp as he trudges down curzon street  has bryanston square properly any reason for existence except that the hobson newcomes dwelt there  are the chambers of captain costigan forgotten by the memory of any man or those of pen and george warrington  but pen took better rooms not so lofty when he scored that success with walter lorraine  where did mr bowes the hopeless admirer of the fotheringay dwell  every one should know but that question might puzzle some  or where was the lair of the mulligan  like the grave of arthur or of moliere it is unknown the whole of the postal district known as w is haunted by that tremendous shade  i live there says he pointing down towards uxbridge with the big stick he carries so his abode is in that direction at any rate  no more has been given to man to know  many minor reminiscences occur to the mind  in pump court we encounter the brisk little spectre of mr frederick minchin and who can forget that his club was the oxford and cambridge than which what better could he desire  mr thackeray himself was a member of the garrick the athenaeum and the reform but the clubs of many of his characters like the buth of jeames yellowplush are wrapped up in a mistry  they are alluded to by fancy names but the scholiast on thackeray will probably be able to identify them  is it not time by the way for that scholiast to give his labours to the public  thackerays world is passing the children he knew the boys he tipped and took to the play are middle aged menfogies in fact  tempus edax rerum time has an appetite as good as that of a boy at his first club dinner  the meaning of the great writers contemporary allusions may be lost like those of villon and aristophanes  such is the fate of comedy  who knows if we turn to dickens what the common profeel machine was or what were the steps of the dance known as the fanteag the spelling is dubious or what the author meant by a redfaced nixon  was it a nixie  does the new professor of the english language and literature at oxford hope to cast the light of teutonic research on these and similar inquiries  sam weller found that oysters always went handinhand with poverty  how this must astonish a generation which finds the oyster nearly as extinct as the ichthyosaurus  the book of snobs calls aloud for a commentator who is the nobleman holding his boots out of the hotel windowan act which the snob very properly declined to classify as snobbish  who are the originals of henry foker this indeed is known and of wagg and wenham  or did wenhams real name rhyme to foker as according to the mulligan perkins rhymes to jerkins my man of firkins  posterity will insist on an answer which will be nothing if not authentic  posterity pace mr rideing will remember very well that george osbornes father lived in russell square and will hunt in vain for 96  there is no such number any more than there ever was such a pope as he to whom the unfortunate old woman in candid attributed her birth  here once more as voltaire justly remarks in a footnote we observe the discretion of our author  colonel newcome lived as is well known in fitzroy square and died in the charter house  to these shrines the pious go in pilgrimage the rather dingy quarters are brightened by the memory of his presence as we think of scott in castle street edinburgh or of dr john brown in princes streetdr john brown who was a colonel newcome that had gone into medicine instead of the army  smithfield is hardly more memorable for her martyrs than for the battles fought on neighbouring ground between biggs and berry between cuff and old figs  kentish town but little sought for sentimental reasons is glorified by the memory of adolphus larkins islington pentonville somers town were the scenes of many of his exploits  brompton again passionate brompton lent her shelteror rather sold it for the poetess lived in a boardinghouseto miss bunnion  cursitor street might be unknown as the great men before agamemnon many of whom by the way as meleager and pirithous are known well enough had not cursitor street contained the sponginghouse where rawdon crawley was incarcerated  in addition to these scholia on thackeray so sadly needed and so little likely to be published we need novelists maps and topographies of london and paris  these will probably be constructed by some american of leisure they order these things better in america  when we go to paris we want to know where balzacs men and women lived z marcas and cesar birotteau and le cousin pons and le pere goriot and all the duchesses financiers scoundrels journalists and persons of both sexes and no character comedie humaine  london also might be thus spaced outthe london of richardson and fielding and miss burney as well as the london of thackeray or dickens  already to speak of today rupert street is more interesting because there fallen in fortune but resolute of heart and courtly as ever prince florizel of bohemia held his cigar divan    torrid summer   is it very cold asks the prince of denmark according to a familiar reading  no one has any occasion to consult the thermometer before answering the question is it very hot  all things combine to prove that it is very hot  even the man of metal who used according to legend to patrol the coast of crete the man with only one vein from head to heel would admit could he appear in the machineries at present that it is very hot indeed  he might not feel any subjective sensation of heat for he seems to have been a mythical anticipation of the conquering machine which is to dominate the world but he would have inferred the height of the temperature from a number of phenomena  he would have seen the ticketclerks in the railway stations with their coats off  he would have observed imitation japanese parasols at a penny among the ware of enterprising capitalists in the streets  he would have marked the very streetboys in wide inexpensive straw hats of various and astonishing colours  woman he would have found in beautiful shades of blue in such light garments woven wind as theocritus speaks of when he presents the wife of his doctor with a new ivory distaff  as to men they in their attire do show their wit or their want of courage as the case may be  it is not easy for modern man when he repairs to the metropolis to dress up to the heat of the weather  an ingenious though too hasty philosopher once observed that all men who wear velvet coats are atheists  he probably overstated the amount of intellectual and spiritual audacity to be expected from him who setting the picturesque before the conventional dons a coat of velvet  but it really does require some originality even to wear a white hat and a white waistcoat in a london july  the heat is never so great but that the majority of males endure black coats and black shiny hats  the others are in a minority  the voice of public opinion is not on their side who stole the moke anna asked suspicion and the answer came the man in the chapeau blanc  there is something daring something distinctive in a white hat and it may be doubted whether the amount of comfort obtained by the revolutionary wearer is in a due ratio to the conspicuousness which his action entails on him  members of parliament are singularly emancipated from these fears of the brave but members of parliament cannot supply the whole contingent of whitehatted men now to be seen in the streets of the metropolis  their presence proves that it is very hot indeed  one swallow does not make a summer but half a dozen pairs of ducks beheld in public places would mark a summer of unusually high temperature  there are of course alleviations  nature compensates all who can afford to purchase the compensations  strawberries long waited for shy retiring fruit have now nearly approached the popular price of sixpence a basket  a divine of a past generation declared that in his opinion the joys of paradise would consist of eating strawberries to the sound of a trumpet  for a poor sixpence half of this transcendental pastime may be partaken of and probably the brass band which is usually round the corner could supply the sound of the trumpet at a small extra charge  unluckily doctors have decided that many of us must not eat strawberries nor drink champagne cup nor iced coffee  that is the way with doctors  aesculapius was originally worshipped in the form of a serpent in the guise of a serpent he came to rome  medical men still hold of their heroic father and physicians are the serpents in the paradise of a warm summer  mortals in their hands are like sancho panza with his medical adviser  here is summer provoking a gentle interest in every method of assuaging thirst and almost every method is condemned by one member of the faculty or another  champagne cannot be so royally sound nor is shandygaff so humble that it scapes whipping how melancholy a thing is human life at best  in boyhood we can eat more ices than our pocketmoney enables us to purchase in maturity we have the pocketmoney without the powers of digestion  the french lady said that if strawberry ices were only sinful no pleasure could exceed that which is to be enjoyed in the consumption of the congealed fruit strawberry ices are sinful now and under the medical ban  the french lady were she living still might be at ease on that score  but her audacity is not given to all and many fall back on that poor creature lemonsquash when they are conscious of a thirst worthy of being quenched by the most imperial beverages in imperial quarts  men being reasonable must hurry about town when the thermometer is at something fabulous wearing black clothes going to parties and larding the lean earth  beasts are not so foolish  to the pious brahmin vishnu accords the power of becoming what animal he pleases with a break in the lease so to speak when circumstances alter  had a sage this power at this moment he would become a cow standing up to her middle in the clear cool water of the kennet under the shade of a hanging willow tree  what bliss can equal that of a cow thus engaged  her life must indeed be burning with a hard gemlike flame  she must be plucking the flower of a series of exquisite moments  the rich deep grass with the buttercups and forgetmenots is behind her but she has had enough of that and is open to more spiritual pleasures  the kingfishers and water wagtails flit about her  the waterrat jumps into the stream with a soft plash and his black body scuttles along to the opposite bank  the green dragonflies float hither and thither the beautiful frailwinged water flies float over trout too lazy to snatch at them  the cow in her sensuous nirvana may see and marvel at the warm boatingman as he tows two stout young ladies in a heavy boat or labours with the oar  her pleasure is far more enduring than that of the bathers in the lasher up stream and she has an enormous advantage over the contemplative man trying to lie on the grass and enjoy nature for he really is not enjoying nature  the pleasures of lying on the grass are chiefly those of imagination  you cannot get into a truly comfortable position  your back has a lump of grass under it here or your arm tingles and falls asleep as children say  no attitude will enable you to read and the black flies hover around and alight on such of your features as are temptingto a fly  then you begin to be quite sure it is damp and as you have nothing else to sit on you sit down on your book which no one can call comfortable  the notion of reclining on cushions in a punt is equally fallacious and while promising much ends in a headache  besides the river does not always smell very nicely now that it has so long been unrelieved by rain all through the hot day in fact civilized northern man finds loafing very difficult especially as his aryan impetuosity is always urging him to do something active  cows in this climate are the only true lotus eaters  next to them in enjoyment comes the angler who approaches the river about eight oclock at the time of the evening rise  he like the cow is kneedeep in water wading he listens to the plash of big hungry trout sucking down gnats under the alders he casts over them and if he catches them who more content than he as the sky turns from amber to purple and silvery grey and the light fades till one cannot thread the gut through the eyehole of one of the newfashioned hooks certainly this man is more blessed than he who is just coming to the ices at a big hot london dinner and knows that his physician has forbidden him this form of enjoyment  what a struggle in that persons mind and how almost predestined is his fall how sure his repentance next morning    western drolls   the death of mr josh billings may have diminished the stock of harmless pleasures but can hardly be said to have eclipsed the gaiety of nations  in this country at least however it may have been in the states josh billings was by no means the favourite or leading american humorist  if phonetic spelling were universal much of his fun would disappear  his place was nearer that of orpheus c kerr than of artemus ward or of mark twain  it has long been the english habit to look for most of our broad fun across the atlantic  americans say we are not a funny people  a chivalrous and mediaeval french writer not unfrequently quoted once made a kindred remark  we are not at present a boisterously comic lot of geniuses and if you see the tears running down the eyes of a fellowcountryman reading in a railway carriage if he be writhing with mirth too powerful for expression the odds are that he has got hold of a yankee book  in american country newspapers there is usually one column entirely devoted to facetiae which appear to have been clipped out of the columns of other country papers  they live on each other just as the natives of the scilly islands are feigned to eke out a precarious livelihood by taking in each others washing  it is averred that one american journal the danbury newsman contains nothing but merrimenta fearful idea  we have nothing like this at home and as for writers who make a reader giggle almost indelicately often where are they to be found  happy thoughts affect some of us in this way others are convulsed by vice versa but as george eliot says nothing is such a strain on the affections as a difference of taste in jokes  it is unsafe to recommend any writer as very funny  no man can ever tell how his neighbour will take a joke  but it may safely be said that authors who really tickle their students are extremely rare in england except as writers for the stage and surely the great pink pearl might have made timon of athens shake his sides or might convert a veddah to the belief that there is something to laugh at  in literature when we want to be even hysterically diverted we must as a rule buy our fun from the american humorists  if we cannot make laughter ourselves at least we can and do laugh with them  a vast amount of american humour may be called local and middleclass  in the youth of dickens there was a regular set of homemade middleclass jokes about babies about washingday about mothersinlaw about dinner parties that were not successes about curtain lectures about feminine extravagance in bonnetbuying about drunken men about beer all of them jokes worn threadbare  a similar kind of fun with local differences prevails in the states but is wonderfully mixed up with scriptural and religious jokes  to us sober britons whatever our opinions these latter japes appear more or less ribald though they are quite innocently made  aristophanes a pious conservative was always laughing consumedly at the greek gods and the greek gods were supposed to be in the joke  the theatrical season was sacred to the deity of wine and fun and he with the other olympians was not scandalized by the merriment  in the ages of faith it is also notorious that saints and even more sacred persons were habitually buffooned in the mystery plays and the church saw no harm  the old leaven of american puritanism has the same kind of familiarity with ideas and words which we approach more delicately conscious that the place where we tread is holy ground  this consciousness appears to be less present in the states which are peopled by descendants of the puritans and scores of good things are told in family american journals and magazines which are received without a grin in this country  we are not amused a great person is reported to have once observed when some wit had ventured on a hazardous anecdote and we meaning the people of england are often not amused but rather vexed by gaieties which appear absolutely harmless on the other side of the ocean  these two kinds of humour the middleclass jokes about courting between lovers seated on a snake fence or about sunday schools and quaint answers there given to biblical questions leave us cold  but surely we appreciate as well as the americans themselves the extraordinarily intellectual high spirits of mark twain a writer whose genius goes on mellowing ripening widening and improving at an age when another man would have written himself out  his gravity in narrating the most preposterous tale his sympathy with every one of his absurdest characters his microscopic imagination his vein of seriousness his contrasts of pathos his bursts of indignant plain speaking about certain national errors make mark twain an author of the highest merit and far remote from the mere buffoon  say the jumping frog is buffoonery perhaps it is but louis quinze could not have classed the author among the people he did not love les buffons qui ne me font rire  the man is not to be envied who does not laugh over the ride on the genuine mexican plug till he is almost as sore as the equestrian after that adventure  again while studying the narrative of how mark edited an agricultural paper in a country district a person with any sense of humour is scarcely a responsible being  he is quite unfit so doth he revel in laughter uncontrollable for the society of staid people and he ought to be ejected from club libraries where his shouts waken the baldheaded sleepers of these retreats  it is one example of what we have tried to urge that marks way is not nearly so acceptable in the innocents abroad especially when the innocents get to the holy land  we think it in bad taste for example to snigger over the siege of samaria and the discomfiture of shoddy speculators in curious articles of food during that great leaguer  recently mark twain has shown in his mississippi sketches in tom sawyer and in hucklebury finn that he can paint a landscape that he can describe life that he can tell a story as well as the very best and all without losing the gift of laughter  his travelbooks are his least excellent he is happiest at home in the country of his own blue jay  the contrasts the energy the mixture of races in america the overflowing young life of the continent doubtless give its humorists the richness of its vein  all over the land men are eternally swopping stories at bars and in the long endless journeys by railway and steamer  how little comparatively the english swop stories  the scotch are almost as much addicted as the americans to this form of barter so are the irish  the englishman has usually a dignified dread of dropping into his anecdotage  the stories thus collected in america are the subsoil of american literary humour a rich soil in which the plant cultivated by mark twain and mr frank stockton grows with vigour and puts forth fruit and flowers  mr stockton is very unlike mark twain he is quiet domesticated the jester of the family circle  yet he has shown in rudder grange and in the transferred ghost very great powers and a pleasant dry kind of amontillado flavour in his fun which somewhat reminds one of thackeraythe thackeray of the bedfordrow conspiracy and of a little dinner at timmins  mr stocktons vein is a little too connubiala little too rich in the humours and experiences of young married people  but his fun is rarely strained or artificial except in the later chapters of rudder grange and he has a certain kindliness and tenderness not to be always met with in the jester  his angling and hunting pieces are excellent and so are those of mr charles dudley warner  this humorist like alceste was once funnier than he had supposed when he sat down with a certain classical author to study the topography of epipolae  but his talent is his own and very agreeable though he once so forgot himself as to jest on the deceased wifes sister  when we think of those writers to whom we all owe so much it would be sheer ingratitude to omit the name of the master of them all oliver wendell holmes  here is a wit who is a scholar and almost a poet and whose humour is none the less precious for being accompanied by good humour learning a wide experience of the world  with mr lowell he belongs to an older generation yet reigns among the present  may the reign be long    show sunday   the years bring round very quickly the old familiar events  yesterday was show sunday  it scarcely seems a year since last the painters received their friends and perhaps a few of their enemies  these visits to studios are very exciting to ladies who have read about studios in novels and believe that they will find everywhere tawny tigerskins venetian girls chrysanthemum and hawthorn patterned porcelain suits of armour old plate swords and guns and bows and all the other properties of the painter of romance  some of these delightful things no doubt the visitors of yesterday saw and probably some painters still wear velvet coats and red neckties and long hair and pointed beards  but the typical artist is not what he was  he has become domesticated sometimes he is nearly as rich and apolaustic as a successful stock broker and much more fashionable  then he dwells in marble halls with pleasing fountains by whose falls all sorts of birds sing madrigals  he has an entirely new house in short fitted up in the early basque style or after the fashion of an incas palace or like the royal dwelling of a rajah including of course all modern improvements  this is a very desirable kind of artist to know at home but after all it is not easy to distinguish him from a highlycultivated and successful merchant prince with a taste for bricabrac  he is not in the least like the painter of romance perhaps he is betterhe is certainly more fortunate but he is not the real old thing the bohemian of ouida and miss braddon one might as well expect a banker to be a bohemian  another class of modern painter is even more disappointing  he is extremely neat and smooth in his appearance and dresses in the height of the most quiet fashion  his voice is low and soft and he never like the artist of fiction employs that english word whereby the royalist sailor was recognized when attired as a portuguee he tried to blow up one of the ships of admiral blake  this new kind of artist avoids studio slang as much as he does long hair and red waistcoats  he might be a young barrister only he is more polished or a young doctor only he is more urbane  no doubt there exist men of the ancient speciesroughand ready men as strong as bargees given to much tobacco amateurs of porter or shandygaff great hunters of the picturesque such wild folk as thackeray knew and mr charles keene occasionally caricatures  these are the artists whom young ladies want to see but they are not in great force on show sunday  they rather look on that festival as a day of national mourning and humiliation and woe  they do not care to have all belgravia or south kensington let loose in their places  they do not wish the public to gaze and simper at pieces which will probably be enskied or rejected or hung at a dangerous corner next a popular picture  no painter who is not of the most secure eminence can perhaps quite enjoy show sunday  many of his visitors know as much about art as the fuegians do of white neckties  they come and gaze and say how soft how sweet like rosey mackenzie and have tea and go away  other people offer amazing suggestions and no one who thinks the pictures failures quite manages to conceal his opinion  poets are said to be fond of reading their own poems aloud which seems amazing but then as they read they cannot see their audience nor guess how they are boring those sufferers  the poet like the domestic fowl which did not scream when plucked is too much absorbed  but while his friends look at his pictures the painter looks at their faces and must make many sad discoveries  like other artists he does not care nearly so much for the praise as he is dashed and discomfited by the slightest hint of blame  it is a wonder that irascible painters do not run amuck among their own canvases and their visitors on show sunday  that at least in mr brownings phrase is how it strikes a contemporary  were the artists to yield to the promptings of their lower nature were they to hearken to the old man within them fearful massacres would occur in st johns wood and campden hill and round holland house  an alarmed public and a powerless police would behold vast ladies of wealth and maidens fair and wild critics with eyeglasses speeding at a furious pace along certain roads pursued by painters armed to the teeth with palette knives and mahlsticks  this is what would occur if academicians and others gave way to the natural passions provoked by criticism and general demeanour on show sunday  but it is a proof of the triumph of civilization that nothing of this kind occurs  peace prevails in the street and studio and at the end of the day the artist must feel much as the critic does after the private view at the royal academy  the artist has been having a private view of the public on its good behaviour and that wild contempt of the bourgeois which burns in every artists breast must reach its highest temperature  however the holidays are beginning the working season is over and that reflection doubtless helps the weary painter through his ordeal  but his friends also have to bear a good deal if they happen not to like his performances  they must feign admiration as well as they may and the sun of show sunday goes down on a world rather glad that it is well over  lord beaconsfield once said at an academy dinner that originality was the great characteristic of english art  so little was he supposed to have spoken seriously that another of whose ceasing to perorate there is no prospect characterized his criticism in language so strong that it cannot well be repeated  let us admit that lord beaconsfield was either mistaken or that like the consul aulus he spake a bitter jest  our artists when they have found their vein go on working it  they do not wander off in search of new veins as a general rule  it would be unkind to draw attention to personal proofs of this truism  he who has done well with babies in fancy dresses will go on doing well with infants in masquerade  there are moments when the arrival of cronus to swallow the whole family of painted babes as he did his own would be not unwelcome when an artistic herod would be applauded for a general massacre of the burlington house innocents  but this may be only the jaundiced theory of a jaded critic  the mothers of england are a much more important set of judges and they like the babies  then the bishops though a little monotonous must be agreeable to their flocks while the hunting dogs and pugs and kittens and monks and venetian girlsla blonde et la bruneand the highland rivers of the colour of porter with a head on it and the mackerelhued sea and the marble and the martyrs and the mediterraneanthey are all dear to various classes of our teeming population  the critic may say he has seen them all before he knows them off by heart but then so does he know raphaels infants and botticellis madonnas and fra angelicos angel trumpeters and vecellis blue hills and robustis doges and lionardos smiling enigmatic ladies  he does not say he is tired of these but that is only his eternal affectation  he is afraid perhaps to say that the old masters bore himthat is a compliment reserved for contemporaries  let it be admitted that in all ages artists have had their grooves like other men and have reproduced themselves and their own best effects  but as this is inevitably true how careful they should be that the effects are really of permanent value and beauty  realistic hansom cabs and babies in strange raiment and schoolgirls of the last century and masters of hounds are scarcely of so much permanent value as the favourite types and characters which lionardo and carpaccio repeat again and again  we no more think claude monotonous than we think the quiet coloured end of evening flat and stale  but we may and must tire of certain modern combinations too often rehearsed after the trick has become a habit and the method an open mystery    the dry fly   as the easter vacation approaches the cockney angler the inveterate cockney as lord salisbury did or did not say begins to look to his fishing tackle  now comes in the sweet of the year and we may regret with mr swinburne that such sweet things should be fleet such fleet things sweet  there are not many days that the london troutfisher gets by the waterside  the streams worth his attention and also within his reach are few and either preserved so that he cannot approach them or harried by poachers as well as anglers  how much happier were men in waltons day who stretched their legs up tottenham hill and soon found in the lea trout which would take a worm when the rod was left to fish for itself  in those old days hackney might be called a fishing village there was in waltons later years a writer on fishing named w gilbert gent  this gent produced a small work called the anglers delight and if the angler was delighted he must have been very easily pleased the book now sells for large sums apparently because it is scarce for it is eminently worthless  the gentle writer instead of giving directions about flydressing calmly tells his readers to go and buy his flies at a little shop near powles  to the anglers delight this same w gilbert added a tract on the hackney river and the best stands there  now there are no stands there except cabstands which of course are uninteresting to the angler  two hundred years have put his fishing far away from him  however the ancient longing lives in him and the sunday morning trains from paddington are full of early fishingmen  but it cannot be that most of them are after trout the thames trout being so artful that it needs a weeks work and private information to come to terms with him hitherto he has been spun for chiefly or coaxed with live bait but now people think that a good big loch fly may win his affections  it is to be hoped that this view is correct for the attempts by spinning and with live bait are calculated to stretch and crack even the proverbial patience of anglers  persons conscious of less enduring mettle in their mind will soon be off to the moorland waters of devonshire or the border where trout are small fairly plentiful and come early into season  about the upper waters of severn where sabrina is still unvexed by pollution and where the stream is not greater than tweed at peebles sport is fair in spring  though the devonshire and border and probably the welsh waters are just in their prime the season is not yet for the itchen and the kennet with their vast overeducated and overfed monsters of the deep  though there may be respectable angling for accomplished artists thereabouts in late april and may the true sport does not begin till the mayfly comes in which he generally does in june  then the kennet is a lovely and seductive spectacle to the angler  between the turns of sun and shower the most beautiful delicate insects frail as gossamer and fair as a fairy are born and flit for their hour and float down the water soon to be swallowed by the big fourpound trout  he who has no experience of this angling and who comes to it from practice in the north at first thinks he cannot go wrong  there is the smooth clear water broken every moment by a trouts nose just gently pushed up but indicating by the size of the ripple that a monster is feeding below  you think if you are accustomed to less experienced fish that all is well  you throw your flies two or three a yard above the ripple and wait to strike but the ripples instantly cease and on the surface of the water you see the long thin track of a broad back and huge dorsal fin  the trout has been not frightenedhe is in no hurrybut disgusted by your clumsy cast which would readily have taken in a seatrout or a lochtrout  they of kennet and test know a good deal better than to approach your wet flies  a few minutes of this failure reduce the novice to the despair of tantalus  he never was set to such a torture as casting over big feeding trout and never getting a rise  you feel inclined to throw your flybook bodily at the heads of the trout and bid them take their choice of its contents  that method of angling would be quite as successful as angling for large southern trout in the northern manner  so the novice either loses his temper and walks away to take his ease and some shandy gaff at the bear or he sits down to smoke or he potters botanically among the flowering waterweeds  then a southern angler comes near and is presently playing a trout which the northern man has not put down or frightened into total abstinence for the day  then the true method of fishing for trout in a clear stream is illustrated in practice and a beautiful and most delicate art it proves to be  first the angler notices a rising fish  then he retires to a safe distance from the bank outflanks the trout and comes round in his rear as fish always feed with their heads up stream it is necessary in such clear water to fish for them from below from as far below as possible every advantage is taken of cover and the angler soon acquires the habits of a skirmisher  a tuft of rushes an inequality in the ground or an alder bush conceals him behind this he kneels and gets his tackle in order  he uses only one fly not two or three as people do on the border  he carefully measures his ground flicking his cast through the air so that the fly shall be perfectly dry  then the trout rises and in a moment the dry fly descends as lightly as a living insect half a foot above the ripple  down it floats the fisher watching with a beating heart then there is a ripple then a splash the rod bends nearly double the line flies out to the further bank and the struggle begins  the fight is by no means over for the fish instinctively makes for a bed of weeds where he can entangle and break the line while the angler holds him as hard as he dares and if tackle be sound and luck goes not contrary the big trout is landed at last  this is no trifling victory  nay a kennet trout is far harder to catch and kill than the capricious salmon which will often take a fly however clumsy be the man who casts it  there is a profane theory that several members of the hungerford club never catch the trout they pay so much to have the privilege of trying to capture  a very sure eye and clever hand are needed to make the fly light dry and neat so close above the fish that he has not time to be alarmed by the gut  gutshy he is and the less he sees of it the better  moreover a wonderful temper is required for in the backward cast of the long line the hook will ten to one catch in a tree or a flower or a straw or a bit of hay and then it has to be disengaged by the angler crawling on hands and knees  perhaps a northern angler will never quite master the delicacy of this sport nor acquire the entomological knowledge which seems to be necessary nor make up his mind between the partisans of the light onehanded rod and the doublehanded rod    amateur authors   literature knows no trades unions but if things go on as they are at present perhaps we shall hear of literary rattening and picketing  the kolnische zeitung in germany has been protesting against the mob of noble ladies who write with ease though their works even to persons acquainted with the german tongue are by no means easy reading  the teutonic paper requests these ambitious dames to conduct themselves as amateurs to write if write they must but to print only a few copies of their books and give these few copies only to their friends  this is advice as morally excellent as it will be practically futile nor does it apply only to ladies of rank but to amateur novelists in general  the old quarrel between artists and amateurs is fiercely waged in dramatic society perhaps because actors and actresses feel the stress of competing with cheap amateur labour  now though the professional novelist has only of late begun to think seriously of the subject it is plain that he too is competing with labour unnaturally cheap and is losing in the competition  to define an amateur is difficult as all athletic clubs and rowing clubs are aware  but in this particular field of human industry the amateur may be defined with ease  the amateur novelist is not merely the person who having another profession writes a romance by way of bywork as the greeks called it  lord beaconsfield was no amateur in romance and perhaps no novel was ever sold at so high a ransom as endymion  yet lord beaconsfield only scribbled in his idle hours and was not half so much an amateur novelist as mr gladstone is an amateur student of homer  no the true amateur is he or she who publishes at his or her own expense  the labour of such persons is not only cheap its rewards may be estimated by a frightful minus quantitythe publishers bill  every one must have observed that when his box of books comes from the circulating library it by no means contains the books he has asked the librarian to send  the batch does not exclusively consist of the plums and prizes of the publishing season of sir henry gordons book on his illustrious brother of the most famous novel of the month of mr romillys new guinea and the western pacificas diverting a book of travel as ever was written of mr stocktons mrs null and generally of all that is freshest and most notable in biography fiction and history  a few of the peaches of the best quality there are but the rest are fruit less valued are in fact amateur novels  there are two sets of three gaudy novels by unheardof ladies and perhaps three shilling novels with such titles as who did it  chopped in cover or under a cloud none of which names we trust are copyright  a similar phenomenon presents itself at the bookstalls which are choked with cheap and unenticing brief tales of the deadly sins  and whose fault is it that we do not get the good books and are flooded with the bad books  why it is the fault of the ambitious amateur of the ladies and gentlemen who publish at their own risk and at the cost of the world of readers and professional writers  this is with a few remarkable limitations a free country  no law exists which says to publishers thou shalt not publish on commission no law confines the vagaries of amateur romance  hence the market is choked and the circulating libraries are overwhelmed with rubbish and good books as the americans of the west say get no show  the debauched novel reader to whom every story is a story and one no better nor worse than another may not heed it but the judicious grieve and the artist in fiction returns a smaller income tax  then the very revenue suffers with the general decline of letters  it may of course be urged that all artists are amateurs before they secure a paying public  the amateur novelist may be compared to the young dramatic author who gives his piece at a matinee and who once in a hundred times finds a manager to approve it  may not publishing en amateur be the only way of reaching the public  to this question the answer is no the risk of publishing a novel by a new author is nothing like so great as the risk of producing a play with an unknown name to it  publishers exist for the purpose of bringing out books that will pay and they generally pounce on a good manuscript in fiction whether the writer be known or unknown  it is much more easy to predict whether a novel will pay or not than to prophecy about a drama  thus the most obscure author in spite of the difficulties faced by jane eyre and vanity fair may rely on it that if his ms is not accepted it is not worth accepting he should not if he has decently sound reasons for selfconfidence be disheartened by two or three refusals  one mans taste might be averse to john inglesant anothers might turn against ouida a third might fail to see the merit of vice versa  but if half a dozen experts taste and reject a manuscript it is almost certain to be hopeless  then the author should take the advice once offered by mr walter besant  never publish at your own expense  if you do you stamp yourself as an amateur you add to the crowd of futilities that choke the market and if you have it in you to write a novel which shall be a good piece you are handicapping yourself by placing a bad novel on your record  people sin out of thoughtlessness as well as depravity and we would not say that every amateur novelist is ex officio infamous nefarious and felonious  he or she may be only rather vain conceited and unreflecting  where then is the remedy if homilies fail to convert the sinner as indeed it is the misfortune of homilies to fail  the remedy will be found in a novelists league with tickets and boycotting and strikes and rattening and all the other devices for getting our own way in an oppressive world  there will be a secret society of professionals  lady novelists amateurs will be rattened their blottingpaper and french dictionaries will be stolen or destroyed their publishers will be boycotted by all members of the league who will decline to publish with any man known to deal with amateurs  nay so powerful is this dread and even criminal confederacy that amateurs will not even be reviewed neither the slashing nor the puffing nor the faintly praising notice will be meted out to them  there will be a conspiracy of silence  the very circulating libraries will be threatened and coffins stolen from undertakers who dabble in romance will be laid at mr mudies door unless he casts off the amateur in fiction  the professionals will march through rapine to emancipation  they will strike off the last gyves that fetter the noble art of romance and in five or six years we shall have only about a tenth of the present number of romances but that tenth will pass through as many editions as the pilgrims progress which by the way was probably like ronsards poems the work of an amateur  but these were other times when an author did not expect to make money and thought himself lucky if after a slashing personal review by the inquisition his fragments were not burned at the stake in a bonfire of his volumes    some rare things for sale   an american writer has been complaining lately that his countrymen have lost the habit of reading  this is partly the result of that free trade in english books which is the only form of free trade that suits the american constitution  people do not buy american books any longer because they can get english works mere printed rags but paying nothing to english authors for a few cents  the rags of course fall to pieces and are tossed into the wastepaper basket and thus a habit of desultoriness and of abstention from books worth styling books grows and grows like a noxious and paralysing parasite over the american intellect  in this way our pleasant vices are made instruments to plague us and the condition of the law which leaves the british authors at the mercy of the aldens and monros of the states is beginning to react on the buyers of goods indelicately obtained  even newspaper articles are becoming it is said a heavy and a weary weight on the demoralised attention and people are ceasing to read anything but brief and probably personal paragraphs such as joaquin miller has had his hair cut  this is a deplorable condition of things and perhaps not quite without example at home where however many people still intend to read books and order them at the libraries though they never really carry out intentions which like those of wilkins micawber the younger are excellent  to persons conscious of mental debility and incapable of grappling even with a short shilling novel a brief and easy form of reading may be recommended  they may study catalogues they may peruse the lists of their wares which secondhand booksellers and dealers in all kinds of curiosities circulate gratis  this is the only kind of circular which should not go straight to its long home in the wastepaper basket a catalogue is full of information  it is so exceedingly inconsecutive that even the most successful barrister or doctor or stockbroker they are the people that read least need not be fatigued by its contents  the catalogue skips from gay to grave from tupper to aretino from dickens to drelincourt on death  you can pick it up where you like and lay it down when your poor fagged attention is distracted by a cab in the street or a bird in the branches  then there is the pleasure of marking with a pencil the articles which you would buy if you couldthe nankin double bottle the old novel bound in the arms of the comtesse de verrue the picture ascribed to the school of potto pottoboileri  of course in these bad times such purchases are out of the question but the taste and judgment are gratified by marking them down like partridges in september  these contemplative reveries on catalogues have been inspired by a catalogue not without its meritsa list of relics of mexican history now to be sold  the curious may find it for themselves the wealthy may speculate in the treasures which it advertises  here is a piece of the emperor maximilians waistcoat same in which they shot him to employ an idiom of captain rawdon crawleys  there are many relics of the same recent and troublous times but the amateur is more strongly attracted by a very singular series of objects of the times of the spanish conquest nearly four hundred years ago  it is not so much the obsidian idols made of that curious bottleglasslike mineral so fashionable among the aztecs as the authentic remains of fernando cortes that the collector will covet  what man had ever such fortune as corteshe who discovered a new world as strange as a new planet  he conquered a great civilized race he overthrew a dynasty not only of mortals but of gods huitzilopochtli and quetzalcoatl fled from him and their hideous priests draped and masked in skins fresh flayed from beasts or men vanished at his coming as isis osiris and the dog anubis fled from the folding star of bethlehem  he fought battles like the visions of romance and he took great and stately cities with all their temples and towers which a month before were as unknown to europeans as the capitals of mars and sirius  the wonderful catalogue of which we speak is rich in relics of this hero  we are offered a chance to buy his trunk a carved wooden trunk in which cortes carried his personal property  his army chest which held the sacred gold of montesuma and the treasure of the temple of the sun is to be sold for a consideration  his pistols are also on sale and his fieldglass which must be an exceedingly early example of that useful invention  whether the fieldglass is binocular or not the catalogue does not pause to inform us  corslets worn by his brave castilians are also to be vended perhaps the very leather and steel that guarded the honest heart of good bernal diaz  but all these treasures and even the very scissors of fernando cortes are less enticingly romantic than the iron head of alvarados spear  surely no spear since that of peleus son not to be wielded by meaner men has ever been so well worth acquiring as the spear of alvarado tonatrish the sungod as he was called by the mexicans by reason of his long bright golden hair  this may have been probably was the spear that alvarado bore when he charged up the steps of the great teocalli or gods house rained upon by aztec darts driving before him the hordes of heathendom with this very spear when the summit was gained he may have fought in that strange fight high in air beheld by all the people of the city and all the allies of spain  here stood the christian cross there was planted the wargod huitzilopochtli there the two faiths fought out their battle and the vanquished were tossed dying down the sides of the teocalli  then the spaniard was victorious fire was set to the teocalli and the cannibal aztec religion rolled away in the clouds of smoke and vapour of flame  with the selfsame spear no doubt did alvarado make his famous leap using it as a leaping pole to clear the canal during the retreat of the night of dread  assuredly alvarados spear or even the iron head of it alone is an object worthy of an archaeologists regard and scarce less curious than that     broomstick o the witch of endor    weel shod wi brass  which burns describes in the collection of captain grove  but extraordinary as is the charm of these relics of anahuac and of castille perhaps even more engrossing is the last article in this romantic catalogue namely a green portfolio giving an account of the various articles and how they came into the hands of their proprietor  their pedigree if authentic must be most important  probably the most inattentive mind even in the holidays could tackle a catalogue like this or another in which the snuffbox of xerxes and the bootjack of themistocles should be offered for sale  these antiquities seem scarcely less desirable or less likely to come into the market than the scissors pistols and fieldglass of fernando cortes an original portion of the tables of the law broken on a familiar occasion by the prophet hannibals cigarette case a landing net at one time in the possession of alcibiades a piece of chalk used by archimedes in his mathematical demonstrations the bronze shoe of empedocles the arrow on which abaris flew and the walkingstick a considerable piece of timber which dr johnson lost in mull may all be reposing in some private collection  collectors do get very odd things together  poor m soleirol had quite a gallery of portraits and autographs of moliere and a french mathematician about a dozen years ago possessed an assortment of apocryphal letters from almost every one mentioned in history sacred or profane  the collection of mr samuel ireland was like this and an english student possessed autographs of most of the great reformers carefully written by an ingenious swindler in contemporary books  the lovers of relics are apt to be thus deluded and perhaps we should not regret this as long as they are happy  but they should be very careful indeed when they are asked to buy alvarados spear though probably it is extant somewhere as it certainly is in the catalogue  it is a question of caution in the purchaser    curiosity hunting   what will people not collect in this curious age and what prices will they not pay for things apparently valueless  few objects can seem less desirable than an old postagestamp yet our paris correspondent informs us that postagestamps are at a premium in the capital of taste and of pleasure  a wellknown dealer offers 4 pounds 15s for every tuscan stamp earlier than 1860 and 16 pounds for particularly fine examples mauritius stamps of 1847 are estimatedby the purchaser mindat two thousand francs and postmarks of british guiana of 1836 from five hundred to a thousand francs  eighty pounds for a soiled bit of paper that has no beauty to recommend it  probably no drawing of equal size from the very hand of raffaelle or leonardo would be priced nearly so high as these grubby old stamps  yet the drawing would be not only a thing of art beautiful in itself but also a personal relic of the famous artist whose pencil touched it while a stamp is a relic of nothing but some forgotten postal arrangement with a colony  we do not know moreover how much the dealer will ask for these stamps when once he gets hold of them and has rich collectors at his mercy  in no trade do the buyers price and the sellers price differ with such wide margins as in the commerce of curiosities especially perhaps in the booktrade  people find that they possess books highly priced in dealers catalogues and if they want money they carry their treasures to the dealers  but advantage seldom comes of it  the dealer has a different price very often when he is a purchaser  this is intelligible but to many persons who are not amateurs the mania for rare postagestamps passes all understanding  yet it is capable of being explained  like many other oddities and puzzling features in the ways of collectors the high price of certain stamps is the consequence of the passion for perfection  any one can collect stampslittle boys and schoolgirls often do  but there comes a point at which foreign stamps and old stamps grow rare and more rare and finally next to impossible to procure  here it is that the heart of the mature collector begins to beat  he is determined to have a perfect collection  nothing shall escape him in the way of printed franks on letters  now nineteentwentieths of his assortment he can buy in the gross without trouble or great expense but the last twentieth demands personal care and attention and the hunting up of old family letters and the haunting of great dealers shops and peeping through dirty windows in shady lanes and alleys  as he gets nearer and nearer a complete collection the spoil grows more and more shy the excitement faster and more furious till finally the amateur would sell an estate for a square inch of paper and turn large england to a little stamp if he had the opportunity  the fury of the pastime is caused by the presence of definite limits  there is only a certain known number of stamps in the world  this limit makes perfection possible  it is not as if you were collecting really beautiful things like tanagra terracottas or really rare and quaint and mysterious things like aggery beads  though tanagra terracottas and aggery beads and fine examples of moorish lustre or of ancient nankin or of gold coins of the roman empire are all rare yet there is no definite limit to their number more may turn up any day when the pickaxe breaks into a new tanagra cemetery when a fallen palm in ashanti brings up aggery beads clinging to its earthy roots when a pot of coins is found by some old roman way and so forth  to be sure perfection may be attained in coin collecting when a man has specimens of all known sorts but even then he will pine for better specimens for the best specimens  in the other branches of the sport we have mentioned the collector may be eager of course for good things but he can never know the passion of the stampomaniac who has all sorts but three and finds these within his reach  perfection is within a step of such a man and that step we fear he will take even if it involves ever so many breaches of the decalogue  in one of this months magazines in a story called mr pierrepoints repentance mr grant allen tells the tale of a coin collectors infamy and that coin collector a clergyman and fellow of his college  a pope is said to have stolen a rare book from a painter and it is certain that enthusiastic collectors are apt to have their moral tone lowered some as the american gentleman said about the lady whom he had wooed with intentions less than honourable  a good example of the toils of the collector in pursuit of perfection is given by m henri beraldi in his very amusing catalogue of m paillets library  this book by the way is itself scarce and the bibliomaniac will be rather lucky if he meets with it  m beraldi describes m paillets copy of dorats fables published in 1773 with illustrations by marillier  nobody perhaps ever reads dorat now but his book came out in the very palmiest days of the art of illustration in france  there were no photogravures then nor hideous scratchy and seamy processes such as almost make one despair of progress and of the future of humanity  the people that takes to processes is lost  the illustrations of the fables were duly engraved on copper  there were ninetynine vignettes and as many tailpieces  the bibliographical history of the book is instructive either to young collectors or to the common herd not to speak impolitelythe persons who do not understand what collectors want  the fables were originally published on three different sorts of paper dutch paper at seventytwo francs french paper at twentynine francs and on small paper at twentyfour francs  in 1853 the original drawings were bought by one of the rothschilds for about 60 pounds they would now probably be worth at least 1000 pounds  the ordinary copies of the book itself bring about 6 pounds the large paper copies about 30 pounds and a copy in old morocco can hardly be estimatedyou may pay anything for it as a copy in old calf has sold for 240 pounds  such is the natural history of a book pretty valueless as literature the fables of dorat  in the early edition of brunets manual published in 1821 the large paper copies of the work with the engravings in the earliest state are priced at from fifteen to eighteen francs  these vignettes had gone out of fashion they have come in
