reference to the tastes and capacities of readers of the highschool age every poem included has been found by experience to be within the grasp of boys and girls most of brownings best poetry is within the ken of any reader of imagination and diligence to the reader who lacks these not only browning but the great world of literature remains closed browning is not the only poet who requires close study the difficulties he offers are in his best poems not more repellent to the thoughtful reader than the nut that protects and contains the kernel to a boy or girl of active mind the difficulty need rarely be more than a pleasant challenge to the exercise of a little patience and ingenuity  browning when at his best in vigor clearness and beauty is peculiarly a poet for young people his freedom from sentimentality his liveliness of conception and narration his high optimism and his interest in the things that make for the life of the soul appeal to the imagination and the feelings of youth  the present edition attempts but little in the way of criticism the notes cover such matters as are not readily settled by an appeal to the dictionary and suggest in addition questions that are designed to help in interpretation and appreciation  teachers college new york  july 1899      contents   life of browning browning as poet appreciations chronological list of

camberwell london may 7 1812 he was contemporary with tennyson dickens thackeray lowell emerson hawthorne darwin spencer huxley dumas hugo mendelssohn wagner and a score of other men famous in art and science  brownings good fortune began with his birth his father a clerk in the bank of england possessed ample means for the education of his children he had artistic and literary tastes a mind richly stored with philosophy history literature and legend some repute as a maker of verses and a liberality that led him to assist his gifted son in following his bent from his father robert inherited his literary tastes and his vigorous health in his father he found a critic and companion his mother was described by carlyle as a type of the true scotch gentlewoman her fathomless charity her love of music and her deep religious feeling reappear in the poet  free from struggles with adversity and devoid of public or stirring incidents the story of brownings life is soon told it was the life of a scholar and man of letters devoted to the study of poetry philosophy history to the contemplation of the lives of men and women and to the exercise of his chosen vocation  his school life was of meagre extent he attended a private academy read at home under a tutor and for two years attended the university of london when asked in his later life whether he had been to oxford or cambridge he used to say italy was my university and indeed his many poems on italian themes bear testimony to the profound influence of italy upon him in his teens he came under the influence of pope and byron and wrote verses after their styles then shelley came by accident in his way and became to the boy the model of poetic excellence  in 1838 appeared his first published poem pauline it bears the marks of his peculiar genius it has the germs of his merits and his defects though not widely read it received favorable notice from some of the critics in 1835 appeared paracelsus in 1837 strafford in 1840 sordello from this time on for the fifty remaining years of his life his poetic activity hardly ceased though his poetry was of uneven excellence the middle period of his work beginning with bells and pomegranates in 1842 and ending with balaustions adventure a transcript of euripides alcestis in 1871 was by far the richest in poetic value  in 1846 he married elizabeth barrett the poet they left england for italy where because of mrs brownings feeble health they continued to reside until her death in 1861 the remainder of his life was divided between england and italy with frequent visits to southern france his reputation as a poet had steadily grown he was now one of the best known men in england his mental activity continued unabated to the end within the last thirty years of his life he wrote the ring and the bookhis longest work one of the longest and intellectually one of the greatest of english poems translated the agamemnon of Æschylus and the alcestis of euripides published many shorter poems kept up the studies which had always been his labor and his pastime and found leisure also to know a wide circle of men and women william sharp gives a pleasing picture of the last years of his life everybody wished him to come and dine and he did his utmost to gratify everybody he saw everything read all the notable books kept himself acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines conducted a large correspondence read new french german and italian books of mark read and translated euripides and Æschylus knew all the gossip of the literary clubs salons and the studios was a frequenter of afternoon teaparties and then over and above it he was browning the most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since shakespeare1  he died in venice on december 12 1889 and was buried in the poets corner of westminster abbey    footnote 1 sharps life of browning   browning as poet  the three generations of readers who have lived since brownings first publication have seen as many attitudes taken toward one of the ablest poetic spirits of the century to the first he appeared an enigma a writer hopelessly obscure perhaps not even clear in his own mind as to the message he wished to deliver to the second he appeared a prophet and a philosopher full of all wisdom and subtlety too deep for common mortals to fathom with line and plummetconcealing below green depths of ocean priceless gems of thought and feeling to the third a poet full of inequalities in conception and expression who has done many good things well and has made many grave failures  no poet in our generation has fared so ill at the hands of the critics already the browning library is large some of the criticism is good much of it regarding the author as philosopher and symbolist is totally askew reams have been written in interpretation of childe roland an imaginative fantasy composed in one day abstruse ideas have been wrested from the simple story of my last duchess his poetry has been the stampingground of theologians and the centre of prattling literary circles in this tortuous maze of futile criticism the one thing lost sight of is the fact that a poet must be judged by the standards of art it must be confessed however that browning is himself to blame for much of the smoke of commentary that has gathered round him he has often chosen the oblique expression where the direct would serve better often interpolated his own musing subtleties between the reader and the life he would present often followed his theme into intricacies beyond his own power to resolve into the simple forms of art thus it has come about that misguided readers became enigma hunters and the poet their sphinx  the real question with browning as with any poet is what is his work and worth as an artist what of human life has he presented and how clear and true are his presentations what passions what struggles what ideals what activities of men has he added to the art world what beauty and dignity what light has he created how does he view life with what of hope or aspiration or strength these questions may be discussed under his sense and mastery of form and under his views of human life  brownings sense of form has often been attacked and defended the first impression upon reading him is of harshness amounting to the grotesque rhymes often clash and jangle like the music of savages such rhymes as    fancy the fabric   ere mortar dab brick  strain dignity and beauty to the breakingpoint archaic and bizarre words are pressed into service to help out the rhyme and metre instead of melodic rhythm there are harsh and jolting combinations until the reader brought up in the traditions of shakespeare milton and tennyson is fain to cry out this is not poetry  in internal form as well browning often defies the established laws of literature distorted and elliptical sentences long and irrelevant parentheses curious involutions of thought and irregular or incoherent development of the narrative or the picture often leave the reader in despair even of the meaning nor can these departures from orderly beauty always be defended by the exigencies of the subjects they do not fit the theme they are the discords of a musician who either has not mastered his instrument or is not sensitive to all the finer effects some of his work stands out clear from these faults a toccata of galuppis love among the ruins the songs from pippa passes apparitions andrea del sarto and a score of others might be cited to show that browning could write with a sense of form as true and an ear as delicate as could any poet of the century except tennyson  to browning belongs the credit of having created a new poetic formthe dramatic monologue in this form the larger number of his poems are cast among the best examples in this volume are my last duchess the bishop orders his tomb the laboratory and confessions one person only is speaking but reveals the presence action and thoughts of the others who are in the scene at the same time that he reveals his own character as in a conversation in which but one voice is audible the dramatic monologue has in a peculiar degree the advantages of compression and vividness and is in brownings hands an instrument of great power  the charge of obscurity so often made against brownings poetry must in part be admitted as has been said above he is often led off by his manysided interests into irrelevancies and subtleties that interfere with simplicity and beauty his compressed style and his fondness for unusual words often make an unwarranted demand upon the readers patience such passages are a challenge to his admirers and a repulse to the indifferent sometimes indeed the ore is not worth the smelting often it yields enough to reward the greatest patience  browning like all great poets knew life widely and deeply through men and books he was born in london near the great centres of the intellectual movements of his time he travelled much especially in italy and france he read widely in the literatures and philosophies of many ages and many lands and so grew into the cosmopolitanism of spirit that belonged to chaucer and to shakespeare  in all art human life is the matter of ultimate interest to browning this was so in a peculiar degree in the epistolary preface to sordello written thirty years after its first publication he said my stress lay on the incidents in the development of a soul little else is worth study this interest in the development of a soul is the keynote of nearly all his work to it are directly traceable many of the most obvious excellences and defects of his poetry he came to look below the surfaces of things for the soul beneath them he came to be the subtlest assertor of the soul in song and like his own pair of lovers on the campagna unashamed of soul his early preference of shelley to keats indicated this bent his readers are conscious always of revelations of the souls of the men and women he portrays the sweet and tender womanhood of the duchess the sordid and material soul of the old bishop of st praxeds the devoted and heroic soul of napoleons young soldier the weary and despairing soul of andrea del sartoand a host of others stand before us cleared of the veil of habit and convention the souls of men appear as the victors over all material and immaterial obstacles human affection transforms the bare room to a bower of fruits and flowers human courage and resolution carry childe roland victoriously past the threats and terrors of malignant nature and the despair from accumulated memories of failure death itself is described in evelyn hope in prospice in rabbi ben ezra as a phase a transit of the soul wherein the material aspects and the physical terrors disappear in brownings poetry the one real and permanent thing is the world of ideas the world of the spirit he is in this one of the truest platonists of modern times  to many young readers this method in art comes like a revelation other poets also portray the souls of men but browning does it more obviously more intentionally more insistently it is well therefore to have read browning to learn to read him aright is to enter the gateway to other good and great poetry  out of this predominating interest in the souls of men and out of his intense intellectual activity and scientific curiosity grows one of brownings greatest defects he is often led too far afield into intricacies and anomalies of character beyond the range of common experience and sympathy the criminal the moral idiot belong to the alienist rather than to the poet the abnormalities of nature have no place in the world of great art they do not echo the common experience of mankind already the interest is decreasing in that part of his poetry which deals with such themes bishop blougram and mr sludge will not take place in the ranks of artistic creations nor can the poets special pleading for such types however ingenious it may be whatever philanthropy of soul it may imply be regarded as justification sometimes indeed the poet is led by his sympathy and his intellectual ingenuity into defences that are inconsistent with his own standards of the true and the beautiful  the trait in browning which appeals to the largest number of readers is his strenuous optimism he will admit no evil or sorrow too great to be borne too irrational to have some ultimate purpose of beneficence there shall never be one lost good says abt vogler the suicides in the morgue only serve to call forth his declaration    my own hope is a sun will pierce   the thickest cloud earth ever stretched                                           that what began best cant end worst   nor what god blessed once prove accurst  he has no fear of death he will face it gladly in confidence of the life beyond his grammarian is content to assume an order of things which will justify in the next life his ceaseless toil in this merely to learn how to live rabbi ben ezras old age is serene in the hope of the continuity of life and the eternal development of character he finds life good and the plan of things perfect in brief browning accepts life as it is and believes it good piecing out his conception of the goodness of life by drawing without limit upon his hopes of the other world with the exception of a few poems like andrea del sarto this is the unbroken tone of his poetry calvinism asceticism pessimism in any form he rejects he sustains his position not by argument but by hope and assertion it is a matter of temperament he is optimistic because he was born so different from the serene optimism of shakespeares later life in the tempest and the winters tale in that it is not like shakespeares born of long and deep suffering from the contemplation of the tragedies of human life it bears in that degree less of solace and conviction  to brownings temperament also may be ascribed another prominent trait in his work he steadily asserts the right of the individual to live out his own life to be himself in fulfilling his desires and aspirations the statue and the bust is the famous exposition of this doctrine it is a teaching that neither the poets optimism nor his acumen has justified in the minds of men it is a return to the unbridled freedom of nature advocated by whitman and rousseau an extreme assertion of the value of the individual man and of unregulated democracy an outgrowth it may be of the robustness and originality of brownings nature and interestingnot as a clew to his life which conformed to that of organized societybut as a clew to his independence of classical and conventional forms in the exercise of his art  creative energy browning has in high degree with the poets insight into character and motives the poets grasp of the essential laws of human life the poets vividness of imagination he has portrayed a host of types distinct from each other true to life strongly marked and consistent with fine dramatic instinct he has shown these characters in true relation to the facts of life and to each other in this respect he has satisfied the most exigent demands of art and has already taken rank as one of the great creative minds of the nineteenth century  true poet he is also in his depth of feeling and range of sympathy beneath a ruggedness of intellect like his landscape in de gustibus there is always sympathy and tenderness it is indeed more like the serenity of chaucers emotions than like the tragic fervor of shakespeares mrs brownings estimate of him in lady geraldines courtship    or from browning some pomegranate which if cut deep down the middle   shows a heart within bloodtinctured of a veined humanity  is true criticism  his love of nature and his sense of the joy and beauty of it appear often in his poetry but not with the same insistence as in wordsworth and burns and seldom with the same pervasiveness or with the same beauty as in tennyson he was rather the poet of mens souls when he does use nature it is generally to illustrate some phase or experience of the soul and not for the sake of its beauty he has however some naturedescriptions so exquisite that english poetry would be the poorer for their loss witness de gustibus up at a villa home thoughts from abroad pippas songs and saul  it is too early to guess at brownings permanent place in our literature but his vigor of intellect his insight into the human heart his originality in phrase and conception his unquenchable and fearless optimism and his grasp of the problems of his century make him beyond question one of its greatest figures   appreciations    shakespeare is not our poet but the worlds   therefore on him no speech and brief for thee   browning since chaucer was alive and hale   no man has walked along our roads with step   so active so inquiring eye or tongue   so varied in discourse but warmer climes   give brighter plumage stronger wing the breeze   of alpine heights thou playest with borne on   beyond sorrento and amalfi where   the siren waits thee singing song for song  walter savage landor   tennyson has a vivid feeling of the dignity and potency of law browning vividly feels the importance the greatness and beauty of passions and enthusiasms and his imagination is comparatively unimpressed by the presence of law and its operations it is not the order and regularity in the processes of the natural world which chiefly delight brownings imagination but the streaming forth of power and will and love from the whole face of the visible universe  tennyson considers the chief instruments of human progress to be a vast increase of knowledge and of political organization browning makes that progress dependent on the production of higher passions and aspirationshopes and joys and sorrows tennyson finds the evidence of the truth of the doctrine of progress in the universal presence of a selfevolving law browning obtains his assurance of its truth from inward presages and prophecies of the soul from anticipations types and symbols of a higher greatness in store for man which even now reside within him a creature ever unsatisfied ever yearning upward in thought feeling and endeavour   hence it is not obedience it is not submission to the law of duty which points out to us our true path of life but rather infinite desire and endless aspiration brownings ideal of manhood in this world always recognizes the fact that it is the ideal of a creature who never can be perfected on earth a creature whom other and higher lives await in an endless hereafter  the gleams of knowledge which we possess are of chief value because they sting with hunger for full light the goal of knowledge as of love is god himself its most precious part is that which is least positivethose momentary intuitions of things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard the needs of the highest parts of our humanity cannot be supplied by ascertained truth in which we might rest or which we might put to use for definite ends rather by ventures of faith which test the courage of the soul we ascend from surmise to assurance and so again to higher surmisecondensed from edward dowden studies in literature   browning has not cared for that poetic form which bestows perennial charm or else he was incapable of it he fails in beauty in concentration of interest in economy of language in selection of the best from the common treasure of experience in those works where he has been most indifferent as in the red cotton nightcap country he has been merely whimsical and dull in those works where the genius he possessed is most felt as in saul a toccata of galuppis rabbi ben ezra the flight of the duchess the bishop orders his tomb in saint praxeds church hervé riel cavalier tunes times revenges and many more he achieves beauty or nobility or fitness of phrase such as only a poet is capable of it is in these last pieces and their like that his fame lies for the future it was his lot to be strong as the thinker the moralist with the accomplishment of verse the scholar interested to rebuild the past of experience the teacher with an explicit dogma in an intellectual form with examples from life the anatomist of human passions instincts and impulses in all their gamut the commentator on his own age he was weak as the artist often unnecessarily and by choice in the repulsive formin the awkward the obscure the ugly he belongs with jonson with dryden with the heirs of the masculine intellect the men of power not unvisited by grace but in whom mind is predominant upon the work of such poets time hesitates conscious of their mental greatness but also of their imperfect art their heterogeneous matter at last the good is sifted from that whence worth has departedfrom george edward woodberrys studies in letters and life  when it is urged that for a poet the intellectual energies are too strong in browning that for poetry the play of intellectual interests and activities is too great in his work and that browning often and at times ruthlessly sacrifices the requirements and effects of art for the expression of thought that though he refreshes the heart he tires the brain we should admit this with regard to a good deal of the work of the third period we should allow that this is the side to which he leans generally but still hold that though to many his intellectual quality and energy may well seem excessive yet in great part of his work and that of course his best the passion of the poet and his kind of imagination are just as fresh and powerful as the intellectual force and subtlety are keen and abundantjames frothingham studies of the mind and art of robert browning    now dumb is he who waked the world to speak   and voiceless hangs the world

swarthy skin no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin but lips where smiles went out and in there was no guessing his kith and kin and nobody could enough admire the tall man and his quaint attire quoth one

please your honors said he im able by means of a secret charm to draw all creatures living beneath the sun that creep or swim or fly or run after me so as you never saw and i chiefly use my charm on creatures that do people harm the mole and toad and newt and viper and people call me the pied piper and here they noticed round his neck                                        80 a scarf of red and yellow stripe to match with his coat of selfsame cheque and at the scarfs end hung a pipe and his fingers they noticed were ever straying as if impatient to be playing upon this pipe as low it dangled over his vesture so oldfangled yet said he poor piper as i am in tartary i freed the cham°                                               °89 last june from his huge swarms of gnats                                    90 i eased in asia the nizam°                                                  °91 of a monstrous brood of vampirebats and as for what your brain bewilders if i can rid your town of rats will you give me a thousand guilders one fifty thousandwas the exclamation of the astonished mayor and corporation  vii  into the street the piper stept smiling first a little smile as if he knew what magic slept                                              100 in his quiet pipe the while then like a musical adept to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled like a candleflame where salt is sprinkled and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered you heard as if an army muttered and the muttering grew to a grumbling and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling and out of the houses the rats came tumbling                               110 great rats small rats lean rats brawny rats brown rats black rats gray rats tawny rats grave old plodders gay young friskers fathers mothers uncles cousins cocking tails and pricking whiskers   families by tens and dozens brothers sisters husbands wives followed the piper for their lives from street to street he piped advancing and step for step they followed dancing                                    120 until they came to the river weser wherein all plunged and perished save one who stout as julius cæsar swam across and lived to carry as he the manuscript he cherished to ratland home his commentary which was at the first shrill notes of the pipe i heard a sound as of scraping tripe and putting apples wondrous ripe into a cider presss gripe                                                 130 and a moving away of pickletubboards and a leaving ajar of conservecupboards and a drawing the corks of trainoilflasks and a breaking the hoops of buttercasks and it seemed as if a voice sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery is breathed called out oh rats rejoice the world is grown to one vast drysaltery so munch on crunch on take your nuncheon breakfast supper dinner luncheon                                       140 and just as a bulky sugarpuncheon already staved like a great sun shone glorious scarce an inch before me just as methought it said come bore me i found the weser rolling oer me  viii  you should have heard the hamelin people ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple go cried the mayor and get long poles poke out the nests and block up the holes consult with carpenters and builders                                       150 and leave in our town not even a trace of the ratswhen suddenly up the face of the piper perked in the marketplace with a first if you please my thousand guilders  ix  a thousand guilders the mayor looked blue so did the corporation too for council dinners made rare havoc with claret° moselle° vindegrave° hock°                              °158 and half the money would replenish their cellars biggest butt with rhenish°                                 °160 to pay this sum to a wandering fellow with a gypsy coat of red and yellow beside quoth the mayor with a knowing wink our business was done at the rivers brink we saw with our eyes the vermin sink and whats dead cant come to life i think so friend were not the folks to shrink from the duty of giving you something for drink and a matter of money to put in your poke but as for the guilders what we spoke                                      170 of them as you very well know was in joke beside our losses have made us thrifty a thousand guilders come take fifty  x  the pipers face fell and he cried no trifling i cant wait beside ive promised to visit by dinnertime bagdat and accept the prime of the headcooks pottage all hes rich in for having left in the caliphs° kitchen                                 °179 of a nest of scorpions no survivor                                         180 with him i proved no bargaindriver with you dont think ill bate a stiver and folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion  xi  how cried the mayor dye think i brook being worse treated than a cook insulted by a lazy ribald with idle pipe and vesture piebald you threaten us fellow do your worst blow your pipe there till you burst                                       190  xii  once more he stept into the street   and to his lips again laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane   and ere he blew three notes such sweet soft notes as yet musicians cunning   never gave the enraptured air there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling small feet were pattering wooden shoes clattering                         200 little hands clapping and little tongues chattering and like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering out came the children running all the little boys and girls with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls tripping and skipping ran merrily after the wonderful music with shouting and laughter  xiii  the mayor was dumb and the council stood as if they were changed into blocks of wood unable to move a step or cry                                               210 to the children merrily skipping by could only follow with the eye that joyous crowd at the pipers back but how the mayor was on the rack and the wretched councils bosom beat as the piper turned from the high street to where the weser rolled its waters right in the way of their sons and daughters however he turned from south to west and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed                                 220 and after him the children pressed great was the joy in every breast he never can cross that mighty top hes forced to let the piping drop and we shall see our children stop when lo as they reached the mountainside a wondrous portal opened wide as if a cavern were suddenly hollowed and the piper advanced and the children followed and when all were in to the very last                                     230 the door in the mountainside shut fast did i say all no one was lame and could not dance the whole of the way and in after years if you would blame his sadness he was used to say its dull in our town since my playmates left i cant forget that im bereft of all the pleasant sights they see which the piper also promised me for he led us he said to a joyous land                                   240 joining the town and just at hand where waters gushed and fruittrees grew and flowers put forth a fairer hue and everything was strange and new the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here and their dogs outran our fallow deer and honeybees had lost their stings and horses were born with eagles wings and just as i became assured my lame foot would be speedily cured                                       250 the music stopped and i stood still and found myself outside the hill left alone against my will to go now limping as before and never hear of that country more  xiv  alas alas for hamelin   there came into many a burghers pate   a text which says that heavens gate   opes to the rich at as easy a rate as the needles eye takes a camel in                                       260 the mayor sent east west north and south to offer the piper by word of mouth   wherever it was mens lot to find him silver and gold to his hearts content if hed only return the way he went   and bring the children behind him but when they saw twas a lost endeavor and piper and dancers were gone forever they made a decree that lawyers never   should think their records dated duly                                     270 if after the day of the month and year these words did not as well appear   and so long after what happened here   on the twentysecond of july thirteen hundred and seventysix and the better in memory to fix the place of the childrens last retreat they called it the pied pipers street where any one playing on pipe or tabor was sure for the future to lose his labour                                 280 nor suffered they hostelry or tavern   to shock with mirth a street so solemn but opposite the place of the cavern   they wrote the story on a column and on the great church window painted the same to make the world acquainted how their children were stolen away and there it stands to this very day and i must not omit to say that in transylvania theres a tribe                                        290 of alien people who ascribe the outlandish ways and dress on which their neighbours lay such stress to their fathers and mothers having risen out of some subterraneous prison into which they were trepanned long time ago in a mighty band out of hamelin town in brunswick land but how or why they dont understand  xv  so

saw my stout galloper roland at last with resolute shoulders each butting away the haze as some bluff river headland its spray  and his low head and crest just one sharp ear bent back for my voice and the other pricked out on his track and one eyes black intelligenceever that glance oer its white edge at me his own master askance and the thick heavy spumeflakes which aye and anon his fierce lips

again his curls he threw and cheerful turned to work anew                                            10  said blaise the listening monk well done i doubt not thou art heard my son  as well as if thy voice today were praising god the popes great way  this easter day the pope at rome praises god from peters dome  said theocrite would god that i might praise him that great way and die  night passed

with signalfires well there i lay close covered oer in my recess up to the neck in ferns and cress thinking on metternich° our friend                                        °19 and charless miserable

glanced round and saw me beckon from the ground                                           40 a wild bush grows and hides my crypt she picked my glove up while she stripped a branch off then rejoined the rest with that my glove lay in her breast then i drew breath they disappeared it was for italy i feared    an hour and she returned alone exactly where my glove was thrown meanwhile came many

meant to call a freak of youth this hiding and give hopes of pay and no temptation to betray but when i saw that womans face its calm simplicity of grace our italys own attitude in which she walked thus far and stood                                     60 planting each naked foot so firm to crush the snake and spare the worm at first sight of her eyes i said i am that man upon whose head they

gossips who saunters who hurries by green blinds as a matter of course to draw when the sun gets high and the shops with fanciful signs which are painted properly  what of a villa tho winter be over

three fingers well the wild tulip at end of its tube blows out its great red bell like a thin clear bubble of blood for the children to pick and sell  is it ever hot in the square theres a fountain to spout and splash in the shade it sings and springs in the shine such foambows flash on the horses with curling fishtails that prance and paddle and pash round the lady atop in her conchfifty gazers do not abash tho all that she wears is some weeds round her waist in a sort of sash     30  all the year long at the villa nothing to see though you linger except yon cypress that points like deaths lean

mere playthings all the while things he admires and mocks toothat is it because so brave so better tho they be it nothing skills if he begin to plague look now i melt a gourdfruit into mash add

live fly to yon rocktop nip me off the horns of grigs high up that make the merry din saucy thro their veined wings and mind me not in which feat if his leg snapped brittle clay and he lay

   300 jerusalems repose shall make amends for time this letter wastes thy time and mine till when once more thy pardon and farewell  the very god think abib dost thou think so the allgreat were the allloving too so through the thunder comes a human voice saying o heart i made a heart beats here face my hands fashioned see it in myself thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine but love i gave thee with myself to love                                  310 and thou must love me who have died for thee the madman saith he said so it is strange                                          saul  i  said abner at last thou art come ere i tell ere thou speak kiss my cheek wish me well then i wished it and did kiss his cheek and he since the king o my friend for thy countenance sent neither drunken nor eaten have we nor until from his tent thou return with the joyful assurance the king liveth yet shall our lip with the honey be bright with the water be wet for out of the black midtents silence a space of three days not a sound hath escaped to thy servants of prayer nor of praise to betoken that saul and the spirit have ended their strife and that faint in his triumph the monarch sinks back upon life            10   ii  yet now my heart leaps o beloved gods child with his dew on thy gracious gold hair and those lilies still living and blue just broken to twine round thy harpstrings as if no wild heat were now raging to torture the desert   iii                                  then i as was meet knelt down to the god of my fathers and rose on my feet and ran oer the sand burnt to powder the tent was unlooped i pulled up the spear that obstructed and under i stooped hands and knees on the slippery grasspatch all withered and gone that extends to the second enclosure i groped my way on till i felt where the foldskirts fly open then once more i prayed          20 and opened the foldskirts and entered and was not afraid but spoke here is david thy servant and no voice replied at the first i saw naught but the blackness but soon i descried a something more black than the blacknessthe vast the upright main prop which sustains the pavilion and slow into sight grew a figure against it gigantic and blackest of all then a sunbeam that burst thro the tent roof showed saul   iv  he stood erect as that tentprop both arms stretched out wide on the great crosssupport in the centre that goes to each side he relaxed not a muscle but hung there as caught in his pangs              30 and waiting his change the king serpent all heavily hangs far away from his kind in the pine till deliverance come with the springtimeso agonized saul drear and stark blind and dumb   v  then i tuned my harptook off the lilies we twine round its chords lest they snap neath the stress of the noontidethose sunbeams like swords and i first played the tune all our sheep know as one after one so docile they come to the pendoor till folding be done they are white and untorn by the bushes for lo they have fed where the long grasses stifle the water within the streams bed and now one after one seeks its lodging as star follows star                40 into eve and the blue far above usso blue and so far   vi  then the tune for which quails on the cornland will each leave his mate to fly after the player then what makes the crickets elate till for boldness they fight one another and then what has weight to set the quick jerboa amusing outside his sand house there are none such as he for a wonder half bird and half mouse god made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear to give sign we and they are his children one family here   vii  then i played the helptune of our reapers their winesong when hand grasps at hand eye lights eye in good friendship and great hearts expand   50 and grow one in the sense of this worlds lifeand then the last song when the dead man is praised on his journeybear bear him along with his few faults shut up like dead flowerets are balmseeds not here to console us the land has none left such as he on the bier oh would we might keep thee my brotherand then the glad chaunt of the marriagefirst go the young maidens next she whom we vaunt as the beauty the pride of our dwellingand then the great march wherein man runs to man to assist him and buttress an arch naught can break who shall harm them our friendsthen the chorus intoned as the levites go up to the altar in glory enthroned                        60 but i stopped here for here in the darkness saul groaned   viii  and i paused held my breath in such silence and listened apart and the tent shook for mighty saul shuddered and sparkles gan dart from the jewels that woke in his turban at once with a start all its lordly malesapphires and rubies courageous at heart so the head but the body still moved not still hung there erect and i bent once again to my playing pursued it unchecked as i sang   ix                  oh our manhoods prime vigor no spirit feels waste not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced oh the wild joys of living the leaping from rock up to rock               70 the strong rending of boughs from the firtree the cool silver shock of the plunge in a pools living water the hunt of the bear and the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair and the meal the rich dates yellowed over with golddust divine and the locustflesh steeped in the pitcher the full draught of wine and the sleep in the dried riverchannel where bulrushes tell that the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well how good is mans life the mere living how fit to employ all the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy hast thou loved the white locks of thy father whose sword thou didst guard  80 when he trusted thee forth with the armies for glorious reward didst thou see the thin hands of thy mother held up as men sung the low song of the nearly departed and hear her faint tongue joining in while it could to the witness let one more attest i have lived seen gods hand thro a lifetime and all was for best then they sung thro their tears in strong triumph not much but the rest and thy brothers the help and the contest the working whence grew such result as from seething grapebundles the spirit strained true and the friends of thy boyhoodthat boyhood of wonder and hope present promise and wealth of the future beyond the eyes scope           90 till lo thou art grown to a monarch a people is thine and all gifts which the world offers singly on one head combine on one head all the beauty and strength love and rage like the throe that awork in the rock helps its labour and lets the gold go high ambition and deeds which surpass it fame crowning themall brought to blaze on the head of one creatureking saul   x  and lo with that leap of my spiritheart hand harp and voice each lifting sauls name out of sorrow each bidding rejoice sauls fame in the light it was made foras when dare i say the lords army in rapture of service strains thro its array            100 and upsoareth the cherubimchariotsaul cried i and stopped and waited the thing that should follow then saul who hung propped by the tents crosssupport in the centre was struck by his name have ye seen when springs arrowy summons goes right to the aim and some mountain the last to withstand her that held he alone while the vale laughed in freedom and flowers on a broad bust of stone a years snow bound about for a breastplateleaves grasp of the sheet fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to his feet and there fronts you stark black but alive yet your mountain of old with his rents the successive bequeathings of ages untold          110 yea each harm got in fighting your battles each furrow and scar of his head thrust twixt you and the tempestall hail there they are now again to be softened with verdure again hold the nest of the dove tempt the goat and its young to the green on his crest for their food in the ardours of summer one long shudder thrilled all the tent till the very air tingled then sank and was stilled at the kings self left standing before me released and aware what was gone what remained all to traverse twixt hope and despair death was past life not come so he waited awhile his right hand held the brow helped the eyes left too vacant forthwith to remand         120 to their place what new objects should enter twas saul as before i looked up and dared gaze at those eyes nor was hurt any more than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn ye watch from the shore at their sad level gaze oer the oceana suns slow decline over hills which resolved in stern silence oerlap and entwine base with base to knit strength more intensely so arm folded arm oer the chest whose slow heavings subsided   xi                                          what spell or what charm for awhile there was trouble within me what next should i urge to sustain him where song had restored him song filled to the verge his cup with the wine of this life pressing all that it yields             130 of mere fruitage the strength and the beauty beyond on what fields glean a vintage more potent and perfect to brighten the eye and bring blood to the lip and commend them the cup they put by he saith it is good still he drinks not he lets me praise life gives assent yet would die for his own part   xii                                              then fancies grew rife which had come long ago on the pasture when round me the sheep fed in silenceabove the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep and i lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie neath his ken tho i saw but the strip twixt the hill and the sky and i laughedsince my days are ordained to be passed with my flocks     140 let me people at least with my fancies the plains and the rocks dream the life i am never to mix with and image the show of mankind as they live in those fashions i hardly shall know schemes of life its best rules and right uses the courage that gains and the prudence that keeps what men strive for and now these old trains of vague thought came again i grew surer so once more the string of my harp made response to my spirit as thus   xiii                                                  yea my king i beganthou dost well in rejecting mere comforts that spring from the mere mortal life held in common by man and by

their place while the palmwine shall staunch every wound of mans spirit in winter i pour thee such wine leave the flesh to the fate it was fit for the spirit be thine            160 by the spirit when age shall oercome thee thou still shalt enjoy more indeed than at first when inconscious the life of a boy crush that life and behold its wine running each deed thou hast done dies revives goes to work in the world until een as the sun looking down on the earth tho clouds spoil him tho tempests efface can find nothing his own deed produced not must everywhere trace the results of his past summerprimeso each ray of thy will every flash of thy passion and prowess long over shall thrill thy whole people the countless with ardour till they too give forth a like cheer to their sons who in turn fill the south and the north       170 with the radiance thy deed was the germ of carouse in the past but the license of age has its limit thou diest at last as the lion when age dims his eyeball the rose at her height so with manso his power and his beauty forever take flight no again a long draught of my soulwine look forth oer the years thou hast done now with eyes for the actual begin with the seers is saul dead in the depth of the vale make his tombbid arise a gray mountain of marble heaped foursquare till built to the skies let it mark where the great first king slumbers whose fame would ye know up above see the rocks naked face where the record shall go               180 in great characters cut by the scribesuch was saul so he did with the sages directing the work by the

that day and before it not seldom had granted thy help to essay carry on and complete an adventuremy shield and my sword in that act where my soul was thy servant thy word was my word still be with me who then at the summit of human endeavour and scaling the highest mans thought could gazed hopeless as ever on the new stretch of heaven above metill mighty to save just one lift of thy hand cleared that distancegods throne from mans grave let me tell out my tale to its endingmy voice to my heart which can scarce dare believe in what marvels last night i took part       200 as this morning i gather the fragments alone with my sheep and still fear lest the terrible glory evanish like sleep for i wake in the gray dewy covert while hebron upheaves the dawn struggling with night on his shoulder and kidron retrieves slow the damage of yesterdays sunshine   xv                                            i say thenmy song while i sang thus assuring the monarch and ever more strong made a proffer of good to console himhe slowly resumed his old motions and habitudes kingly the right hand replumed his black locks to their wonted composure adjusted the swathes of his turban and seethe huge sweat that his countenance bathes         210 he wipes off with the robe and he girds now his loins as of yore and feels slow for the armlets of price with the clasp set before he is saul ye remember in gloryere error had bent the broad brow from the daily communion and still tho much spent be the life and bearing that front you the same god did choose to receive what a man may waste desecrate never quite lose so sank he along by the tentprop till stayed by the pile of his armour and warcloak and garments he leaned there awhile and sat out my singingone arm round the tentprop to raise his bent head and the other hung slacktill i touched on the praise       220 i foresaw from all men in all time to the man patient there and thus ended the harp falling forward then first i was ware that he sat as i say with my head just above his vast knees which were thrust out each side around me like oak roots which please to encircle a lamb when it slumbers i looked up to know if the best i could do had brought solace he spoke not but slow lifted up the hand slack at his side till he laid it with care soft and grave but in mild settled will on my brow thro my hair the large fingers were pushed and he bent back my head with kind power all my face back intent to peruse it as men do a flower                  230 thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine and oh all my heart how it loved him but where was the sign i yearnedcould i help thee my father inventing a bliss i would add to that life of the past both the future and this i would give thee new life altogether as good ages hence as this momenthad love but the warrant loves heart to dispense   xvi  then the truth came upon me no harp moreno song more outbroke   xvii  i have gone the whole round of creation i saw and i spoke i a work of gods hand for that purpose received in my brain and pronounced on the rest of his handworkreturned him again              240 his creations approval or censure i spoke as i saw reported as man may of gods workalls love yet alls law now i lay down the judgeship he lent me each faculty tasked to perceive him has gained an abyss where a dewdrop was asked have i knowledge confounded it shrivels at wisdom laid bare have i forethought how purblind how blank to the infinite care do i task any faculty highest to image success i but open my eyesand perfection no more and no less in the kind i imagined fullfronts me and god is seen god in the star in the stone in the flesh in the soul and the clod          250 and thus looking within and around me i ever renew with that stoop of the soul which in bending upraises it too the submission of mans nothingperfect to gods all complete as by each new obeisance in spirit i climb to his feet yet with all this abounding experience this deity known i shall dare to discover some province some gift of my own theres a faculty pleasant to exercise hard to hoodwink i am fain to keep still in abeyance i laugh as i think lest insisting to claim and parade in it wot ye i worst een the giver in one giftbehold i could love if i durst               260 but i sink the pretension as fearing a man may oertake gods own speed in the one way of love i abstain for loves sake what my soul see thus far and no farther when doors great and small nineandninety flew ope at our touch should the hundredth appal in the least things have faith yet distrust in the greatest of all do i find love so full in my nature gods ultimate gift that i doubt his own love can compete with it here the parts shift here the creature surpass the creatorthe end what began would i fain in my impotent yearning do all for this man and dare doubt he alone shall not help him who yet alone can              270 would it ever have entered my mind the bare will much less power to bestow on this saul what i sang of the marvellous dower of the life he was gifted and filled with to make such a soul such a body and then such an earth for insphering the whole and doth it not enter my mind as my warm tears attest these good things being given to go on and give one more the best ay to save and redeem and restore him maintain at

enough by lifes dream of the rest to make sure by the painthrob triumphantly winning intensified bliss and the next worlds reward and repose by the struggles in this   xviii  i believe it tis thou god that givest tis i who receive in the first is the last in thy will is my power to believe alls one gift thou canst grant it moreover as prompt to my prayer as i breathe out this breath as i open these arms to the air              290 from thy will stream the worlds life and nature thy dread sabaoth i willthe mere atoms despise me why am i not loath to look that even that in the face too why is it i dare think but lightly of such impuissance what stops my despair thistis not what man does which exalts him but what man would do see the kingi would help him but cannot the wishes fall through could i wrestle to raise him from sorrow grow poor to enrich to fill up his life starve my own out i wouldknowing which i know that my service is perfect oh speak thro me now would i suffer for him that i love so wouldst thouso wilt thou          300 so shall crown thee the topmost ineffablest uttermost crown and thy love fill infinitude wholly nor leave up nor down one spot for the creature to stand

i know not too well how i found my way home in the night there were witnesses cohorts about me to left and to right angels powers the unuttered unseen the alive the aware i repressed i got thro them as hardly as stragglingly there as a runner beset by the populace famished for news life or death the whole earth was awakened hell loosed with her crews and the stars of night beat with emotion and tingled and shot out in fire the strong pain of pent knowledge but i fainted not           320 for the hand still impelled me at once and supported suppressed all the tumult and quenched it with quiet and holy behest till the rapture was shut in itself and the earth sank to rest anon at the dawn all that trouble had withered from earth not so much but i saw it die out in the days tender birth in the gathered intensity brought to the gray of the hills in the shuddering forests held breath in the sudden windthrills in the startled wild beasts that bore off each with eye sidling still though averted with wonder and dread in the birds stiff and chill that rose heavily as i approached them made stupid with awe              330 een the serpent that slid away silenthe felt the new law the

there is no sort of historical foundation about good news from ghent i wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the african coast after i had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of

page 41  the lover denies the evanescence of human love he implies that in some future time the love will reappear and be rewarded brownings optimism lays hold sometimes of the present sometimes of the future for the fulfilment of its hope especially strong is his sense of the continuity of life there shall never be one lost good he makes abt vogler say the charm of this poem is more perhaps in

representing some crisis of human life into which breaks with beneficent influence a song of the girl felippa or pippa on her holiday from the silkmills she is unconscious of the influence she exerts william sharp says these songs are as pathetically fresh and free as a thrushs song in a beleaguered city and with the same unconsidered magic   the lost leader page 75  the desertion of the liberal cause by wordsworth southey and others is the germinal idea of this poem but browning always strenuously insisted that the resemblance went no further that the lost leader is no true portrait of wordsworth though he became poetlaureate the lost leader is a purely ideal conception developed by the process of idealization from an individual who serves as a lay figure  13 shakespeare was more of

how gratifying when the last toll of st marks had left a deeper stillness than before those by the bedside saw a yet profounder silence on the face of him whom they loved  what claim does browning

thirty pages of the stones of venice put into as many lines brownings also being the antecedent work  it is not however for its historical accuracy that a poem is mainly to be judged the full and

characteristic note of poetic melancholy found again and again from virgil to tennyson  3739 is the ironical tone of these lines in harmony with the spirit of the rest of the poem  what does galuppis music mean to browning what does it recall of the life in venice is the lightness of tone in the music itself or in the poets idea of venice what emotions are aroused what causes the poets sadness is

nearer together now he sees the past the beginnings of things and the future even the dead are back again in his presence his imagination has anulled time and space as he thinks of his art it seems more glorious to him than painting and poetry these work by laws that can be explained and followed while music is a direct expression of the will an act of higher creative power  when the music ends he cannot be consoled by the thought that as good music will come again so he turns to the one unchanging thing the ineffable name thus he gains confidence to say there shall never be one lost good all failure and all evil are but a prelude to the good that shall in the end prevail so he returns in hope and patience to the c major the common chord of life  art vogler is famous not only for its confident optimism but as an example of brownings power of annexing a new domainthat of musicto poetry  where does the musician cease to speak of solomons building and begin to describe his own note

creative vision what does he mean in line 40 is he right in saying music is less subject to laws than poetry and painting why is he sad when his music ceases why does he turn to god for consolation follow carefully the argument in stanza ix is it convincing what analogy does he find between music and good and evil   rabbi ben ezra page 133  abraham ben meir ben ezra into whose mouth browning

soulless because he has done wrong or do the lack of soul in his painting and the wrongdoing and the infatuation with lucrezias beauty all arise from the same thingthe mans own nature does he appeal to your sympathy or provoke your condemnation does he blame himself or another or circumstances  what idea have you of lucrezia what does she think of andrea of his art what things does he desire of her  what problems of life are here presented which is principal the relation of man and woman the need of soul for great work or the interrelation between character and achievement or is there something else for which the poem stands  can you cite any lines that embody the main idea of the poem does anything in it remind you of the grammarian or of rabbi ben ezra   caliban upon setebos page 161  setebos was the god of calibans mother the witch sycorax on prosperos island  read shakespeares the tempest observe especially all that is said by or about caliban observe that browning makes caliban usually speak of himself in the third person and prefixes an apostrophe to the initial verb as in the first line  tylors primitive culture and early history of mankind give interesting accounts of the religions of savages  how is calibans savage nature indicated in the opening scene what things does he think setebos has made from what motives what limit to the power of setebos why does caliban imagine these limits how does setebos govern out of what materials does caliban build his conceptions of his deity why does he fear him how does he propitiate him why is he terrified at

come to him of the failures of his friends was their disgrace in physical or moral failure how does he come to find the tower why does browning represent it as a dark tower does his courage fail at the end of his quest or does he win the victory in finding the tower and blowing the challenge   an epistle page 183  the arabs were among the earliest in the cultivation of mathematical and medical science this fact together with their monotheism makes karshish an appropriate character for the experience of the poem  114 an ancient and oriental idea of the soul and its relation to the body  15 sage abib to whom the letter is sent  17 snakestone a stone used to cure snakebites  19 charms note here and elsewhere the mixture of science and superstition  2133 the poet has given local color to the journey  28 vespasian was appointed generalinchief against the insurgent jews in 67 ad and began the great siege of jerusalem in 70 ad the date of the poem and the length of time since lazaruss return to life may thus be estimated  3738 note the vividness gained by making karshish keep the physicians point of view  44 fallingsickness  cure epilepsy karshish is already admitting into his letter the story of lazarus  48 not only spiders but many other animals or parts of animals were formerly used as medicines  6465 karshish still half ashamed of his interest in the marvellous story he has to tell first gives this as a pretext and then in the next lines confesses  171 ff belief in magic survived in some degree among the educated until a century or two ago  177 greekfire a violently inflammable substance supposed to have been a compound of naphtha sulphur and nitre which was hurled against the enemy in battle as it was first used in 673 in the siege of constantinople browning is guilty of an unimportant anachronism  252255 a good touch to make the earthquake mean to karshish an omen of the gravest event within his ken  268269 karshish still unconvinced by the story of lazarus naturally regards it as irreverent  304311 this comes to karshish as an afterthought a corollary to the idea in the body of the poem  how is the general style of the verseletter maintained what is karshishs mission in judea how does he show his devotion to his art point out instances of local color are they in harmony with the main current of the poem or do they detract from the interest in the story why does karshish work up to his story so diffidently why has the incident taken such hold upon him what do you conceive to be his character and worth as a man  what of lazarus what change has been wrought in him is he in any way unfitted for this life to what does karshish compare him with his sudden wealth of insight behind the veil of the next world which of the two men is better fitted for the condition in which he is placed what religious significance does the story of lazarus come to have to karshish what parallel ideas do you find in rabbi ben ezra and in this poem compare george eliots story the lifted veil   saul page 196  this is generally regarded as one of brownings greatest poems even his detractors concede to it beauty of form fervor of feeling and richness of imagery the incident upon which it is based is found in 1 samuel chapter xvi saul is in the depths of mental eclipse and david has been summoned to cure him by music the young shepherd sings to him first the songs that appeal to the gentle animals then the songs that men use in their human relationshipssongs of labor of the weddingfeast of the burialservice of worship then he sings the joy of physical life ending in an appeal to the ambition of king saul saul is roused but not yet brought to will to live so david sings anew of the life of the spirit the spirit of saul living for his people then a touch of tenderness from the king flashes into david a prophetic insight if he the imperfect would do so much for love of saul what would god the allperfect do for men and so he reaches the conception of the christ the incarnation  the poem is full of echoes of the old testament fused with the spirit of modern christianity and modern thinking it is touched here and there with bits of beauty from oriental landscape the long even swell of the lines carries one along with no sense of the roughness so common in brownings verse rising by steady degrees to the climax we feel like david some sense of the terrible glory some sense of the unseen presences that hovered around him as he made his way home in the night   one word more page 224  one word more was appended to brownings volume men and women 1855 by way of dedication of the book to his wife it is characteristic of its author in its reality of feeling in its seeking an unusual point of view in its parenthetic and allusive style and its occasional high felicity of expression those who feel overpowered by brownings vigor and profundity of thought might stop here to note the exquisite inconsistency between the examples cited and the thing thus illustrated the painter turning poet the poet turning painter the moon turning her unseen face to a mortal lover these are compared to browning the poetwriting another poem the only difference in his art is that the poet here speaks for himself in the first person and not as usual dramatically in the third person the idea of the poem may be found stripped of digression and fanciful comparisons in the eighth twelfth fourteenth seventeenth and eighteenth stanzas something of the same idea appears in my star  5 rafael etc more commonly spelled raphael born in italy in 1483
