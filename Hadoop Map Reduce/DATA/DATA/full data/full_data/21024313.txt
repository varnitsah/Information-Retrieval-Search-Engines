isabels dark eyes   then vanished in the blush of shame   that as its penance instant came   o thought unworthy of my race                      the lord of the isles   as little recked fitzjocelyn of the murmurs which he had provoked as he guessed the true secret of his victory  in his eyes it was the triumph of merit over prejudice and mrs frost espoused the same gratifying view though ascribing much to her nephews activity and james himself flushed with hope and success was not likely to dissent  next they had to make their conquest available  apart from louiss magnificent prognostications at the lowest computation the head masters income amounted to a sum which to james appeared affluence and though there was no house provided it mattered the less since there were five to choose from in the terrace even if his grandmother had not wished that their household should be still the same  with miss conways own fortune and the terrace settled on herself where could be any risk  would lady conway think so and how should the communication be made james at first proposed writing to her enclosing a letter to isabel but he changed his mind unable to satisfy himself that when absent from restraint she might not send a refusal without affording her daughter the option  he begged his grandmother to write to isabel but she thought her letter might carry too much weight and whatever might be her hopes it was not for her to tell the young lady that such means were sufficient  louis begged to be the bearer of the letter  his aunt would certainly keep terms with him and he could insure that the case was properly laid before isabel and as there could be no doubt at present of his persuasive powers james caught at the offer  the party were still at beauchastel and he devised going to his old quarters at ebbscreek and making a descent upon them from thence  when he came to take up his credentials he found james and his little black leathern bag determined to come at least to ebbscreek with him and declaring it made him frantic to stay at home and leave his cause in other hands and that he could not exist anywhere but close to the scene of action  captain hannaford was smoking in his demiboat and gave his former lodgers a hearty welcome but he twinkled knowingly with his eye and so significantly volunteered to inform them that the ladies were still at beauchastel that jamess wrath at the old skippers impudence began to revive and he walked off to the remotest end of the garden  the captain remaining with louis with whom he was always on far more easy terms looked after the other gentleman winked again and confessed that he had suspected one or other of them might be coming that way this summer though he could not say he had expected to see them both together  mind captain said louis it wasnt i that made the boat late this time last year  well  i might be wrong i fancied you cast an eye that way  then maybe it aint true whats all over the place here  louis pressed to hear what  why that when the french were going on like robert spear and them old times he had convoyed the young lady right through the midst of them and they would both have been shot if my ladys butler hadnt come down with a revolver killed halfadozen of the mob and rescued them out of it but that lord fitzjocelyn had been desperately wounded in going back to fetch her bracelet and mr delaford had carried him out in his arms  well said louis coolly without altering a muscle of his face as the captain looked for an angry negative  and when they got homeso the story wentmr frost the tutor was so mad with jealousy and rage that my lady declared those moorings would not suit her no longer but had let go and laid her head right for beauchastel  pray what was the young lady supposed to think of the matter  stories appeared to vary  one version said that mr delaford had found him on his knees to her and that my lady had snatched her cruelly away because she would not have her married before her own daughters and looked over all the post for fear there should be a letter for her  another declared that miss conway would not have him at any price and was set upon the poor tutor and that he was lying dangerously ill of a low fever the women will have it so observed the captain the storys everywhere except maybe in the parlour at beauchastel and i wouldnt wonder if mrs mansell knew it all herself for her maid has a tongue a yard long  i wont say but i thought there might be some grain of truth at the bottom  and you shall hear it byandby when i know what it is myself  id not say i would have believed it the more if that fine gentleman had taken his oath of ita fellow that aint to be trusted observed the captain  this might have led to a revelation if louis had had time to attend to it but he had pity on jamess impatient misery and proceeded to ask the loan of the boat  the tide would not however serve and as waiting till it would was not to be endured the two cousins set off to walk together through the woods louis beguiling the way by chaffing james as far as he would bear with the idea of isabels name being trifled with by the profane crowd  he left james at the gate of the park prowling about like a panther to try for a glimpse of isabels window and feeding his despair and jealousy that louis should boldly walk up to the door while he with so much better a right was excluded by his unguarded promise to lady conway  all the tumultuary emotions of his mind were endlessly repeated and many a slow and pealing note of the churchclock had added fuel to his impatience and spurred him to rush up to the door and claim his rights before louis came bounding past the lodgegates flourishing his cap and crying hurrah jem  all right  im going to her at once cried jem beginning to rush off but louis caught and imprisoned his arm  not so fast sir  you are to see her  i promise you shall see her if you wish it but it must be in my aunts way  let me go i say  when i have walked five miles in your service you wont afford me an arm to help me back  i am not a horse with wings and i wont be cupids post except on my own terms  come back  i dont stir till i have heard the state of the case  yes you do for all the sportsmen will be coming home and my aunt would not for all the world that mr mansell caught you on the forbidden ground  how can you give in to such shuffling nonsense  if i am to claim isabel openly why am i not to visit her openly  you have yielded to that womans crooked policy  i dont trust you  when you are her son you may manage her as you please  just now she has us in her power and can impose conditions  come on and if you are good you shall hear  drawing james along with him through the beechwood glades he began you would have been more insane still if you had guessed at my luck i found isabel alone  mrs mansell had taken the girls to some juvenile fete and delaford was discreet enough not to rouse my aunt from her letters  i augured well from the happy conjunction  go on dont waste time in stuff  barkis is willing then  is that enough to the point  fitzjocelyn you never had any feelings yourself and therefore you trifle with those of others  i beg your pardon  it was a shame  jem you may be proud  she trusts you completely and whatever you think sufficient she regards as ample  like her  only too like her  such confidence makes one feel a redoubled responsibility  i thought i had found something at which you could not grumble  how does she look  how do they treat her  apparently they have not yet fed her on bread and water  no seriously i must confess that she looked uncommonly well and lovely never mind jem i verily believe that in spite of absence and all that she had never been so happy in her life  if any description could convey the sweetness of voice and manner when she spoke of you i could not look in her face  those looks can only be for you  we talked it over but she heeded no ways and means it was enough that you were satisfied  she says the subject has never been broached since the flight from northwold and that lady conways kindness never varies and she told me she had little fear but that her dear mamma would be prevailed on to give sanction enough to hinder her from feeling as if she were doing wrong or setting a bad example to her sisters  they know nothing of it but walter who learnt it no one knows how draws the exemplary moral that it serves his mother right for inflicting a tutor on him  has she had my letter  does she know i am here  wait  all this settled and luncheon being ready down came my lady and we played unconsciousness to our best ability  i must confess my aunt beat us hollow  isabel then left us to our conference which we conducted with the gravity of a tailor and an old woman making a match in brittany  you came out with that valuable improvable freehold the terrace i suppose  i told the mere facts  my aunt was rather grand about a grammarschool she said even a curacy would sound better and she must talk it over with isabel  i gave your letter conjuring her to let isabel have it and though she declared that it was no kindness and would put the poor darling into needless perplexity she was touched with my forbearance in not having given it before when i had such an opportunity  so she went away and stayed a weary while but when she came it was worth the waiting  she said isabel was old enough to know her own mind and the attachment being so strong and you so unexceptionable she did not think it possible to object she had great delight in seeing you made happy and fulfilling the dictates of her own heart now that it could be done with moderate prudence they go to scarborough in a fortnight and you will be welcome there theres for you  louis you are the best fellow living  but you said i was to see her at once  i asked why wait for scarborough and depicted you hovering disconsolately round the precincts  never mind jem i did not make you more ridiculous than human nature must needs paint a lover and it was all to melt her heart  i was starting off to fetch you when i found she was in great terror  she had never told the mansells of the matter and they must be prepared  she cannot have it transpire while she is in their house and in fact is excessively afraid of mr mansell and wants to tell her story by letter  now i think considering all things she has a right to take her own way  you said i was not to go without meeting her  i had assented and was devising how to march off my lunatic quietly when the feminine goodnatured heart that is in her began to relent and she looked up in my face with a smile and said the poor dears were really exemplary and if isabel should walk to the beach and should meet any one there she need know nothing about it  what says isabel  she held up her stately head and thought it would be a better return for mr mansells kindness to tell him herself before leaving beauchastel but lady conway entreated her not to be hasty and protested that her fears were of mr mansells displeasure with her for not having taken better care of hershe dreaded a break and so ontill the end of it was that though we agree that prudence would carry us off tomorrow morning yet her ladyship will look the other way if you happen to be on the southern beach at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  i suppose you were very headlong and peremptory in your note for i could not imagine isabel consenting to a secret tryste even so authorized  i never asked for any such thing  i would not for worlds see her led to do anything underhand  she will honour you  thats right jem  neither as a clergyman nor as a dynevor can i consent to trick even those who have no claim to her duty  neither as a gentleman nor as a human creature added louis in the same tone  shall i go back and give your answer  no you are walking lame enough already  no matter for that  to tell you the truth i cant stand your being with her again while i am made a fool of by that woman  if im not to see her ill be off ill send her a note we will cross to bickleypool and start by the mailtrain this very night  louis made no objection and james hurried him into the little parlour where in ten minutes the note was dashed off   my own most precious oneas thanks to my most unselfish of cousins i may dare to call youi regret my fervency and urgency for an interview since it led you to think i could purchase even such happiness by a subterfuge unworthy of my calling and an ill return of the hospitality to which we owed our first meeting  we will meet when i claim you in the face of day without the sense of stolen felicity which is a charm to commonplace minds  my glory is in the assurance that you understand my letter approve and are relieved  with such sanction and with ardour before you like mine i see that you could do no other than consent and there is not a shadow of censure in my mind but if without compromising your sense of obedience you could openly avow our engagement to mr mansell i own that i should feel that we were not drawn into a compromise of sincerity  what this costs me i will not say it will be bare existence till we meet at scarborough                                         your own j e f d   having written this and deposited it in the ebbscreek postoffice james bethought himself that his submissive cousin had thrown himself on the floor with his bag for a pillow trying to make the most of the few moments of rest before the midnight journey  seized with compunction james exclaimed there old fellow we will stay tonight  thank you he was too sleepy for more  the delay was recompensed  james was trying to persuade louis to rouse himself to be revived by breadandcheese and beer and could extort nothing but a drowsy repetition of the rhyme in old days the warcry of the grammarschool against the present headmaster       the welshman had liked to be choked by a mouse       but he pulled him out by the tail  when an alarum came in the shape of a little grinning boy from beauchastel with a note on which james had nearly laid hands as he saw the writing though the address was to the viscount fitzjocelyn  you may have it said louis  if anything were wanting the coincidence proves that you were cut out for one another  i rejoice that the moon does not stoop from her sphere   my dear cousini trust to you to prevent mr f dynevor from being hurt or disappointed and indeed i scarcely think he will though i should not avail myself of the permission for meeting him so kindly intended  i saw at once that you felt as i did and as i know he will he would not like me to have cause to blush before my kind friendsto know that i had acted a deceit nor to set an example to my sisters for which they might not understand the justification  i know that you will obtain my pardon if needed and to be assured of it would be all that would be required to complete the grateful happiness of               isabel   the boy had orders not to wait and these being seconded by fears of something that walked in ebbscreek wood after dark he was gone before an answer could be thought of  it mattered the less since isabel must receive jamess note early in the morning and so in fact she didand she was blushing over it and feeling as if she could never have borne to meet his eye but for the part she had fortunately taken when louisa tapped at her door with a message that mr mansell wished to speak with her if she were ready  she went downstairs still in a glow and her old friends first words were a compliment on her roses so pointed that she doubted for a moment whether he did not think them suspicious especially as he put his hands behind his back and paced up and down the room for some moments  he then came towards her and said in a very kind tone isabel my dear i sent for you first because i knew your own mother very well my dear and though lady conway is very kind and has always done you justicethat i will always say for heryet there are times when it may make a difference to a young woman whether she has her own mother or not  isabels heart was beating  she was certain that some discovery had been made and longed to explain but she was wise enough not to speak in haste and waited to see how the old gentleman would finally break it to her  he blundered on a little longer becoming more confused and distressed every minute and at last came to the point abruptly  in short isabel my dear what can you have done to set people saying that you have been corresponding with the young men at ebbscreek  i sent a note to my cousin fitzjocelyn last night said isabel with such calmness that the old gentleman fairly stood with his mouth open looking at her aghast  fitzjocelyn  then it is fitzjocelyn is it he exclaimed  then why could he not set about it openly and honourably  does his father object  i would not have thought it of you isabel nor of the lad neither  you need not think it dear mr mansell  there is nothing between lord fitzjocelyn and myself but the warmest friendship  isabel  isabel why are you making mysteries  i do not wish to pry into your affairs  i would have trusted you anywhere but when it comes round to me that you have been sending a private messenger to one of the young gentlemen there i dont know what to be at  i would not believe mrs mansell at first but i saw the boy and he said you had sent him yourself  my dear you may mean very rightlyi am sure you do but you must not set people talking  it is not acting rightly by me isabel but i would not care for that if it were acting rightly by yourself  and he gazed at her with a piteous perplexed expression  let me call mamma said isabel  as you will my dear but cannot you let the simple truth come out between you and your own bloodrelation without all her words to come between  cant you isabel  i am sure you and i shall understand each other  that we shall replied isabel warmly  i have given her no promise dear mr mansell i have wished all along that you should know that i am engaged with her full consent to mr frost dynevor  to the little black tutor cried mr mansell recoiling but recollecting himself  i beg your pardon my dear he may be a very good man but what becomes of all this scrambling over barricades with the young lord  isabel described the true history of her engagement and it was received with a long low whistle by no means too complimentary  and what makes him come and hide in holes and corners if this is all with your mammas good will  mamma thought you would be displeased she insisted on taking her own time for breaking it to you said isabel  was there ever a woman but must have her mystery  well i should have liked him better if he had not given into it  he never did said isabel indignant enough to disclose in full the whole arrangement made by lady conways manoeuvres and lax goodnature i knew it would never do she added though i could not say so before her and fitzjocelyn  my note was to tell them so and look here mr mansell this is what mr dynevor had already written before receiving mine  she held it out proudly and mr mansell making an unwilling sound between his teeth took it from her but as he read his countenance changed and he exclaimed ha very well  this is something like so thats it is it  you and he would not combine to cheat the old man like a pair of lovers in a trumpery novel  no indeed said isabel that would be a bad way of beginning  where is the young fellowat ebbscreek did you say  ill tell you what isabel with his hand on the bell ill have out the dogcart this minute and fetch him home to breakfast to meet my lady when she comes down stairs if it be only for the sake of showing that i like plain dealing  isabel could only blush smile look doubtful and yet so very happy and grateful that mr mansell became cautious lest his impulse should have carried him too far and after having ordered the vehicle to be prepared he caught her by the hand and detained her saying mind you miss you are not to take this for overmuch  im afraid it is a silly business and i did not want you to throw yourself away on a schoolmaster  i must see and talk to the man myself but i wont have anything thats not open and aboveboard and that my lady shall see for once in her life  im not afraid said isabel smiling  james will make his own way with you  isabel ran away to excuse and explain her confession to lady conway while mr mansell indulged in another whistle and then went to inform his wife that he was afraid the girl had been making a fool of herself but it was not lady conways fault that she was nothing worse and he was resolved whatever he did to show that honesty was the only thing that would go down with him  the boat was rocking on the green waves and louis was in the act of waving an adieu to deaf mrs hannaford when a huntsmans halloo caused james to look round and behold mr mansell standing up in his dogcart making energetic signals with his whip  he had meant to be very guarded and wait to judge of james before showing that he approved but the excitement of the chase betrayed him into a glow of cordiality and he shook hands with vehemence  thats rightjust in time  jump in and come home to breakfast so you wouldnt be a party to my ladys tricksjust like herjust as she wheedled poor conway  i will let her see how i esteem plain dealing  i dont say that i see my way through this business but well talk it over together and settle matters without my lady  james hardly knew where he was between joy and surprise  the invitation was extended to his companion but fitzjocelyn discerned that both james and mr mansell would prefer being left to themselves he had a repugnance to an immediate discussion with the one aunt and was in haste to carry the tidings to the other and besides it was becoming possible that letters might arrive from the travellers actuated by all these motives he declined the offer of hospitality and rowed across to bickleypool enlightening the captain on the state of affairs as far as he desired     chapter ii  the third time    tho this was fair and that was braw     and you the toast of all the town   i sighed and said amang them a     ye are not mary morison                             burns   mrs frost and louis were very merry over the result of lady conways stratagems and sat up indulging in bright anticipations until so late an hour that louis was compelled to relinquish his purpose of going home that night but he persisted in walking to ormersfield before breakfast that he might satisfy himself whether there were any letters  it was a brisk october morning the sportsmans gun and whistle reechoing from the hill sides where here and there appeared the dogs careering along over green turnipfields or across amber stubble the little northwold trees in dark sober tints of brown and purple hung over the grey wall tinted by hoary lichen and as louis entered the ormersfield field paths and plunged into his own ferny dell the long grass and brackens hung over the path weighed down with silvery dew and the large cavernous web of the autumnal spider was all one thick flake of wet  if he could not enter the ravine without thankfulness for his past escape neither could he forget gratitude to her who had come to his relief from hopeless agony  he quickened his pace in the earnest longing for tidings which had seized him even to heart sickness  it was the reaction of the ardour and excitement that had so long possessed him  the victory had been gainedhe had been obliged to leave james to work in his own cause and would be no longer wanted in the same manner by his cousin  the sense of loneliness and of the want of an object came strongly upon him as he walked through the prim old solitary garden and looked up at the dreary windows of the house almost reluctant to enter as long as it was without marys own serene atmosphere of sympathy and good sense her precious offices of love her clear steady eyes even in babyhood his trustworthy counsellors  was it a delusion of fancy acting on reflections in the glass that as he mounted the steps from the lawn depicted marys figure through the diningroom windows  nay the table was really laid for breakfasta female figure was actually standing over the teachest  a scene from the vicar of wakefield deluding me decided louis advancing to the third window which was open  it was mary ponsonby  mary  you herethey said you were not at home  my fatherwhere  he is not come down  he is as well as possible  we came at eleven last night  i found i was not wanted added mary with a degree of agitation that made him conclude that she had lost her father  one step he made to find the earl but too much excited to move away or to stand still he came towards her wrung her hand in a more real way than in his first bewildered surprise and exclaimed in transport o mary mary to have you back again then remembering his inference added low and gravely it makes me selfishi was not thinking of your grief  never mind said mary smiling though her eyes overflowed i must be glad to be at home again and such a welcome as this  o mary mary he cried nearly beside himself i have not known what to do without you  you will believe it now wont youoh wont you  mary would have been a wonderful person had she not instantly and utterly forgotten all her conclusions from framptons having declared him gone to beauchastel for an unlimited time but all she did was to turn away her crimson tearful face and reply your father would not wish it now  then the speculations have failed  so much the better  no no he must tell you  she was trying to withdraw her hand when lord ormersfield opened the door and in the moment of his amazed louis mary had fled  what is it oh what is it father cried louis for all greeting why can she say you would not wish it now  wish it wish what asked the earl without the intuitive perception of the meaning of the pronoun  what you have always wishedmary and mewhat is the only happiness that life can offer me  if i wished it a year ago i could only wish it the more now said the earl  but how is thisi fully believed you committed to miss conway  miss conway  miss conway burst out louis in a frenzy  because jem frost was in love with her himself he fancied every one else must be the same and now he will be married to her before christmas so thats disposed of  as to my feeling for her a particle a shred of what i do for mary it was a mere fictiona romance an impossibility  i do not understand you louis why did you not find this out before  mrs ponsonby called it my duty to test my feelings and i have tested them  that one is a beautiful poets dream  mary is a woman the only woman i can ever love  not an hour but i have felt it and now father what does she mean  she means poor girl what only her own scrupulous delicacy could regard as an objection but what renders me still more desirous to have a right to protect her  the cause of our return  how  i thought her father was dead  far worse  at valparaiso we met robson the confidential agent  i learnt from him that mr ponsonby had hardly waited for her mothers death to marry a limenian a person whom everything pointed out as unfit to associate with his daughter  even robson cautious as he was said he could not undertake to recommend miss ponsonby to continue her journey  and this was all exclaimed louis too intent on his own views for anything but relief  all  is it not enough to set her free  she acquiesced in my judgment that she could do no otherwise than return  she wrote to her father and i sent three lines to inform him that under the circumstances i fulfilled my promise to her mother by taking her home  i had nearly made her promise that should we find you about to form an establishment of your own she would consider herself as my child but  oh father how shall we make her believe you care nothing for her scruple  the wretched man  butoh where is she  it does not amount to a scruple in her case deliberately resumed the earl  i always knew what ponsonby was and nothing from him could surprise meeven such an outrage on feeling and decency besides he has effectually shut himself out of society and degraded himself beyond the power of interfering with you  for the rest mary is already in feeling so entirely my child that to have the right to call her so has always been my fondest wish  and louis the months i have spent with her have not diminished my regard  my mary she will have a happier lot than her mother  the end of the speech rewarded louis for the conflict by which he had kept himself still to listen to the beginning  lord ormersfield had pity on him and went in search of mary while he remembering former passages felt that his father might be less startling and more persuasive but began to understand what james must have suffered in committing his affairs to another  the earl found mary in what had been her mothers sittingroom striving to brace her resolution by recalling the conversation that had taken place there on a like occasion  but alas how much more the heart had now to say  how much it felt as if the only shelter or rest in the desolate world was in the light of the blue eyes whose tender sunshine had been on her for one instant  yet she began firmlyif you please would you be so kind as to let me go to aunt melicent  byandby my dear when you think fit  oh then at once and without seeing any one please  nay mary with redoubled gentleness there is one who cannot let you go without seeing him  mary you will not disappoint my poor boy again  you will let him be an amendment in my scheme  you have been always most kind to me but you cannot really like this  you forget that it has been my most ardent wish from the moment i saw you what only your mothers child could be  that was before no i ought not  yours is not a family to bring disgrace into  i cannot allow you to speak thus  i knew your trials at home when first i wished you to be my sons wife and my opinion is unchanged except by my increased wish to have the first claim to you  lord ormersfield said mary collecting herself only one thing tell me as if we were indifferent persons is this a connexion such as would do louis any harm  i trust you to answer  he paced along the room and she tried to control her trembling  he came back and spoke no mary  if he were a stranger i should give the same advice  your fathers own family is unexceptionable and those kind of things so far offfew will ever hear of them and no one will attach consequence to them  if that be your only scruple it does you infinite credit but i can entirely remove it  what might be an injury to you single would be of comparatively little importance to him  miss conway faltered mary who could never remember her when in louiss presence  a mere delusion of our own  there was nothing in it  he calls you the only woman who can make him happy as i always knew you were  he must explain all  you will come to him my dear child  mary resisted no more he led her down stairs and left her within the diningroom door  mary you will now was all louis said but she let him draw her into his arms and she rested against his breast as when he had come to comfort her in the great thunderstorm in auld langsyne  she felt herself come at length to the shelter and repose for which her heart had so long yearned in spite of her efforts and as if the world had nothing more to offer of peace or joy  oh mary how i have wanted you  you believe in me now  i am sure mamma would murmured mary  he could have poured forth a torrent of affection but the suspicion of a footstep made her start from him and the next moment she was herself glowing indeed and half crying with happiness but alarmed at her own agitation and struggling to resume her commonplace manner  theres your father not had a morsel of breakfast she exclaimed hurrying back to her teacups whose ringing betrayed her trembling hand  call him louis  must i go said louis coming to assist in a manner that threatened deluge and destruction  oh yes go  i shall be able to speak to you when you come back  he had only to go into the verandah  his father was watching at the library window and they wrung each others hand in gladness beyond utterance  mary had seated herself in the solid stately chair with the whole entrenchment of tea equipage before her  they knew it signified that she was to be unmolested they took their places and the earl carved ham and louis cut bread and mary poured out tea in the most matteroffact manner hazarding nothing beyond such questions as may i give you an egg  then curiosity began to revive louis ventured where did you land and his father made answer at liverpool yesterday and how the customhouse had detained them and he had therefore brought mary straight home instead of stopping with her at northwold at eleven oclock to disturb mrs frost  you would have found us up said louis  you were sleeping at the terrace  yes i walked here this morning  then your ankle must be pretty well was marys first contribution to the conversation  quite well for all useful purposes said louis availing himself of the implied permission to turn towards her  but louis suddenly exclaimed the earl did you not tell me something extraordinary about james frost  whom did you say he was going to marry  isabel conway  never was his love of electrifying more fully gratified  lord ormersfield was surprised into an emphatic interjection and inquiry whether they were all gone mad  not that i am aware of said louis  perhaps you have not heard that mr lester is going to retire and jem has the school  then it must be calcott and the trustees who are out of their senses  do you not consider it an excellent appointment  it might be so some years hence said the earl  i am afraid it will tie him down to a secondrate affair when he might be doing better and the choice is the last thing i should have expected from calcott  he opposed it  he wanted to bring in a very ordinary style of person from  school but jems superiority and the general esteem for my aunt carried the day  what did ramsbotham and his set do  they were better than could have been hoped they gave us their votes when they found their man could not get in  ha  as long as that fellow is against calcott he cares little whom he supports  i am sorry that calcott should be defeated even for jamess sake  how did richardson vote  he was doubtful at first but i brought him over  lord ormersfield gave a quick searching glance as he said james frost did not make use of our interest in this matter  jem never did  he and my aunt held back and were unwilling to oppose the squire  they would have given it up but for me  father i never supposed you could be averse to my doing my utmost for jem when all his prospects were at stake  i should have imagined that james was too well aware of my sentiments to allow it  what a cloud on the happy morning  louis eagerly exclaimed james is the last person to be blamed  he and my aunt were always trying to stop me but i would not listen to their scruples  i knew his happiness depended on his success and i worked for him in spite of himself  if i did wrong i can only be very sorry but i cannot readily believe that i transgressed by setting the question before people in a right light  only whose fault soever it was it was not jems  lord ormersfield had not the heart to see one error in his son on such a day as this more especially as mary peeped out behind the urn to judge of his countenance and he met her pleading eyes swimming in tears  no i find no fault he kindly said  young ardent spirits may be excused for outrunning the bounds that their elders might impose but you have not removed my amazement  james intending to marry on the grammarschoolit cannot be worth 300 pounds a year  isabel is satisfied  she never desired anything but a quiet simple useful life  your aunt catharine delighted of course  no doubt of that but what has come to lady conway  she cannot help it and makes the best of it  she gave us very little trouble  ah her own daughter is growing up said the earl significantly  isabel is very fond of northwold said mary feeling that louis was wanting her sympathy  she used to wish she could settle therewith how little consciousness  if i had to judge in such a case said lord ormersfield thoughtfully i should hesitate to risk a womans happiness with a temper such as that of james frost  oh father cried louis indignantly  i suspect said lord ormersfield smiling that of late years jamess temper has been more often displayed towards me than towards you  a certain proof how safe his wife will be returned louis  his father shook his head and looking from one to the other of the young people congratulated himself that here at least there were no perils of that description  he asked how long the attachment had existed  from the moment of first sight said louis the fine spark was lighted on the euston square platform and it was not much later with her  he filled up her beau ideal of goodness  and in effect all lady conways pursuit of you threw them together said lord ormersfield much entertained  lady conway has been their very best friend without intending it it would not have come to a crisis by this time if she had not taken me to paris  it would have been a pity if the catastrophe of the barricades had been all for nothing  lord ormersfield and mary here broke out in amazement at themselves for having hitherto been oblivious of the intelligence that had greeted them on their first arrival when frampton had informed them of lord fitzjocelyns wound and gallant conduct and his father had listened to the story like the fastening of a rivet in miss conways chains and mary with a flush of unselfish pride that isabel had been taught to value her hero  they both claimed the true and detailed account as if they had hitherto been defrauded of it and insisted on hearing what had happened to him  i dare say you know best said louis lazily  i have heard so many different accounts of late that i really am beginning to forget which is the right one and rather incline to the belief that delaford brought a rescue or two with his revolver and carried us into a fortress where my aunt had secured the windows with featherbeds  you had better make haste and tell that the true edition may be preserved said mary rallying her spirits in her eagerness  i have begun to understand why there never yet has been an authentic account of a great battle said louis  life would make me coincide with sir robert walpoles judgment on history  all i am clear about is that even a red republican is less red than he is painted that isabel conway is fit to visit the sentinels in a beleaguered castlea noble being but oh mary did i not long sorely after you when it came to the wounded knight part of the affair  i am more sure of that than of anything else  mary blushed but her tender heart was chiefly caring to know how much he had been hurt and so the whole story was unfolded by due questioning and the earl had full and secret enjoyment of the signal defeat of his dear sisterinlaw the one satisfaction on which every one seemed agreed  it was a melancholy certainty that mary must go to mrs frost but the earl deferred the moment by sending the carriage with an entreaty that she would come herself to fetch her guest  mary talked of writing a note but the autumn sun shone cheerily on the steps and louis wiled her into seating herself on the upper step while he reclined on the lower ones as they had so often been placed when this was his only way of enjoying the air  the sky was clear the air had the still calm of autumn the evergreens and the yellowfringed elms did not stir a leafonly a large heavy yellow plane leaf now and then detached itself by its own weight and silently floated downwards  mary sat without wishing to utter a word to disturb the unwonted tranquillity the rest so precious after her months of seavoyage her journey her agitations  but louis wanted her seal of approval to all his past doings and soon began on their inner and deeper story ending with tell me whether you think i was right my own dear governess  oh no you must never call me that any more  it is a name belonging to my happiest days  it was only in play  it reverses the order of things  i must look up to you  if you can said louis playfully slipping down to a lower step  a tear burst out as mary said mamma said it must never be that way then recovering she added i beg your pardon louis i was treating it as earnest  i think i am not quite myself today i will go to my room  no no dont he said i will not harass you with my gladness dearest  he stepped indoors brought out a book and when mrs frost arrived to congratulate and be congratulated she found mary still on the step gazing on without seeing the trees and flowers listening without attending to the rich soothing flow of lope de vegas beautiful devotional sonnets in majestic spanish in louiss low sweet voice     chapter iii  mists    therefore thine eye through mist of many days     shines bright and beauty like a lingering rose   sits on thy cheek and in thy laughter plays     while wintry frosts have fallen on thy foes   and like a vale that breathes the western sky   thy heart is green though summer is gone by                                       f tennyson   happy aunt kittythe centre the confidante of so much love perhaps her enjoyment was the most keen and pure of all because the most free from selfthe most devoid of those cares for the morrow which after besetting middle life often so desert old age as to render it as free and fresh as childhood  she had known the worst she had been borne through by heartwhole faith and love she had seen how often frettings for the future were vain and experienced that anticipation is worse than reality  where there was true affection and sound trust she could not would not and did not fear for those she loved  james went backwards and forwards in stormy happiness  he had come to a comfortable understanding with old mr mansell who had treated him with respect and cordiality from the first giving him to understand that isabels further expectations only amounted to a legacy of a couple of thousands on his own death and that meantime he had little or no hope of helping him in his profession  he spoke of isabels expensive habits and the danger of her finding it difficult to adapt herself to a small income and though of course he might as well have talked to the wind as to either of the lovers his remonstrance was so evidently conscientious as not to be in the least offensive and mr frost dynevor was graciously pleased to accept him as a worthy relation  all was smooth likewise with lady conway  she and mr mansell outwardly appeared utterly unconscious of each others proceedings remained on the most civil terms and committed their comments and explanations to mrs mansell who administered them according to her own goodnatured gossiping humour and sided with whichever was speaking to her  there was in lady conway much kindness and goodhumour always ready to find satisfaction in what was inevitable and willing to see all at ease and happy around hera quality which she shared with louis and which rendered her as warm and even caressing to our dear james as if he had been the most welcome suitor in the world and she often sincerely congratulated herself on the acquisition of a sensible gentleman to consult on business and so excellent a brother for walter  it was not falsehood it was real amiability and it was an infinite comfort in the courtship especially the courtship of a pendragon  as to the two young sisters their ecstasy was beyond description only alloyed by the grief of losing isabel and this greatly mitigated by schemes of visits to northwold  the marriage was fixed for the end of november so as to give time for a little tranquillity before the commencement of jamess new duties as soon as this intelligence arrived mrs frost removed herself mary and her goods into the house beautiful that no 5 might undergo the renovations which poor thing had been planned twenty years since when poor henrys increasing family and growing difficulties had decided her that she could do without them one year more  even should miss conway not like to keep house with the old woman said she by way of persuading herself she had no such expectation it was her duty to keep the place in repair  that question was soon at rest isabel would be but too happy to be allowed to share her home and truly james would hardly have attached himself to a woman who could not regard it as a privilege to be with the noble old lady  clara was likewise to be taken home isabel undertook to complete her education and school and tuition were both to be removed from the contemplation of the happy girl whose letters had become an unintelligible rhapsody of joy and affection  isabel had three thousand pounds of her own which with that valuable freehold dynevor terrace james resolved should be settled on herself speaking of it with such solemn importance as to provoke the gravity of those accustomed to deal with larger sums  with the interest of her fortune he meant to insure his life that as he told louis with gratified prudence there might be no repetition of his own case and his family might never be a burden on any one  the income of the school with their former wellhusbanded means was affluence for the style to which he aspired and his grandmother though her menus plaisirs had once doubled her present revenue regarded it as the same magnificent advance and was ready to launch into the extravagance of an additional servant and of fitting up the longdisused drawingroom and the diningparlour hitherto called the schoolroom and kicked and hacked by thirty years of boys  she and clara would betake themselves to their present little sittingroom and make the drawingroom pleasant and beautiful for the bride  and in what a world of upholstery did not the dear old lady spend the autumn months  how surpassingly happy was jane and how communicative about cheveleigh and how pleased and delighted in little charlottes promotion  and charlotte  she ought to have been happy with her higher wages and emancipation from the more unpleasant work with the expectation of one whom she admired so enthusiastically as miss conway and above all with the long openhearted affectionate letter which miss ponsonby had put into her hand with so kind a smile  somehow it made her do nothing but cry she felt unwilling to sit down and answer it and as if it were out of perverseness when she was in mrs marthas very house and when there was so much to be done she took the most violent fit of novelreading that had ever been known and when engaged in working or cleaning alone chanted dismal ballads of the type of alonzo the brave and the fair imogens till mrs martha declared that she was just as bad as an old dumbledore and not worth half so much  one day however miss ponsonby called her into her room to tell her that a parcel was going to lima in case she wished to send anything by it  miss ponsonby spoke so kindly and yet so delicately and charlotte blushed and faltered and felt that she must write now  i have been wishing to tell you charlotte added mary kindly how much we like mr madison  there were some very undesirable people among the passengers who might easily have led him astray but the captain and mate both spoke to lord ormersfield in the highest terms of his behaviour  he never missed attending prayers on the sundays and from all i could see i do fully believe that he is a sincerely good religions man and if he keeps on as he has begun i think you are very happy in belonging to him  charlotte only curtsied and thanked but it was wonderful how those kind sympathizing words blew off at once the whole mists of nonsense and fancy  tom was the sound good religious man to whom her heart and her troth were given the other was no such thing a mere flatterer and she had known it all along  she would never think of him again and she was sure he would not think of her  truth had dispelled all the fancied sense of hypocrisy and doubledealing she sat down and wrote to tom as if delaford had never existed and forthwith returned to be herself again at least for the present  poor mary she might speak cheerfully but her despatches were made up with a trembling heart  louis and mary missed the security and felicity that seemed so perfect with james and isabel  in the first place nothing could be fixed without further letters although the earl had tried to persuade mary that her father had virtually forfeited all claim to her obedience and that she ought to proceed as if in fact an orphan and secure herself from being harassed by him by hastening her marriage  of this she would not hear and she was exceedingly grateful to louis for abstaining from pressing her as well as for writing to mr ponsonby in terms against which no exception could be taken  till secure of his consent she would not consider her engagement as more than conditional nor consent to its being mentioned to any one if isabel knew it that was jamess fault   even the faithfull sisters were kept in ignorance and she trusted thus to diminish the wrong that she felt her secrecy to be doing to aunt melicent who was so much vexed and annoyed at her return that she dreaded exceedingly the effect of the knowledge of her engagement  miss ponsonby was convinced that the news had been exaggerated and insisted that but for lord ormersfields dislike it would have been further sifted and she wrote to mary to urge her coming to her to await the full tidings instead of delaying among her fathers avowed enemies  mary settled this point by mentioning her promise to mrs frost to remain with her until her grandchildren should be with her and miss ponsonbys correspondence ceased after a dry though still kind letter which did not make mary more willing to bestow her confidence but left her feeling in her honest heart as if she were dealing insincerely by aunt melicent  the discretion and reserve rendered requisite by the concealment were such as to be very tormenting even to so gentle a temper as that of louis since they took from him all the privileges openly granted to the cousin and scarcely left him those of the friend  she on whose arm he had leant all last summer would not now walk with him without an escort and even with mrs frost beside her shrank from ormersfield like forbidden ground  her lively frank tone of playful command had passed away nay she almost shrank from his confidence withheld her counsel and discouraged his constant visits  he could not win from her one of her broad fearless comments on his past doings and in his present business the taking possession of inglewood the choice of stock and the appointment of a bailiff though she listened and sympathized and answered questions she volunteered no opinions ahe expressed no wishes she would not come to see  poor louis was often mortified into doubts of his own ability to interest or make her happy but he was very patient  if disappointed one day he was equally eager the next he submitted obediently to her restrictions and was remorseful when he forgot or transgressed and they had real soothing comforting talks just often enough to be tantalizing and yet to convince him that all the other unsatisfactory meetings and partings were either his own fault or that of some untoward circumstance  he saw as did the rest that marys spirits had received a shock not easily to be recovered  the loss of her mother was weighing on her more painfully than in the first excitement and the step her father had taken insulting her mother degrading himself and rending away her veil of filial honour had exceedingly overwhelmed and depressed her while sorrow hung upon her with the greater permanence and oppression from her strong selfcontrol and dislike to manifestation  all this he well understood and reverent to her feeling he laid aside all trifling and waited on her mood with the tenderest watchfulness  when she could bear it they would dwell together on the precious recollections of her mother and sometimes she could even speak of her father and relate instances of his affection for herself and all his other redeeming traits of character most thankful to louis for accepting him on her word and never uttering one word of him which she could wish unsaid  what louis did not see was that the very force of her own affection was what alarmed mary and caused her reserve  to a mind used to balance and regulation any sensation so mighty and engrossing appeared wrong and repressed as her attachment had been it was the more absorbing now that he was all that was left to her  admiration honour gratitude old childish affection and caressing eldersisterly protection all flowed in one deep strong current but the very depth made her diffident  she could imagine the whole reciprocated and she feared to be importunate  if the day was no better than a weary turmoil save when his voice was in her ear his eyes wistfully bent on her the more carefully did she restrain all expression of hope of seeing him tomorrow lest she should be exacting and detain him from projects of his own  if it was pride and delight to her to watch his graceful agile figure spring on horseback she would keep herself from the window lest he should feel oppressed by her pursuing him and when she found her advice sought after as his law she did not venture to proffer it  she was uncomfortable in finding the rule committed to her and all the more because lord ormersfield who had learnt to talk to her so openly that she sometimes thought he confounded her with her mother used in all his schemes to appear to take it for granted that she should share with him in the managing consulting headship of the house leaving louis as something to be cared for and petted like a child without a voice in their decisions  these conversations used to make her almost jealous on louiss account and painfully recall some of her mothers apprehensions  that was the real secret source of all her discomfortnamely the misgiving lest she had been too ready to follow the dictates of her own heart  would her mother have been satisfied  had not her fondness and her desolation prevailed where for louiss own sake she should have held back  every time she felt herself the elder in heart every time she feared to have disappointed him every time she saw that his liveliness was repressed by her mournfulness she feared that she was letting him sacrifice himself  and still more did she question her conduct towards her father  she had only gradually become aware of the extent of the mutual aversion between him and the earl and miss ponsonbys reproaches awakened her to the fear that she had too lightly given credence to hostile evidence  her affection would fain have justified him and forgetting the difficulties of personal investigation in such a case she blamed herself for having omitted herself to question the confidential clerk and having left all to lord ormersfield who cool and wary as he ordinarily was would be less likely to palliate mr ponsonbys errors than those of any other person  her heart grew sick as she counted the weeks ere she could hear from lima  none of her troubles were allowed to interfere with mrs frosts peace outwardly she was cheerful and helpful equable though less lively those carpets and curtains tables and chairs which were the grand topics at the house beautiful were neither neglected nor treated with resigned impatience  marys taste counsel and needle did good service her hearty interest and consideration were given to the oftenturned volume of designs for bedsteads sofas and windowcurtains and miss mercy herself had hardly so many resources for making old furniture new  many of her happiest halfhours with louis were spent as she sewed the stiff slippery chintz and he held the curtain rings while aunt catharine went to inspect the workmen and many a time were her cares forgotten and her active spirits resumed while louis acted carpenter under her directions and rectified errors of the workmen  it might not be poetical but the french skyblue paper covered with silvery fernleaves that louis took such pains to procure and the china doorhandles that he brought over in his pockets and the great map which mary pasted over the obstinate spot of damp in the vestibule were the occasions of the greatest blitheness and merriment that they shared together  much did they enjoy the prediction that james would not know his own house greatly did they delight in sowing surprises and in obtaining aunt catharines neverfailing start of wellpleased astonishment  each wedding present was an eventmr mansells piano which disconcerted all previous designs lord ormersfields handsome plate and many a minor gift from old scholars delighted to find an occasion when an offering would not be an offence  even mr calcott gave a valuable inkstand in which mrs frost and louis beheld something of forgiveness  isabel had expressed a wish that mary should be one of her bridesmaids a wedding was not the scene which poor mary wished to witness at present but she saw louis bent on having her with him and would not vex him by reluctance  he had also prevailed on his father to be present though the earl was much afraid of establishing a precedent and being asked to act the part of father on future contingencies there was only one bride as he told louis whom he could ever wish to give away  however that trouble was spared him by mr mansell but still louis would not let him off on the plea that jamess side of the house should make as imposing a demonstration as possible  mrs frost was less manageable  though warmly invited by the conways and fondly entreated by her grandson she shook her head and said she was past those things and that the old mother always stayed at home to cook the wedding dinner  she should hear all when clara came home the next day and should be ready for the happy pair when they would return for christmas after a brief stay at thornton conway which isabel wished james to see that he might share in all her old associations  all the rest of the party journeyed to london on a november day and in gaslight and gloom they deposited mary at her aunts house in bryanston square  gaslight was the staple of hymens torch the next morning  london was under one of the fogs of which it is popularly said you may cut them with a knife  the church was in dim twilight the bride and bridegroom loomed through the haze and the indistinctness made claras fine tall figure appear quite majestic above the heads of the other bridesmaids  the breakfast was by lamplight and the mist looked lurid and grim over the white cake and no one talked of anything but the comparative density of fogs and mr mansells asthma had come on and his speech was devolved upon lord ormersfield to whom louis had imprudently promised exemption  what was worse lady conway had paired them off in the order of precedence and louis was a victim to two dowagers between whom he could neither see nor speak to mary  he was the more concerned because he had thought her looking depressed and avoiding his eye  he tried to believe this caution but he thought she was also eluding his father and her whole air gave him a vague uneasiness  the whole party were to dine with lady conway and trusting in the meantime to discover what was on her spirits he tried to resign himself to the order of the day without a farther glimpse of her  when the married pair took leave walter gave his sister a great hug but had no perception of his office of handing her downstairs and it was fitzjocelyn who gave her his arm and put her into the carriage with an augury that the weather would be beautiful when once they had left the fog in london  she smiled dreamily and repeated beautiful as though all were so beautiful already to her that she did not so much as perceive the fog  james pressed his hand saying i am glad you are to be the one to be happy next  you do not look so said clara earnestly  the two sisters had come partly downstairs but their london habits had restrained them from following to the streetdoor as clara had done and now they had rushed up again while clara with one foot on the staircase looked in her cousins face as he tried to smile in answer and repeated louis i hoped you were quite happy  i am said louis quickly  then why do you look so grave and uneasy  louis said an entreating voice above and there stood marypray say nothing but call a cab for me please  no i am not illindeed i am notbut i cannot stay  you look ill  it has been too much for you  clara take herlet her lie down quietly cried louis springing to her side  oh no thank youno said mary decidedly though very low i told lady conway that i could not stay  i settled it with aunt melicent  that aunt of yours  hush  no it is for my own sakemy own doing  i cannot bear it any longer  please let me go  then i will take you  i saw the brougham waiting  we will go quietly together  no that must not be  i was thoughtless in urging you to come  the turmoil has been too much  my poor mary  that is what comes of doing what i like instead of what you like  why dont you always have your own way  let me come nay if you will not at least let clara go with you and come back  mary roused herself at last to speak as she moved downstairsyou need not think of me there is nothing the matter with me  i promised aunt melicent to come home  she is very kindit is not that  you must not tell me not to think  i shall come to inquire  i shall be with you the first thing tomorrow  yes you must come tomorrow said mary in a tone he could not interpret and a tight lingering grasp on his hand as he put her into his fathers carriage  he stood hesitating for a moment as it drove off then instead of entering the house walked off quickly in the same direction  clara had stood all the time like a statue on the stairs waiting to see if she were wanted and gazing intently with her fingers clasped when both were gone she drew a long breath and nodded with her head whispering to herself in a grave and critical voicethat is love  she did not see fitzjocelyn again till nearly dinnertime and as he caught her anxious interrogating eye he came to her and said very low i was not let in miss ponsonby was engaged  miss mary lying downi believe they never told her i was there  it is all that aunthorrid woman  dont talk of it now  i will see her tomorrow  clara grieved for him whenever she saw him called on to exert himself to talk and she even guarded him from the sallies of his young cousins  once when much music and talk was going on he came and sat by her and made her tell him how fondly and affectionately she had parted with her schoolfellows and how some of her old foes had become as she hoped friends for life but she saw his eye fixed and absent even while she spoke and she left off suddenly  go on he said i like to hear and with a manifest effort he bent his mind to attend  oh thought clara as she went up that nightwhy will the days one most expects to be happy turn out so much otherwise  however he will manage to tell me all about it when he and his father take me home tomorrow     chapter iv  outward bound    the voice which i did more esteem     than music in her sweetest key   those eyes which unto me did seem     more comfortable than the day   those now by me as they have been   shall never more be heard or seen                               george wither   in suspense and impatience fitzjocelyn awaited the end of his fathers breakfast that he might hasten to learn what ailed mary the post came in vexing him at first merely as an additional delay but presently a sound of dissatisfaction attracted his notice to the foreign air of two envelopes which had been forwarded from home  hem said the earl gravely i am afraid this fellow ponsonby will give us some trouble  then mary had heard from him cried louis  she was keeping it from me not to spoil the day  i must go to her this momentbut pausing again what is it  he cannot have had my letter  no but he seems to have anticipated it  puffed up as they are about these speculations he imagines me to have brought mary home for no purpose but to repair our fortunes and informs me that in the event of your marriage she will receive not a farthing beyond her mothers settlements  i am much obliged  it is all i ever thought you would receive and but for me it would have been in the bottom of some mine long ago  do you wish to see what he says  louis caught up the missive  it was the letter of a very angry man too violent to retain the cold formality which he tried to assume he was beholden to his lordship for his solicitude about his daughter  it was of a piece with other assistance formerly rendered to him in his domestic arrangements for which he was equally obliged  he was happy to inform his lordship that in this instance his precautions had been uncalled for and referred him to a letter which he would receive from mr dynevor by the same mail for an explanation of the circumstances to which he referred  he had been informed by undoubted authority that lord fitzjocelyn had done his daughter the honour of soliciting her hand  it might console his lordship to learn that should the union take place the whole of his property would be secured to mrs ponsonby and his daughters sole fortune would be that which she inherited by her mothers marriage settlements  possibly this intelligence might lead to a cessation of these flattering attentions  mrs ponsonby he can mention her in the same sentence with marys mother said the earl  louis turned pale as he read and scarcely breathed as he looked up at his father dreading that he might so resent the studied affronts as to wish to break off the connexion and that he might have him likewise to contend with but on that score he was set at rest  the earl replied to his exclamation of angry dismay it is little more than i looked for  it is not the first letter i have had from him i find he has some just cause for offence  the marriage is less disgraceful than i had been led to believe  here is oliver dynevors testimony  oliver dynevors was a succinct businesslike letter certifying his cousin that he had been mistaken in his view of the marriage  dona rosita de guzman was an orphan of a very respectable family who had come to spend the year before her intended noviciate at the house of an uncle  she was very young and mr dynevor believed that the marriage had been hastened by her relations making her feel herself unwelcome and her own reluctance to return to her convent and that she might not be aware how very recently mr ponsonby had become a widower  for his own part he was little used to ladies society and could form no judgment of the bride but he could assure lord ormersfield that she had been guilty of no impropriety she was visited by every one and that there was no reason against mary ponsonby associating with her  what could the clerk be thinking of exclaimed louis  my first impression was not taken from the clerk  what i heard first and in the strongest terms was from the captain of a ship at valparaiso  in fact it was in the mouth of all who had known the family  robson neither confirmed nor contradicted and gave me the notion of withholding much from regard for his employer  he lamented the precipitation but seemed willing to make excuses  he distinctly said he would not take it on himself to recommend miss ponsonbys continuing her journey  he was right  if i had known all this i should still have brought her home  i must write an apology as far as her character is concerned but be that as it may the marriage is atrociousan insulta  disgrace  he could not have waited six weeks  but i must go to mary cried louis as though reproaching himself for the delay  oh that she should have forced herself to that wedding and spared me  i am coming with you said the earl  she will require my personal assurance that all this makes no difference to me  i am more afraid of the difference it may make to her said louis you have never believed how fond she is of her father  on arriving they were ushered into the room where miss ponsonby was at breakfast and a cup of tea and untasted roll showed where her niece had been  she received them with stiff upright chillness and to their hope that mary was not unwell repliednot very well  she had been overfatigued yesterday and had followed her advice in going to lie down  louis began to imagine a determination to exclude him and was eagerly beginning to say that she had asked him to come that morningcould she not see him when the lady continued with the same severityuntil yesterday i was not aware how much concern lord fitzjocelyn had taken in what related to my niece  at that moment when louiss face was crimson with confusion and impatience the door was softly pushed ajar and he heard himself called in low hoarse tones  miss ponsonby was rising with an air of vexed surprise but he never saw her and hastily crossing the room he shut the door behind him and followed the form that flitted up the stairs so fast that he did not come up with her till she had entered the drawingroom and stood leaning against a chair to gather breath she was very pale and her eyes looked as if she had cried all night but she controlled her voice to say i could not bear that you should hear it from aunt melicent  we had letters this morning dearest  always thinking for me  but i must think for you  you can hardly stand  he would have supported her to the sofa but she shrank from him and leaning more heavily on the chair saiddo you not know louis all that must be at an end  i know no such thing  my father is here on purpose to assure you that it makes not the slightest difference to him  yours  yes  but oh louis with a voice that in its faintness and steadiness had a sound of anguishonly think what i allowed him to make me do  to insult my father and his choice  it was a mistake i know she continued fearing to be unjust and to grieve louis but a most dreadful one  he says he should have brought you home all the same began louis mary you must sit down he cried interrupting himself to come nearer and she obeyed sinking into the chair  what a state you are in  how could you go through yesterday  how could you be distressed and not let me know  i could not spoil their weddingday that we had wished for so long  then you had the letter  in the morning  oh that i had examined farther  oh that i had never come home  mary i cannot hear you say so  you would have been spared all this  you were doing very well without meas you will  he cried out with deprecating horror  louis she said imploringly  oh louis do not make it harder for me to do right  whywhat  i dont understand  your father has not so much as heard how we stand together  he cannot be desiring you to give me up  hehe forbids me to enter on anything of the sort with you  i dont know what made him think it possible but he does  and again mary waited for the power of utterance he orders me to come out with mrs willis in the valdivia and it sails on the 12th of december  but mary mary you cannot be bound by this  it is only fair towards him towards all of us to give him time to answer our letters  mary shook her head  the only condition he says on which he could allow me to remain would be if i were engaged to james frost  too late for that certainly said louis and the smile was a relief to both  at any rate it shows that he can spare you  only give him time  when he has my fathers explanationand my father is certain to be so concerned at having cast any imputation on a lady his first thought was to apologize  that is not all  i remember now that dear mamma always said she did not know whether he would consent  oh how weak i was ever to listen  no mary that must not be said  it was my presumptuous inveterate folly that prevented you from trusting my affection when she might have helped us  i dont know  it would have caused her anxiety and distress when she was in no state for them  i dont think it did said mary considering i dont think she ever knew how much i cared  the admission could only do louiss heart good and he recurred to his arguments that her father could be persuaded by such a letter as he felt it in him to write  you do not know all said mary  i could not show you his letter but from it and from my aunt i better understand what impressions he has of you all and how hopeless it is  tell me  she could not help giving herself the relief when that most loving sympathizing face was pleading with her to let him comfort her  she knew there was no fiery nor rancorous temper to take umbrage and it was best for him to know the completeness of the deathblow  oh louis he fancies that my dear mothers fondness for her own family destroyed his domestic peace  he says their pride and narrow notions poisonedyes that is the wordpoisoned her mind against him and that was the reason he insisted on my being brought up here and kept from you all  but i dont understand why he let you come straight home to us and live in dynevor terrace  then he was really sorry mamma was so ill andand for all that was past i am sure he felt it was the last parting and only wished to do anything that could make up to her  he freely gave her leave to go wherever she pleased and said not a word against northwold  it was one of her great comforts that he never seemed in the least vexed at anything she had done since we went home  besides my aunt says that he and mr dynevor had some plans about james and me  he will have that out of his head  he will come to reason  fond of you and sorry for the past he will listen  no wonder he was in a passion but just imagine what it would be to heed half jem frost says when he is well worked up  papa is not like james said mary things go deeper with him  he never forgets  i shall never forgive myself for not having spoken to robson  i know his manner seeming to assent and never committing himself and i ought to have gone through anything rather than have taken such an accusation for granted  to hinder his pleading against her selfconviction she reopened her letter to prove the cruelty of the injustice  mr ponsonby professed to have been unwilling to enter so speedily on the new tie but to have been compelled by the species of persecution which was exercised on rosita in order to make her return to her nunnery  he dwelt on her timid affection and simplicity and her exceeding mortification at the slur which mary had been induced to cast upon her though he said her innocent mind could not comprehend the full extent of the injury since the step his daughter had taken would when known seriously affect the ladys reception into society in a manner only to be repaired by marys immediately joining them at lima  he peremptorily indicated the ship and the escorta merchants wife well known to her and charged her on her duty as the only proof of obedience or affection which could remedy the past to allow no influence nor consideration whatever to detain her  you see said mary  i see was the answer  mary you are right you must go  the words restored her confiding look and her face lost almost all the restless wretchedness which had so transformed it  thank you she said with a long breath i knew you would see it so  it will be a very pretty new style of wedding tour  andes for alps no mary you need not suspect me of trifling now  i really mean it and seriously our going in that way would set this rosita straight with society much more handsomely and effectually  dont doubt my fatheri will fetch him  stop louis  you forget  did i not tell you that he expressly warns me against you  he must have heard of what happened before he says i had prudence once to withstand and he trusts to my spirit and discretion to mary stopped short of the phrase before her eyesto resist the interested solicitations of necessitous nobility and the allurements of a beggarly coronet  no she concluded he says that you are the last person whom he could think of allowing me to accept she hid her face in her hands and her voice died away  happily that is done said louis not yet disconcerted but if you go as i own you must it shall be with a letter of mine explaining all  you will plead for mei think you will and when he is satisfied that we are no rebels then the first ship that sails for perusay that will do mary  no louis i know my father  she roused herself and sat upright speaking resolutely but not daring to look at himi made up my mind last night  it was weak and selfish in me to enter into this engagement and it must be broken off  you must be left freenot bound for years and years  oh mary  mary this is too much  i deserved distrust by my wretched folly and fickleness last year but i did not know what you were to me thenmy most precious one  can you not trust me  do you not know how i would wait  you would wait said poor mary striving with choking tears and be sorry you had waited  are you talking madness mary  i should live for the moment to compensate for all  you would waste your best years and when the time came you would still be young and i grown into an old careworn woman  you would find you had waited for what was nothing worth  how can you talk so cried louis wounded when you know that to cherish and make up to you would be my dearest fondest wish  no dont shake your head  you know it is not a young rose and lily beauty that i loveit is the honest earnest glance in my marys eyes the rest and trust and peace whenever i do but come near her  time cant take that away  pray said mary feebly dont let us discuss it now  i know it is right  i was determined to say it today that the worst might be over but i cant argue nor bear your kindness now  please let it wait  yes let it wait  it is depression  you will see it in a true light when you have recovered the shock and dont fancy all must be given up together  lie down and rest i am sure you have been awake all night  i may rest now i have told you and seen you not angry with poor papa nor with me  oh louisthe gratitude to you the weight off my mind  i dont think any one could help taking the same view said louis it seems to me one of the cases where the immediate duty is the more clear because it is so very painful  mary i think that you are committing your way unto the lord and you know he shall bring it to pass  as he spoke there was a tap at the door and miss ponsonby stiffly entering said excuse my interruption but i hope lord fitzjocelyn will be considerate enough not to harass you any longer with solicitations to act against your conscience  he is not persuading me said mary turning towards her aunt a face which through all her dejection proved her peace in his support and approval he is helping me  yes said louis to the astonished aunt since i have heard the true state of the case i have been convinced that there is no choice for her but to go out to repair the injustice so unfortunately done to this poor lady  it is a noble resolution and i perfectly concur with her  i am glad you think so properly sir returned miss ponsonby lord ormersfield seems quite of another opinion  he was desirous of seeing you mary but i have been telling him i could permit no more interviews today  oh no said mary putting her hand to her head as if it could bear no more not today   louis tell him how it is  make him forgive me but do not let me see him yet  you shall see no one said louis tenderly you shall rest there and as if he had the sole right to her he arranged the cushions placed her on the sofa and hung over her to chafe her hands and bathe her forehead with eau de cologne while as he detected signs of hasty preparations about the room he added dont trouble yourself with your arrangements i will see about all i can to help you  only rest and cure your head  say that one thing to me again whispered mary ere letting his hand go  again he murmured the words commit thy way unto the lord and he shall bring it to pass  then mary felt her hand pressed to his lips but she would not unclose her burning eyes she would fain sleep beneath the impress of that spell of patient confidence  the gentle authority of his manner had deprived miss ponsonby of all notion of interfering  this odious frivolous young man of fashion so entirely disconcerted her ideas of ardent lovers or of selfinterested puppies that she gazed at him surprised and softened and when he looked at her anxiously to judge whether mary would find in her a kind comforter her eyes were full of tears and she said as they left the room it must be a great relief to my poor mary that you see it so sensibly  she has been suffering much in anticipation of this meeting  her unselfishness goes to ones heart said louis almost overcome if she would but have spared herself yesterday  ah she said she could not bear that you should be pained on your friends weddingday  i am much comforted to find that you appreciate the effort  this was not what miss ponsonby had intended to say but there was something about the young man that touched her exceedingly even when fresh from a very civil and decorous combat with his father and a rippingup of all the ancient grievances of the married life of their two relations rendering wider than ever the breach between the houses of ponsonby and fitzjocelyn  lord ormersfield came forward to learn whether he might see mary and was met by assurances that she must be kept as quiet as possible upon which he took leave making a stately bend of the head while louis shook miss ponsonbys hand and said he should come to the door to inquire before the day was over  i never saw her so broken down he said in answer to his fathers compassionate but indignant exclamation as they walked home yesterday was a terrible strain on her  i wish we had never brought her here said lord ormersfield  the aunt is your enemy as she always was that of marys mother  she nearly avowed that she set her brother on making this premature prohibition  i do not think she is unkind to mary said louis i could be almost glad that the dear aunt kitty is spared all this worry  it would make her so very miserable  her influence would be in your favour whereas this woman is perfectly unreasonable  she justifies her brother in everything and is actually working on that poor girls scruples of conscience to send her out by this ship  nay said louis after hearing her fathers letter i do not see that it is possible for her to do otherwise  lord ormersfield hastily turned to look at his sons countenanceit was flushed and melancholy but fully in earnest nevertheless the earl would not believe his ears and made a sound as if he had missed the words  i am grieved enough to say so repeated louis but as he puts it i do not see how mary can refuse to obey him  i declare fitzjocelyn exclaimed his father with some anger any one who takes the trouble may talk you into anything imaginable  not into believing her wrong  i did not think you so weak continued his father  it is the very case where a womans exaggerated notions of right may be wrought on to do her infinite harm  they become quite ridiculous without some one to show that such things may be carried too far  i must say i did expect strength of mind and common sense for your own interest i esteem it a mere matter of duty to put an end to such nonsense  my dear father said louis it was mary and her mother who first taught me my own obligations  i should never dare to interfere with any ones filial dutyabove all where my own happiness is so deeply concerned  yours  i am not talking of yours  what is to become of mary with such a man as that and this spanish woman who if she does not deserve all that has been said of her no doubt soon willno education no principles breaking out of her convent  and you let yourself be drawn into calling it marys duty to run into such company as that  you are not fit to protect her  from all i have heard of mr ponsonby i am convinced he has too much regard for his daughter to summon her into any improper society i do not hear that he has been to blame as a father  i wish i could see it as you do but not only do i know that mary could not have an instants peace under the sense of his displeasure but it seems to me that this is one of the express commands which could not be disobeyed without setting aside the law of heaven  if i gave my voice against it i should fear to bring on us a curse and not a blessing  fitzjocelyn i always knew how it would be if you took to being one of those very good people  nothing is so weak and yet so unmanageable any rational being would look on it as a duty to rescue her from such a man as that but that is too ordinary a virtue for you  you must go higher  louis made no answer  never had his father pained him so much and he could ill brook additional suffering  however said the earl recovering i shall see her  i shall put the matter in a just light  she is a sensible girl and will understand me when she has recovered the shock  on one head i shall give warning  she must choose between us and her father  if she persist in going out to join this establishment i will have your engagement given up  father father you would not be so cruel  i know what i am saying  am i to allow you to be encumbered all the time she is on the other side of the world waiting ponsonbys pleasure to come home at last in ten or fifteen years time worried and fretted to death like her poor mother  no louis it must be now or never  you are only saying what i would not hear from her  she has been insisting on breaking off and all my hope was in you  she has  that is like her  the only reasonable thing i have heard yet  then you will not help me  you who i thought loved her like your own daughter and wished for nothing so much  so i might but that is a different thing from allowing you to wear out your life in a hopeless engagement  if she cast off her family nothing could be better otherwise i would never connect you with them  it did not occur to his lordship that he was straining pretty hard the filial duty of his own son while he was arguing that mary should snap asunder the same towards her father  the fresh discomfiture made poor louis feel utterly dejected and almost hopeless but lest silence should seem to consent he said when you see mary you will be willing for me to do anything rather than lose what is so dear and so noble  yes i will see mary  we will settle it between us and have it right yet but we must give her today to think it over and get over the first shock  when she has had a little time for reflection a few cool arguments from me will bring her to reason  so it was all to be settled over louiss passive head and thus satisfied his father who was exceedingly sorry for him forgot his anger and offered to go home alone as claras escort promising to return on the monday to bring the full force of his remonstrances to bear down marys scruples  lord ormersfield believed clara too much of a child to have any ideas on what was passing and had it depended on him she must have gone home in an agony of ignorance on the cause of her cousins trouble but louis came with them to the station and contrived to say to her while walking up and down the platform her father is bitter against me  he has sent for her and she is going  clara looked mutely in his face with a sort of inquiring dismay  youll hear all about it when my father has told aunt kitty said louis  clarahe paused and spoke lowertell her i see what is right now tell her toto pray for me that i may not be talked into tampering with my conscience or with hers  dont let it dwell on you or on my aunt he added cheerfully  no it wont you will be thinking of jem and isabel  and as his father came up his last words were in his own bright tone tell granny from me that giraffes ought always to be seen by gaslight  claras countenance returned him a look of sorrowful reproach for thinking her capable of being amused when he was in distress and she sat in silent musings all the way homepondering over his words speculating on his future wondering what mary felt and becoming blunt and almost angry when her grave escort in the opposite corner consulted civility by addressing some indifferent remark to her as if she said to herself she were no better than a stuffed giraffe and knew and cared nothing about anybody  he might have guessed that she understood something by the sudden way in which she curtailed her grandmothers rapturous and affectionate inquiries about the wedding ran upstairs on the plea of taking off her bonnet and appeared no more till he had gone home when coming down she found granny with tearful eyes lamenting that mr ponsonby was so harsh and unkind and fully possessed with the rational view which her nephew had been impressing on her  ha said clara that is what louis meant  ill tell you what granny lord ormersfield never knew in his life what was right half as well as louis does  i wish he would let him alone  if mary is good enough for him she will go out and wait till her father comes round if she is not she wont and lord ormersfield has no business to tease her  then you would like her to go out said mrs frost  i like anything that makes louis happy  i thought it would have been delightful to have him marriedone could be so much more at ormersfield and mary would be so nice but as to their being overpersuaded and thinking themselves half wrong why they would never be happy in their lives and louis would be always halfasleep or half mad to save himself the trouble of thinking  but hell never do it  on the saturday morning marys healthy and vigorous spirit had quite resumed its tone  the worst was over when she had inflicted the stroke on louis and seen him ready to support instead of adding to her distress  he found her pale and sorrowful but calm collected and ready for exertion  by tacit consent they avoided all discussion of the terms on which they were to stand  greatly touched by her consideration for him on the weddingday he would not torture her with pleadings and was only too grateful for every service that he was allowed to render her without protest as still her chief and most natural dependence  she did not scruple to allow him to assist her she understood the gratification to him and it was only too sweet to her to be still his object  she could trust him not to presume his approval made her almost happy and yet it was hard that his very patience and acquiescence should endear him so much as to render the parting so much the more painful  the day was spent in business  he facilitated much that would have been arduous for two solitary women and did little all day but go about for mary fulfilling the commissions which her father had sent home and though he did it with a sore heart it was still a privilege to be at work for mary  rigid as miss ponsonby was she began to be touched  there was a doubt as to his admission when he came on sunday morningmistress saw no one on sunday but when his name was carried in miss ponsonby could not withstand marys face  she took care to tell him her rule but that considering the circumstances she had made an exception in his favour on the understanding that nothing was to break in upon the observance of the sabbath  louis bent his head with the heartfelt answer that he was but too glad to be permitted to go to church once more with mary  aunt melicents sunday was not quite their own sunday but all that they could desire was to be quietly together and restricted from all those agitating topics and arrangements  it was a day of rest and they valued it accordingly  in fact miss ponsonby found the young lord so good and inoffensive that she broke her mornings resolution invited him to partake of the cold dinner let him go to church with them again in the evening and remain to tea and when he took leave she expressed such surprised admiration at his having come and gone on his own feet his churchgoing and his conduct generally that mary could not help suspecting that her good aunt had supposed that he had never heard of the fourth commandment  miss ponsonby was one of the many good women given to hard judgments on slight grounds and to sudden reactions still more violent and the sight of lord fitzjocelyn spending a quiet respectable sunday had such an effect on her that she transgressed her own mandate and broached the distressing subject  mary my dear i suppose this young gentleman is an improved character  he is always improving said mary  i mean that an important change must have taken place since i understood you to say you had refused him  i thought you acted most properly then and as i see him now i think you equally right in accepting him  he was very much what he is now said mary  then it was from no doubt of his being a serious character  none whatever said mary emphatically  well my dear i must confess his appearance his family and your refusal misled me  i fear i did him great injustice  a silence and then miss ponsonby said after all my dear though i thought quite otherwise at first i do believe that considering what the youth is and how much attached he seems you might safely continue the engagement  marys heart glowed to her aunt for having been thus conquered by louisshe who three nights back had been so severely incredulous so deeply disappointed in her niece for having been deluded into endurance of him  but her resolution was fixed  it would not be right she said his father would not allow it  there is so little chance of papas relenting or of my coming home that it would be wrong to keep him in suspense  he had better turn his thoughts elsewhere while he is young enough to begin again  it might save him from marrying some mere fine lady  that will never be whatever woman he chooses will she could not go on but presently cleared her voiceno i should like to leave him quite free  i was less his choice than his fathers and though i thought we should have been very happy it does not seem to be the leading of heaven  i am so far his inferior in cleverness and everything attractive and have been made so like his elder sister that it might not have been best for him  i want him to feel that in beginning afresh he is doing me no injury and then in time whenever i come home it may be such a friendship as there was between our elders  that is what i try to look forward tono i dont think i look forward to anything  good night aunt melicenti am so glad you like him  in this mind mary met lord ormersfield  the delay had been an advantage for he was less irritated and she had regained selfpossession  her passage had been taken and this was an argument that told on the earl though he refused to call it irrevocable  he found that there was no staggering her on the score of the life that awaited her she knew more on that subject than he did had confidence in her father and no dread of rosita and she was too much ashamed and grieved at the former effect of his persuasions to attend to any more of a like description  he found her sense of duty more stubborn than he had anticipated and soon had no more to say she might carry it too far but the principle was sound and a father could not well controvert it  he had designed the rupture with louis as a penalty to drive her into his measures but he could not so propound it and was wondering how to bring it in when mary relieved him by beginning herself and stating the grounds with such sensible unselfish almost motherly care of louiss happiness that he was more unwilling than ever to let him resign her and was on the point of begging her to reconsider and let louis wait for ever rather than lose her  but he knew they ought not to be bound under such uncertainties and his conviction was too strong to give way to emotion  he thanked her and praised her with unwonted agitation and regretted more than ever and so they closed the conference by deciding that unless mr ponsonby should be induced to relent by his daughters representations on her arrival mary and louis must consider themselves as mutually released  that loopholeforlorn most forlorn hope as they knew it to bewas an infinite solace to the young people by sparing them a formal parting and permitting them still to feel that they belonged to each other  if he began declaring that nothing would ever make him feel disconnected with mary he was told that it was not time to think of that and they must not waste their time  and once mary reminded him how much worse it would be if they had been separated by a quarrel anger might give one spirits he said smiling mournfully  at the time but think what it would be not to be able to remember happy times without remorse  then you do mean to recollect mary  i trust to bring myself to remember rightly and wisely  i shall try to set it for a reward for myself to cure me of repinings said mary looking into his face as if the remembrance of it must bring cheerfulness and refreshment  and when shall i not think mary  when i leave off work i shall want you for a companion when i go to work the thought must stir me up your judgment must try my own  oh hush louis this is not good  be yourself and be more than yourself and only think of the past as a time when we had a great deal of pleasantness and you did me much good  did i  yes i see it now i am with aunt melicent  you put so many more thoughts in my head and showed me that so much more was good and wholesome than i used to fancy  dear mamma once said you were educating me and i hope to go on and not let your lessons waste away  nay mary you won good everywhere  if you had not been mary i might have made you a great goose  but you taught me all the perseverance i ever had  and oh mary i dont wonder you do not trust it  there is the forbidden subject said mary firmly  that was the sort of conversation into which they fell now and then during those last days of busy sadness  truly it could have been worse  suffering by their own fault would have rent them asunder more harshly and louiss freedom from all fierceness and violence softened all ineffably to mary  james frosts letter of fiery indignation almost of denunciation made her thankful that he was not the party concerned and louis made her smile at isabels copy of all his sentiments in ladylike phrases  the last day came  louis would not be denied seeing mary on board the valdivia and in spite of all miss ponsonbys horror of railways he persuaded her to trust herself under his care to liverpool  she augured great things from the letter which she had entrusted to mary and in which she had spoken of lord fitzjocelyn in the highest terms her vocabulary could furnish  they parted bravely  spectators hindered all display of feeling and no one cried except miss ponsonby  goodbye louis i will not forget your messages to tom madison  my love to your father and aunt catharine  goodbye mary i shall see tom and chimborazo yet     chapter v  the new world    still onward as to southern skies   we spread our sails new stars arise   new lights upon the glancing tide   fresh hues where pearl and coral hide   what are they all but tokens true   of grace for ever fresh and new                         prayers for emigrants   there are some days in the early year devoid indeed of spring brilliance but full of soft heavy steaming fragrance pervading the grey air with sweet odours and fostering the growth of tender bud and fragile stem with an unseen influence more mild and kindly than even the smiling sunbeam or the gushing shower  a growing day as the countrypeople term such genial gentle weather might not be without analogy to the brief betrothal of louis and mary  subdued and anxious there had been little of the ordinary light of joy hope or gaiety and their pleasures had been less their own than in preparing the happiness of their two friends  it was a time such as to be more sweet in memory than it was in the present and the shade which had hung over it the selfrestraint and the forbearance which it had elicited had unconsciously conduced to the development of the characters of both preparing them to endure the parting far more effectually than unmixed enjoyment could have done the check upon louiss love of trifling the restraint on his spirits the being thrown back on his own judgment when he wanted to lean upon mary had given him a habit of controlling his boyish ways  it was a call to train himself in manliness and selfreliance  it changed him from the unstable reed he once had been and helped him to take one steady and consistent view of the trial required of him and of mary and then to act upon it resolutely and submissively with mary gone he cared little what became of him until her letters could arrive and his father with more attention to his supposed benefit than to his wishes carried him at once without returning home to a round of visits among all his acquaintance most likely to furnish a distracting amount of christmas gaieties  in the midst of these there occurred a vacancy in the representation of a borough chiefly under the influence of sir miles oakstead and as it was considered expedient that he should be brought into parliament his father repaired with him at once to oakstead and involved him in all the business of the election  on his success he went with his father to london for the session and this was all that his friends at northwold knew of him he wrote hurried notes to james or to mr holdsworth on necessary affairs connected with his farm and improvements mentioning facts instead of feelings and promising to write to aunt catharine when he should have time but the time did not seem to come and it was easy to believe that his passiveness of will increased by the recent stroke had caused him to be hurried into a condition of involuntary practical activity  mary meanwhile was retracing her voyage in the lull of spirits which after long straining had nothing to do but to wait in patience bracing themselves for a fresh trial  never suffering herself at sea her first feelings after the final wrench of parting were interrupted by the necessity of attending to her friend a young mother with children enough to require all the services that the indefatigable mary could perform  if mrs willis always averred that she never could have gone through the voyage without miss ponsonby mary felt in return that the little fretful boy and girl who would never let her sit and think except when both were asleep had been no small blessing to her  yet mary was not so much absorbed and satisfied with the visible and practical as had once been the case  the growth had not been all on louiss side  if her steadfast spirit had strengthened his wavering resolution the intercourse and sympathy with him had opened and unfolded many a perception and quality in her which had been as tightly and hardly cased up as leafbuds in their gummy envelopes  a wider range had been given to her thoughts there was a swelling of heart a vividness of sensation such as she had not known in earlier times she had been taught the mystery of creation the strange connexion with the unseen and even with her fellowmen  beyond the ordinary practical kind offices for which she had been always ready there was now mingled something of louiss more comprehensive spirit of questioning what would do them good and drawing food for reflection from their diverse ways  she was sensible of the change again and again when sights recurred which once had only spoken to her eye  that luminous sea sparkling like floods of stars had been little more than how pretty how funny at her first voyage  now it was not only how louis would admire it but how profusely how gloriously has the creator spread the globe with mysterious beauty how marvellously has he caused his creatures to hold forth this light to attract others to their needful food  and the furrow of fire left by their vessels wake spoke to her of that path like a shining light shining more and more unto the perfect day  if with it came the remembrance of his vision of the threads of light it was not a recollection which would lead to repining  and when at cape horn a mighty ice mountain drifted within view spired pinnacled encrusted with whiteness rivalled only by the glory of the summer cloud caverned here and there into hollows of sapphire blue too deeply dazzling to behold or rising into peaks of clear hard chill green the wild fantastic points sometimes glimmering with fragments of the rainbow arch the rich variety endless beyond measure in form and colouring and not only magnificent and terrible in the whole mass but lovely beyond imagination in each crystal too minute for the eye  mary had once on a like occasion only said it was very cold and looked to see whether the captain expected the monster to bear down on the ship but the present iceberg put her in mind of the sublime aspirations which gothic cathedrals seem as if they would fain embody  and then she thought of the marvellous interminable waste of beauty of those untrodden regions whence yonder enormous iceberg was but a small fragmenta petty messengerregions unseen by human eyebeauty untouched by human handthe glory the sameness yet the infinite variety of perfect purity  did it not seem with all the associations of cold of peril of dreariness to be a visible token that indeed he who fashioned it could prepare good things past mans understanding  it was well for mary that southern constellations snowy whitewinged albatross leaping flyingfish and whitecapped mountaincoast had been joined in her mind with something higher deeper and less personal or their recurrence would have brought her nothing but pain unmitigated in the contrast with the time when first she had beheld them six years ago  then she was full of hope and eager ardour to arrive longing for the parental presence of which she had so long been deprived hailing every novel scene as a proof that she was nearer home and without the anticipation of one cloud only expecting to be loved to love and to be useful  and now all fond illusions as to her father had been snatched away her very love for him rendering the perception doubly cruel her mother her precious mother far away in ormersfield churchyardher life probably shortened by his harshnessher place occupied by a young girl differing in language in church in everythingmarys own pardon uncertain after all her sacrificesa sense of having deeply offended hung upon her and her heart was so entirely in england that had her home been perfect her voyage must still have been a cruel effort  that one anticipation of being set at rest by her fathers forgiveness and the forlorn despairing hope of his relenting towards louis were all she dared to dwell on and when mrs willis counted the days till she could arrive and meet her husband poor mary felt as if but for these two chances of comfort she could gladly have prolonged the voyage for the rest of her life  but one burning tropical noon the valdivia was entering callao harbour and mary sick and faint at heart was arraying herself in a coloured dress lest her mourning should seem to upbraid her father the voyage was over the ship was anchored boats were coming offshore the luggage was being hoisted out of the hold the passengers were congregated on deck eager to land some gazing with curious and enterprising eyes on the new country others scanning every boat in hopes of meeting a familiar face  mrs willis stood trembling with hope excitement and the strange dread often rushing in upon the last moment of expectation  she clung to mary for support and once said  oh miss ponsonby how composed you are  marys feelings were too deeptoo much concentrated for trembling  she calmed and soothed the wifes sudden fright lest something should have happened to george and she even smiled when the childrens scream of ecstacy infected their mother when the papa and uncle they had been watching for with straining eyes proved to be standing on deck close beside them  mary cast her eyes round and saw nothing of her own  she stood apart while the willis family were in all the rapture of the meeting she saw them moving off too happy and sufficient for themselves even to remember her  she had a dull heavy sensation that she must bear all and this was the beginning and she was about to begin her arrangements for her dreary landing when mrs williss brother mr ward turned back  he was a middleaged merchant whom her mother had much liked and esteemed and there was something cheering in his frank hearty greeting and satisfaction in seeing her  it was more like a welcome and it brought the willises back shocked at having forgotten her in the selfishness of their own joy but they had made sure that she had been met  mr ward did not think that she was expected by the valdivia mr ponsonby had not mentioned it as likely  so they were all seated in the boat with the black rowers and while the willises fondled their children and exchanged homenews mr ward sat by mary and spoke to her kindly not openly referring to the state of her home but showing a warmth and consideration which evinced much delicate sympathy  they all drove together in the willises carriage up the sloping road from callao to lima and mary heard astonishment such as she had once felt breaking out in screams from the children at the sight of omnibuses filled with gailydressed negroes and brown horsewomen in panama hats and laceedged trousers careering down the road  but then her father had come and fetched her from on board and that dear mamma was waiting in the carriage  they entered the old walled town when twilight had already closed in and mrs willis was anxious to take her tired little ones home at once  they were set down at their own door but mr ward with protecting anxious kindness insisted on seeing miss ponsonby safely home before he would join them  as they drove through the dark streets mary heard a little restless movement betraying some embarrassment and at last with an evident desire of reassuring her he said senora rosita is thought very pleasing and engaging and then as if willing to change the subject he hastily added i suppose you did not speak the pizarro  no  she has sailed about three weeks  she takes home your cousin mr dynevor  mary cried out with surprise  i thought him a complete fixture but he is gone home for a year it seems his family property was in the market and he was anxious to secure it  how glad his mother will be was all mary could say as there rushed over her the thought of the wonderful changes this would make in dynevor terrace  her first feeling was that she must tell louis her second that two oceans were between them and then she thought of aunt catharine having lived after all to see her son  she had forgotten to expect the turn when the carriage wheeled under the arched entry of her fathers house  all was gloom and stillness except where a little light shone in a sort of porters lodge upon the eager negro features of two blacks with much gesticulation playing at dice  they came out hastily at the sound of the carriage and as mr ward handed out mary and inquired for mr ponsonby she recognised and addressed the whitewoolled old xavier the mayor domo  poor old xavier  often had she hunted and teased him and tried to make him understand cosas de inglaterra and to make him cease from his beloved dice but no sooner did he see her face than with a cry of joy la senorita maria la senorita maria down he went upon his knees and began kissing the hem of her dress  all the rest of the negro establishment came round capering and chattering spanish and in the confusion mary could not get her question heardwhere was her father and xaviers vehement threats and commands to the others to be silent did not produce a calm  at last bearing a light there came forward a faded sallow dame with a candle in her hand who might have sat for the picture of the duena rodriguez and at her appearance the negroes subsided  she was an addition to the establishment since marys departure but in her might be easily recognised the tia the individual who in limenian households holds a position between companion and housekeeper  she introduced herself by the lugubrious appellation of senora dolores and receiving mary with obsequious courtesy explained that the senor and senora were at a tertulia or evening party  she lighted mary and mr ward into the quadra and there mr ward shaking hands with her as if he would thereby compensate for all that was wanting in her welcome promised to go and inform her father of her arrival  mary stood in the large dark room with the soft matted floor and the windows high up near the carved timbered ceiling the single lamp burning in rum casting a dim gleam over the wellknown furniture by which her mother had striven to give an english appearance to the room it was very dreary and she would have given the world to be alone with her throbbing head her dull heartache and the weariness of spirits overlong wound up for the meeting but her own apartment could be no refuge until it had been cleansed and made ready and dolores and xavier were persecuting her every moment with their hospitality and their inquiries  then came a quick manly tread and for a moment her heart almost seemed to stand still in the belief that it was her father but it was only robson hurrying in to offer his services and apologies  perhaps he was the very last person she could bear to see feeling as she did that if he had been more explicit all the offence would have been spared  he was so much aware of all family matters and was accustomed to so much confidence from her father that she could not believe him unconscious and there was something hateful to her in the plausible frankness and deferential familiarity of his manners as brushing up his sandy hair upon his forehead he poured forth explanations that mr ponsonby would be delighted but grieved that no one had met hervaldivia not expected so soonnot anticipated the pleasureif they had imagined that miss ponsonby was a passenger  my father desired that i would come out by her said mary  ay trueso he informed me but since later intelligenceand he cast a glance at mary to judge how much further to go but meeting with nothing but severity he covered the impertinence by saying in fact though the valdivia was mentioned and mrs willis mr ponsonby had reason to suppose you would not receive his letters in time to avail yourself of the escort  i did so however said mary coldly  most gratifying  mr and mrs ponsonby will be highly gratified in fact miss ponsonby i must confess that was a most unfortunate blunder of mine last august  i should not have fallen into the error had i not been so long absent at guayaquil that i had had no opportunity of judging of the amiable lady and i will own to much natural surprise and some indignation before i had had the pleasure of personal acquaintance with the charms and the graceshem in effect it was a step that no one could have recommended and when your noble relative put it to me in so many words whether i would counsel your continuing your journey i could not take it on me to urge a measure so painful to your feelings unaware as i was then of the amiable qualities of the lady who occupies the situation of the highly beloved and esteemed  mary could not bear to hear her mothers name in his mouth so she cut him short by saying i suppose you thought you acted for the best mr robson it was very unfortunate but it cannot be helped pray can you tell me where the lad madison is she added resolved to show him that she would not discuss these matters with him i have a parcel for him  he is at the san benito mine miss ponsonby  how does he go on  welli may say very well allowing for inexperience  he appears a steady intelligent lad and i have no doubt will answer the purpose well  there was one gratification for mary at least in the pleasure this would afford at home but robson continued making conversation about mr dynevors visit to england and the quantity of work this temporary absence entailed on him and then on the surprise it would be to his patron to find her and senora rositas interest in her and the numerous gaieties of the bride and the admiration she excited and his own desire to be useful   this afforded mary an opportunity for getting rid of him at last by sending him to make arrangements for her baggage to be sent from callao the next morning  ten minutes more half spent in conquering her disgust half in sick anticipation and other feet were crossing the matted sala the curtain over the doorway was drawn aside and there stood her father and a lady all white and diamonds by his side  he held out his arms mary fell into them and it was the same kind rough kiss which had greeted her six years back  it seemed to be forgiveness consolation strength all at once and their words mingledpapa you forgive memary my good girl i did not think they would have let you come back to me  this was but a dreary coming home for you my dear  and then instantly changing his language to spanish he added appealing to his wife that had they guessed she was on board they would have come to meet her  rosita replied earnestly to that effect and warmly embraced mary pitying her for such an arrival and hoping that dolores had made her comfortable  the rest of the conversation was carried on in the same tongue  rosita was much what mary had expectedof a beautiful figure with fine eyes and splendid raven hair but without much feature or expression  she looked almost like a dream tonight however with her snowy robes and the diamonds sparkling with their dewdrop flashes in her hair and on her arms with the fitful light caught from the insufficient candles  all she ventured to say had a timid gracefulness and simplicity that were very winning and her husband glanced more than once to see if she were not gaining upon his daughter and so in truth she was personally though it was exceedingly painful to see her where mary had been used to see that dear suffering face and it was impossible not to feel the contrast with her father as painfully incongruous  mr ponsonby was a large man with the jovial manner of one never accustomed to selfrestraint good birth and breeding making him still a gentleman in spite of his loud voice and the traces of selfindulgence  he was ruddy and bronzed and his eyebrows and hair looked as if touched by hoar frost altogether as dissimilar a partner as could be devised for the slender girlish being by his side  after a little spanish conversation all kind on his aide and thus infinitely relieving mary they parted for the night  she laid before him the packet of letters which she had held all this time as the last link to louis and sought his eye as she did so with a look of appeal but he carefully averted his glance and she could read nothing  weary as she was mary heard again and again through her unglazed windows the watchmans musical cry of ave maria purisima lases temblado  viva peru y sereno and chid herself for foolish anticipations that louis would hear and admire all the strange sounds of the new world  the kindness of her welcome gave her a little hope and she went over and over again her own part of the discussion which she expected almost persuading herself that louiss own conduct and her aunts testimony must win the day  she need not have spent so many hours in preparation for the morning she was up early in hopes of seeing her father before he went to his office but he was gone for a ride  the english breakfast which had been established much to his content by her own exertions had quite vanished each of the family had a cup of chocolate in private and there was no meeting till late in the morning rosita sauntered into her room embraced her made inquiries as to her rest informed her that she was going to the opera that night and begged her to accompany her  to appear in public with rosita was the tribute for which mary had come out so she readily agreed and thereupon the senora digressed into the subject of dress and required of mary a display of all her robes and an account of the newest fashions of the english ladies  it was all with such innocent earnest pleasure that mary could not be annoyed and goodnaturedly made all her disappointing display  the midday meal brought her fatherstill kind and affectionate but never dropping the spanish nor manifesting any consciousness of her letters  she had hopes of the period allotted to the siesta to which custom in old days she had never acceded but had always spent the interval on any special occupationabove all to writing for him but he went off without any notice of her and she was in no condition to dispense with the repose for her frame was tired out though her hopes and fears could not even let her dreams rest  then came a drive with rosita resplendent in french millinery then supper then the opera to which her father accompanied them still without a word  another day was nearly the same only that this time she had to do her best to explain the newest fashions in behalf of a dress of rositas then being made and in the evening to go to a party at the consuls where she met mr ward and had some talk which she might have enjoyed but for her suspense  on the third rosita was made happy by unpacking an elegant little black papier mache table a present from miss ponsonby  good melicent were ever two sistersinlaw more unlike   but lord ormersfield had done rosita and her husband good service  if aunt melicent had first learned the real facts her wrath would have been extremea mere child a foreigner a roman catholic a nun  her horror would have known no bounds and she would perhaps have broken with her brother forever  but by making the newlymarried pair victims of injustice the earl had made the reality a relief and melicent had written civilly to her brother and a sisterly sort of stiff letter to the brideof which the limenian could not understand one word so that mary had to render it all into spanish even to her good aunts hopes that rosita would be kind to her and use all her influence in favour of her happiness  whether rosita would have comprehended this without marys blushes might be questioned but she did say ah yes you were to have married the visconde were you not  el senor was so angry  did his father forbid when your father refused your portion  oh no he would receive me if i brought nothing  and you wish to marry said rosita  if my father would only consent  but why did you come here then said rosita opening her large eyes  my father commanded me  england is a long way off said rosita languidly he could not have reached you there  you would have been a great lady and noble how could you come away if he would still have you  because it would have been wrong  we could not have been happy in disobeying my father  ah but you could have done penance  i had many penances to do for quitting my convent padre inigo was very severe but they are over at last and i am free for giving alms twice a week and the sisters have forgiven me and send me so many silver flowers and dulces i will show them to you some day  could you not have done penance  i am afraid not  ah i forgot you were a heretic poor thing  how inconvenient  and so you will not come with me to the bullfight next sunday  such being rositas ideas on the point mary gave up much hope in her influence and tried what a goodhumoured announcement of her reestablishment of the english breakfast would effect towards bringing her father to a teteatete but he never came near it  the waiting in silence was miserable enough for herself but she would have continued to bear it except for the injustice to louis who must not be kept in suspense  the departure of the next english mail should be the limit of her endurance and after a day of watching she finally went up to her father when he would have bidden her good night and said in english papa if you please i must speak to you  so you shall my dear but we are all tired we must have our nights rest  no papa it must be tonight if you please  it is necessary for me to know before tomorrow how i am to write to lord fitzjocelyn  pshaw  mary ive settled that young fellow  papa i dont think you know  ive written him a civil answer if thats what you mean much civiller than he or his father deserve he said speaking loud and trying to fling away from her but she stood her ground and spoke calmly and steadily though her heart beat violently  you do not understand the true state of the case papa and without doing so you cannot write such an answer as they deserve  i know this that old ormersfield has been the curse of my life and out poured one of those torrents of fierce passion which had been slowly but surely the death of his wife  mary had never heard one in the full tide before but she stood firm there were none of the tears auch as in her mother had been wont to exasperate him further but with pale cheeks compressed lips and hands locked together her heart was one silent entreaty that it might be forgiven him above  thus she stood while the storm of anger raged and when at last it had exhausted itself he said in a lower voice and so you are still taken with this fellows son this young puppy  i thought you had more spirit and sense mary or i never would have trusted you among them  there are very few people in this world half so good or so rightminded as fitzjocelyn said mary earnestly and deliberately it was he who bade me come to you well knowing that we could never be happy without your consent  oh he did so did he  he is deeper than i thought would not risk your fortune  why mary i did not think a girl of your sense could be so taken in  it is transparent i tell you  they get you there flatter you up with their attentions but when they find you too wise for them the first time off goes this youth to miss conway finds her a bad speculation no heiress at all and disposes of her to his cousin  i wonder if hell find old dynevor grateful  meanwhile the old lord must needs come out here finds our gains a better prize than he expected trumps up this story at valparaiso takes you in and brings you home to this precious youth  and you and your aunt too are ready to believe it all  i always knew that women were fools whenever a title came in their way i see it more than ever now since you and melicent are both like the rest of em  papa said mary again rallying her firmness we have found sadly how easy it is to be deceived when one is not on the spot  will you listen to me who saw it all  no mary i will not hear the nonsense they have put into your head my poor girl  no  i tell you it is of no use  it is my resolute purpose that not one farthing of mine shall go to patch up the brokendown ormersfield property  the man is my enemy and has sown dissension in my family from the first moment i connected myself with him  ill never see my daughter his sons wife  i wonder he had the impudence to propose it  i shall think you lost to all feeling for your father if you say another word about it  very well said mary with steady submission  then i will only write one more letter to fitzjocelyn and tell him that your objections are insuperable and that he must think of it no more  thats right mary you are a good girl after all  youll stand by your father in spite of all the house of peers  im glad to see you hold up your head so bravely  so you did fancy being a viscountess did you but it is not a heartbreaking matter either my girl  this was too much for mary and when her father would have kissed her she laid her head on his shoulder and wept silently but bitterly  ha whats all this  why you dont pretend to care for a young mercenary scamp like that  he is the noblest most generous most disinterested man i ever knew said mary standing apart and speaking clearly  i give him up becauseyou command me father but i will not hear him spoken of unjustly  ha ha so long as you give him up we wont quarrel  he shall be all that and more too if you like and well never fight over the matter again since i have you safe back my child  i do not mean to mention him again said mary i wish to obey you  then theres an end of the matter  youll get over it my girl and well find some honest man worth two of your niggardly proudspirited earls  there i know you are a reasonable girl that can be silent and not go on teasing  so mary you may have a cup of tea for me tomorrow in the sala like old times  goodnight my dear  waiting upon himself  that was the reward that mr ponsonby held out to his daughter for crushing her first love  but it was a reward  anything that drew her father nearer to her was received with gratitude by mary and the words of kindness in some degree softened the blow she had never had much hope though now she found it had been more than she had been willing to believe and even now she could not absolutely cease to entertain some hopes of the results of olivers return nor silence one lingering fancy that louis might yet wait unbound although she told herself of his vacillation between herself and isabel of his fathers influence and of the certainty that he would see many more worthy of his love than herself not any one who could love him so welloh no  but when mary found her thoughts taking this turn she rose up as she lay clasped her hands together and repeated half aloud again and again be thou my all  and by the morning though marys cheek was very white and her eyes sunken for want of sleep she had a cheerful word for her father and a smile the very sight of which would have gone to the heart of any one of those from whom he had cut her off  then she wrote her letters  it was not so hard to make this final severance as it had been to watch louiss face and think of the pain she had to inflict  many a time had she weighed each phrase she set down so that it might offend neither against sincerity nor resignation and yet be soothing and consoling  some would have thought her letter stiff and laboured but she had learned to believe that a grave and careful style befitted a serious occasion and would have thought incoherency childish or affected  she released him entirely from his engagement entreating him not to rebel against the decision but to join her in thankfulness that no shade need be cast over the remembrance of the happy hours spent together and begging him not to grieve since she had after the first pain been able to acquiesce in the belief that the separation might conduce to his happiness and she should always regard him as one of those most near and dear to her and rejoice in whatever was for his welfare glad that his heart was still young enough to form new ties forgive me for speaking thus she added i know that it may wound you now but there may come a time when it may make you feel more at ease and unfettered and i could not endure to imagine that the affection which you brought yourself to lavish on one so unworthy should stand in the way of your happiness for life  she desired him to make no answer but to consider this as the final dissolution and she concluded by all that she thought would prove most consoling as to the present state of affairs with her and with a few affectionate words to show that he was still a great deal to her though everything he might not be  this done mary faced her life in the new world  she had to form her habits for herself for her importance in the house was gone but she went to work resolutely and lonely as she was she had far more resources than if she had never been at ormersfield  she had many hours to herself and she unpacked her books and set herself courses of study to which louis had opened the door  she unveiled her eyes to natural history and did not find flower or butterfly unsoothing she undertook the not very hopeful task of teaching a tiny negro imp who answered the purpose of a bell to read and work and she was persevering in her efforts to get xavier and dolores to make her father comfortable  her father was decidedly glad of her company  he liked conversation and enjoyed the morning meeting to which mr ward was often a welcome addition delighting in anything so english and finding miss ponsonby much improved by her introduction to english society sometimes mary wrote for her father and now and then was consulted and she was always grateful for whatever made her feel herself of use  she was on kind and friendly terms with rosita but they did not become more intimate than at first  the senora was swinging in a hammock halfasleep with a cigarette between her lips all the morning and when she emerged from this torpid state in a splendid toilette she had too many more congenial friends often to need her stepdaughter in her visits her expeditions to lotteries and her calls on her old friends the nuns  on a fastday or any other occasion that kept her at home she either arranged her jewels discussed her dresses or had some lively chatter which she called learning english  she coaxed fondled and domineered prettily over mr ponsonby and he looked on amused gratified her caprices caressed her and seemed to regard her as a pretty pet and plaything     chapter vi  the two pendragons    the red dragon and the white   hard together gan they smite   with mouth paw and tail   between hem was full hard batail                  the history of merlin   spring was on the borders of summer when one afternoon as clara sat writing a note in the drawingroom she heard a tap at the door of the little sittingroom and springing to open it she beheld a welcome sight  louis  how glad i am  where do you come from  last from the station said louis  what makes you knock at that door now the drawingroom is alive  i could not venture on an unceremonious invasion of mrs james frosts territory  youll find no distinction of territory here laughed clara  it was a fiction that we were to live in separate rooms like naughty children  does not the drawingroom look nice  as much improved as the inhabitant  where are the other natives  granny and isabel are walking and will end by picking up jem coming out of school  we used to wait for him so often that at last he said we should be laughed at so theres a law against it which no one dares to transgress but granny  so i conclude that you are a happy family  after all it was worth spending two years at school to enjoy properly the having it over  i give jem credit for having secured a firstrate governess for you  that she is  why with her i really do like reading and drawing all the morning  i almost believe that some day i shall wake up and find myself an accomplished young lady  and louis have you read the last western magazine  i have read very little for sport lately  then i must tell you  jem was bemoaning himself about having nothing to give to the new blind asylum and the next evening isabel brought out the prettiest little manuscript book tied with blue ribbon and told him to do as he pleased with it  it was a charming account of her expedition to the hebrides written out for her sisters without a notion of anything further but jem sent it to this magazine and it is accepted and the first part is out  she will have quite a sum for it and all is to go to the blind asylum  capitallet me take it home to night clara and i will stand an examination on it tomorrow  we ask her whether she projects a sketch of the paris revolution said clara laughing  she has a famous heap of manuscripts in her desk and one long story about a sir roland who had his name before she knew jem but it is all unfinished she tore out a great many pages and has to make a new finish and i am afraid the poor knight is going to die of a mortal wound at his ladys feet  isabel likes sad things bestbut oh here they come and im talking dreadful treason  three more joyouslooking people could hardly have been found than those who entered the room welcoming louis with delight and asking what good wind had brought him  partly that inglewood is crying out for the masters eye said louis and partly that my father fancied i looked fagged and kindly let me run down for a holiday  i am of his mind said mrs frost tenderly there is an mp expression gathering on your brows louis  for you to dispel aunt kitty  i told him you were the best dissipation and virginia was of the same mind  isabel she says dynevor terrace is the only place she ever wishes to see again  do you often see virginia asked isabel  not unless i go early and beg for her and then she generally has some master  that last onset of accomplishments is serious  yes said isabel the sense of leisure and tranquillity here is marvellous  not leisure in the sense of idleness said james  no said isabel but formerly idle requirements thronged my time and for nothing worth doing could i find leisure  there is nothing more exacting than idle requirements said james pray is clara accepting that invitation  come to dinner louis and give us an excuse  no he wont said mrs frost he will take my side  these young people want to cast off all their neighbours  now granny exclaimed james have we not dutifully dined all round did not isabel conduct clara to that ball  is it not hard to reproach us with sighing at an evening immolated at the shrine of the richardsons  well my dears you must judge  i am ready to do whatever you think right i leave you to settle it said isabel moving out of the room that louis might be free for a more intimate conversation  now cried james is it in the nature of things that she should live in such society as mrs walbys and mrs richardsons  people who call her mrs james  such a queen as she looks among them said clara  one comfort is they dont like that said james  even mrs calcott is not flattered by her precedence  i hope we shall soon be dropped out of their parties  as long as i do my duty by their sons what right have they to impose the penance of their society on my wife  all the irksomeness of what she has left and none of the compensations  blissful solitude said louis thereto i leave you  you are not going yet  you mean to dine here was the cry  my dear friends he said holding up his hands if you only knew how i long to have no one to speak to  you crying out for silence exclaimed james  i am panting for what i have not had these five monthsspace for my thoughts to turn round  surely you are at liberty to form your own habits said james  i am told so whenever my father sees me receive a note said louis wearily but i see that habituated as he is to living alone he is never really at ease unless i am in the way so i make our hours agree as far as our respective treadmills permit and though we do not speak much i can never think in company  dont you have your rides to yourself  why no  my father will never ride enough to do him good unless he wants to do me good  people are all surprised to see him looking so well the country lanes make him quite blooming  but not you my poor boy said his aunt i am afraid it is a sad strain  there now aunt kitty i am gone  i must have the pleasure of looking natural sometimes without causing any vituperation of any one beyond seas  you shall look just as you please if you will only stay  we are just going to dinner  thank you let me come tomorrow  i shall be better company when i have had my sulk out  his aunt followed him to the stairs and he turned to her saying anxiously no letter  she shook her head  it would be barely possible he said but if it would only come while i am at home in peace  ah this is sadly trying said she parting his hair on his brow as he stood some steps below her and winning a sweet smile from him  all for the best he said  one thing may mitigate another  that political whirlpool might suck me in if i had any heart or hopes for it  and on the other hand it would be very unwholesome to be left to my own inertnessto be as good for nothing as i feel  my poor dear boy you are very good about it  i wish you could have been spared  i did not come to make you sad aunt kitty he replied smiling no i get some energy back when i remember that this may be a probation her mother would not have thought me man enough and that is what i have to work for  whether this end well or not she is the leading star of my life  and with the renewal of spirit with which he had spoken he pressed his aunts hand and ran down stairs  when he rode to northwold the following afternoon having spent the morning in walking over his fields he overtook a most comfortable couplejames and isabel returning from their holiday stroll and louis leaving his horse at the inn and joining them began to hear all their school affairs  james had thrown his whole heart into his work had been making various reforms introducing new studies making a point of religious instruction and meditating on a course of lectures on history to be given in the evenings the attendance to be voluntary but a prize held out for proficiency  louis took up the subject eagerly and isabel entered into the discussion with all her soul and the grammarschool did indeed seem to be in a way to become something very superior in tone to anything northwold had formerly seen engrossing as it did all the powers of a man of such ability in the full vigour of youth  talking earnestly the trio had reached the terrace and james was unlatching the iron gate when he interrupted himself in the midst of detailing his views on modern languages to say no i have nothing for you  sir i beg your pardon was the quick reply from a withered small but not illdressed old man i only asked  let the lady pass said james peremptorily wishing to save his wife from annoyance it is of no use i never look at petitions  surely he is not a beggar said isabel as he drew her on  you may be easy about him my dear said james  he has laid hold of louis who would swallow the whole spanish legion of impostors he will be after us directly with a piteous story  louis was after him with a face more than half arch funjem jem it is your uncle  nonsense  how can you be so taken in  dont go and disappoint grannyill settle him  take care jemit is oliver and no mistake  why he is as like you as pendragon blood can make him  go and beg his pardon  james hastened down stairs as louis bounded upsought mrs frost in the sittingrooms and without ceremony rushed up and knocked at the bedroom door  jane opened it  he is come cried louisoliver is come  old jane gave a shriek and ran back wildly clapping her hands  her mistress started forwardcomewhere  herein the hall with jem  he feared that he had been too precipitate for she hid her face in her hands but it was the intensity of thanksgiving and though her whole frame was in a tremor she flew rather than ran forward never even seeing louiss proffered arm  he had only reached the landingplace when beneath he heard the greetingmother i can take you homecheveleigh is yours  but to her the words were drowned in her own breathless crymy boy my boy  she saw knew heard nothing save that the son missed and mourned for thirtyfour years was safe within her arms the longing void filled up  she saw not that the stripling had become a worn and elderly manshe recked not how he came  he was oliver and she had him again  what was the rest to her  those words  they might be out of taste but fitzjocelyn guessed that to speak them at the first meeting had been the vision of olivers lifethe object to which he had sacrificed everything and yet how chill and unheeded they fell  louis could have stood moralizing but his heart had begun to throb at the chance that oliver brought tidings of mary  he felt himself an intrusive spectator and hastened into the drawingroom when clara nearly ran against him but stood still  i beg your pardon but what is isabel telling me  is it really  really  kindred blood signally failed to speak  clara took a turn up and down the room  i say louis ought i to go down  no leave him and granny to their happiness said louis and james at the same moment running up threw himself into a chair with an emphatic there  dear grandmamma said isabel i hope it is not too much for her  james made no answer  are you disappointed in him dear james she continued  i could not be disappointed he answered shortly  poor manhe has a poor welcome among you said louis  welcome is not to be bought said james  i could not stand hearing him reply to poor grannys heartfelt rapture with his riches and his cheveleigh as if that were all she could prize  steps were mounting the stairs and the alert sharp tones of oliver were heardmarried then  should have waiteddone it in style  james and isabel glanced at each other in amused indignation and mrs frost entered tremulous with joy and her bright hazel eyes lustrous with tears as she leant on the arm of her recovered son he was a little spare shrivelled man drolly like his nephew but with all the youthfulness dried out of him the freckles multiplied by scores and the keen black eyes sunken sharpened and surrounded with innumerable shrewd puckers  the movements were even more brisk as if time were money and in speech the small change of particles was omitted and every word seemed bitten off short at the end the whole man in gesture manner and voice an almost grotesque caricature of all jamess peculiarities  mrs roland dynevor i presume said oliver as isabel came forward to meet him  never so known hitherto returned her husband  my wife is mrs james frost if you please  that is over now said oliver consequentially and as his mother presented to him poor henrys little clara he kissed her affectionately saying wellgrown young lady upon my word  like her fatherthats right  here is almost another grandchild said mrs frostlouis fitzjocelynnot much like the fitzjocelyn you remember but a new mp as he was then  humph said oliver with a dry sound apparently expressing so that is what our parliament is made of  father well he asked  quite well thank you sir  oliver levelled his keen eyes on him as though noting down observations while he was burning for tidings of mary yet held back by reserve and sense of the uncongeniality of the man  his aunt however in the midst of her own joy marked his restless eye and put the question whether mary ponsonby had arrived  ha you let her go did you said oliver turning on louis  i told her father youd be no such fool  he was in a proper rage at your letter but it would have blown over if you had stuck by her and he is worth enough to set you all on your legs  louis could not bring himself to make any answer and his mother interrupted by a question as to dona rosita  like all the rest  eyes and feet thats all  foolish business but what possessed ormersfield to make such a blunder  i never saw ponsonby in such a tantrum and his are no trifles  it was all the fault of your clerk robson said james he would not refute the story  sharp fellow robson chuckled oliver couldnt refute it  no as he told me he knew the way ponsonby had gone on ever since his wife went home and of late he had sent him to guayaquil about the equatorial navigationso he had seen nothingand says he to me he had no notion of bringing out poor miss ponsonbydid not know whether her father would thank him and yet the best of it is that he pacifies ponsonby with talking of difficulty of dealing with preconceived notions  knows how to get hold of him  marriage would never have been if he had been there but it was the less damage mary would have had more reason to have turned about if she had not found him married  but oliver said his mother i thought this robson was an honest man in whom you had entire confidence  ha ha  dye think id put that in any man  no no he knows how far to go with me  ive plenty of checks on him  cant get business done but by a wideawake chap like that  is madison under him asked louis feeling as if he had been apprenticing the boy to a chief of banditti  the lad you sent out  ay  left him up at the mines  sharp fellow but too raw for the office yet  too scrupulous said james in an undertone while his uncle was explaining to his mother that he could not have come away without leaving robson to manage his affairs and mr ponsonby and telling exultingly some stories of the favourite clerks sharp practice  the party went down together in a not very congenial state  next to mrs frosts unalloyed gladness the most pleasant spectacle was old jane who volunteered her services in helping to wait that she might have the delight of hovering about master oliver to whom she attended exclusively and would not let charlotte so much as offer him the potatoes  and charlotte was in rather an excited state at the presence of a peruvian production and the flutter of expecting a letter which would make her repent of the smiles and blushes she had expended over an elaborate valentine admired as an original production and valued the more alas because poor marianne had received none  charlotte was just beginning to repent of her ungenerous triumph and agitation made her waiting less deft and pretty than usual but this mattered the less since to oliver any attendance by womenservants was a shock as were the small table and plain fare and he looked round uneasily  here is an old friend oliver said his mother taking up a curious old soupladle  i see  it will take some time to get up the stock of plate  i shall give an order as i pass through london  to be engraved with the dynevor crest as before or would you prefer the lozenge maam  oh my dear dont talk of it now  i am only sorry this is nothing but muttonbroth but thats what comes of sudden arrivals oliver  it shall be remedied at home said oliver as if he considered muttonbroth as one degree from famine  i know you had it for me said louis  if jane excels in one art before all others it is in muttonbroth  oliver darted a glance as if he imagined this compliment to be mere derision of his mother and jane  things went on in this style all the evening  oliver had two ideascheveleigh and the equatorial steam navigation companyand on these he rang the changes  there was something striking in his devotion of a lifetime to redeem his mothers fortunes but the grandeur was not easily visible in the detail  he came down on dynevor terrace as a consequential moneyed man contemptuous of the poverty which he might have alleviated and obtruding tardy and oppressive patronage  he rubbed against the new generation in too many places for charity or gratitude to be easy he was utterly at variance with taste and openly broached unworthy sentiments and opinions and his kindness and his displeasure were equally irksome  if such repugnance to him were felt even by louis the least personally affected and the best able to sympathize with his aunt it was far stronger in james abhorring patronage sensible that happen what might his present perfect felicity must be disturbed and devoid of any sentiment for cheveleigh that could make the restoration compensate for the obligation so unpleasantly enforced and isabels fastidious taste made her willing to hold aloof as far as might be without vexing the old lady  there was no amalgamation  fitzjocelyn and isabel were near the window talking over her former home and her sisters and all the particulars of the society which she had left and he had entered highly interesting to themselves and to the listening clara but to the uninitiated sounding rather like taste shakspeare and the musical glasses  oliver and his mother sitting close together were living in an old world asking and answering many a melancholy question on friends dead or lost sight of and yet these last they always made sure that they should find when they went home to cheveleighthat home to which the son reverted with unbroken allegiance while the whole was interspersed with accounts of his plans and explanations of his vast designs for the renovation of the old place  james hovered on the outskirts of both parties too little at ease to attach himself to either fretted by his wifes interest in a world to which he was a stranger impatient of his uncles plans and trebly angered by observing the shrewd curious glances which the old man cast from time to time towards the pair by the window fortunately mrs frost was still too absolutely wrapt in maternal transport to mark the clouds that were gathering over her peace  to look at her son wait on him and hear his voice so fully satisfied her that as yet it made little difference what that voice said and it never entered her mind to suppose that all her dear ones were not sharing her bliss  you were the first to tell me she said as she bade louis good night with fondness additional to her messenger of good news but as he pressed her dear old trembling hand his heart misgave him whether her joy might not be turned to pain and when he congratulated jane and heard her call it a blessed day he longed to be certain that it would prove so  and before he could sleep that night he wrote a letter to tom madison warning him to let no temptation nor bad example lead him aside from strict justice and fair dealing and advising him rather to come home and give up all prospects of rising than not preserve his integrity  james and isabel were not merciful to their uncle when they could speak of him without restraint and began to conjecture his intentions with regard to them  you dont wish to become an appendage to cheveleigh said james fondly  i who never knew happiness till i came here  i do not know what my uncle may propose said james but i know you coincide in my determination that he shall never interfere with the duties of my office  you do not imagine that he wishes it  i know he wishes i were not in holy orders  i knew he disliked it at the time of my ordination but if he wished me to act according to his views he should have given himself the right to dictate  by not neglecting you all your youth  not that i regret or resent what concerns myself but it was his leaving me a burden on my grandmother that drove me to become a clergyman and a consistent one i will be not an idle heirapparent to this estate receiving it as his gift not my own birthright  an idle clergyman  never never cried isabel  i should not believe it was you  and the schoolyou could not leave it just as your plans are working and the boys improving  certainly not it would be fatal to abandon it to that stick powell ah isabel as he looked at her beautiful countenance how i pity the man who has not a highminded wife  suppose you came begging and imploring me not to give any umbrage to the man because you so doted upon diamonds  the less merit when one has learnt that they are very cold hard stones said isabel smiling  isabel was a highminded wife but she would have been a still better one if her loving admiration had allowed her to soften james or to question whether pride and rancour did not lurk unperceived in the midst of the really high and sound motives that prompted him  while their grandmother could only see oliver on the best side james and isabel could only see him on the worst and lost the greatness of the design in the mercenary habits that exclusive perseverance in it had produced  it had been a false greatness but they could not grant the elevation of mind that had originally conceived it  the following day was sunday and nothing worse took place than little skirmishes in which the uncle and nephews retort and rejoinder were so drolly similar that clara found herself thinking of miss faithfulls two sandy cats over a mouse but she kept her simile to herself finding that isabel regarded the faintest gentlest comparison of the two gentlemen almost as an affront  all actual debate was staved off by mrs frosts entreaty that business discussion should be deferred  humph said oliver you reign here maam but thats not the way we get on at lima  i dare say said james  mrs frosts joy was still undimmed  it was almost a trance of gladness trembling in her smile and overflowing in her eye at every congratulation and squeeze of the hand from her friends  dear jemmy said she taking his arm as they went home in the evening did not that psalm seem meant for usif riches increase set not your heart upon them  james had been thinking it meant for some one but as he said certainly not for you dear granny  ah snares of wealth were set far enough from me for a time  i never felt so covetous as when there was a report that there was to be an opposition school  but now your dear uncle is bringing prosperity back i must take care not to set my heart even on what he has gained for me  i defy riches to hurt you said james smiling  ah  jemmy you didnt know me as a county grandee she said with a bright sad look when your poor grandpapa used to dress me up im an old woman now past vanities but i never could sit as loose to them as your own dear wife does  i never tried  well it will be changed enough but i shall be glad to see poor old cheveleigh  it does me good to hear poor oliver call it home  if only we had your dear father  to me dynevor terrace is home said james  a happy home it has been said the old lady  goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life  and now oliver whom i never thought to see againoh what can i do to be thankful enough  i knew what he was doing  i knew he was not what you all thought him  and roughing it has been no harm to you or clara and it is all over now  and the dear old place comes back to the old name oh james i can sometimes hardly contain myselfthat my poor boy has done it and all for me and his brothers children  james could scarcely find it in his heart to say a single word to damp her joy and all his resolution enabled him to do was to say gently you know dear granny we must not forget that i am a clergyman  i know  i have been telling your uncle so but we can do something you might take the curacy and do a great deal of good  there used to be wild places sadly neglected in my time  i hope that since it has been given back to us we may feel it more as a stewardship than i did when it was mine  james sighed and looked softened and thoughtful  your uncle means to purchase an annuity for jane she added and if we could only think what to do for the faithfulls  i wonder whether they would come and stay with us  at least they can never vex themselves again at not paying rent  after a pausejem my dear could you manage to give your uncle the true account of your marriage  he admires isabel very much i can tell you and is pleased at the connexion  but i fancy though he will not say so that mr ponsonby has desired him to find out all he can about louis and unluckily they have persuaded themselves that poor louis courted isabel supposing that she was to have beauchastel and finding his error betook himself to mary  turning isabel over to me  extremely flattering  now jem dont be angry  it is only foolish talk  but unluckily i cant persuade your uncle not to think the real story all my partiality and you might do much more if it be not too unpleasant to you  thank you granny it is out of the question  if it were as he does us the honour to imagine i should be the last person to confess it my evidence could be of no service to fitzjocelyn when my uncles maxim is to place confidence in no one  the sole refutation in my power is the terms on which we meet  now i have vexed you  i wish i had said nothing about it but when dear louiss happiness may depend on his report  if i were base enough to have acted as he supposes i should be base enough to deny it  there is not enough to be hoped to make me speak with unreserve on such a subject  he saved himself from sayingto such a man but the shrewd suspicious old bachelor was not an inviting confidant for the vicissitudes of delicate and tender feelings of such recent date and mrs frost reproached herself with asking too much of her proud sensitive grandson  the black gown and trencher cap by no means gratified oliver when james set off to school on monday morning but he consoled himself with observing we shall soon put an end to that  james is quite devoted to the school said isabel and she was answered by the dry growl  it will be a hard thing to transplant our young people said mrs frost they have managed to be very happy here  so hard of transplantation that i doubt the possibility said isabel you have made us take very deep root here  have you ever seen cheveleigh mrs dynevor  never  poor oliver you and i think no place equal to our birthplace said mrs frost  i should think mrs roland dynevor would find it compensation  how many beds did we make up mother the year my father was sheriff  you must go to jane for that said his mother laughing  im sure i never knew  i believe it was twentyseven said oliver gravely  i know there were one hundred and eightyfive persons at the ball and that the room was hung with blue brocade mother and you opened the ball with lord francis  i remember you had violet satin and white blonde  my dear how can you remember such things  you were a little bit of a schoolboy  i was sixteen said oliver  it was the year 13  i will have the drawingroom hung with blue brocade and i think mrs roland dynevor will own that nothing can exceed it  very likely said isabel indifferently and she escaped beckoning with her clara who was rather entertained with the reminiscences over which granny and uncle oliver seemed ready to linger for ever and yet she was rather ashamed of her own amusement and interest when she heard her sisterinlaw say if he did but know how weary i am of that hateful thing a great house  i hope cheveleigh is not grander than ormersfield said clara in an odd sort of voice  the ladies for the first time did not sit together this morning clara practised and isabel took the chapel in the valley out of her desk and began a process of turning the sir roland into sir hubert  oliver and his mother were in the sittingroom and on jamess return from school in the middle of the day he was summoned thither mrs frost was sitting by the fire rather tearful and nervous and her son stood full in the front as dignified and magnanimous as size and features would permit and the same demeanour was instantly and unconsciously assumed by his nephew who was beyond measure chafed by the attempt at a grand coup  i have requested your presence began oliver as the eldest son of my elder brother and thus after my mother the head of our family you are aware that when unfortunate circumstances involved my mothers property it was my determination to restore the inheritance to her and to my dear brother henry  for this object i have worked for the last thirtyfour years and a fortunate accident having brought our family estate into the market i have been enabled to secure it  i am now ready to make it over to my mother with entail to yourself and your heirs as representatives of my brother henry and settling five thousand pounds on your sister as the portion to which the younger children of our family have always been entitled if you are willing to reside at our family seat with my mother i will assure you of a suitable allowance during her lifetime and  nothing was more intolerable to a man like james than a shower of obligations and his spirit angered at the very length of the address caught at the first opening for avoiding gratitude and beheld in the last proposal an absolute bribe to make him sacrifice his sacred ministry and he burst forth sir i am much obliged to you but no offers shall induce me to forsake the duties of my calling  you mistake if you think i want anything unclerical  no occasion to huntmr tresham used in my dayno one thought the worse of himunlucky your taking orders  there is no use in entering on that point said james  no other course was left open to me and my profession cannot be taken up nor laid down as a matter of convenience  young men are taught to think more seriously than they were in our day said mrs frost  i told you that you must not try to make him turn squire  well well good living may be had perhaps  move to cheveleigh and look out for it at leisure if nothing else will content him  but well have this drudgery given up  ill not go home and show my nephew heir of the dynevors keeping a thirdrate grammarschool said oliver with his one remaining eton quality of contempt for provincial schools  the northwold scholar and master were both roused to arms in james  sir he said you should have thought of that when you left this heir of the dynevors to be educated by the charity of this thirdrate grammarschool  is this your gratitude sir passionately exclaimed oliver i who have toiled my whole life for your benefit might look for another return  it was not for me said james  it was for family pride  had it been from the affection that claims gratitude you would not have left your mother in her old age to labour unaided for the support of your brothers orphans  for ourselves i thank you the habits nurtured by poverty are the best education but i cannot let you suppose that a grand theatrical restoration can atone to me for thirty years neglect of my grandmother or that my gratitude can be extorted by benefactions at the expense of her past suffering  jem dear jem what are you saying cried mrs frost  dont you know how kindly your uncle meant  dont you know how happy we have been  you may forgive  you are his mother and you were injured but i can never forget what i have seen you undergo  you foolish boy to forget all our happiness  nor proceeded james can i consent to forego the career of usefulness that has been opened to me  but jem you could be so useful in the parish and your uncle could not wish you to do anything unhandsome by the trustees  i wish him to do nothing maam said oliver  if he is too high and mighty to accept a favour it is his own loss  we can do without him if he prefers the fitzjocelyn patronage  much good may it do him  james deigned no answer looked at his watch and found it time to return to the school  oliver broke out into angry exclamations and his mother did her utmost to soothe him  he had no turn for being a countrygentleman he was fit for nothing but his countinghouse and he intended to return thither as soon as he had installed his mother at cheveleigh and so entirely did all his plans hinge upon his nephew that even now he was persuaded to hold out his forgiveness on condition that james would apologize resign the school and call himself dynevor  mrs frost hoped that isabel would prevail on her husband to listen favourably but isabel gloried in his impracticability and would have regarded any attempt at mediation as an unworthy effort to turn him aside from the path of duty  she replied that she would never say a word to change his notions of right and she treated poor oliver with all the lofty reserve that she had formerly practised upon possible suitors  when fitzjocelyn came in the afternoon to take leave before his return to london mrs frost begged him to use his influence with james  who would have thought it would have so turned out she said  my poor oliver to be so met after all his generous plans and yet jem does want to do right  unfortunately louis felt that to own olivers generosity it was necessary to be out of sight of him and finding that there was silence and constraint in the drawingroom he asked isabel to walk with him to meet james  one breathes freely said she as they left the house  was there ever a more intolerable man  never was a man who made a more unlucky error in judgment  and that is all you call it  the spurious object warped the mind aside said louis  the grand idea was too exclusive and now he suffers for the exclusiveness  it is melancholy to see the cinder of a burntoffering to mammon especially when the offering was meant for better things  in this strain he chose to talk without coming to particulars till near the corner of the old square they met the shouting throng of boys and presently james himself descending the steps of the grim old grey building  i thought you would forgive me for coming to meet you under such an escort said isabel especially as it was to escape from our peruvian relative  poor man it was a great pity he did not come last year said louis  i am glad i have no temptation to bend to his will returned james  ha  i like the true core of the quarrel to display itself  fitzjocelyn you do not mean that you do not fully approve of the course i have taken  extremely magnanimous but not quite unprecedented  witness st ronans well where the younger scrogie abjures the name of mowbray  pshaw  louis cant you understand  frost is a glorious name to me recording my grandmothers noble exertions on our behalf but i can imagine it to be hateful to him recalling the neglect that made her slaving necessary  for which amiable reason you insist on obtruding it  pray are the houses henceforth to be frost terrace or arctic row  are you come to laugh or to remonstrate exclaimed james stopping  oh you want to put on your armour  certainly i should never tell if i were come to remonstrate nor should i venture in such a case  then you are come to approve said isabel  i knew it  little you two careeach of you sure of an admiring double  i care for your opinion as much as ever i did said james  exactly so said louis laughing  i desire to have your judgment in this matter  if i could judge i would said louis  i see you right in principle but are you right in spirit  i own my heart bleeds for aunt kitty regaining her son to battle with her grandson  i am very sorry for her said james but it cant be helped  i cannot resign my duties here for the sake of living dependent on a suitable allowance  ah jem jem  oliver little knew the damage his neglect did you  what damage  the fostering an ugly little imp of independence  aye you grandees have naturally a distaste for independence and make common cause against it  especially when in a rabid state  take care jem  independence never was a christian duty yet  then you want me to go and live on the hoards for the sake of which my grandmother was left to toil  you would like to see me loitering about pensioned to swell the vanity of cheveleigh neglecting my vows forsaking my duties  you unreasonable man  is there no way in this whole world for you to do your duty as a clergyman but hearing northwold boys the latin grammar  then what do you want me to do  i dont want you to do anything  you are the man to know what is right only isabel dont help him to hate people more than can possibly be avoided and dont break dear aunt kittys heart amongst you  thats what i care most about  when louis bade his aunt farewell he threw his arm round her neck looked fondly at her and said dear aunt you wont let them tease you  no my dear i am getting past being teased she said  vexations dont hurt me as much as love does me good and theyll not forget their affection  it is all goodness in jem and poor oliver will understand it when i have got him into our home ways again but he has been so long away from home poor fellow  thats right  i wont be uneasy for you  squabble as they will they wont hurt you but oh  dynevor terrace without you  ah you must come to me at home  home  im like jem jealous for this old house  it is odd how little i feel these things said his aunt  if any one had told me when i tore myself away from cheveleigh that i should have it back how little i should have thought that i could take it so easily  i wonder at myself when i wake in the morning that i am not more moved by it nor by leaving this dear old place i suppose it is because i have not long to stay anywhere  i can keep nothing in my head but that i have got my oliver  i believe it is the peace that is not of this world said louis     chapter vii  roland and oliver      twas old ancestral pride   twas hope to raise a fallen house     from penurys disgrace   to purchase back from usurers     the birthright of his race                        the lump of goldc mackay   marys letter arrived not long after louiss return to london and her calm serious beautifullyexpressed farewell came upon him at last like a blow which had been long impending but of which preparation had failed to lessen the weight  ah said the earl when the chief part had been read to him she is admirable and excellent as ever  it is a great disappointment that she is unattainable but i am glad she writes so sensibly and sees that it is right you should think no more about her  after all the connexion with that fellow ponsonby might have been very troublesome and it is well as she says that it was all over while you are so young  young or old there is no other mary in the world said louis sadly  we will say no more about it now  i understand you but you will think differently byandby  louis did not answer  he knew that others might have been deceived by the tardiness and uncertainty of his attachment but that it had taken such deep root that he believed he could no more detach himself from mary than if she were his wife  his heart fainted as he thought of years without the strength and soothing which her very letter breathed forth as he pictured to himself alternations between his chill and stately home and the weary maze of london foresaw persuasions from his father to induce him to form some new attachment and dreaded to think of the facility with which perhaps he might still be led out of his own convictions  yet he still believed that patience and perseverance would win the day and tried to derive encouragement and energy from the thought that this might be a trial sent for the very purpose of training him in steadfastness  a strong impulse drew him to bryanston square where miss ponsonby was very kind and warm the more so because she had discovered how much easier it had been to say than to unsay and strongly regretted the injustice she had done him  he had the satisfaction of talking for a good hour about mary and of sending a message that he did not write because he wished to be guided by her in everything and that he was striving to work so as to please her  the conversation ended with some good auguries as to the effect of olivers return to peru and louis went away cheered bearing the final dismissal better than his father had expected  lord ormersfield attributed his tranquillity to having his mind settled and so it was though not quite as his lordship imagined  meantime there was a lull at dynevor terrace  oliver was gone to take possession and furnish the mansion and mrs frosts great object was to keep the subject from irritating her grandson so as to save him from binding himself by any rash vows  cheveleigh was treated in the domestic circle with judicious silence olivers letters were read by his mother in private and their contents communicated to jane alone whose happiness was surpassing and her contempt for dynevor terrace quite provoking to poor mrs martha  really said charlotte one day i dont think a catastrophe is half so pretty as it ought to be  mr oliver is but a poor little puny man and i never knew mr james so hard to please  charlotte and marianne had begun to merge their rivalry in honest friendship cemented by mariannes increasing weakness and difficulty in getting through even the light work her mistress required  jane petted her now still more than charlotte and was always promising her the delightful air and the luxuries of cheveleigh  see here charlotte said marianne one afternoon when they sat down together to their sewing mariannes eyes were brighter and her cheeks pinker than for many dayssee here it is for your good i show it you that you maynt build on no false expectations  it was marked private but i think it but fair you should see  mine was marked private too said charlotte slowly as she fixed her eyes on the envelope marianne held out to her and putting her hand into her pocket pulled out a similar one directed to miss arnold  marianne scarcely suppressed a shriek gasped and turned pale  each lady then proceeded to unfold a pink sheet of notepaper containing an original copy of verses each labelled on a hair of   then came a scented shining note requesting to be informed whether the right construction had been put on some words that had dropped from the miss conways and if it were true that the reverend and respected mr f dynevor had come into a large fortune  in that case mr delaford mercenary considerations apart would take the earliest opportunity of resigning his present position and entering the family which contained his charmer  the merry wives were parodied by the hysterical maids  charlotte might afford to laugh but mariannes heart was more in the matter and they struck up such a chorus that jane broke upon them declaring that they would frighten mrs james frost out of her senses  when charlotte told her what was the matter her comment was and a very good thing too that you should find him out in time  a pair of silly girls you  i always was thankful i never could write to be deluded with nonsense by the post and i am more so than ever now come leave off crying marianne he aint worth it  but how shall we answer him mrs beckett said charlotte  never demean yourself to answer him said jane let him never hear nought about youthats the best for the like of him  i can tell him he need not be in no hurry about giving warning to lady conway at cheveleigh well have a solemn steady butler with no nonsense nor verses nor guitarsforty years oldand a married man  charlotte took the advice and acted with dignified contempt and silence relieved to imagine that tom had never been in danger from such a rival  marianne did not divulge the tender and melancholy letter of reproach that she posted privately but she grew paler and coughed more all that bright summer  mrs frost had refused to let any cause remove her from northwold until after an event which it was hoped would render james less disdainful of his inheritance  butwas there ever anything more contrary exclaimed jane as she prepared to set out the table for a grand tea  theres master james as pleased and proud of that there little brown girl as if she was as fine a boy as master henry himself i do believe upon my word it is all to spite poor dear master oliver  poor jane she was almost growing tart in her partizanship of oliver  the little brown girl was no dove of peace  her father decidedly triumphed in the mortification that her sex was to others of the family and though he averred that the birth of a son would not have made him change his mind he was well satisfied to be spared the attack which would have ensued  oliver like jane appeared to regard the poor child as a wilful offence and revenged himself by a letter announcing that clara would be his heiress information which mrs frost kindly withheld from her granddaughter in the hope of a reconciliation  lord ormersfield took james in hand undertaking to make him hear common sense but the sense was unfortunately too common and the authoritative manner was irritating above all when a stately warning was given that no churchpreferment was to be expected from his influence whereupon james considered himself insulted and they parted very stiff and grand the earl afterwards pronouncing that nothing was so wrongheaded as a conscientious man  but they were too much accustomed to be on respectfully quarrelsome terms to alter their regard for one retort more or less and after all there were very few men whom lord ormersfield liked or esteemed half so much as the fearless and uncompromising james frostjames frostas he curtly signed himself in spite of all louiss wit on rolands and oliversand yet those soft satirical speeches did more than all direct attacks to shake his confidence in his own magnanimity more especially because fitzjocelyn always declared himself incompetent to judge and never failed to uphold that he was so far right that his ministry must stand above all worldly considerations  the breach had become so wide that oliver would not have accepted the terms he had formerly offered  his object seemed to be to pique his nephew and niece by showing them what they had lost  he wrote the most magnificent descriptions of cheveleigh and insisted that his mother and clara should come and take possession on the eightieth birthday of the former the 14th of september and isabel was recovering so rapidly that there was nothing to oppose to his project although the new catharine would be scarcely three weeks old by that time  thereupon came down addressed to clara a case of peruvian jewels newly set in londonintended doubtless to excite great jealousy in her sisterinlaw  poor oliver could he but have known that isabel only glanced at them to tell clara the names of the ornaments and to relieve her mind by assurances that the whole of a set need not be worn at once  next arrived an exceedingly smart french milliner who by the help of jane and marianne got clara into her toils and pinned and measured her for a whole mortal morning and even grandmamma ordered a black velvet gown and accompaniments  lastly there descended on claras devoted head a cheque for a sum which terrified her imagination and orders to equip herself suitably as miss dynevor of cheveleigh who was to enjoy the same allowance halfyearly  her first idea was what delightful presents could be made to every one but as she was devising showers of gifts for her niece james cut her shorti am sorry to give you pain clara but it must be understood that neither directly nor indirectly can i nor mine receive anything bought with my uncles money  that was the only thing to make me not hate it  it is best you should hate it  i do  why did he come home to bother us  oh jem cant i still live here and only visit there  no clara  the care of granny is your first duty and during her life so long as you are single her home must be yours  the edict was given in stern selfabnegation but james was very kind to her treating her as a victim and spending his leisure in walking about with her that she might take leave of every favourite haunt he was indulgent enough even to make no objection to going with her to ormersfield where she wandered about the park visited old scenes with louis and went over all his improvements  his cottages had as yet the sole fault of looking too new and one of his tenants would not shut up his pigs but otherwise all was going on well and inglewood was in the excitement of louiss first harvest  he walked about with ears of wheat in his hand talked knowingly of loads and acres and had almost taught his father to watch the barometer  it added to claras regrets that she should miss the harvestsupper for which he and mr holdsworth had wonderful designs but it was not to take place until fitzjocelyns return from cheveleigh  oliver had invited him and his father to conduct mrs frost thither and add eclat to her reception and this as clara said was the only comfort in the business  james had effectually destroyed all pleasure on her part and had made the change appear an unmitigated misfortune even though she did not know what she would have thought the worst  congratulations were dreadful to her and it was all that isabel could do to persuade her to repress her dislike so as not to distress her grandmother  to mrs frost it was pain to leave what she owned with thankful tears to have been a happy peaceful refuge for her widowhood and poverty she grieved over each parting clung to the faithfulls reiterated fond counsels to isabel and could hardly bear to detach herself from the greatgrandchild  but still it was her own son and her own home and oliver and cheveleigh were more to her than even james and dynevor terrace so that though she was sorry it was not with a melancholy sorrow and she could still hope against hope that uncle and nephew might be brought together at last and that a son of james would yet reign in the dear old place  besides she had not time to be unhappy  she was fully employed nursing isabel doing honour to the little one answering olivers letters superintending claras wardrobe choosing parting gifts for innumerable friends high and low and making arrangements for the inexperienced household  janes place was to benot exactly supplied but occupied by a cook miss dynevor was to have a personal attendant and mrs beckett begged that marianne might be chosen since she could not bear to see the poor thing sent away when in so much need of care  the diamonds the french millinery and janes motherly care came in strong contrast to the miserable lodging or the consumptive hospital which poor marianne had begun to anticipate and weeping with gratitude she declared that she had never seen nor thought of such kindness since her mother died  isabel seldom roused herself to understand anything about her servants but she liked marianne and was glad clara should have her since she was not strong enough to undertake nursery cares  she believed it had not agreed with her to sit up late  compunction for having been the cause had never dawned on isabels mind  charlotte was to remain at dynevor terrace james and isabel wished to keep her and mrs beckett thought her sufficiently indoctrinated with her ways to have some chance of going on well  besides as jane said i cant be accountable for taking her into that large family until i see what company there may be  shes a wellbehaved girl enough but shes too pretty and too simplelike for me to have her among the common run of servants  ill see what i can do for her when i see what sort of a housekeeper it is  and jane gave charlotte infinite injunctions varying from due care of the chaney images to reserve with mankind  because you see charlotte she said youll be terribly forsaken  mrs james poor dearshe would not know if the furniture werent rubbed once in ten years but you must make it a pride to yourself to be faithful  i am faithful cried charlotte  i never cared for that traitor delaford and his guitar but i could not get rid of him  and ill tell you whatill seal up his fine red book and all his verses and you shall leave them in london as you go through with my compliments i think that will be proper and scornful  hoitytoity  thats what shes at  the best thing you can do too charlotte and im glad that youve too much spirit to pine like poor marianne  id take my affidavit that if the crowner could sit upon her when she diesand die she willthat there fine gentleman and his guitar will be found at the bottom of her chest  but dont go off about that nowthough tis the reason i wont part from the poor thing till i can helpthe better luck for you that youd got more in your head than vanities and furbelows  what i meant was not being faithful to him out in peruthats your own affair but the being faithful to your duty to your mistress whether shes after you or not  you know what a good servant is and youve got to show it aint all eyeservice  charlotte cried heartily  no one else was allowed that privilege when the 13th came excepting mrs frost herself  james afraid that a scene would hurt his wife severely forbade clara to give way and the poor girl mute and white did as she was told and ventured not a word of farewell though her embraces were convulsive and when she went down stairs she could not help kissing charlotte  james handed his grandmother to her seat in the carriage which was to take her to the station  goodbye my dear she said i know the day will come when all this will be made up  you know how i have loved you both  i wish my uncle all good  i see it now she said holding his hand between both of hers  it is my fault  i fostered our family pride  may god take away the sin from us both  the words were hardly articulate through tears and perhaps james did not hear  he hurried clara down the garden and into the carriage and she had her last nod from miss faithfull at the open window miss mercy was at the station whither schoolhours had hindered james from accompanying them but where they found lord ormersfield and louis  the warmhearted little woman was all tears and smiles  oh dear mrs frost i am so sorry and yet it is selfish  i am so happy but where shall we find such another neighbour  come and see us  you know you are to persuade your sister  ah  she shook her head  salome is hard to move  but youyou are such a travelleryou will come to see mr james  im eighty tomorrow i little expect to make any more journeys except one mercy  i never look to see poor northwold more but it has been a place of blessings to me and you have been one of them dont think im too glad to go away but i cannot but be thankful that my dear boy is bringing me home to lay me down where my father and his father lie  it was said with that peculiar cheerfulness with which happy old age can contemplate the end of the pilgrimage and she looked at louis with a sunny smile     chapter viii  the restoration    when silent time wi lightly foot     had trod on thirty years   i sought again my native land     wi mony hopes and fears   as i drew near my ancient pile     my heart beat a the way   the place i passed seemed yet to speak     of some dear former day   some pensy chiels a newsprung race     wad next their welcome pay                    but sair on ilka wellkenned face     i missed the youthful bloom                          miss blamire   oliver had sent orders to his mother to sleep in london and proceed the next morning by a train which would arrive at about two oclock  on that eventful morning clara was the prey of mrs beckett marianne and the french milliner and in such a flounced glace silk such a lace mantle and such a flowery bonnet was she arrayed that lord ormersfield bowed to her as a stranger and louis talked of the transformations of the giraffe  is it not humiliating she said to be so altered by finery  you might dress isabel for ever and her nobleness would surmount it all  if you are not the rose at least you have lived near the rose said louis  you dont fall quite short of the character of miss dynevor  i wish i were going to school said clara as they passed along familiar streets then at least some one would pity me  after two hours spent on the railroad the train entered a district with the bleakness but not the beauty of the neighbourhood of mountains the fresh september breeze was laden with smoke and stations stood thick upon the line  as the train dashed up to one of these a flag was seen waving and the shout of cheveleigh cheveleigh road greeted them  on the platform stood a tall footman in the most crimson of coats powdered hair and a stupendous crimson and white shoulderknot auch as clara had only seen going to st jamess  she would never have imagined that she had any concern with such splendour but her grandmother asked him if the carriage were there as a mere matter of course and jane devolved on him all luggage cares as coolly as if she had been ruling over him all his life  as they issued from the station a thin uncertain boyish cheer rang out and before them stood a handsome open carriage and four chestnut horses with crimson postillions and huge crimsonandwhite satin rosettes  wont they all turn to rats and pumpkins whispered clara to louis  bless the poor boy cried mrs frost between laughing and crying what has he been about  does he think i am the sheriffs lady still  the party entered the carriage and the crowd of little boys and girls flymen and porters got up another hurrah as the four horses went thundering off with mrs frost apologizingpoor olivers notions were on such a grand scalehe had been so long absent that he did not know how much these things had been disused but no one could look at her bright tearful eyes and quivering mouth without seeing that she exulted in her sons affection and his victory and after all it was natural to her and a resumption of old habits  they drove through two miles of brown flat heath with faraway mountain outlines which she greeted as dear friends  here and there the enginehouse of a mine rose up among shabby buildings and byandby was seen a square churchtower with lofty pinnacles among which floated forth a flag  the old lady caught hold convulsively of claras handthe old churchmy old churchsee clara that is where your dear grandfather liesmy last home  with brimming eyes mrs frost gazed on it as it came forth more distinctly and clara looked with a sense of awe but rending her away from grave thoughts shouts burst upon her ears and above them the pealing crash of all the bells as they dashed under a splendid triumphal arch all evergreens and dahlias forming the word welcome and were met by a party on horseback waving their hats while a great hurrah burst out from the numbers who lined the street mrs frost bowed her thanks and waved her hand  but oh she said almost sobbing where am i  this is not cheveleigh  lord ormersfield showed her a few old houses that they both recognised looking antiquated in the midst of a modern growth of narrow conceited new tenements  the shouting crowd had to fitzjocelyns eyes more the aspect of a rabble than of a genuine rejoicing peasantry  what men there were looked beerattracted rather than reputable and the main body were whooping boys women nursegirls and babies  the suspicion crossed him that it was a new generation without memories of forty years since wondering rather than welcoming in spite of arches bells and shouts  after another halfmile a gate swung wide beneath another arch all over c d the f studiously omitted and the carriage wheeled in amid a shower of tight little nosegays from a squadron of schoolchildren they drove up the long approach through fir plantations which drew from mrs frost a cry of friendly recognitionfor her husband had planted them but they had not taken kindly to the soil and fifty years had produced but a starveling growth  beyond lay an expanse of parched brown turf here and there an enclosure of unprosperous trees and full in front stood the wide space of stuccoed wall with a great gothic window full in the midst and battlements in the castellated style of the early years of the nineteenth century  no one spoke  after the first glance mrs frost shut her eyes to restrain the hot tears that arose at the thought of the wintry morning when icedrops hung hoary on the firtrees as she had driven away from the portal whence music was now pealing forth a greeting and where oliver was standing on the very spot where with clenched hand he had vowed that all should be restored  alas how much was in his power to restore  gailydressed people surrounded the entrance and amid triumphant strains from the band the carriage stopped and oliver held out his hand saying welcome home mother  she leant forward kissed his brow and suffered him to lead her up the steps to the halldoor lord ormersfield conducting clara  at the door mrs frost paused to turn curtsey and sign her thanks to the throng who had followed  her noble aspect and demeanour so full of dignity and feeling obtained a fresh and more genuine acclamation but throughout there was a strange sense of unreality she seemed like one performing a part to gratify her son  clara asked her cousin if it were not like acting a play and it was plain to him that the spectators beheld it with more curiosity than sympathy  they were a new race  property had changed hands rapidly in a region of trade and manufacture and the old dynevor name had been forgotten past recall amid the very population who were thriving upon the identical speculations which had swamped mr frosts fortune  if the crowd without looked like a mob the assembly within had a parvenu appearance and as oliver handed his mother across the hall he muttered something as if he were disappointed both in the number and consequence of his guests  he led her into a magnificent apartment all gilding blue brocade and mirrors as far as might be after the model of the days of the shrievalty but the bare splendour could ill recall the grace and elegance that had then reigned there without effort  peru had not taught oliver taste either of the eye or of the mind and his indefatigable introductionsmy mother mrs dynevor my niece miss dynevor lord ormersfield lord fitzjocelyn came so repeatedly as quite to jingle in their ears  sir andrew britton a burly cotton lord with a wife in all the colours of the rainbow seemed to be the grand guest  his lady seated herself beside mrs frost and began to tell her with a tone of patronage how good a neighbourhood it was and how much pleasure she should have in introducing miss dynevor  in vain did mrs frost look for a face she knew and inquire from her new acquaintance after familiar old names of places and people  the places were either become factories or some charming new family lived there and for the people it seemed as if she might as well ask for antediluvians lady britton had seldom heard their names or if any trace survived they had never been on her visiting list  at last oliver came up to her saying here maam mr henderson claims an early acquaintance with you  mr henderson and she eagerly started up but looked baffled  little george henderson said the greyheaded gentlemanfor once a real gentlemani assure you i have not forgotten the happy days i have spent here  little george as she took him by both handswho would have thought it  you were little george with the apple cheeks  and are no more of you here  he shook his head sadly  they would have been even more glad than i am to welcome you home they were older and knew you better  ah  i must learn to ask no questions  and yet that dear sister fanny of yours  gone many years since maam  she died in india  i hope my daughter fanny may put you a little mind of her  is she not here  why no  i wished to bring her but she is but fifteen and mamma will not trust her out without herself  we are quiet people and the world is growing too gay for us  clara and i must come to find you out  can you believe this tall creature is poor dear henrys daughter as clara hastened to greet her fathers playfellow with an alacrity which piqued lady britton into a supercilious aside to lord fitzjocelyn that the hendersons were in poor circumstances and no one visited them  and is no one here whom i know  not one of the old set george asked the old lady mournfully  i fear there is hardly any one said mr henderson  all seem even to me new people  stay do you recollect old mrs golding  after a little confusion mr hendersons old mrs golding proved to be mrs frosts young mrs golding and on the eager inquiry whether she were present ensued the melancholy answer that she was deaf and infirm only just able to smile with pleasure at the tidings of her old friends restoration and the daughter whom she could only just believe to be grown up was a worn elderly woman  not even the one heartfelt greeting was without sadness and clara likewise met with one solitary satisfaction and that a very mixed one  mr danvers the young curate whom oliver had not thought worth presenting was hailed by fitzjocelyn as if their slight oxford acquaintance had been an intimacy and was by him introduced to clara as belonging to jamess college  she frankly held out her hand but was discomfited by his inquiry for her brother whom he had hoped to meet  louis said something about not expecting the schoolmaster abroad in the halfyear and clara was not at all grateful to him for relieving her from the embarrassment but regarded the reply as a shabby prevarication and was much inclined to speak out but louis was drawing the curate into conversation about the population and hearing but a desponding history  it was interrupted when oliver after waiting in vain for more distinguished company began to marshal his guests to the grand hall paved with black and white marble and with a vast extent of wall and window decked with evergreens flags and mottoes  here a cold collation was prepared with a band in a musicgallery above and all the et ceteras dear to county papers  oliver himself handed in lady britton his mother fell to the lot of the earl and fitzjocelyn received orders to conduct a handsome young giggling mrs smithers who never having been in contact with a live lord wanted to make the most of him and before she had arrived at her place was declaring that it was a most interesting occasion just like a scene at the opera  louis glanced back to see what became of clara and finding her following with sir andrew britton contrived to sit immediately opposite to her at the long narrow table with nothing between them but a couple of cold chickens and a tongue garnished with transfixed crayfish  his eyes were perhaps a greater support to her than even conversation for she gathered a little philosophy and charity from their cheering smile and arch twinkling and she managed to listen civilly to her neighbour while she saw that her cousin was being very polite to mrs smithers  she was a great way from all other friends for the table had been spread for a more numerous assembly and the company sat in little clusters with dreary gaps between where moulds of jelly quaked in vain and lobstersalads wasted their sweetness on the desert air  her uncle could just be seen in the far perspective at the head of the table and between him and the earl louis descried his aunt catharine looking bright with a little embellishing flush on her withered cheek  sir andrew was not a ladys man and after he had heard how far miss dynevor had come today that she had never ridden and had not seen the menai tubular bridge he discontinued the difficult task and she finding that he had not even seen the cathedral which she had passed only fifteen miles off gave him up and occupied herself with watching the infinite variety of affectations which mrs smithers was playing off and the grave diversion with which louis received them the lady was evidently trying to discover what had been the intermediate history of mrs and miss dynevor and louis was taking pleasure in baffling her with cool quiet answers especially when she came to the question whether miss dynevor had not a brother and why he was not present  it appeared that oliver had made almost as if his mother had been buried and dug up again involving the thirtyfour years of her exile in such utter mystery that people had begun to make all sorts of wild stories to account for her proceedings and lord fitzjocelyns explanation that she had lived in her own house in northwold and taught him the latin grammar seemed quite a disappointment from the simplicity and want of romance  the weary banquet had arrived at ices and clara hoped the end was near when the worse trial of speeches began  mr henderson was declaring how strongly he felt the honour which had been devolved on him of expressing the universal joy in having so excellent and muchbeloved a neighbour restored by the noble exertions of her son he said all that the rest of the world ought to have felt and so heartily and sincerely as to make every one imagine the whole the general sentiment and the welcoming hurrah was cordial and joyous mrs frost was deeply touched and gratified and lord ormersfield congratulated himself on having instigated oliver to give this toast to mr henderson  if clara could have driven james from her mind she would have been delighted but there could be no triumph for her where he was excluded  the earl returned thanks on behalf of his aunt and said a great deal that could have come from the mouth of no one unaccustomed to public speaking ending by proposing the health of mr oliver frost dynevor  in the midst of the fine old english gentleman while louis was suppressing a smile at the incongruity a note was brought to him which he tossed to clara purporting that he was to return thanks for her  she bent over the table to say you will say nothing i cannot bear to hear folded her hands and shut her eyes as if she had been going to stand fire  olivers clear harsh tones incapable of slowness or solemnity began to return thanks for himself and pronounce this to be the happy day to which he had been looking throughout his lifethe day of restoring the family inheritance to his mother and the child of his elder brother he falteredhe never could calmly speak of henry failing the presence of one so dear he rejoiced however to be able to introduce to them his only daughter and he begged that his friends would drink the health of the heiress of cheveleigh miss dynevor  never did toast apparently conduce so little to the health of the subject  unprepared as clara was for such a declaration it was to her as if she had been publicly denounced as the supplanter of her brother she became deadly white and sat bolt upright stiff and motionless barely stifling a scream and her eyes fixed between command and entreaty on her cousin without seeing far less acknowledging the bows levelled at her  louis alarmed by her looks saw that no time was to be lost and rising hastily before any one was ready perilled his fame for eloquence by rapidly assuring the gentlemen and ladies that miss dynevor was truly sensible of the kindness of their welcome and their manner of receiving the toast then pushing back his chair with never mind to mrs smithers and her scentbottle he was at the back of claras chair almost before her confused eyes had missed him in her gasps for breath and impulse to do something desperate and so she might if his voice had not been in her ear his hand grasping hers both to console and raise her  clara come take care  she obeyed but trembling so much that he was obliged to support her  others would have risen in alarm but he silenced them by signs and entreaties that no one would frighten her grandmother  there was a large glass door standing open under the gothic window and through it he led her out upon a wide green lawn  she drew her breath in sobs but could not speak  louis asked her to untie her bonnet and touched the string which was merely a streamer  this brought a kind of laugh but she unfastened the bonnet herself and the first use she made of her breath was fiercely to exclaimhow could you  why did you not tell them i never will  sit down said louis gently  let me fetch some water  nonolet me get away from this place and she almost dragged him along as fresh cheers and peals of music broke out till they had entered a lonely walk in a sort of wilderness of shrubs  still she hurried on till they came out on a quiet little garden where the tinkling of a little fountain was the only sound the water looked clear and fresh with the goldfish darting in it and the sun shone calmly on the bright flowers and wavy ferns adorning the rockwork  what are you doing clara  you must rest here said he drawing her down on a rustic bench intended to represent a crocodile  i cant rest here  i must go home  im going home to jem she exclaimed obeying however because though she could run she could not stand  dear clara he said affectionately it was much worse than i expected  i never believed he could have committed himself to such an open declaration especially without warning  ill not stay cried clara with all the vehemence of her dynevor nature  ill go straight home to northwold tomorrow morningtonight if i could  yes i will  i never came here for this  and what is to become of my poor aunt kitty  she has her oliver  she would not have me put jem out of his birthright  james will not be put into it  she wrenched away her hand and looked at him with all her brothers fierceness  and you she cried why could not you speak up like a man and tell them that i thank none of them and will have nothing to say to any of them and that if this is to belong to any one it must be to my noble my glorious generous brother and if he hasnt it it may go to the queen for what i care  ill never have one stone of it why could you not say so instead of all that humbug  i thought the family had afforded quite spectacles enough for one day said louis and besides i had some pity upon your grandmother and on your uncle too  jem told me grandmamma claimed my first duty but he never knew of this wicked plan  yes he did  knew that i was to supplant him  yes we all knew it was a threat of your uncle but we spared you the knowledge thinking that all might yet be accommodated and never expecting it would come on you in this sudden way  then i think i have been unfairly used cried clara i have been brought here on false pretences  as if i would have come near the place if i had known it  a very false pretence that your grandmother must not be left alone at eighty by the child whom she brought up  oh louis you want to tear me to pieces  i have pity on my aunt i have far more pity on your uncle  clara stared at him  here is a man who started with a grand heroic purpose to redeem the estate not for himself but for her and his brother he exiles himself he perseveres till this one pursuit for which he denies himself home kindred wife or child absorbs and withers him up  he returns to find his brother dead and the children for whom he sacrificed all set against him and rejecting his favours  this was quite a new point of view to clara  it is his own fault she said  that a misfortune is by our own fault is no comfort said louis his apparent neglect after all arose from his absorption in the one object  yes but how shameful to wish james to forget his ordination  a strong way of putting it  he asked too much but he would have been and may yet be contented with concessions involving nothing wrong  his way of life can hardly have taught him to appreciate jamess scruples as we do and even if right and wrong were more neatly partitioned between them than i think they are it would still be hard on him to find this destined heir spurning his benefits  what are you coming to louis  you think james right  i would give the world to think so clara  one motive is too high for praise the otherno i will say nothing of it  but i could wish i had not precipitated matters last year  what would you have robbed us of our few happy months  it was your uncle whom i robbed he would otherwise have come home like a good genius but he found you all happy without him and with no gratitude to spare for him  and there he sits at the head of that long melancholy table trying to bring back days that have gone too far ever to be recalled and only raising their spectres in this mocking finery scarcely one man present whose welcome comes from his heart his mother past the days of heeding the display except for his sake his nephew rejecting him you indignant and miserable oh clara  i never saw more plainly money given for that which is not bread and labour for that which satisfieth not  empty and hollow as the pageant was i could better bear to take my part in it so far as truth would let me than tell that poor man that the last of his brothers children rejects him and his benefits  at this rate you will make a hero of uncle oliver  it is because he is one of this worlds heroes that he is distasteful to you  i dont understand  exclusive devotion to one object grand though it was has made him the man he appears to us  think what the spirit must have been that conceived and carried out such a design  depend upon it there is a greatness in him which may show when as dear granny says she has cured him of all he learnt away from home  i think that must be the work for which you are all brought together here  but i cant thrust out jem  i wont stay here on those terms  i shall protest  it is not graceful to make an uproar about your own magnanimity nor to talk of what is to happen after a mans death  you dont come here to be heiress but to take care of your grandmother  there is no need to disturb the future unless to be sure you were obliged to explain your expectations  ah to be sure any way i could restore it all to james  or better still you may yet be able to draw the uncle and nephew together and bring back peace and union  then i must stay and bear all this you think  as a mere matter of obedience certainly  claras countenance fell  that may deprive it of the brilliance of a voluntary sacrifice but after all it is what makes your course safe and plain  and very dismal just because no one will believe so  so the safer for humility said louis  perhaps the dear old terrace did not offer training and trial enough  i try to believe something of the kind in my own case  if choice had been mine i should hardly have been exactly what i am and you know how my chief happiness has been put far from me but i can imagine that to be at the summit of my wishes might foster my sluggishness and that i might rest too much on better judgment than my own if it were beside me  probation maybe safer than joy and you may do more good to yourself and others than even under isabels wing  only think of the means in your hands and all the wretched population round  there will be some hope of help for the curate nowbesides i shall know where to come for subscriptions next time i run crazy about any wonderful charity  clara smiled  i suppose i must bear it she said  for shame clara  with aunt kitty who would make a palace of a dungeon in the glorious glow of such a sunset turning each cloud to red and purple radiance by the very force of love and faith who could regret the being beside her  my own dear and precious aunt to see her so happy with bliss and peace so undisturbed so far above these toys and these distresses gives me a sort of fear  oh dont louis  they were interrupted by approaching voices  clara hastily started up as her uncle and lady britton appeared in the green alley  oh must i go back to them all  my head does ache  louis gave her his arm pursued the path in the opposite direction and emerged at the lower end of the bowlinggreen with the battlemented front of the house rising before them  presently he met his father searching for him  poor clara has been overcome he said in explanation  the speechifying has been too much for her  it was the first time that clara had appeared to the earl in any light but that of an idle schoolgirl and he said kindly it must have been very trying  there should have been more preparation your uncle would have shown better taste in sparing your grandmamma so obtrusive a reception and i was much pained both for her and for you during some of the speeches  sympathy from lord ormersfield nearly overthrew clara again and she involuntarily squeezed louiss arm  he asked for his aunt and was told she is in the house entertaining these people  they do not know when to go away  how could oliver inflict such a party on her and such a style of people  i must go and help her said louis  clara was in no condition to appear but louis caused mrs beckett to be summoned and committed her to her care  her transport was one of the few pleasant things of that day  oh miss clara  oh my lord was there ever the like  isnt master oliver the most blessed boy missus in her own home again  eight men and a french mancook  if ever i thought to see the day  her old room just as it was only grander  oh if poor mr james was but here  ay jane and heres clara thinking herself ill about mr james take her up and give her some tea and make her fit to behave prettily byandby that granny may not be vexed  having seen her safe under janes fondling care and infectious exultation he betook himself to the drawingroom relieved his aunts anxiety by a whisper and won golden opinions from the whole company before they were fairly got rid of and oliver begged to conduct his mother to her apartment  yes my dear i must go to poor little clara  ive no fears for clara said oliver as he led her upstairs knowing young fellow to wait for my announcement  i can give her near double what ponsonby could id not objectold dynevor blood  my poor oliver you have so learnt to think of money that you cant believe others live for anything else  youll learn your mistake  you think the young chap meant nothing  i shall look sharp after him then  i look on clara as my own  ill have no trifling  you may save yourself the trouble said his mother  they understand each otherthey have always been like brother and sister and i cannot have the children teased or things put into their heads  oliver laughed his scornful chuckle and said he did not understand that sort of brother and sister but happily he became absorbed in showing his mother the fittings of her splendid bedroom  clara had the comfort of clinging round her grandmothers neck and being told that it was all nonsense  jem should have his rights and uncle oliver would learn to love and honour him at last and she was a good child and ought to have been prepared if granny could have guessed he would do it so publicly and suddenly but she must forgive him for he was beside himself at having got them home again and he could not make enough of her because she was poor henrys child  so she saw granny must not be grieved and she let herself be dressed for a constrained dinner in the vast diningroom where the servants outnumbered the diners and the silver covers bore the dynevor dragon as a handle looking as spiteful as some of the race could do  oliver was obliged to conclude that no offer had passed between the two young people but on the way home next morning the earl observed clara frost has a fine figure and is much improved by dress  she shows excellent feeling and does credit to her education  the pendragon blood never had a finer development said louis  even supposing justice done to poor james she will have a handsome portion  oliver will have far more to dispose of than the five thousand pounds guaranteed to her  poor child said louis  yes i pity her for being exposed to his parading  he forgot the gentleman in his merchants office  if you should ever have any thoughts of rescuing her from him my approval would not be wanting and it would be the easiest way of restoring her brother  my dear father if clara and i were always sister and brother when she was poor we certainly shall be no more now  lord ormersfield mentally execrated mr ponsonby and felt that he had spoken too soon  janes felicity was complete when a few days after she received addressed in lord fitzjocelyns handwriting an illustrated news with a whole page containing the reception of mrs dynevor of cheveleigh with grand portraits of all the flounces and veils many gratuitous moustaches something passing for oliver standing up with a wineglass in his hand a puppy that would have perfectly justified mr ponsonbys aversion representing lord fitzjocelyn and no gaps at the banquettable  that picture mrs beckett caused to be framed and glazed kept it as her treasure for life and put it into her will as a legacy to charlotte arnold     chapter ix  the giant of the western star    come let us range the subterranean vast   dark catacombs of ages twilight dells   and footmarks of the centuries long past   which look on us from their sepulchral cells    then glad emerge we to the cheering day   some sunranged height or alpine snowy crown   or chimborazo towering far away   oer the great andes chain and looking down   on flaming cordilleras mountain thrown   oer mountain vast new realms                    the creationrev i williams   the same impression of the illustrated london news which delighted jane becketts simple heart in england caused no small sensation at lima  dona rosita cast one glance at el visconde there portrayed and then became absorbed in claras bonnet mr robson pronounced lord ormersfield as good a likeness as mr dynevor mr ponsonby cast a scornful look and smile at the unlucky figure representing fitzjocelyn and not a critical voice was heard excepting tom madisons who indignantly declared that they had made the young lord look as if he had stood behind a counter all his life  the juxtaposition of lord fitzjocelyn and mr dynevors niece was not by any means forgotten  it looked very like a graceful conclusion to olivers exertions that he should crown their union and the county paper which had likewise been forwarded very nearly hinted as much mr ponsonby took care that the paragraph should be laid in his daughters way and he offered her the sight of oliver dynevors own letter  mary suspected that he regarded it as something conclusive and took care to read it when there were no eyes to mark her emotions ormersfield and his son were there wrote oliver  the young man is not so soft as he looks  they tell me he is going to work sensibly at the estate and he has a sharp eye for the main chance i hear he played fast and loose till he found your daughter had better prospects than miss conway whom my fool of a nephew chose to marry and now he is making up to my niece  my mother dotes on him and i shall make no objectionno extravagance that i can see and he will take care of the property  you will take no offence since you refuse the tender altogether  of this mary believed two sentencesnamely that aunt catharine doted on fitzjocelyn and that he was not so soft as he looked which she took as an admission that he was not comporting himself foolishly  she was quite aware that the friendship between him and clara might deceive an uninitiated spectator and though she commanded herself to think that an attachment between them would be equally natural and desirable she could not but look with great satisfaction at the easy unsuspicious tone of mrs frosts letter which after mentioning with much affection and gratitude all olivers attempts to make her happy in spite of the many sad changes around ended by saying that poor clara felt the separation from her brother so much that without dear louis she did not know how she would have gone through the festivities  you can guess how he is everything to us all said aunt kitty and i brightened up his looks with giving him your last letter to read  i dare say miss mary you would like to scold me  aunt kitty  aunt kitty you dearly loved a little kindly mischief let that be as it might mr ponsonby thought that mr dynevors letter had certainly not had much effect for mary was more lively and cheerful than he had seen her since her first arrival  marys cheerfulness was becoming the more necessary to him since he was beginning a little to weary of the childish charms of his young limenian wife  rosita had neither education nor conversation and when all her pretty ways had been tried on him in succession they began to grow tedious  moreover the playful submission which she had brought from her convent was beginning to turn into wilfulness her extravagances in dress were appalling  she refused to wear the same dresses twice and cried stamped her graceful foot and pouted when he remonstrated  she managed to spend every evening in amusement either at the opera or at evening parties where her splendid eyes and scraps of broken english made great havoc among young lieutenants and midshipmen visiting lima mr ponsonby was growing tired of these constant gaieties and generally remained at home sending mary in his stead as a sort of guard over her and mary always the same in her white muslin followed rosita through all the salas of limalistened to the confidences of limenian beautiestalked of england to little naval cadets more homesick than they would have chosen to avowand felt sure of some pleasure and interest for the evening when mr ward came to stand by her chair  one afternoon as mary sat in her window reading a gay voice exclaimed beso las manos a usted and looking up she saw one of the prettiest figures imaginable  a full dark purple satin skirt just revealed the point of a dainty white satin shoe  it was plaited low on the hips and girded loosely with a brightly striped scarf the head and upper part of the person were shrouded in a close hood of elastic black silk webbing fastened behind at the waist and held over the face by the hand which just allowed one beringed finger and one glancing dark eye to appear while the other hand held a fan and a laced pockethandkerchief  so perfectly did the costume suit the air and shape of the lady that as she stood among marys orange trees it was like an illusion of the fancy but consternation took away all the charm from marys eyes  tapada she cried you surely are not going out tapada  ah you have found me out cried rosita  yes indeed i am and i have the like saya y manto ready for you  come we will be on the alameda xavier waits to attend us  your senor ouard will be at his evening walk  but mary drew back  this pretty disguise was a freak such as only the most gay ladies permitted themselves and she had little doubt that her father would be extremely displeased at his wife and daughter so appearing although danger there was none since though any one might accost a female thus veiled not the slightest impertinence was ever allowed  mary implored bosita to wait till mr ponsonbys views should be known but she was only laughed at for her english precision and the pretty creature danced away to her stolen pleasure  she came in all glory and delight at the perplexity in which she had involved the english officers the guesses and courtesies of her own countrymen and her mystification of mr robson who had evidently recognised her though pretending to treat her as a charming stranger  the triumph was of short duration  for the first time she had aroused one of mr ponsonbys gusts of passion she quailed under it wept bitterly and made innumerable promises and then she put on her black mantilla and with xavier behind her went to her convent chapel and returned half crying over the amount of repetitions of her rosary by which her penance was to be performed and thereby all sense of the fault put away  responsibility and reflection never seemed to be impressed on that childish mind  mary had come in for some of the anger for not having prevented rositas expedition but they were both speedily forgiven and mary never was informed again of her using the saya y manto  their minds were diverted by the eager desire of one of the young officers to visit the silver mines  it had been an old promise to mary from her father to take her to see them but in her former residence in peru it had never been fulfilled  he now wished to inspect matters himself in order to answer the numerous questions sent by oliver and rosita eagerly catching at any proposal which promised a variety a party was made up for ascending to the san benito mines some days journey from lima  mary and rosita were the only ladies but there were several gentlemen three naval officers and mr ward who was delighted to have an opportunity of visiting the wonders which had been for many years within his reach without his rousing himself from his business to see them  tents bedding and provisions were to be carried with them and mary had full occupation in stimulating dolores to bring together the requisite preparations while mr ward and robson collected guides muleteers and litters  it was a merry party seated on the gailytrapped mules with an idle young midshipman to make mischief and all in spirits to enjoy his nonsense in the exhilaration of the mountain air blowing freshly from the snowy summits which seemed to rise like walls before them the steaming misty relaxing atmosphere of lima was left behind and with it many a care and vexation  mr ponsonby brought his mule to the side of his wifes litter and exchanged many a joke in anglospanish with her and the lieutenant and mr ward his brow unfurrowed from countinghouse cares walked beside marys mule gathered each new flower for her and listened to her narrative of some of the causes for which she was glad with her own eyes to see tom madison in his scene of action  the first day of adventure they slept at a hacienda surrounded with fields where numerous llamas were pasturing  the next began the real mountain work the rock looked like a wall before them and the white summits were sharply defined against the blue sky  the sharper air made rosita shiver but the english travellers congratulated themselves on something like a breeze consoling them for the glow with which the sunbeams beat upon the rocks  the palms and huge ferns had given place to pines and these were growing more scanty once or twice they met a brown indian robed in a coloured blanket with a huge straw hat from beneath which he gazed with curious though gentle eyes upon the cavalcade  byandby looking like a string of ants descending a perpendicular wall mary beheld a row of black specks slowly moving she was told that these were the mules bringing down the metal in panniersthe only means of communication until as the lieutenant promised a perpendicular railroad should be invented  the electricity of the atmosphere made jokes easily pass current  the mountain was only one of the spurs of the andes a mere infant among the giants but had it been set down in europe mont blanc must have hid his diminished head and the view was better than on some of the more enormous neighbours which were both further inland and of such height that to gaze from them was like looking from an airballoon into vacancy  whereas here mary had but to turn her head as her mule steadily crept round the causewaya legacy of the incasto behold the expanse of the pacific a sheet of glittering light in the sunshine the horizon line raised so high that the first moment it gave her a sense of there being something wrong with her eye before the feeling of infinity rushed upon her  they were turning the flank of the mountain and losing the sunshine the evening air was almost chill and the clearness such that they already saw the ragged height whither they were bound rising in craggy shattered grandeur every flat space or gentler declivity covered with sheds and huts for the workpeople and cavernous mouths opening on the cliffside  dark figures could be distinctly seen moving about and as to the descending mules they seemed to be close on the other side of a narrow ravine  rosita who now it came to the point was not without fears of sleeping on the bare mountainside wanted to push on she was sure they could arrive before night but she was told that she knew nothing of mountain atmosphere and she was not discontented with the bright fire and comfortable arrangements on which they suddenly came after turning round a great shoulder of rock  mr robson and the sumptermules had quietly preceded them and the gipsying on the andes was likely to be not much less luxurious than an english picnic  the negro cook had done his best mary made her fathers coffee and rosita was waited on to her satisfaction  and when darkness came on too early for english associations with warm days the lights of the village at the mine glittered merrily and apparently close at hand and the stars above shone as mary had never seen them so marvellously large and bright and the magellan clouds so white and mysterious  mr ward came and told her some of the observations made on them by distinguished travellers and after an earnest conversation she sought her matted bed with a pleasant feeling on her mind as if she had been unusually near louiss world  clear sharp and cold was the air next day the snowfields glistened gloriously in the rising sun and a rosecoloured mist seemed to rise from them  rosita was shown the unusual spectacle of hoar frost and shiveringly profited by marys ample provision of wraps  the hillsides were beyond conception desolate and bare birds were an almost unknown race in peru and here even green things had departed scarcely a tuft of blossom looking out on the face of the red and purple rock and the exceeding stillness so awful that even the boysailor scarce dared to speak above his breath  rosita began to repent of having come near so horrible a place and when she put her head out of her litter and beheld herself winding along a ledge projecting from the face of a sheer precipice she would have begged to go back instantly but her husband spoke in a voice of authority which subdued her she drew in her head into her basketwork contrivance and had recourse to vows to sta rosa of lima of a chaplet of diamond roses if she ever came safely down again  mary had made up her mind that they should not have been taken thither if there were any real danger and so though she could have preferred her mule taking the inner side of the ledge and was not too happy when it climbed like a cat she smiled and answered all inquiries that she did not think she ought to be frightened  the region was in general more stern than beautiful the clefts between the hills looking so deep that it seemed as if an overthrown mountain could hardly fill them but now and then came sudden peeps of that wonderful ocean or almost under her feet as if she could throw a stone into it there would lie an intensely green valley shut in with feathering pines and the hacienda and grazing llamas dwindled so that they could have been taken for a swiss farm and flocks of sheep  not till the middle of the day did they meet the line of mules and not until the sunset did they find themselves close before the wonderful perforated san benito summit  it was unlike many other metalliferous hills an isolated sharplydefined mass of rock breaking into sudden pinnacles and points traversed with veins of silver  these veins had been worked with galleries which even before the spanish conquest had honeycombed the solid rock and had been thought to have exhausted its riches but it had been part of oliver dynevors bold speculations to bring modern science to profit by the leavings of the peruvians and their destroyers  it was a marvellous work but it might still be a question whether the profit would bear out the expense  however that was not the present consideration  no one could feel anything but admiring astonishment at the fantastic craggy height of peaks and spires rising against the darkening sky like the very stronghold of the giant of the western star and with the black openings of the galleries here and there showing the lights of the workmen within  mary remembered the tales in which louis used vainly to try to interest her of metalworking dwarfs within the mountains and would have been glad to tell him that after all reality was quite as strange as his legends  the miners indians and negroes might truly have been trolls as with their brown and black countenances and wild bright attire they came thronging out of their rude houses built of piled stones on every tolerably level spot  three or four stout hearty cornish miners with picks on their shoulders made the contrast stranger and among them stood a young man whose ruddy open face carried mary home to ormersfield in one moment and she could not but blush almost as if it had been louis when she bent her head in acknowledgment of his bow  he started towards her as if to help her off her mule but mr ponsonby was detaining him by questions and mr ward as usual was at her rein  in a wonderfully brief time as it seemed to her all the animals were led off to their quarters and robson coming up explained that madisons hut the only habitable place had been prepared for the ladiesthe gentlemen must be content to sleep in their tent  the hut was at least clean said robson as he ushered them in and mary felt as if it were a great deal more  it was rudely built and only the part near the hearth was lined with matting the table and the few stools and chairs were rough carpentry chiefly made out of boxes but upon the wall hung a beautiful print from raffaelle of which she knew the giver as surely as if his name had been written on it and the small bookcase suspended near contained compressed together an epitome of louiss tastesthe choicest of all his favourites in each class of book  mary stood by it reading the names and trying to perceive louiss principle of selection in each case  it jarred upon her when as the gentlemen loitered about waiting for the evening meal they came and looked at the titles with careless remarks that the superintendent was a youth of taste and a laugh at the odd medleyspenser shakspeare don quixote calderon fouque and selections from jeremy taylor c  mary would hear no more comments  she went to the fire and tried to persuade rosita they would come safe down again and then on the apology for a mantelshelf she saw some fossils and some dried grasses looking almost as if fitzjocelyn had put them there  she did not see madison that night but the next morning he presented himself to act as their guide through the wonders of the extraordinary region where his lot had been cast  she found that this was only the first floor of the wondrous castle  above and above rose galleries whence the ore was lowered down to the buildings here placed where it underwent the first process of separation  the paths above were fit for none save a chamois or a barefooted indian or a sailorfor the midshipman was climbing aloft in such places that toms chief work was to summon him back in horror lest he should involve himself in endless galleries excavated before the days of atahualpa  much of the desperate scrambling which madison recommended as plainsailing was beyond mr ponsonby but where he went mary went and when he stopped she though she had not drawn since the master at her school had resigned her as a hopeless case applied herself to the perpetration of an outline of the rocks that as she said her aunts might see what sort of place it was  her steady head and firm enterprizing hand and foot enabled her to see the crowning wonder of the mountain one of the ventanillas or windows  mr ward having visited it came back bent on taking her thither there was no danger if she were not afraid  so between him and tom madison she was dragged up a steep path and conducted into a gallery cut out in the living rock growing gloomier and gloomier till suddenly there was a spot of light on the sparkling floor and mary found herself beneath an opening through the mountain crown right up into the sky which through the wild opening looked of the deepest most ultramarine almost purple blue utterly beyond conception in the glory of intense colour bringing only to her mind those most expressive yet most inexpressive words the body of heaven in his clearness  she felt what she had often heard said that to all mountain tops is given somewhat of the glory that dwelt on sinai  that ineffable blue was more dazzling than even the fields beyond fields of marvellous white that met her eye on emerging from the dark gallery  i never wish so much that lord fitzjocelyn should see anything as that said tom madison when mary in her gratitude was trying to say something adequate to the trouble she had given though the beauty was beyond any word of admiration  he would she began to answer but the rest died away only answered by tom with an emphatic he would and then began the difficulties of getting down  but mary had the pleasure at the next pause of hearing mr ward say that is a very fine intelligent young fellow worthy of his library i think your father has a prize in him  marys eyes thanked mr ward with all her heart in them  it was worth going up the andes for such a sentence to put into a letter that aunt kitty would show to louis  robson seemed anxious to monopolize the attention of the gentlemen to the exclusion of madison and while tom was thus thrust aside mary succeeded in having a conversation with him such as she felt was a sort of duty to louis  she asked him the names of the various mountainpeaks in sight whose bare crags too steep to support the snow here and there stood out dark in salient contrast to the white scenery and as he gave them to her mentioning the few facts that he had been able to gather respecting them she was able to ask him whether he was in the habit of seeing anything approaching to society he smiled saying that his nearest neighbours were many miles offan engineer conducting some far more extensive mining operations whom he sometimes met on business and an old spanish gentleman who lived in a valley far down the mountain side with whom he sometimes smoked his cigar on a sunday if he felt inclined for a perpendicular promenade on a peruvian causeway for nearly four miles  mary asked whether he often did feel inclined  no he thought not often he had generally worked hard enough in the week to make his book the best company but he liked now and then to see something green for a change after these bare mountains and rocks and the old don manrique was very civil and agreeable  then after a few minutes conversation of this kind something of the old conscious abruptness of tone seemed to come over the young man and looking down he said bluntly miss ponsonby do you think there would be any objection to my coming into lima just for christmas  i suppose not i cannot tell  tom explained that all the miners would be making holiday and the senior cornishman might safely be left in charge of the works while he only wished to spend christmasday itself in the city and would be a very short time absent  he blushed a little as he spoke and mary ventured to reply to what she gathered of his thought no other day would suit you as well  no maam it hardly would he answered gravely  i will try what can be done said mary unless you would speak to mr ponsonby yourself  he looked inquiringly at mr ponsonbys figure some paces distant and shook his head  i will try repeated mary and then she added these grand hilltops and blue sky almost make a church  yes maam said tom his black eyes lighting at the thought ive felt so sometimes but tis a mighty lonely one after a time  ive taken my book and got out of earshot of the noise the blacks make and i do assure you miss ponsonby the stillness was enough to drive one wild with nothing but savage rocks to look at either  not a green plant nor a voice to answer unless one got to the mountain echoes and they are worse  but surely you have the cornishmen  what do they do on a sunday  they lie about and smoke and sleep or go down to the valley said tom  i never thought of them  i think you should said mary gravely  if you are in any authority over them it must give you a charge over their souls i think you should at least give them the choice of reading the service with you  ill think about it said madison gruffly  i will send up some books for them to make an opening said mary i should not like to think of men living in such scenes without being the better for them  robson was here obliged to call madison to refer some question to him but mary had another talk with him when he begged to know if there were likely soon to be an opportunity of sending to england he had some fossils which he wished to send to lord fitzjocelyn and he fetched them and explained his theories with regard to them as if he had almost forgotten that she was not his young lord  she carried his request to her father and was answered that of course he might take a holiday if he could leave the works with safety he had better spend a few days in the town when he did come  with this answer she made him happy and they set off to the extreme joy of rosita who had engrossed much less attention than she had expected and declared she would never have come into these horrible places if she could have imagined what they were like  certainly no one wished to have her company there again  when mr ponsonby mentioned the permission which he had accorded to madison robson coughed and looked annoyed  mary could not help suspecting that this was because the request had not been preferred through himself  so the young fellow wants to be coming down does he  i thought his ardour was too hot to last long  very natural that the poor lad should want a holiday said mr ponsonby  it must take a tolerable flow of spirits to stand long being so many feet above the level of the sea in caves fit for a robbers den at the theatre  oh i am making no objection sir returned robson the young man may take his pleasure for what i care so he can be trusted not to neglect his business  here the path narrowed and mary had to fall back out of hearing but she had an unpleasant suspicion that robson was telling her father something to toms disadvantage and she had to consider how to avoid rousing a jealousy which she knew might be dangerous  mr ward however came up to interrupt her thoughts and watch the steps of her mule  the worst difficulties of the descent had precluded all conversation and the party were just beginning to breathe freely think of terra firma as not far off and gaze with easier minds on the marvellous ocean  mary went on in very comfortable discussion of the wonders they had seen and of madisons remark that the performances of the incas made one quite ashamed of the achievements of modern sciencea saying in which mr ward perfectly agreed and then he began to say something rather long and a little disconnected and marys mind took an excursion to aunt kitty and the reading of the letter that she was going to write when suddenly something in mr wards voice startled her and recalling her attention she discovered to her dismay that he was actually making her an offer  an offer  she would as soon have expected one from her father  and oh how well expressedhow entirely what it ought to be  how unlike every one of those three of her past experience  in great distress she exclaimed oh mr ward pray do notindeed i cannot  i feared that i was but too likely to meet with such an answer said mr ward and yet your father encouraged me to hope that in course of time  then papa has told you what he thinks said mary  i applied to him before i could venture to join this party  mary i am aware that i can bring none of the advantages which havehis voice falteredwhich have forestalled me but the most true and earnest affection is already yours  i am very sorry for it mr ward said mary gravely though much touched  it is very kind of you but it is only fair and candid to tell you that papa has probably led you into a mistake  he thinks that thethe object was weak and unworthy and that my feelings could be easily overcome  he does not know  he assured me that all was at an end  it is said mary but i am certain that i shall never feel for any one else the same asand the tears were coming last  you are very kind mr ward but it is of no use to think that this can ever be  forgive me for having harassed you said mr ward and they went on so long in silence that mary hoped it was over and yet he did not go away from her  she was sorry to see the grieved dejected expression on his good sensible though somewhat worn countenance and she esteemed him highly but who could have thought of so unlucky a fancy coming into his head  when at length he spoke again it was to say that he begged that she would forget what was past and allow him to continue on his former footing  mary was glad to have something grateful to say and answered that she should have been very sorry to lose him as a friend whereupon his face cheered up he thanked her and fell back from her rein  in spite of her past trials of the futility of the attempt to live with a rejected suitor as if nothing had happened she had hopes of the possibility when her own heart was untouched and the gentleman nearly doubled her years but when she talked to her father she gathered that it was considered by both gentlemen that the proposal had been premature and that her final detachment from louis was reckoned on as so certain that mr ward was willing to wait as if it were only a matter of time  he was so wealthy and prosperous and a connexion with him would have been so useful to the firm that mary was grateful to her father for forbearing to press her on what he evidently wished so earnestly mr ward had exactly the excellent wellbalanced character which seemed made to suit her and she could have imagined being very happy with him ifno nomr ward could not be thought of at the same moment  yet whatever she might say no one would believe her so she held her peace and wrote her history of the silver mines and mr ward haunted the house and was most kindly forbearing and patient and mary found at every turn how good a man he was and how cruel and mistaken his sister thought her  and christmas came when the churches were perfect orangegroves and the scene of the wanderers of bethlehem was acted from house to house in the twilight  the scanty english congregation met in the room that served as a chapel in the consuls housepoor mary alone of all her household there to keep the feast and mr ward was there and madison had come down from his mountain  there were hearts at home that would rejoice to hear that  mary saw him afterwards and he thanked her for her suggestion respecting the miners  two had been only as shy as tom himself they had been reading alone and were glad to join company a third was beginning to come and it had led to a more friendly intercourse mary sent him away very happy with some books for them some new spanish reading for himself an astronomical book and her little celestial globefor the whole firmament of stars had been by no means lost on him  that interview was her christmas treat  well for her that she did not hear robson say that young man knows how to come over the ladies  i shall keep a sharper lookout after him i know no harm of him but if theres one man i trust less than another it is one that tries the serious dodge     chapter x  the wrong woman in the wrong place    give me again my hollow tree   my crust of bread and liberty      the town mouse and the country mousepope   the new cooks first compliment to charlotte was upon my word you are a genteel young woman i dare say you have a lot of sweethearts  the indignant denial of the lady of eschalott was construed into her being sly and mrs cook promised herself to find her out  those were not happy days with the little maiden  the nurse looked down on her and the cook filled the kitchen with idlers whose looks and speeches were abhorrent to her  sometimes the woman took offence at her for being high at others she forced on her advice upon her dress or tried to draw out confidences either on lovers or the affairs of the family  charlotte was sadly forlorn and shut herself up in her pantry or in her own little attic with janes verbenas which cook had banished from the kitchen and lost her sorrows in books hired at the library  she read and dreamt created leisure for reading lived in a trance and awoke from it to see her work neglected reproach herself and strain her powers to make up for what was left undone  then finding her efforts failing she would be distressed and melancholy until a fresh novel engrossed her for a time and the whole scene was enacted over again  still it was not all idleness nor lost ground  the sense of responsibility was doing her good she withstood the cooks follies and magnanimously returned unopened a shining envelope of mr delafords  at christmas when mr and mrs frost went to pay a visit at beauchastel and the cook enjoyed a course of gaieties the only use she made of her liberty was to drink tea once with mrs martha and to walk over to marksedge to see old madison who was fast breaking and who dictated to her his last messages to his grandson  james and isabel spent a pleasant lively christmas with their hospitable old friends and james returned full of fresh vigour and new projects  his first was to offer his assistance to the vicar so as to have a third service on the sunday but there were differences of opinion between them and his proposal was received so ungraciously that a coolness arose which cut him off from many openings for usefulness  however he had enough to occupy him in his own department the school he was astonished at his boys deficiency in religious instruction and started a plan for collecting them for some teaching for an hour before morning service  mr calcott agreed with him that nothing could be more desirable but doubted whether the parents would compel their sons to attend and advised james to count the cost doubting whether in the long run he would be able to dispense with one day of entire rest this was the more to be considered since james expended a wonderful amount of energy in his teaching did his utmost to force the boys on in class and in private drilled his usher joined in the games and gave evening lectures on subjects of general information  some responded to his training and these he strenuously encouraged asking them to dinner and taking them to walk and these were enthusiastically fond of him and regarded his beautiful wife as a being of a superior order  fitzjocelyn and james used to agree that intercourse with her was a very important element in their training and the invitations were made as impartial as possible including the intelligent and wellconducted irrespective of station  isabels favourite guest was a good wellmannered lad son to mr ramsbothams follower the butcher but unluckily mrs richardson and her friends did not esteem it a compliment when their sons were asked to meet him and on the other hand james did not always distinguish real merit from mere responsiveness to his own mind dull boys or such as had a half sullen half conservative dislike to change did not gain notice of an agreeable kind and while intending to show strict justice he did not know how far he was affected by his prepossessions  his lectures had emancipated him from evening parties and after mrs frosts departure visiting gave isabel little trouble  the calm lofty manners that had been admired in miss conway were thought pride in mrs james frost and none of the ladies of northwold even wished to do more than exchange morning calls with her and talk among themselves of her fineladyism  she recked nothing of their keeping aloof her book and her pen were far pleasanter companions on her alternate evenings of solitude and in them she tried to lose her wishes for the merry days spent with granny and clara and her occasional perceptions that all was not as in their time  james would sometimes bring this fact more palpably before her  the separation of the families had not diminished the income of the household but the difference in comfort was great  isabel knew nothing of management and did not care to learn  she had been willing to live on a small scale but she did not understand personal superintendence she was careless of display and perfectly happy as long as she was the guest of the grandmother but she had no comprehension of petty tidinesses or small economies  now james brought up on a very different scale knew in detail how the household ought to live and made it a duty not to exceed a fixed sum  he had the eye for neatness that she wanted he could not believe it a hardship to go without indulgences to which his grandmother and sister had not been accustomed  thus he protested against unnecessary fires isabel shivered and wore shawls he was hurt at seeming to misuse her resigned his study fire and still found the coals ever requiring to be renewed insisted that his wife should speak to the cook and mystified her by talking about the regulation of the draught of the kitchen fire and when isabel understood she forgot the lecture  he was a devoted and admiring husband but he could not coolly discover innumerable petty neglects and wasteful habits  impatient words broke out and isabel always received them so meekly that he repented and apologized and in the reconciliation the subject was forgotten but only to be revived another time  isabel was always ready to give warm aid and sympathy in all his higher cares and purposes and her mild tranquillity was repose and soothing to him but she was like one in a dream  she had married a vision of perfection and entered on a romance of happy poverty and she had no desire to awaken so she never exerted her mind upon the world around her when it seemed oppressive and kept the visionary james frost before her in company with adeline and the transformed sir hubert it was much easier to line his tent with a tapestry of maltese crosses than to consider whether the hall should be covered with cocoanut matting  how christmas passed with clara may be seen in the following letter   cheveleigh jan 1851  dearest jemi can write a long letter tonight for a fortunate cold has spared me from one of sir andrews dinnerparties  it is a reminiscence of the last ball partly brought on by compunction at having dragged poor granny thither in consideration of my unguarded declaration of intense dislike to be chaperoned by lady britton granny looks glorious in black velvet and diamonds and i do trust that her universal goodwill rendered the ball more tolerable to her than it was to me  she at least is all she seems whereas i am so infested with civilities that i long to proclaim myself little clara frost bred up for a governess and the laughingstock of her school oh for that first ball where no one danced with me but mr richardson and i was not a mere peg for the display of uncle olivers peruvian jewels  i have all the trouble in the world to be allowed to go about fit to be seen and only by means of great fighting and coaxing did i prevail to have my dress only from london instead of paris  and no wonder i shivered all the way to the ball  fancy jane insisting on my going to display my dress to that poor dying marianne i was shocked at the notion of carrying my frivolities into such a scene but jane said her mind ran on it and it was anything to take off her thoughts from that man  so i went into her room and oh if you could have seen the poor thing with her short breath and racking cough her cheeks burning and her eyes glistening at that flimsy trumpery  one bunch of the silver flowers on my skirt was wrong she spied it and they would not thwart her so she would have the needle and the skeleton trembling fingers set them right  they said she would sleep the easier for it and she thanked me as if it had really set her more at rest but how sad how strange it seems when she knows that she is sinking fast and has had mr danvers with her every day   he thinks all is well with her but it was a melancholy blank untaught mind to begin to work on  louis would call her life a mournful picture of our civilization  she has told it all to jane she was of the mechanic class just above the rank that goes to sundayschools she went to a genteel weekly school and was taken out pleasuring on sundayno groundwork at all  an orphan at fifteen she never again knew tenderness  then came dressmaking till her health failed and she tried service  she says isabels soft tones made a paradise for her but late hours which she did not feel at the time wore her out and delaford trifled with her always when alone he pretended devotion to her then flirted with any other who came in his way and worry and fretting put the finish to her failing health  she had no spirit to break entirely with him and even now is pining for one kind word which he seems to be too hard and selfish to send to her in answer to a letter of forgiveness that she wrote a fortnight back  what a wretch he must be  jane says he tried flirting with poor little charlotte and that she was a little took up with his guitar and his verses but then jane says charlotte has somewhat at the bottom and knows better than to heed a man as wasnt real religious  i suppose that is the true difference between charlotte and marianne and even if we looked into delafords history most likely we should find him another nineteenthcentury victim to an artificial life  at least i trust that jane has been the greatest blessing marianne herself speaks of her as more than a mother to her and i believe i told you of the poor girls overpowering gratitude when she found we would not turn her out to die homeless  we read and we talk and mr danvers comes but i believe dear old jane does more for her than all  poor jane when her task of nursing is over i do not know what she will turn to  the grand servants only keep terms with her because uncle oliver gave notice that no one should stay in the house who did not show respect to his friend mrs beckett  it takes all her love for missus and master oliver to make her bear it and her chief solace is in putting me to bed and in airing master olivers shirt and slippers  you would laugh to hear her compassionating the home mincedpies and she tells me she would give fifty pounds rather than bring charlotte here  my uncle wished grandmamma to manage the house and she did so at first but she and the servants did not get on well together and she said what i never knew her say before that she is too old and so we have an awful dame who rules with a high hand  you ask whether the dear granny is happy  you know she is all elasticity and things are pleasanter here to her than to me but i do not think she enjoys life as she did at home  it is hard to have her whole mission reduced to airing those four horses  we have tormented my uncle out of making us use more than two at a time by begging for six and the lord mayors coach but aired alternately they must be and we must do it and by no road but what the coachman chooses and this does not seem to me to agree with her like trotting about the town on her errands  there is no walking here excepting in the pleasureground where all my grandfathers landscapegardening has been cut up so as to be a mere vexation to her  the people round are said to be savage and disaffected and the quarter of a mile between the park and the village is subject to miners going home  they did once holloa at me and orders were issued that i should walk no more i believe that if they saw me fearless and coming among them for friendly purposes they would leave off hooting but the notion frightens granny so i am a prisoner  they are the people to think it a mockery to be visited by a lady bedizened as i am and stuck up in a carriage so we can do very little except through mr danvers and my uncle is always discontented at the sight of him and fancies he is always begging a little sauciness on my part has the best effect when anything is wanted for my uncle is very kind to me in his own fashion which is not mine  we have made something of a nest in the last of the suite of rooms the only one habitably small but it is wonderful where all the time in the day goes  my uncle likes me to ride with him in the morning and i have to help granny air the horses in the afternoon and in the evening when we are lucky enough to dine alone i play them both asleep unless they go to backgammon  think of granny reduced to that we should be very happy when he is detained in his study but that granny thinks it is bad for him  dear granny  i see the object of her life is to win him back to serious thoughts she seems to think of him like a schoolboy who must be lured to find home pleasanter than idle ways and she begs me quite sadly to bear with him and make him happy to prevent him from longing after his countinghouse at lima  she tried to make him promise never to go back but he has only promised never to go while she lives and she seems to think it would be fatal and to charge all his disregard of religious matters upon herself for having sent him out  if you could see her pleased smile when we extort a subscription or when she gets him to church but when those south american mails come in on sundaysalas  those accounts are his real element and his moments of bliss are over the moneymarket and city intelligence or in discussing railway shares with sir andrew  all the rest is an obstinate and dismal allegiance to the days of shrievalty about as easy to recall as the days when the pendragons wore golden collars and armlets  imitated hospitality turns into ostentation and the people who seek after silver covers and french cookery are no more to my taste than they are in good earnest to uncle olivers  the nice people if there are any wont come in our way except mr henderson and when we do pluck up courage to disgust mr coachman by calling on mrs henderson we are very happy  but she is a wise woman and will not bring her pretty fanny into our world and when i press her behold i remember what i used to think of patronage  but louis has promised to come at easter and he will teach me a little more charity i hope and what is better no i dont mean that will tell me about the dear dear trebly dear terrace and all the doings  i hope you will begin your sunday scheme but granny fears the bad set will not care and the good will prefer having their families together  it is worse than i expected even of mr purvis to refuse the afternoon service when you offered to take all the trouble off his hands granny hopes you will take care what you are about with him  tell louis we have a famous letter from mary to show him if he will bring us all news of every one and especially of his godchild contrary to custom you tell us more about her than her mamma does                      your most affectionate sister                                        clara   before easter charlottes poor rival was lying at rest in cheveleigh churchyard and janes task of love was at an end     chapter xi  aunt catharines home    the lady sleepso may her sleep   as it is lasting so be deep   heaven have her in its sacred keep   this bed being changed for one more holy   this room for one more melancholy   some tomb that oft hath flung its black   and winglike panels fluttering back   triumphant oer the fluttering palls   of her grand family funerals                         e a poe   the summer was nearly over when one morning at breakfast louis surprised his father by a sound half consternation half amusement and handed him a note containing these words   dear fthere were three of us last night there are five this morning  isabel and the twins are doing well  heaven knows what is to become of us          yours           j f   what would you have said lord ormersfield calmly  the poorer people are the more children they have  he went on with his own letters while louis laughed at the enunciation of this inverse ratio and then took up the note again to wonder at the tone of anxiety and distress so unlike james  he went to call on lady conway and was better satisfied to find that james had written in a lively strain to her as if proud of his little daughters and resolved not to be pitied  of this he was in no danger from his sistersinlaw who looked upon twingirls as the only blessing needed to complete isabels felicity had devised three dozen names for them and longed to be invited to northwold to see them  nothing was heard of james for more than a week and as london grew hotter dustier and drearier than ever fitzjocelyn longed more than he thought wholesome to confess after ormersfield turf the deep ravines and rushing brooks  the sun shone almost through the blind of the open window on the large library table where sat louis at his own end writing to his inglewood bailiff and now and then solacing himself by lifting with the feather of his pen one of the bells of a delicate lily in a glass before hima new spectacle on the earls writingtable and so was a strip of vellum with illuminations rich and rarelouiss indulgence when he felt he had earned an hours leisure  there was a ring at the door a step on the stairs and before the father and son stood james his little black bag in his hand like himself all dust and his face worn heated and tired  then you have not heard from cheveleigh he said in answer to their astonished greetings producing a note which was eagerly read   dearest jemmy uncle says i may write to you in case you can leave isabel that he will be glad to see you  i told you that dear grandmamma had a cold and so we would not let her come to isabel but i little guessed what was coming  it only seemed a feverish cold and jane and i almost laughed at my uncle for choosing to send for a doctor  he was not alarmed at first but yesterday she was inert and sleepy and he asked for more advice  dr hastings came today and oh jem he calls it a breaking up of the constitution and does not think she will rally  she knows us but she is almost always drowsy and very hard to rouse  if you can come without hurting isabel i know you will  we want you all the more because my uncle will not let me send for mr danvers  poor uncle oliver is dreadfully troubled                             your most affectionate clara   transplantation has killed heri knew it would said james as louis stood with the note in his hand as if not yet understanding the blow  nay said the earl it is an age at which we could hardly hope she would long be spared  you could leave mrs james frost with comfort  yes miss mercy undertakes hershe is doing wellshe would not hear of my staying  i must go on the train starts at two he added hastily looking at the timepiece  we will send you said lord ormersfield  take time to rest  you look very ill  you should have some luncheon  no thank you said james at first with the instinct of resistance but yielding and confessing charlotte went into hysterics and i had nothing to eat before i came away  louis came forward from the window where he had been standing as in a dream he laid his hand on jamess shoulder and said i will go his voice was hardly audible but clearing it and striving to recall his thoughts he added father i can be spared  the division is not coming on tonight or you could get me a pair  the earl looked doubtfully at james  yes let me go said louis  i must see her again  it has been mother and son between us  and hiding his face in his hands he hurried out of the room  let him come said james  if duty and affection claim a right none have such as he  i hesitate only as to acting unceremoniously by your uncle  this is no moment for ceremonyno time to deprive her of whatever she loves best  be it so then  his own feelings are his best passport and well has she deserved all that he can ever feel  and james if she should express any desire to see me if i can be of any use in settling matters or could promote any better understanding with your uncle i am ready at a moments notice  i would come at once but that many might be burdensome to your uncle and sister  the two cousins were quickly on their way  james took a secondclass ticket the first time he had ever done so in travelling with his cousin  fitzjocelyn placed himself beside him without remark  james dozed as well as the narrow seat would permit and only woke to chafe at each halt and louis mused over the associations of those scenes and last years triumphant return  had the change of habits truly hastened the decay of her powers had her sons toil and success been merely to bring her home to the grave of her fathers at the expense of so many heartburnings separations and dissensions at least he trusted that her last hours might be crowned by the peacemakers joy and that she might see strife and bitterness laid aside between oliver and henrys only surviving son  alas it was not to be  the shutters and blinds were closed and clara met them at the door her pale face and streaming eyes forestalling the tidings  the frame hitherto so vigorous and active had been spared long or weary decay and tranquil torpor had mildly conducted the happy gentle spirit to full repose  she had slumbered away without revival or suffering as one who did rest from her labours and her eyes had been closed on the previous night  clara wept as she spoke but she had been alone with her sorrow long enough to face it and endure calmly  not so her brother  it was anguish to have come too late and to have missed the last word and look and he strode madly up and down the room almost raving at the separation and removal which he declared had killed her  oh speak to him louis cried clara  oh what shall i do  as she spoke the door was opened and mr dynevor came in with a griefstricken look and quieter manner but his entrance instantly silenced all jamess demonstrations and changed them into a haughty compressed bitterness as though he actually looked on him in the light of his grandmothers destroyer  ah james began his uncle gently i wish you had been here earlier  i left home by the first train after hearing  i ought to have heard sooner  i could not suppose you would choose to come here without serious reason said oliver with more dignity than usual  however i would willingly forget and you will remain here for the present  i must apologize for having thrust myself on you sir said louis but indeed i could not stay away  after what she has been to me ever since i can remember her and tears cut him short  sir it does you honour returned oliver  she was attached to you i hope you will not leave us as yet  louis felt as if he could not leave the house where what was mortal of his dear old aunt yet remained and he likewise had a perception that he might be a support and assistance to clara in keeping the peace between her brother and uncle so he gratefully accepted the invitation  mr dynevor presently explained that he intended the funeral to take place at the end of the week  i can not be so long from home said james in a quick low voice  clara ran up to her uncle laid her hand on his arm and drew him into a window whence he presently turned saying your sister tells me that you cannot be so long absent in the present state of your family if possible the day shall be hastened  james was obliged to say thank you but any concession seemed to affect him like an injury  grievous work was it to remain at cheveleigh under the constant dread of some unbecoming outbreak between uncle and nephew fortunately oliver had too much on his hands to have much time to spend with the others but when they were together there was scarcely a safe subject not even the intended names of the twins james made hasty answer that they had already received their names mercy and salome  louis and clara both cried out incredulously  yes said james  we dont like family names  but such as those  i wish nothing better for them than to be such another pair of faithful sisters  may they only do as well poor children  the end was softer than the beginning and there was a tight short sigh that seemed to burst upward from a whole world of suppressed anxiety and despondence  it was not easy to understand him he would not talk of home was brief about his little catharine and when clara said something of isabels writings formerly his great pride and feared that she would have no more time for them his blunt answer was she ought not  these comparatively indifferent topics were the only resource for he treated allusions to his grandmother as if they were rending open a wound and it was only in his absence that louis and clara could hold the conversations respecting her which were their chief comfort and relief  if they were certain that oliver was busy and james writing letters they would walk up and down the sheltered alley where louis had last year comforted clara  the green twilight and chequered shade well accorded with the state of their minds darkened indeed by one of the severest losses that could ever befall either of them and yet it was a sorrow full of thankfulness and blessed hope  louis spoke of his regret that scenes of uncongenial gaiety should have been forced upon her last year  i believe it made very little difference to her said clara  she did just what uncle oliver wished but only as she used to play with us no more nay rather less for her own amusement than as she would play at battledore or at threadpaper verses  and she was not teased nor harassed  i think not  she was grieved if i were set against uncle olivers plans and really hurt if she could not make him think as she did about right and wrong but otherwise she was always bright  she never found people tiresome she could find something kind to say to and for the silliest and when my uncles display was most provoking she would only laugh at poor olivers odd notions of doing her honour  i used to be quite ashamed of the fuss i would make when i thought a thing vulgar when i saw that sort of vanity by the side of her real indifference springing from unworldliness  and then her mornings were quiet  more quiet than at home  while we were riding she used to sit with her dear old big bible and the two or three old books she was so fond of  you remember her sutton and her bishop home and often she would show me some passage that had struck her as prettier than ever well as she had always known it  once she said she was very thankful for the leisure time free from household cares and even from friendly gossip for she said first she had been gay then she had been busy and had never had time to meditate quietly  so she made a cloister of this grand house  ah i trusted she was past being hurt by external things  that grand old age was like a pure glad air where worldly fumes could not mount up  my only fear would have been this unlucky estrangement making her unhappy  i think i may tell you how she felt it said clara i am trying to tell james but i dont know whether i can  she said she had come to perceive that she had confounded pride with independence  she blamed herself so that i could not bear to hear it for the grand fine things in her life  she said pride had made her stand alone and unkindly spurn much that was kindly meant  i dont mean that she repented of the actions but of the motives she said the glory of being beholden to no one had run through everything and had been very hurtful even to uncle oliver  she never let him know all her straits and was too proud she said to ask when she was hurt at his not offering help and so she made him seem more hardhearted and let us become set against him  she said she had fostered the same temper in poor jem who had it strongly enough by inheritance and that she had never known the evil nor understood it as pride till she saw the effects  did they make her unhappy  she cried when she spoke of it and i have seen her in tears at church and found her eyes red when she had been alone but i dont think it was a hard cruel sorrow i think the sunshine of her nature managed to beam through it  the sunshine was surely love said louis making the rainbow of hope on the tears of repentance  perhaps it is a blessing vouchsafed to the true of heart to become aware of such a hidden constitutional infirmity in time to wash it out with blessed tears like those  hidden said clara yes indeed it was even from herself because it never showed in manner like my pride she was gracious and affable to all the world  i heard the weedingwomen saying she had not one bit of pride and when i told her of it she shook her head and laughed sadly and said that was the kind of thing which had taken her in  common parlance is a deceitful thing said louis sighing people cant even be sincere without doing harm  well i had looked to see her made happy by harmony between those two  she gave up the hope of seeing it said clara but she looked to it all the same  she said meekly one day that it might be her penalty to see them at variance in her own lifetime but over her grave perhaps they would be reconciled and her prayers be answered how she did love uncle oliver  do you know louis what she was to him showed me what the mothers love must be which we never missed becausebecause we had her  dont talk of it clara said louis hastily we cannot dwell on ourselves and bear it patiently  it was truly the loss of a most tender mother to them both bringing for the first time the sense of orphanhood on the girl left between the uncongenial though doting uncle and the irritable though affectionate brother and louis though his home was not broken up suffered scarcely less  his aunts playful sweetness had peculiarly accorded with his disposition and the affection and confidence of his fond clinging nature had fastened themselves upon her all the more in the absence of his own mary  each loss seemed to make the other more painful  aunt kittys correspondence was another link cut away between him and peru and he had never known such a sense of dreariness in his whole life  clara was going patiently and quietly through those trying days with womanly considerateness believing herself supported by her brother and being so in fact by the mere sisterly gratification of his presence though she was far more really sustained and assisted by fitzjocelyn  how much happier was the sorrow of louis and clara than that of james or oliver  tempers such as those in which the uncle and nephew but too closely resembled each other were soured not softened by grief and every arrangement raised discussions which did not tend to bring them nearer together  oliver designed a stately funeral  nothing was too much for him to lavish on his mother and he was profuse in orders for hangings velvet blazonry mutes and hired mourners greedy of offers of the dreary state of empty carriages demanding that of lord ormersfield and wanting james to write to lady conway for the same purpose  nothing could be more adverse to the feelings of the grandchildren but clara had been schooled into letting her uncle have his way and knew that dear granny would have said oliver might do as he pleased with her in death as in life owning the affection so unpleasantly manifested james on the other hand could see no affection nothing but disgusting parade as abhorrent to his grandmothers taste as to his own  he thought he had a right to be consulted for he by no means believed himself to have abdicated his headship of the family and he made his voice heard entirely without effect except the indignation of his uncle and the absence of the conway carriage although lord ormersfield wrote that he should bring sir walter in his own person thus leaving james divided between satisfaction in any real token of respect to his grandmother and dislike to gratifying olivers ostentation by the production of his baronet kin  sydney calcott wrote to him in the name of various former scholars of mrs frost anxious to do her the last honours by attending the funeral  homage to her days of gallant exertion in poverty was most welcome and touching to the young people but their uncle without taste to understand it wishing to forget her labours and fancying them discreditable to a daughter of the dynevors received the proposal like an indignity and but for fitzjocelyns mediation and expostulations it would have been most unsuitably rejected  he was obliged to take the answer into his own hands since oliver insisted that his mother was to be regarded in no light save that of mrs dynevor of cheveleigh and james was equally resolved that she should be only mrs frost of dynevor terrace  it was heartsickening to see these bickerings over the grave of one so loving and so beloved and very trying to be always on the alert to obviate the snappings that might at any time become a sharp dissension but nothing very distressing actually arose until the last day before the funeral when the three cousins were sitting together in the morningroom james writing letters  i am asking lady conway to give you a bed tomorrow night clara he said  we shall be at home by three oclock  oh jem said clara clasping her hands to keep them from trembling i never thought of that  you are not ready  that is unlucky for i cannot come to fetch you but i suppose you can travel down with jane  only i should have thought it easier to do the thing at once  but jem has my uncle said anything  does he wish me to go  james laid down his pen and stood upright as if he did not understand her words  clara came up to him saying i believe i ought to do what he may wish  i told you said james as if her words were not worth considering that you need only remain here on her account who no longer needs you  louis would have left them to themselves but claras glance sued for his protection and as he settled himself in his chair she spoke with more decisiondear james nothing would make me so happy as to go to dear home but i do not think grandmamma would like me to leave uncle oliver  oh very well said james sitting down to his writing as if he had done with her i understand  dear james  o tell me you are not angry with me  tell me you think i am right cried clara alarmed by his manner  quite right in one point of view he said with acrimony  james said louis very low but so as to make them both start that is not the way to treat your sister  we will renew the discussion another time if you wish it clara said james  no said clara i wish louis to be here  he will judge for me and she spoke clearly her face colouring  it was grandmammas great wish that i should love my uncle  she used to beg me to be patient with him and rejoiced to see us together  she often said he must not be left with no one to make a home for him and to go out to lima again  did she ever desire you to remain here  no said clara she never did but i am convinced that if she had known how soon she was to leave us she would have done so  i feel as much bound as if she had  i have heard her call him my charge and not only so but my uncle has never varied in his kindness to me and when he worked all his life for grandmamma and my father it would be wicked and cruel in meif he does care for meto forsake him now he has lost them all and is growing old  you need not scruple on that score said james  he has attained his object and made the most of it  he is free now and he will soon find a rosita if his mines are not sufficient for him  james you should not say wrong things said clara  i am not likely to think it wrong whatever you may  i have no expectations  do not rise up in arms against me fitzjocelyn i do not accuse her  i might have foreseen it  she meant well at first but the terrace cannot bear competition with a place like this where two socalled duties clash she is at perfect liberty to make her choice it would not be easy to come down to what i have to offer  i understand  the world will call it a wise choice  say no more clara i feel no anger  she attempted no words she clasped her hands over her face and ran out of the room  james said louis rising indignation rendering his voice more low and clearly distinct than ever i little thought to hear you insult that orphan sister of yours in her grief  no i shall not defend her i shall go to give her what comfort i can  heaven help her poor lonely child  he was gone  james paced about in desperation raving against louis for maintaining what he thought claras selfdeception and in the blindness of anger imagining that their ultragenerosity would conduct them to the repair of ormersfield with the revenues of cheveleigh and disdainful as he was it seemed another cruel outrage that his rightful inheritance should be in the hands of another and his children portionless  he was far too wrathful to have any consistency or discrimination in his anger and he was cruelly wounded at finding that his sister deserted him as he thought for her uncles riches and that his own closest friend was ready to share the spoil  in the stillness of the house the sound of a door had revealed to louis where to seek his cousin  it was in the grand saloon where the closed shutters availed not to exclude the solid beams of slanting sunlight falling through the crevices and glancing on the gilding velvet and blazonry upon the costly coffin that shut her out from the dear tender hands and lips that had never failed to caress away her childish griefs  at first the strange broad lines of shadowy light in the gloom were all he could see but one ray tinged with paly light a plaited tress which could only be claras flaxen hair  she had flung herself crouching in a heap on the floor never stirring so that he almost feared she had fainted and kneeling on one knee beside her spoke soothingly my poor little dear clary this is the worst of all but you know it was not jem who spoke  it was only prejudice and temper  he is not himself  the dim light seemed to encourage clara to lift her head to listen to the kind words  was i so very wrong she murmured you know i never thought of that  will he forgive me and let me come home but oh granny and what is to become of my uncle she ended with a sound of misery  not here not now clara said louis she is in perfect peace unhurt by our unhappy dissensions she is with him who looks at hearts who can take away all variance  there was a short space of silence as the two cousins knelt in the darkened room in the sunbeams which seemed as if they could not yet forsake her who had lived in the light of love  presently louis gave clara his hand to raise her and led her into the adjoining room also dim but full of sweet fragrant breezes from the garden  he seated her on a low couch and stood by anxiously watching her  if he had only told me i was wrong she sighed  he could not tell you so clara for it is not wrong and he knows it is not  he will thank you byandby for not attending to him now that he does not know what he says  he is fairly distracted with this grief coming upon his home cares  cares at dear dear happy home cried clara  never  ah clara  i fear that much comfort went away with dear granny i think he is overtasking himself at the school and three children within a year may well make a man anxious and oppressed  and i have vexed and disappointed him more exclaimed she  no wonder he was angry and ready to impute anything  but he will believe me he will forgive me he will take me home  it is my belief said fitzjocelyn in his peculiar way that the worst injury you could do to james would be to give way to the spirit that has possessed him  but louis cried clara wildly astonished i must go i cant have jem saying these things of me  his saying them does not make them true  he is my brother  he has the only right to me  if i must choose between him and my uncle he must be minemine  you have not to choose between him and your uncle  you have to choose between right and wrong between his frenzy and his true good  my brother my brother  i go with my brother was still her vehement cry  without listening to her cousins last words she made a gesture to put him aside and rose to hurry to her brother  but louis stood before her and spoke gravely  very well  yield yourself to his management  go back to be another burden upon a household poor enough already to sour him with cares  let him tell your uncle that both his brothers children loathe the fruit of the selfsacrifice of a lifetime  transgress your grandmothers wishes condemn that poor man to a desolate objectless covetous old age make the breach irreconcilable for ever and will james be the better or the happier for your allowing his evil temper the full swing  clara wrung her hands  my uncle  yes what shall i do with my uncle if i could only have them both  this way you would have neither  keep the straight path and you may end in having both  straighti dont know what straight is  it must be right to cling to my own brother in his noble poverty  oh that he should imagine me caring for this horrid horrid state and grandeur  louis recurred to the old argument that james did not know what he was saying and recalled her to the remembrance of what she had felt to be the right course before jamess ebullition  she owned it most reluctantly but oh she said would james still forgive her and not believe such dreadful things but trust and be patient with her and perhaps uncle oliver might after all be set on going to peru and beyond remonstrance  then it would all come rightno not right for granny had dreaded his going  confused and distressed by the conflicting claims clara was thankful for the present respite given to her by louiss promise that his father should sound her uncle as to his wishes and intentions  lord ormersfields upright unimpassioned judgment appeared like a sort of refuge from the conflict of the various claims and he was besides in a degree her guardian being the sole executor of the only will which mrs frost had ever made soon after the orphans came under her charge giving the terrace to james and dividing the money in the funds between the two  weeping but not unhopefulconvinced though not acknowledging itonly praying for strength and patience and hungering for one kind word from jamesclara quitted that almost brother in whose counsel he had constrained her to seek relief and went to her own chamber there to throw herself on the guidance of that friend who sticketh closer than a brother  the remaining part of the day passed quietly  james did not consciously make any difference in his manner meaning to be still affectionate though disappointed and pitying her mistake both as to her present happiness and future good  lord ormersfield and walter arrived in the evening and james applied himself to finding occupation for his brotherinlaw whom he kept out of the way in the garden very satisfactorily  the earl was so softened and sorrowful that clara hardly knew him  he deeply felt the loss of the kind gentle aunt whose sympathy had been more to him than he had known at the time the last remnant of the previous generation the last link with his youth and he was even more grieved for the blank she left with louis than for himself  by louiss desire he inquired into olivers intentions  must stay here was the answer  cant leave that child alone with the property  i can look to the equatorial company heremust do without me out there  no no i cant leave the girl to her brother hed teach her his own nasty spiteful temper and waste the property on all those brats  no im fixed here i must look after henrys child fine girl goodtempered girl takes after henry dont you think so  that clara took after her father in anything but being tall and fair would hardly have been granted by any one who knew her better than the earl but he readily allowed it and oliver proceededas long as she does not marry here i am but i trust some one will soon take the care of her off my handsman who would look after the property well  shes a good girl too and the finest figure in the whole county lucky him who gets her  i shall be sorry to part with the child too but i shall be working for her and theres nothing left that cares a rush for me now so i might as well be out of the way of the young things i know the old place at lima and the place knows me and what do i care for this now my mother is gone  if i could only see clara safe settled here then i should care as little what became of me as i suppose she would  the earl was touched by the dreary desponding tone of the reply and reported it to louis and clara with such terms that claras decision was made at once namely that it would be wrong and cruel to cast away her uncle and be swayed by jamess prejudice and lord ormersfield told her with grave approval that she was quite right and that he hoped that james would recover from his unreasonable folly  make jem forgive me said clara faintly as her announcement of her purpose when she finally sought her room obliged to be thought meanly of rather than do ill denying her fondest affections cutting herself off from all she loved and with but this consolation that she was doing as grandmamma would have bidden her oh how her heart yearned after home  on the morrow clara sorrowed in her solitary chamber alone with faithful jane who amid her bursts of tears felt the one satisfaction that her dear mistress had lived to be buried like the stock she came of and who counted the carriages and numbered the scarfs like so many additional tributes from the affection of her dear master oliver  once on that day james was visibly startled from his heavy stern mood of compressed indignant sorrow  it was as he advanced to the entrance of the vault and his eye was struck by a new and very handsome tablet on the wall  it was to the father mother and young brother and sisters whose graves had been hastily made far away in the time of the pestilence the only dynevors who did not lie in the tombs of their fathers  for one moment james moved nearer to his uncle  could he have spoken then what might not have followed but it was impossible and the impulse passed away  but he was kind when he hurried upstairs for a last embrace to clara he still felt fondly brotherly and compassionate and all the more because she had proved more weak against temptation than he had expected  his farewell was goodbye my poor clara god bless you  oh thank you cried clara from the bottom of her heart  you forgive me james  i forgive i am sorry for you my poor child  mind dynevor terrace is still your home if you do not find the happiness you expect in your chosen lot  happiness but he had no time to hear  he was gone while she sobbed out her message of love for isabel and louis ran up pale with repressed suffering and speaking with difficulty as he wrung her hand and murmured oh clara may we but abide patiently  after his goodbye he turned back again to say im selfish but let me put you in mind not to let the lima correspondence drop  oh no no you know i wont  thank you  and let me leave you marys keynote of comfort commit thy way unto the lord and he will bring it to pass  thank you said clara in her turn and she was left alone     chapter xii  the frost household    the wind of late breathed gently forth   now shifted east and east by north   bare trees and shrubs but ill you know   could shelter them from rain or snow   stepping into their nests they paddled   themselves were chilled their eggs were addled   soon every father bird and mother   grew quarrelsome and pecked each other                         pairing time anticipatedcowper   three weeks longer did the session drag on but on the joyful day when release was given lord ormersfield was surprised to find mr dynevors card upon his table with an address at farrances hotel  louis alone was at leisure to repair thither  he found clara alone looking as if her grief were still very fresh and though striving to speak gaily the tears very near the surface  we are going abroad she said uncle oliver thinks it a part of my education and declares he will not have me behind the miss brittons we are bound straight for switzerland  lucky girl said louis  im sure i dont care for it said clara mountains and pictures are not a bit in my line unless i had isabel and you louis to make me care  learn then said louis it shows that your education is defective yes i see he continued as clara signed heavily but you dont know the good it will do you to have your mind forcibly turned aside  if i could only sit quiet in a corner said clara  so you will in many a corner of a railway carriage  she smiled a little  the truth is she said that poor uncle oliver cannot be quiet  i cant see what pleasure italy will be to him but he is too miserable at home  i never saw such restless unhappiness and her eyes filled with tears  oh louis  i am glad you would not let me say anything about leaving him  sometimes when he bids me good night he puts his arm round me and says so pitifully that i do not care for him  do you know i think mine is the little spar of love that he tries to cling to in the great ship wreck and i feel quite sorry and hypocritical that it is such a poor miserable shred  it will grow said louis smiling  i dont know he is terribly provoking sometimesand without dear granny to hinder the rubs  o louis it is true that there is no bearing to stay at home in those great empty rooms  and jane  oh she goes said clara recovering a smile she is firmly persuaded that we shall run into another revolution and as she could not frighten us by the description of your wounds she decides to come and dress ours when we get any  dear old jenny i am glad she goes she is the only creature i can talk to but louis before my uncle comes in i have something to give you  it was the letters that mary had written to her aunt since the parting and the spanish books which she had left in her charge  it is very kind in you clara said louis fervently  they talked of mary and a little of james from whom clara had once heard but it had been a stiff letter as if a barrier were between them and then mr dynevor came in and seemed pleased to find louis there even asking him whether he could not join them on their tour and help clara to speak french  no thank you sir said louis i am afraid my company brought no good luck last time  never mind thatmanage better nowha clara  it would be very nice but he has a great deal too much to do at home said clara  oliver would not be persuaded that fitzjocelyn would not meet them abroad and began magniloquently talking of his courier and his route and while he was looking for the map the two cousins smiled and clara saidlucky you to have work at home and to stay with it  only i say clara when you break down anywhere send me a telegraph  no such good luck sighed clara  so he wont come said her uncle when he was gone but we shall have him following us yetha ha  never mind clara  clara laughed  she knew what her uncle meant but the notion was to her too impossible and ridiculous even to need a blush  she did not think the world contained louiss equal but she had always known that his love was disposed of and she no more thought of wishing for it than for any other impossible thing  his affection for mary gave her no more pain than did that of james for isabel and she would have treated with scorn and anger anything that impeached his constancy the pleasure with which he received marys letters was the single satisfaction that she carried away with her  and so she was borne away and her sad heart could not choose but be somewhat enlivened by change and novelty while her uncle made it his business to show her everything as rapidly as it could be seen apparently with no relish himself for aught but perpetual movement  so passed the autumn with clara  it was not much brighter at dynevor terrace  clara being still under age had it not in her power to resign her half of her grandmothers income even if her brother would have accepted it and 70 pounds made a difference in such an income as jamess more especially as his innovations did not tend to fill the school  murmurs were going about that mr frost was severe or that he was partial  some censured his old opinions others his new studies one had been affronted by being almost told his boy was a dunce another hated all this newfangled nonsense  the ladies were all to a woman up against his wife her airs her poverty her twins and her housekeeping and seldom spoke of her save to contrast her with good old mrs frost  and then it was plain that something was wrong between him and his uncle and no one could believe but that his temper had been the cause  the good miss faithfulls struggled in vain to silence scandal and keep it from coming round and luckily isabel was the last person likely either to hear or resent  the boys met with decreased numbers after the holidays and james received them with undiminished energy but with failing patience and a temper not improved by the late transactions at cheveleigh and fretted as louis had divined by home cares  of all living women isabel was one of the least formed by habits or education to be an economical housewife and the mother of twins maternal love did not develop into unwearied delight in infant companionship nor exclusive interest in baby smiles and while she had great visions for the future education of her little maidens she was not desirous to prolong the time spent in their society but in general preferred peace and sir hubert  on the other hand james was an unusually caressing father  after hours among rough inattentive boys nothing rested him so much as to fondle those tender creatures his eldest girl knew him and was in ecstasy whenever he approached and the little pair of babies by their mere soft helplessness gave him an indescribable sense of fondness and refreshment  his little ones were all the world to him and he could not see how a pattern mother should ever be so happy as with them around her  he forgot the difference between the pastime of an hour and the employment of a day  the need of such care on her part was the greater since the nursery establishment was deficient  the grand nurse had almost abdicated on the double addition to her charge and had only been bribed to stay by an illspared increase in wages and a share in an underling who was also to help charlotte in her housemaids department  nevertheless the nurse was always complaining the children though healthy always crying and their father always certain it was somebodys fault  nor did the family expenses diminish retrench his own indulgences as he might  it was the mistresss eye that was wanting and isabel did not know how to use it  the few domestic cares that she perceived to be her duty were gone through as weary tasks and her mind continued involved in her own romantic world where she was oblivious of all that was troublesome or vexatious  now and then she was aware of a sluggish dulness that seemed to be creeping over her higher aspirationsa want of glow and feeling on religious subjects even in the most sacred moments and she wondered and grieved at a condition such as she had never experienced in what she had thought far more untoward circumstances  she did not see the difference between doing her best when her will was thwarted and her present life of neglect and indulgence  nothing roused her she did not perceive omissions that would have fretted women of housewifely instincts and her soft dignity and smooth temper felt few annoyances and though james could sometimes be petulant he was always withheld from reproving her both by his enthusiastic fondness and his sense that for him she had quitted her natural station of ease and prosperity  on a dark hazy november afternoon when the boys had been unusually obtuse and mischievous and james wornout wearied and uncertain whether his cuts had alighted on the most guilty heads strode home with his arm full of latin exercises launched them into the study and was running up to the drawingroom when he almost fell over charlotte who was scouring the stairs  she gave a little start and scream and stood up to let him pass  he was about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour but he saw her flushed panting and evidently very tired and his wrath was averted  hurrying on to the drawingroom he found isabel eagerly writing  she looked up with a pretty smile of greeting but he only ran his hand through his already disordered hair and exclaimed  our stairs are like the captain of knockdunders  you never know they are cleaned except by tumbling over the bucket and the maid  are they being done said isabel quietly  i suppose the maids were busy this morning  and charlotte too  she looks half dead  i thought ellen was to do such work and ought to have done it in proper time  little catharine is so fretful that ellen cannot be spared from the nursery  i suppose she might be if you were not absorbed in that writing  i had the children with me while the servants were at dinner but kitty was so troublesome that i could not keep her  i am particularly anxious to finish this  some people would think a sick child more engrossing than that he had very nearly said trash but he broke off short  there is nothing really the matter with her began isabel composedly but james did not wait to listen and muttering that girl will be killed if she goes on he ran up to the nursery whence he already heard a sound of low fretting  the child was sitting on the nurses lap with a hot red spot on one cheek teased and disturbed by the noises that the lesser ones were constantly making as one lay in her cot and the other was carried about by the girl  as he entered she shrieked joyously and stretched out her arms and kitty was at once clinging hugging round his neck sending ellen down to finish the stairs he carried off the little girl fondling and talking to her and happy in her perfect content but he did not go to the drawingroom  no no mamma must not be interrupted he bitterly thought as he carried her down to the fireless study hung his plaid round himself and her and walked up and down the room with her amusing her till she fell into a slumber on his shoulder  isabel could not at once resume her pen  her even temper was for once ruffled and her bosom swelled at the thought that his reproach was unjust she was willing to do what was fitting and he ought not to expect her to be an absolute nurserymaid  women must keep up the tone of their own minds and she might be being useful to the world as well as to her own family  if he wanted a mere household drudge why had he not looked elsewhere  up went her queenly head as she believed her powers were meant for other things but her heart gave a painful throb at the recollection that poverty had been her voluntary choice and had seemed perfect felicity with james  alas she loved honoured and admired him as her upright unselfish uncompromising husband but worries and rebukes and tart answers had made many a rent in the veil in which her fancy had enfolded him  sir roland had disappeared and james and sir hubert were falling farther and farther asunder  and isabel sighed partly at the memory of the imaginary being for whom she had taken james and partly at the future prospect the narrow sphere the choice between solitude and dull society the homely toils that must increase wornout garments perpetual alphabets children always whining and james always irritated thinking her remiss and coming in with that furrow on his forehead and his hair standing up wildly  she shrank from the contemplation took her lettercase on her knee moved close to the fire to profit by the light stirred up a clear flame and proceeded with the benevolent hermit who came to the rescue when sir hubert was at the last gasp and adeline had received his beautiful resigned words the hermit had transported him into his hut and comforted adeline and was beginning a consolatory harangue making revelations that were to set everything right when just as he had gone as far as my son know that i did not always wear this amice there was a tap at the door and she saw fitzjocelyn who had been at oakstead for the last few weeks attending to some matters connected with his constituency  ah is it you she said her lap too full of papers for her to rise i did not know you were come home  i came yesterday and what company do you think i had in the train as far as estminster  ah i can guess how does louisa look  rather languid but estminster is to work wonders  she declares that northwold is her best cure and i am speculating whether she will prevail  i think lady conway dreads your example  mamma does not allow for the force of imagination said isabel not exactly knowing what prompted either the words or the sigh  i am come to ask if you will kindly give me a dinner  my father is gone to the bookclub meeting so i thought we would try to revive old times he said smiling but sadly for the present scene was little like the no 5 of old times  we shall be delighted said isabel with alacrity relieved at avoiding a teteittete with her husband at present and refreshed by the sight of one belonging to her former life and external to her present round of monotonous detail  fortunately it is not a lecture night and james will be very glad  i suppose he is not come in from school  yea he is  i think he is in the study  i will let him know she said with her hand on the bell  i will go to him said louis departing out of consideration that she might wish for space to attend to dinner room and dress  the two last were scarcely in such a state as he had been used to see at no 5 books were on the sofa the tablecover hung awry the dresden shepherds hat was grimed and his damsels sprigged gown hemmed with dust there were no flowers in the vases which his aunt had never left unsupplied and isabel though she could not be otherwise than handsome and refined had her crape rumpled and the heavy folds of her dark hair looking quite ready for the evening toilette and as she sat on her low seat by the fire the whole had an indescribable air of comfort passing into listless indulgence  fitzjocelyn politely apologized to ellen for a second time stepping over her soapy deluge and as he opened the study door with a preliminary knock a voice as sharp and petulant as it was low called out hollo  be quiet there cant you  youve no business here yet and i have no time to waste on your idleness  i am sorry to hear it said louis advancing into the dim light of the single bedroom candle which only served to make visible the dusky unshuttered windows and the black gulf of empty grate  james was sitting by the table with his child wrapped in the plaid asleep on his breast and his disengaged hand employed in correcting exercises  without moving he held it out purple and chilled exclaiming ha fitzjocelyn i took you for that lout of a garett  is this an average specimen of your reception of your scholars  i was afraid of his waking the child  she has been unwell all day and i have scarcely persuaded her to go to sleep  emulating hooker  as little in patience as in judgment sighed james  and which of them is it who is lulled by the strains of as in proesenti  which said james somewhat affronted  cant you tell sixteen months from five  i beg her pardon but i cant construct a whole child from an inch of mottled legas professor owen would a megalosaurus from a tooth does she walk  poor child she must said james  she thinks it very hard to have two sisters so little younger than herself and he peeped under the plaid at the little brown head and drew it closer round with a look of almost melancholy tenderness guarding carefully against touching her with his cold hands  she will think it all the better byandby said louis  you had better not stay here in the cold  ill come when i have heard that boys imposition and looked over these exercises  and he ran his hand through his hair again  dont  you look like enough to a lion looking out of a bush to frighten ten boys already said louis  ill do the exercises pulling the copybooks away  what you dont trust me as james detained them  no i dont said james his cousins brightness awakening his livelier manner  it needs an apprenticeship to be up to their blunders  let me read them to you  i gave notice to isabel that i am come to dinner and no doubt she had rather i were disposed of  james objected no farther and the dry labour was illuminated by the discursive remarks and moralizings which louis allowed to flow in their natural idle course both to divert his dispirited cousin and to conceal from himself how much cause there was for depression when the victim of the imposition approached louis prevented the dreaded clumsy entrance seized on a virgil and himself heard the fifty lines scarcely making them serve their purpose as a punishment but sending the culprit away in an unusually amiable temper  services from louis were too natural to james to be requited with thanks but he was not uncivil in his notice of a wrong tense that had been allowed to pass and the question was argued with an eagerness which showed that he was much enlivened  on the principle that louis must care for all that was his as he rose to take the stillsleeping child upstairs he insisted that his cousin should come with him if only for the curiosity of looking at the other two little animals and learning the difference between them and kitty at whom he still looked as if her godfather had insulted her  it was pretty to see his tenderness as he detached the little girl from her hold and laid her in the cot making a little murmuring sound and boasted how she would have shown off if awake and laughed over her droll little jealousies of his even touching the twins  as she was asleep he might venture and it was comical to hear him declaring that no one need mistake them for each other and to see him trying to lay them side by side on his knees to be compared when they would roll over and interlace their little scratching fingers and louis stood by teasing him and making him defend their beauty in terms that became extravagant  he was really happy here the careworn look smoothed away the sharpness left his tones and there was nothing but joyous exultation and fondness in his whole manner  the smile did not last long for louis was wellnigh thrown downstairs by a dustpan in a dark corner and james was heard muttering that nothing in that house was ever in its right place and while louis was suggesting that it was only himself who was not in the right place they entered the drawingroom which like the lady was in the same condition as that in which he had left it  since isabel had lost marianne and other appliances she had thought it not worth while to dress for dinner so nothing had happened except that the hermit had proved to be adelines great uncle and had begun to clear up the affair of the sacrilege  he was reluctant to leave off when the gentlemen appeared but isabel shut him up and quietly held out the portfolio to james who put it on the sidetable and began to clear the books away and restore some sort of order but it was a task beyond his efforts  dinner was announced by charlotte as usual all neat grace and simplicity in her black dress and white apron but flushed and heated by exertions beyond her strength  all that depended on her had been well done but it would not seem to have occurred to her mistress that three people ate more than two and to louis who had been too busy to take any luncheon the two dishes seemed alarmingly small  one was of haricot mutton the other of potatoes and charlotte might be seen to blush as she carried lord fitzjocelyn the plate containing a chop resembling indian rubber decorated with grease and with two balls of nearly raw carrot and followed it up with potatoes apparently all bruises  louis talked vigorously of virginia and louisasecretly marvelling how his hosts had brought themselves down to such fare  isabel was dining without apparently seeing anything amiss and james attempted nothing but a despairing toss of his chin as he pronounced the carrots underdone  after the first course there was a long interval during which isabel and louis composedly talked about the public meeting which he had been attending and james fidgetted in the nervousness of hardlyrestrained displeasure but suddenly a frightful shrieking arose and he indignantly cried that girl  poor charlotte in her hysterics again said isabel moving off quickly for her with the purple scentbottle at her chatelaine  isabel makes her twice as bad exclaimed james to pet her with eaudecologne is mere nonsense  some day i shall throw a bucket of cold water over her  isabel had left the door open and they heard her softly comforting charlotte with never mind and lord fitzjocelyn would not care till the storm lulled  charlotte crept off to her room and isabel returned to the dinnertable  well whats the matter now said james  poor charlotte said isabel smiling it seems that she trusted to making a grand appearance with the remains of yesterdays pudding and that she was quite overset by the discovery that ellen and miss catharine had been marauding on them  you dont mean that kitty has been eating that heavy pudding at this time of night cried james  kitty eats everything was the placid answer and i do not think we can blame ellen for she often comes down after our dinner to find something for the nursery supper  things go on in the most extraordinary manner muttered james  i suppose charlotte misses jane said louis  she looks ill  no wonder said james she is not strong enough for such work she has no method and yet she is the only person who ever thinks of doing a thing properly  i wish your friend madison would come home and take her off our hands for she is always alternating between fits of novelreading and of remorse in which she nearly works herself to death with running after lost time  i should be sorry to part with her said isabel she is so quiet and so fond of the children  she will break down some day said james if not before certainly when she hears that madison has a peruvian wife  there is no more to come said isabel rising shall we come upstairs  james took up the candles and louis followed considerably hungry and for once provoked by isabels serene certainty that nobody cared whether there were anything to eat  however he had forgotten all by the time he came upstairs and began to deliver a message from lady conway that she was going to write in a day or two to beg for a visit from isabel during her sojourn at estminster a wateringplace about thirty miles distant  isabels face lighted with pleasure i could go she said eagerly turning towards james  oh yes if you wish it he answered gruffly as if vexed at her gratification  i mean of course if you can spare me she said with an air of more reserve  if you wish it go by all means  i hope you will  the christmas holidays are so near that we may both go said isabel but james still had not recovered his equanimity and louis thought it best to begin talking of other things and turning to james launched into the results of his inglewood crops and the grand draining plan which was to afford marksedge work for the winter and in which his father had become much interested  but he did not find that ready heed to all that occupied him of which he used to be certain at the terrace isabel cared not at all for farming and took no part in mere country squires talk and james was too much overburthened with troubles and anxieties to enter warmly into those of others  of those to whom louiss concerns had been as their own one had been taken from him the other two were far away and the cold yes very good fell coldly on his ear  the conversation reverted to the school and here it appeared that two years experience had taken away the freshness of novelty and the cycle of disappointment had begun  more boys were quitting the school than the newcomers could balance and james spoke with acute vexation of the impracticability of the boys and the folly of the parents  the attendance at his evening lectures had fallen off and he declared that there was a spirit of opposition to whatever he did the boys disobeyed knowing that they should be favoured at home and if they were punished the parents talked of complaints to the trustees  the sunday teaching was treated as especially obnoxious the genteel mothers talked ridiculously about its resembling a charityschool the fathers did not care whether their sons went or not and he had scarcely five boys who appeared there regularly and of them one was the butchers son who came rather in spite of his parents than with their consent  attendance at church was more slack than ever and when he lectured the defaulters and gave them additional tasks in the week it was resented as an injustice  to crown all mr ramsbotham had called and had been extremely insolent about a boy whose ears had been boxed for reading pickwick in school under cover of his latin grammar and isabel was almost indignant with miss faithfull for having ventured to hint to her that she wished mr frost would be a little more gentle with the boys  isabel was fully alive now and almost as vehement as her husband in her complaints against his many foes  there was no lack of sympathy here indeed there might be rather too much for she did not afford the softening influence that james had hitherto found at home  well jem said louis at last i think you should keep your hands off the boys  you are not bitten with the nonsense about personal dignity and corporal punishment said james  by no means  i have an infinite respect for the great institution of flogging but a solemn execution is one thing a random stroke another  theories are very good things till you come to manage two score dunces without sense or honour  there is only one sort of appeal to their feelings that tells  maybe so but i have my doubts whether you are the man to make it  louis was sorry he had so spoken for a flush of pain came up in jamess face at the remembrance of what fitzjocelyn had long ago forgottena passionate blow given to deter him from a piece of wilful mischief in which he was persisting for the mere amusement of provoking  it stood out among all other varieties of cuff stroke and knock by the traces it had left by mrs frosts grief at it and the forgiveness from the earl and it had been the most humiliating distress of jamess childhood  it humbled him even now and he answered  you may be right louis i may be not sufficiently altered since i was a boy  i have struck harder than i intended more than once and i have told the boys so  i am sure if they had any generosity they would have been touched with your amends cried isabel  after all a schoolmasters life does not tend to mend the temper concluded james sighing and passing his hand over his forehead  no thought louis nor does isabels mutton     chapter xiii  the conway household    and ye shall walk in silk attire     and siller hae to spare   gin yell consent to be his bride     nor think of donald mair                    miss blamire   what makes you so lame today asked lord ormersfield as louis crossed the library on returning from an interview to which he had been summoned in another room  i only stumbled over an obstruction on the frost staircase yesterday said louis poor jem chose to have me up to the nursery and to see him in the paternal character is the funniest as well as the pleasantest spectacle the house affords  ah it is not what it was said the earl  i suppose i must call there before the holidays though he added reluctantly  but what did that man ramsbotham want with you  to ask our interest for that appointment for his friend grant  indeed what could bring him here  why unluckily he fancied he had some claim on me on the score of jem frosts election  i was too innocent then to know what those things go for  you may say so ejaculated the earl  so he was insolent enough to bring that up was he  worse said fitzjocelyn he wanted to threaten that unless i would oblige him now there were matters which it was his duty to lay before the trustees  i told him he would do of course whatever was his duty whereupon he thought my lordship was interested in mr frost  intolerably impertinent  i hope you set him down  i told him that neither mr frost nor i should wish him to pretermit his duty on any consideration whatever  then he harked back to what he did for us at the election and i was forced to tell him that if he considered that he had thereby established a claim on me i must own myself in his debt but as to reciprocating it by putting in a person like grant that was against my conscience  he flew into a passion informed me that mr frost would take the consequences mounted the british lion and i bowed him out upon that majestic quadruped talking grandly of illiberal prejudices and the rising generation  you acknowledged that he had a claim on you  as things go in this world i suppose it is true  louis you will never know how to deal with those people  i am afraid not  i could not either boldly or diplomatically get rid of the charge so there was nothing for it but to confess thats not the worst of it  i am afraid he really will be able to take revenge on poor jem and im sure he cant afford to lose any more scholars  such a fellow as that will not have much in his power against james said lord ormersfield  what i am afraid of is that you have cut the ground from under your feet  i cannot see how you are ever to stand for northwold  nor i said louis  in fact father i have always thought it most wonderfully kind forbearance that you never reproached me more for my doings on that occasion  i believe we were all too happy he presently added with a sigh which was reechoed by his father at the same time trying to say something about youthfulness to which louis who had been leaning thoughtfully on the mantelpiece presently answeredhow much wiser old people are than young  an original axiom is not it but it is the last which one learns  you would hardly act in the same way now said his father  i wonder when it ever answers to interfere with the natural course of events responded louis musingly  there were two things that mr calcott told me once upon a time  those two things he left unuttered they werethat the gentleman would be wasted on the school and that the lady was not made for a poor mans wife  no wonder they made him sigh but he concluded by exclaiming aloud  well i hope they will both go to estminster and come back with fresh life  the estminster invitation was already on the road but unfortunately lady conway had been unable to secure lodgings large enough to receive the children  she was urgent however that isabel should come as soon as possible since louisa had been more unwell than usual and was pining for her eldest sister and she hoped that james would join her there as soon as the holidays should set him free  james was hurt to find isabel so much delighted to go but resolved that she should not be deprived of the pleasure and petulantly denied the offers which became even entreaties that she might wait till he could accompany her  he arranged therefore that he should follow her in a fortnights time the miss faithfulls undertaking the charge of their small namesakes and lady conway wrote to fix a day when delaford should come to take care of isabel on her journey  james and isabel laughed at this measure  mrs james frost was certainly not in circumstances to carry such a hero of the buttery in her suite and lady conway herself had more sense than to have proposed it but for delafords own representations  in fact there was a pretty face at dynevor terrace and he had been piqued enough by the return of his letters to be resolved on reestablishing his influence therefore did he demonstrate to my lady that the only appropriate trains would bring him to northwold at seven in the evening and take him and mrs james frost dynevor away at eleven next morning and therefore did isabel look up in a sudden fit of recollection as the breakfast was being removed and say charlotte delaford is coming on tuesday to fetch me to estminster and will sleep here that night  isabel little guessed that in the days when she viewed the fantastic viscount as her greatest enemy the announcement of his approach would have been far less appalling to her  the wretch the traitor the vile deceiver thought charlotte not chary of her epithets and almost ready to wreak her vengeance on the silver spoons  he has gone and broken poor mariannes heart and now he wants to treat me the same and make me faithless to poor tom that is up in the mountaintops and trusts to me  o me what shall i do mrs beckett is gone and theres no one to give me an advice if i speak to him or scorn him hell take his advantage all alikeand his words are so fine and so soft that do what i will to hate him when im away he is sure to wind round me when hes there and i cant get away and im a poor lonely fatherless and motherless orphan and a vain girl that has listened already to his treacherous suit more than poor tom would think for  charlotte worked on in much grief and perplexity for some minutes revolving the vanity that had led to her follies and humbling herself in her own eyes  suddenly a flash of thought crossed her and woke a smile upon her face almost a look of mischief  she tied on a clean apron and running upstairs opened the drawingroom door and said if you please maam might i ask miss faithfulls martha to tea on tuesday night  oh yes if you like said isabel never raising her eyes from the rebuilding of the ruined chapel in the valley  away skipped charlotte and in two minutes was at the back door of the house beautiful  mrs martha had been grimly kind to her ever since she had been afflicted with the cook for a fellowservant and received her only with a reproof for coming gadding out when she ought to be hard at work but when she heard the invitation she became wrathfulshe had rather go ten miles out of her way than even look at that there ford  but charlotte explained her purpose and implored and put her in mind that mrs beckett was gone and she had no protector and martha relented told her that if she had minded her she would never have been in the scrape at all but agreed not without satisfaction to afford mr delaford the society of his old acquaintance  and so when mr delaford with his whiskers freshly curled and his boots in a state of fascinating polish walked up dynevor terrace the door was opened by ellen and the redfaced cook and the upright mrs martha sat on either side the fire  daintily did he greet them and stand warming himself before the fire adapting his conversation to them for the next ten minutes before he ventured to ask whether miss arnold were still an inmate  taking out dinnertaking in tea gruffly replied martha  mr delaford waited but ellen only ran in for one moment to fetch the kettle and martha discoursed as usual on the gold mines in peru byandby when the parlour tea could by no possibility be supposed to be farther prolonged there swept into the kitchen the stately nurse charlotte had run up to the nursery and begged as a favour that she might be left to watch the children while mrs nurse entertained mr delaford belowstairs and in pity to so grand a gentleman constrained to mix with such low servants the nurse had yielded and charlotte sat safe and sound by the nursery fire smiling at his discomfiture and reading over toms letters with an easier conscience than for many a day  mr delaford was too much of a gentleman to be uncivil to the three dames by the kitchen fire but he watched every step and every creaking door  he even went the length of coming up to family prayers in hopes of there meeting charlotte but she only joined the procession at the parlour door and had flown upstairs like a little bird before he was out again  the gentleman was affronted and resolved to make her feel it  they could not but meet at the kitchen breakfast and he barely acknowledged her  this was the most trying stroke of all for it set her in the eyes of the cook and nurse on a level with the inferior servants to whom he would not have deigned a look and it was not easy to resist showing that she was on more familiar terms with him than all  but the instinct of selfprotection and the wisdom of sincerity came to her aid  she abstained from raising her eyes to his face from one conscious word or glance she locked herself into her pantry when she took down the breakfastthings and avoided every encounter even when she had begun to feel that it would have been more flattering had he made more efforts  at last dire necessity obliged her to accept his aid in carrying her mistresss box down the stairs  he walked backwards she forwards  she would not meet his eye and he was too wellbred for one word on the stairs but in the garden he exclaimed miss arnold what have i done  i never ought to have listened to you said charlotte  it was not right by neither of us so please say no more  if you could understand  i dont want to understand nothing  charlotte drove him on with the box till they were close to the fly and then leaving him and the man to adjust the packing flew back to announce that all was ready for her mistress  the last kisses were given to the children and a message left with charlotte for her master who was in school then she stood with miss catharine in her arms and saw the fly drive off  well said mrs cook that butler thinks himself a great beau no doubt  i asked him whether he thought you pretty charlotte and he said you hadnt no air nor no complexion  its as i tells younobody will never take no notice of you while you goes about so dowdy  charlotte did not know whether she was glad that the cook could not tease her about delaford or mortified to be supposed beneath his notice  no air forsooth  she who had often heard it said that she looked like any lady  but oh said charlotte to herself as she spent her daily five minutes at noonday in quiet thought am i not a poor silly thing not to be thankful that care has been round me this time and that i have not been let to do nothing giddy nor false by tom whatever i may have thought  meanwhile isabel had found it much harder to part with her babies for three weeks than it had seemed at the first proposal and there were tears in her eyes as she gazed at the peaked redtiled roof of the old grammarschool and reckoned the days and hours before her husband would join her  other associations revived when she found herself at estminster and was received with shrieks of joy caresses and exclamations too fond and foolish to bear repetition and then the pale louisa rested against her stroking her hand and lady conway fondled her and virginia looking formed and handsome retreated a little way to study her and declare that she was the same isabel neither altered nor grown olderit was all a dream that she had ever left them  she almost felt it so herself so entirely did she fit into the old habits the little quiet dinner only it seemed unusually good the subsequent closing round the fire with the addition of miss king and louisa the easy desultory chat the books with mudies stamp lying about the music which must be practised  it was very like being miss conway still and when she awoke the next morning to find it late and to the impulse of hurrying up or not hurrying expecting to find james making breakfast himself and cross at being made late for school she turned on her pillow half doubting whether she had dreamt these two years in one long night and remembering that captive mermaid who had but to resume her maritime headgear and return to her native element to forget the very existence of her fisherman husband and children  no isabel was not come to that but she was almost ashamed to enjoy her extra hours repose and then the leisurely breakfastnay even the hot rolls and clear coffee were appreciated and she sighed as she called up the image of the breakfast over an hour ago the grim kettle the bad butter the worse fire and james cold and hurried with kitty on his knee gnawing a lump of crust  it was a contrast to lady conway reading her letters and discussing engagements with comfortable complacency and virginia making suggestions and louisas grave bright eyes consulting hers and miss king quietly putting in a remark and the anticipation of walters return as if he were the only person wanting  the sisters always resented their mothers habit of talking of poor isabel regarding her as the happiest of women and they were confirmed in their belief by seeing her looking exceedingly well and handsome with perhaps a little more dignity and a sweeter smile virginia loved to snatch private interviews with miss king to express her confidence in dear isabels felicity in the infallibility and other perfections of james and in the surpassing cleverness of little catharine and louisa was always sighing to behold the twins  but to the delight of the schoolroom the chapel in the valley was produced in a complete form and a very pretty romance it was but the hermit and the brilliant denouement were quite a shock to the young ladies just when their tears were prepared and virginia was almost angry  oh my dear there is trouble enough in the world said isabel hubert and adeline have been my companions so long that at least i must leave them happy  indeed said miss king i am almost surprised that you have been able to finish them at all with so much rewriting  to her surprise isabel blushed and her answer partook of selfdefence  james is so busy and the children so young that this has been my great resource  when my little girls are older i must begin educating in earnest  i want to talk over madame neckars book with you miss king  all systems begin alike from infant obedience i believe said the governess  yes said isabel little catharine is obedience itself with us it is curious to see how well she knows the difference between us and the nurses  there are great tempests upstairs and her papa takes them very much to heart  he always has her downstairs when he is at home and he has accustomed her to so much attention that there is no doing anything while she is by or i would have her more with me  the selfjustifying tone rather puzzled miss king  she noted likewise that isabel was backward in entering into details of her home life and that she never said a word to encourage her sisters wishes to visit her at northwold  knowing isabel as the governess did she was sure that she would not merely talk of things on the surface if her spirit were fully content  only once did she go any deeper and that was as she took up a little book of religious poetry of which she had been very fond  ah she said i dont feel these things as i used  i think practical life dulls one  i should have said practical life made things real said miss king  isabel had not found out that having duties and not doing them was less practical than having no particular task  another cloud of mystery was over the relations with mr dynevor and clara  isabel baffled all lady conways inquiries and advice by entering into no particulars but adhering to her own version of the matter that mr dynevor had required of james conditions incompatible with his duty and not deigning to explain either duty or conditions as beyond the capacity of her hearer  of clara no account was vouchsafed except that isabel believed she was abroad they had been very much disappointed in her and isabel was afraid that she was a good deal altered and the subject seemed so painful that virginia did not venture to push her inquiries any farther  the great subject of interest in the conway family was that virginia and louisa were going to lose their maid and the suggestion somehow arose that charlotte should be her successor  it was agreed on all hands that nature had formed her for a ladysmaid and a few lessons from a hairdresser would make her perfection and she would be invaluable in reading to louisa when restless and unable to sleep  isabel gave herself credit for the most notable arrangement she had ever madepromoting the little maiden whom she really liked and relieving herself from the constant annoyance about sparing ellen from the nursery by obtaining a stronger housemaid  she had only a few scruples or rather she knew that james would have some as to exposing charlotte to delafords attentions after what she had heard in claras letter but the least hint on this score led to a panegyric upon delafords perfectionshis steadiness his prudence his cleverness on journeys his usefulness in taking care of walter i know that walter is safe when he is with delaford said lady conway  and even the sensible miss king observed smiling that there always would be nonsense between men and maidservants and there were many more dangerous places than the present  she would watch over charlotte and fanshawe was quite to be trusted  the conway family knew rather less about their own servants hall than they did of feudal establishments five hundred years ago  still isabel in her superior prudence resolved to consult fanshawe on the true state of affairs  fanshawe was a comfortable portly personage chiefly absorbed in her caps and her good cheer and faring smoothly through life on the principle of always saying what was expected of her and never seeing anything to anybodys disadvantage  she assured mrs james frost that she did not think delaford to blame many girls would be foolish about a man with personal advantages but she could not see it was his fault  poor marianne had been always weakly and after all maam some young women will put constructions upon anything said mrs fanshawe deciding that at least she should make no mischief by sacrificing poor marianne  isabel did not like to come to more individual inquiries lest she should prepare discomfort for charlotte but she easily satisfied herself that all was as right as convenient and having occasion to write some orders to charlotte communicated the proposal saying that all should be settled on her return  there was wild work in the brain of the poor little lady of eschalott no more stairs to scrub  no more mats to shake  no more hurrying after lost time and an uneasy remembrance of undone duties no more hardening of fingers no more shortsleeved lilac no more vulgarities from the cook  ladylike dress high wages work among flowers and gauzes reading to miss louisa housekeepersroom society rank as arnold or miss arnold  how much more suitable to the betrothed of the superintendent at san benito  to be sure she was aware that a serpent lurked among the flowers but she had shown him a bit of her mind once and she found she could take care of herself and keep him at a distance  with her eyes shut she already beheld jane beckett meeting her when seated at the back of a carriage with a veil and a parasol addressing her as a grand lady and kissing and praising her when she found her little charlotte after all     chapter xiv  the trustees meeting    know you not master to some kind of men   their graces serve them but as enemies                            as you like it   my lord said frampton entering the library late one evening in visible perturbation and addressing himself to fitzjocelyn there is a person wishing to see you  what person at this time of night said louis  in fact my lord said the butler hesitating it is the young person at mr frosts  something must be the matter cried louis starting up  she would explain nothing to me she insisted on seeing your lordship andin factshe was in such a state of agitation that i left her with mrs bowles  louis lost no time in hurrying into the hall  charlotte must have followed frampton without his knowledge for she was already there and springing with clasped hands towards fitzjocelyn she cried sobbing my lord my lord come to master  is he ill or the children  no no but hell be off hell be off like poor tom exclaimed charlotte between her gasps but ive locked it and she waved a doorkey and seemed about to laugh hysterically  sit down charlotte said louis authoritatively bringing a chair if you do not explain yourself reasonably at once i shall call mrs bowles and desire her to put you to bed  she made an imploring gesture sank trembling into the chair and after a few incoherent efforts managed to speakif you would but come to master my lordi know it is something bad  louis thought it wisest to despatch frampton at once to order the carriage to be brought out immediately and this so far pacified charlotte that she could speak comprehensibly on the cause of her alarm  he is in such a way she began  he went out to the schoolexamination i believe in his cap and gown this morning he was gone all day but just at dusk i heard him slamto the front door fit to shake the house down like he does when he is put out id a thought nothing of that but byandby i heard him stamping up and down the study like one in a frenzy and i found his cap and gown lying all of a heap in a corner of the hall  then mr calcott came to call and when i went into the study master had his head down on the table and wouldnt see no one he fairly stamped to me to be gone and bring him no more messages  mr calcott he looked so sorry and concerned and sent in again  i was to say that he hoped some arrangement might be made if mr frost would only see him but master had locked the door and hallooed out that i was to say he was obliged but couldnt see nobody  so mr calcott was forced to go and there was poor master not one morsel of dinner has he had  i knocked but he would not open only said he did not want for nothing  no not even when twas time for miss catharine to come down   she thumped at the door and called papa so pretty but he never heeded except to call out take her away  charlotte was crying so much that she could hardly proceed then i knew it must be something very melancholy indeed  but byandby he opens the door with a great jerk and runs right up to the lumberroom  i saw his face and twas like a corpse my lord and he brings down his portmanteau into his dressingroom and i hears him pulling out all his drawers  hell be gone i thinks hell be off to america too  and my poor mistress  so i went up quietly and in secret unbeknown to them all and got my bonnet and ive run every step of the wayfor you are the only one my lord as can soothe his wounded spirit and ive locked both the doors and heres the key so he cant be gone till you come  locked the doors cried louis  what have you done  suppose your mistress or miss clara were ill  oh nono it is not that said charlotte or why should he flee from the face of his children  why i took miss salome up to the top of the stairs when she was screaming and crying with all her might and you would not have thought he was within a mile of her  no my lord no one cant do nothing but you  ill come at once said louis  you did quite right to fetch me but it was a frightful thing to lock the door  sending charlotte to the housekeeper he went to communicate her strange intelligence to his father who shared his dismay so much as almost to wish to come with him to northwold but louis felt he could deal better alone with james  his fears took the direction of the italian travellers knowing that any misfortune to them must recoil on james with double agony after such a parting  in very brief space the carriage was at northwold and desiring that it should wait at the corner of the terrace louis followed charlotte who had jumped down from the box and hastened forward to unlock the door and he was in time to hear the angry though suppressed greeting that received her  pretty doings maam  so i have caught you out at last though you did think to lock me in  he shant come in  i wonder at your impudence  the very front door  oh cook dont  the poor breathless voice managed at last to be heard  this is lord fitzjocelyn  cook had vanished out of sight or hearing before louiss foot was within the threshold  the studydoor was open the fire expiring the books and papers pushed back and jamess fierce restless tread was heard pacing vehemently about his own room  louis ran hastily up and entered at once  his cousin stood staring with wild eyes his hair was tossed and tangled his face lividly pale and the table was strewn with fragments of letters begun and torn up again his clothes lay tumbled in disorder on the floor where his portmanteau lay open and partly packed  all louiss worst alarm seemed fulfilled at once what has happened he cried catching hold of both jamess hands as if to help him to speak  who is illnot clara  nono one is ill said james withdrawing his hands and kneeling down by his box with an air of feigned indifference i am only going to london  to london  aye to see what is to be doneshipchaplaincy curacy literature selling sermons at five shillings eachwhat not i am no longer master of northwold school  he strove to speak carelessly but bending over his packing thrust down the clothes with desperate blows  louis sat down too much dismayed to utter a word  one mornings work in the conclave said james with the same assumed ease  heres their polite reprimand which they expected me to put up withcensuring all my labour forbidding sundayclasses accusing me of partiality and cruelty with a lot of nonsense about corporal punishment and dignity  i made answer that if i were master at all i must be at liberty to follow my own views otherwise i would resign and would you believe it they snapped at the offerthey thought it highly desirable  theres an end of it  impossible cried louis casting his eye over the reprimand and finding that the expressions scarcely warranted jamess abstract of them  you must have mistaken  do you doubt that and james threw to him a sheet where in richardsons clerkly handwriting the trustees of king edwards northwold grammar school formally accepted the resignation of the reverend james roland frost dynevor  they cannot be so hasty  did not mr calcott call to gee you  an old humbug  ill go and see him this instant  something may be done  no said james holding him down by the shoulder i will not be degraded by vain solicitations  this must be that wretched ramsbotham exclaimed louis  oh jem i little thought he had so much power to injure you  it is as well you did not said james  it would have made no difference except in the pain it would have cost you and the only gratification in this business is that i suffer because neither you nor i would deny our principles  i thank you fitzjocelyn and he straightened himself in the satisfaction of persecuted rectitude  you have very little to thank me for said louis wringing his hand and turning aside as if unable yet to face the full extent of the evil  never fear for us continued james boldly we shall struggle on mens consciayou see i cant forget to be a schoolmaster  but what are you about  where are you going  to london  you spoke to a publisher about my lectures on history they will serve for introduction  he may make me his hacka willing one while i advertiseapply for anything  i must be gone  you do not look fit for a night journey  you would be too early at estminster to see isabel  dont name her cried james starting round as if the word were a dart  thank heaven that she is away  i must write to her  maybe lady conway will keep her till i am settledtill i have found some lodging in london where no one will know us  and where you may run up a comfortable doctors bill  with a gesturehalf passion half despairjames reiterated theres no staying here  i must be gone  i must be among strangers  your mens conscia would better prove that it has no cause for shame by staying here instead of rushing out of sight into the human wilderness and sacrificing those poor little  james struck his foot on the floor as though to intercept the word but louis continued apparently unmoved by his angerthose poor little children  if misfortune and injury be no disgrace to the injured i call it cowardly pride to fly off by night to hide oneself instead of living in your own house like an honest man  livepray what am i to live on cried james laughing hoarsely  you will not find out by whirling to london in your present state  in fact louiss most immediate care was to detain him for that one night  there was a look of coming illness about him and his desperate maddened state of mind might obscure his judgment and urge him into some precipitate measure such as he might afterwards rue bitterly for the sake of the wife and children the bare thought of whom seemed at present to sting him so intolerably  moreover louis had a vague hope that so harsh a proceeding would be abandoned by the trustees his father would remonstrate and james might be able to think and to apologize  he was hardly a rational being tonight and probably would have driven away any other companion but long habit and external coolness enabled louis to stand his ground and to protract matters till the clock striking eleven relieved him as much as it exasperated james by proving it so late that the last train would have already past  he persisted in declaring that he should go by the first in the morning and louis persuaded him to go to bed after charlotte had brought them some tea which he said choked him  deciding on sleeping at no 5 louis sent home the carriage with a note to his father and charlotte pressed her hands together in a transport of gratitude when she found that he was not going to abandon her master she did her best to make the forlorn house comfortable but it was but cold comfort with all the fires gone out and he was too sad and anxious to heed it  she was at his door early the next morning with a summons more alarming than surprising  she was sure that master was very ill  there was james lying across his bed halfdressed turned away from the dim morning light and more frightfully pale than ever  he started angrily at louiss entrance and sprang up but fell back insisting with all his might that nothing ailed him but a common headache which needed only to be left quiet for an hour or two  he said it venomously  a very uncommon headache thought louis  my belief is that it is little short of brain fever  if i could only feel his pulse  but it would be very like taking a mad dogs hand  theres nothing for it but to fetch old walby  he may have some experience of refractory patients  go home louis reiterated james savagely on opening his eyes and finding him not gone  i tell you i want nobody  i shall be in london before night  and starting up he tried to draw the curtain at his feet to shut out the tardy dawn but too giddy to persevere he sank back after one noisy pull  louis drew it completely shaded the window and would have settled the pillows but was not allowed and obtaining an impatient grunt by way of dismissal he ran down stairs caught up hat and stick and set off to summon mr walby from his comfortable family breakfasttable  the good old doctor was more concerned than amazed  he could hardly surmount the shock to his trustee conscience on hearing of the consequence of yesterdays proceedings  i was much grieved at the time he said as they walked to the terrace together  you will believe me that i was no willing party my lord  i could never believe that you would do anything hard towards any one mr walby said louis kindly and a few more like assurances led the old man to volunteer the history of the case in confidence  ramsbotham had brought before the meeting of the trustees a serious mass of charges on which he founded a motion that mr frost should be requested to resign  every one rejected such a measure and the complaints were sifted  some were palpably false others exaggerated others related to matters of principle but deducting these it still was proved that the sunday attendance and evening lectures were too visibly the test of his favour and that the boys were sometimes treated with undue severity savouring of violent temper  i must confess my lord said mr walby sinking his voice i am afraid mr frost is too prompt with his hand  a man does not know how hard he hits when he knocks a boy over the ears with a book  mrs barkers little boy really had a gathering under the ear in consequencei saw it myself  louis was confounded he had nothing to say to this he knew the force that irritation gave to jamess hand too well to refuse his credence and he could only feel shame and dismay as if himself guilty by his misjudged patronage  mr walby proceeded to say that under the circumstances the trustees had decided on remonstrating by letter after the examination and it was easy to perceive that the reprimand which might have been wise and moderate from the squire had gained a colour from every one concerned so as to censure what was right and aggravate what was wrong  mr frosts reply had been utterly unexpected ramsbotham and the bookseller had caught at the resignation and so did the butcher who hated the schoolmaster for having instilled inconveniently high principles into his son richardson abstained from voting mr calcott fought hard for mr frost but the grocer was ill and only poor old mr walby supported him and even they felt that their letter had not deserved such treatment  alas had not fitzjocelyn himself taught northwold that the squire was not a dictator  even then mr calcott still hoping that an apology might retrieve the day had set forth to argue the matter with james frost whom he could not suppose serious in his intentions but thought he meant to threaten the trustees into acquiescence  the doors had been closed against him and mr walby feared that now the step was known it was too late to retract it the ladies would never allow it he declared there was no saying how virulent they were against mr frost and as to consideration for his family that rather inflamed their dislike  they had rich relations enough  it would be only too good for so fine a lady to be brought down  every one had some story of her pride neglect or bad housewifery  and i can tell you said mr walby that i am not in their good books for declaring that i never saw anything from her but very pretty affable manners  with these words they reached the house and with sighs and murmurs of ah poor young man  mr walby followed louis to the landingplace where they both paused looking at each other in doubt how to effect an entrance louis suddenly remembering that no presence would be more intolerable to the patient than that of a trustee  however there was nothing for it but to walk in and announce as a matter of course that he had thought it right to call in mr walby  the extremity of displeasure brought james to his feet and out into the passage saying with grave formality that he was much obliged and glad to see mr walby as a friend but lord fitzjocelyn was mistaken in thinking him in need of his advice  many thanks he would trouble him no further and affecting a laugh he said that fitzjocelyn seemed never to have heard of a bad headache  acting does not mend matters jem said louis  you had much better confess how really ill you are  excessive giddiness made james stagger against his cousin and louis throwing his arms round him looked in great alarm to the doctor for help but was answered by something very like a smile  aye aye sir theres nothing for it but to go to bed  if his lordship there had seen as many cases of jaundice as i have he would not look so frightened  very wholesome disorder  yes lie down and ill send you a thing or two to take  so saying mr walby helped louis to lay their unwilling invalid on the bed without much resistance or reply and presently departed so infinitely relieved that he could not help indulging in a little chuckle at the young viscounts mistake  as soon as he was gone james revived enough to protest that it was all nonsense doctors must needs give a name to everything if they would only let him alone he should be himself and off to london in two hours and that it was fitzjocelyn himself who was looking excessively ill and as yellow as a guinea  he would not hear of undressing and going absolutely to bed and fairly scolded every one out of sight  good miss mercy who had trotted in at the tidings of illness stood at the nurserydoor telegraphing signs of commiseration in answer to louiss looks of perplexity  at least she said you had better come to breakfast with us and hear what my sister sayssalome always knows what is best  he soon found himself in the snug parlour where the small round breakfasttable drawn close to miss faithfulls fireside chair had a sort of dollshouse air of cheerful comfort with the tiny plates teacups and the miniature loaf and the complicated spiderlegs among which it was not easy to dispose of his own length of limb  the meal passed in anxious consultation  there might be no danger but the disorder was severe and increasing  jamess health had long been suffering from harass of mind want of exercise and unwholesome diet and the blow of the previous day had brought things to a crisis  there he lay perfectly unmanageable permitting neither aid nor consolation unable to endure the sight of any one and too much stupefied by illness to perceive the impracticability of his wild scheme of seeking employment in london  miss faithfull pronounced that either mercy or lord fitzjocelyn must go and fetch mrs james frost home  i was only thinking how long we could keep her away said louis pray dont be shocked dear miss mercy but i thought i could nurse poor jem much better alone than with another dead weight on our hands  they would neither of them thank you said miss faithfull laughing depend upon it she will know best how to deal with him  well you see more of their household than i do but i have never dared to think of her  do you remember the words if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee  there are some people who can run with the horsemen better than with the footmen said miss salome  you know we are very fond of young mrs frost  we cannot forget her sweetness when she lived in this house and she has always been most kind and friendly  i do believe that to display the most admirable qualities she only needs to be roused  to live in the house with jem and jems three babies and yet want rousing  i have thought said salome diffidently that he was only too gentle with her  do you know how very severe you are growing miss faithfull said louis looking her in the face in the gravity of amusement  i mean said miss faithfull blushing though of course i do not know that i have fancied it might be better for both if he could have gone to the root of the matter and set fairly before her the prime duties requisite in the mistress of such a family  he may have done so  i think not said louis it would be awkward when a woman fancied she embraced poverty voluntarily for his sake  poverty  it was riches compared with their present condition isabel on 150 pounds ayear  it may well make poor jem ill to think about it  i only wonder it is not a brainfever  lord fitzjocelyn regrets that brainfever said miss faithfull  probably my ideas on the subject are derived from the prevalence of the complaint in light literature said louis smiling  it would be more dignified and suit isabel better  poor isabel  i hope i have done her injustice  she behaved gloriously at the barricades and has a great soul after all but i had begun to think heroines not calculated for moderate circumstances  may they do better in no circumstances at all  heighho how a heavy heart makes one talk nonsense  so i am to fetch the poor thing home miss faithfull  this was determined on whether with or without jamess consent miss mercy undertaking that she and martha would help charlotte and dispose of the children in the house beautiful and she went back with louis to fetch them when little catharine was found peeping through the bars of her prisongate at the top of the nurserystairs shouting lustily for papa  she graciously accepted her godfather as a substitute and was carried by him to her kind neighbours house already a supplementary home  as to her father louis found him more refractory than ever his only greeting was why are not you gone home  he scorned mr walbys prescriptions and made such confident assertions that he should be off to london in the evening that fitzjocelyn almost reverted to the brainfever theory and did not venture to hint his intention to any one but charlotte telling her that he should now almost think her justified in locking the doors  sending information to his father he started for estminster very disconsolate and full of selfreproach for the hasty proceedings which had borne such bitter fruits  the man and the situation had been an injustice to each other a sensitive irritable person was the very last to be fit for a position requiring unusual judgment and temper where his energy had preyed upon itself  his being placed there had been the work of louiss own impetuous scorn of the wisdom of elder and graver heads  such regrets derived additional poignancy from the impossibility of conferring direct assistance upon james and from the degree of justice in the hard measure which had been dealt to him would make it for ever difficult to recommend him and yet the devising future schemes for his welfare was the refuge which louiss mind most willingly sought from the present perplexity of the communication in store for poor isabel  as he put out his head at the estminster station a familiar voice shouted hollo  fitzjocelyn how jolly  have you got james there i told isabel it would be no use but when she did not get a letter this morning she would have it that he was coming and got me to walk up with her  where is she asked louis as he jumped out and shook hands with walter  walking up and down the esplanade  she would not come into the station so i said i would run up to satisfy her  i dont know what she will say to you for not being frost  do you mean that she is anxious  it is the correct thing isnt it when wives get away from their husbands and have not the fragment of a letter for twentyfour whole hours  but what do you mean fitzjocelyn asked the boy suddenly sobering  is anything really the matter  yes walter said louis we must tell your sister as best we can james is ill and i am come for her  walter was silent for a few minutes then drew a sigh saying poor isabel i wish it had not been  these were the only comfortable holidays i have had since she chose to marry  isabel here came in sight quickening her pace as she first saw that her brother had a companion but slackening in disappointment when she perceived that it was not her husband then the next moment hurrying on and as she met them exclaiming tell me at once what is it  nothing serious said louis  the children are all well but i left james very uncomfortable though with nothing worse than a fit of jaundice  the inexperienced isabel hardly knew whether this were not as formidable as even the cherished brainfever and becoming very pale she said i am ready at oncewalter will let mamma know  there will be no train for two hours said louis  you will have plenty of time to prepare  you should have telegraphed said isabel i could have come by the first train  trembling she grasped walters arm and began hastening home impatient to be doing something  i knew something was wrong she exclaimed i ought to have gone home yesterday when there was no letter  indeed therewas nothing the matter yesterday at least with his health said louis  you are alarming yourself far too much  to be sure isabel chimed in walter  a fellow at my tutors had it and did nothing but wind silkworms silk all the time  we shall have james yet to spend christmas with us  everybody laughs at the jaundice though fitzjocelyn does look so lugubrious that he had almost frightened me  is this true said isabel looking from one to the other as if she had been frightened in vain  quite true isabel said walter  never mind fitzjocelyns long face i wouldnt go if i were you  dont spoil the holidays  i must go walter dear said isabel but i do not think lord fitzjocelyn would play with my fears  either he is very ill or something else is wrong  you have guessed it isabel said louis  this illness is partly the effect of distress of mind  that horrid meeting of trustees cried isabel  i am sure they have been impertinent  they objected to some of his doings he answered by threatening to resign and i am sorry to say that the opposition set prevailed to have his resignation accepted  a very good thing too cried sir walter  i always thought that school a shabby concern   to be under a lot of butchers and bakers and nothing but cads among the boys  he ought to be heartily glad to be rid of the crew  isabels indignation was checked by a sort of melancholy amusement at her brothers view but louis doubted whether she realized the weight of her own words as she answeredunfortunately walter it is nearly all we have to live upon  so much the better continued walter  ill tell youyou shall all go to thornton conway and ill come and spend my holidays there instead of kicking my heels at these stupid places  i shant mind your babies a bit and frost may call himself my tutor if he likes i dont care if you take me away from eton  a kind scheme walter said isabel but wanting in two important points mammas consent and jamess  oh ill take care of mamma  im afraid i cant promise the same as to james  ah i see  delaford was quite right when he said mr frost was a gentleman who never knew what was for his own advantage  as they arrived at the house isabel desired to know how soon she must be ready and went upstairs  walter detained his cousini say fitzjocelyn have they really got nothing to live on  no more than will keep them from absolute want  i shall take them home said walter with much satisfaction i shall write to tell james that there is nothing else to be done i cannot do without isabel and ill make my mother consent  fitzjocelyn was glad to be freed from the boy on any terms and to see him go off to write his letter  walter was at least sincere and warmhearted in his selfishness and so more agreeable than his mother whom louis found much distressed under the secret conviction that something might be expected of her poor isabel  i wish she could come to me but so many of themand we without a settled home  if there were no childrenbut london houses are so small and indeed it would be no true kindness to let them live in our style for a little while  they must run to expenses in dress it would be much more economical at home and i could send walter to them if he is very troublesome  thank you said louis  i think james will be able to ride out the storm independently  i know that would be his wish  and i think i heard that mr dynevor objected to the school  that might be one obstacle removed  lady conway comforted herself by flourishing on into predictions that all would now be right and that poor dear isabel would soon be a much richer woman than herself while louis listened to the castlebuilding not thinking it worth while to make useless counterprophecies  the sisters were upstairs assisting isabel and they all came down together  the girls were crying but isabels dark soft eyes and noble head had an air of calm resolute elevation which drove all louiss misgivings away and which seemed quite beyond and above the region of lady conways caresses and affectionate speeches  walter and virginia came up to the station and parted with their sister with fondness that was much mure refreshing walter reiterating that his was the only plan  now fitzjocelyn said isabel when they were shut into a coupe tell me what you said about distress of mind  it has haunted me whether you used those words  could you doubt his distress at such a state of affairs  i thought there could be no distress of mind where the suffering is for the truth  ah if he could quite feel it so  what do you mean  there has been a cabal against james from the first to make him lay aside his principles and i cannot regret his refusal to submit to improper dictation at whatever cost to myself  i am afraid he better knows than you do what that cost is likely to be  does he think i cannot bear poverty exclaimed isabel  he had not said so began louis but  you both think me a poor helpless creature said isabel her eyes kindling as they had done in the midst of danger  i can do better than you think  i may be able myself to do something towards our maintenance  he could not help answering in the tone that gave courtesy to almost any words i am afraid it does not answer for the wife to be the breadwinner  then you doubt my writing being worth anything she asked in a hurt tone of humility  tell me candidly for it would be the greatest kindness and her eye unconsciously sought the bag where lay sir hubert whom all this time her imagination was exalting as the hero who would free them from their distresses  worth much pleasure to me to the world at large said louis butyou told me to speak plainlyto your home would any remuneration be worth your own personal care  isabel coloured but did not speak  louis ventured another sentenceit is a delicate subject but you must know better than i how far james would be likely to bear that another even you should work for his livelihood  when isabel spoke again it was to ask further particulars and when he had told all she found solace in exclaiming at the folly and injustice of jamess enemies until the sense of fairness obliged him to say i wish the right and the wrong ever were fairly divided in this world and yet perhaps it is best as it is the grain of right on either side may save the sin from being a presumptuous one  it would be hard to find the one grain of right on the part of the ramsbotham cabal  perhaps you would not think so if you were a boys mother  oh cried isabel with tears in her eyes if he thought he had been too hasty he always made such reparation that only cowards could help being touched  im sure they deserved it and much more  no doubt said louis but alas if all had their deserts  then you really think he was too severe  i think his constitutional character was hardly fit for so trying a post and that his family and school troubles reacted upon each other  you mean claras conduct and dear grandmammaoh if she could but have stayed with us  if you could have seen how haggard and grieved he came home from cheveleigh  i do not think he has been quite the same ever since  and no 5 has never been the same said louis  tell me said isabel suddenly are we very poor indeed  i fear so isabel  till james can find some employment i fear there is a stern struggle with poverty before you  does that mean living as the faithfulls do  yes i think your means will be nearly the same as theirs  fitzjocelyn said isabel after a long pause i see what you have been implying all this time and i have been feeling it too  i have been absorbed in my own pursuits and not paid attention enough to details of management and so i have helped to fret and vex my husband you all think my habits an additional evil in this trial  james has never said a word of the kind cried louis  i know he has not but i ought to have opened my eyes to it long ago and i thank you for helping me  therewill you take that manuscript and keep it out of my way  it has been a great tempter to me  it is finished now and it might bring in something  but i can have only one thought nowhow to make james happier and more at ease  then isabel i dont think your misfortunes will be misfortunes  to suffer for right principles should give strength for anything said isabel  think what many better women than i have had to endure when they have had to be ashamed of their husband not proud of him now i do hope and trust that god will help us and carry us and the children through with it  louis felt that in this frame she was truly fit to cheer and sustain james  how she might endure the actual struggle with penury he dared not imagine at present he could only be carried along by her lofty composure  james still lay on his tossed uncomfortable bed in the evening twilight  the long lonely hours when he imagined louis to have taken him at his word and gone home had given him a miserable sense of desertion and as increasing sensations of illness took from him the hopes of moving on that day he became distracted at the thought of the anxiety his silence would cause isabel and after vainly attempting to write had been lying with the door open watching for some approaching step  there was the familiar sound of a soft gliding step on the stairs then a pause and the sweet soft voice my poor james how sadly uncomfortable you are  my dear he cried hastily raising himself who has been frightening you  no one fitzjocelyn was so kind as to come for me  ah i wished you to have been spared this unpleasant business  do you think i could bear to stay away  oh james have i been too useless and helpless for you even to be glad to see me  it was for your own sake he murmured pressing her hand  has fitzjocelyn told you  yes said isabel looking up as she sat beside him  never mind james  it is better to suffer wrong than to do it  i do not fear but that if we strive to do our duty god will help us and make it turn out for the best for our children and ourselves  he grasped her hand in intense emotion  i know you are anxious about me added isabel  my ways have been too selfindulgent for you to think i can bear hardness  i made too many professions at first i will make no more now but only tell you that i trust to do my utmost and not shrink from my duties  and now not a word more about it till you are better     chapter xv  sweet uses of adversity    one furnace many times the good and bad will hold   but what consumes the chaff will only cleanse the gold                                            r c trench   during the succeeding days james had little will or power to consider his affairs and isabel while attending on him had time to think over her plans  happily they had not a debt  mrs frost had so entirely impressed her grandsons mind with her own invariable rule of paying her way that it had been one of his grounds for pride that he had never owed anything to any man  they were thus free to choose their own course but lord ormersfield urged their remaining at northwold for the present  he saw mr calcott who had been exceedingly concerned at the turn affairs had taken and very far from wishing to depose james though thinking that he needed an exhortation to take heed to his ways  it had been an improper reprimand improperly received but the earl and the squire agreed that nothing but morbid fancy could conjure up disgrace such as need prevent james frost from remaining in his own house until he could obtain employment provided he and his wife had the resolution to contract their style of living under the eye of their neighbours  this gave neither of them a moments uneasiness  it was not the direction of their pride and even before jamess aching head was troubled with deliberation isabel had discussed her plan with the miss faithfulls  she would imagine herself in a colony and be troubled with no more scruples about the conventional tasks of a lady than if she were in the backwoods  they would shut up some of the rooms take one servant of allwork and isabel would be nurserymaid herself  we may do quite as well as the carpenters wife she said she has more children and less income and yet always seems to me the richest person whom i know  james groaned and turned his face away  he could not forbid it for even isabels exertion must be permitted rather than the dishonour of living beyond their means and he consoled himself with thinking that when the deadening inertness of his illness should leave him he should see some means of finding employment for himself which would save her from toil and exertion and in the meantime with all his keen selfreproach it was a blessed thing to have been brought back to his enthusiastic admiration for her all discontents and drawbacks utterly forgotten in her assiduous affection and gallant cheerfulness  lord ormersfield had readily acceded to his sons wish to bring the party to spend christmas at ormersfield as soon as james could be moved  during their visit the changes were to be made and before setting out isabel had to speak to the servants  charlottes alacrity and usefulness had made her doubly esteemed during her masters illness and when he heard how she was to be disposed of he seemed much vexed  he said that she was a legacy from his grandmother and too innocent and pretty to be cast about among strange servants in all the places where the conways visited and that he would not have consented to the transfer but that under their present circumstances it was impossible to keep her  if any evil came to her it would be another miserable effect of his own temper  isabel thought he exaggerated the dangers and she spoke brightly to charlotte about fixing the day of her going to estminster so as to be put into the ways of the place before her predecessor departed the tears at once came into charlottes eyes and she answered if you please maam i should be very sorry to leave unless i did not give satisfaction  that is far from being the reason charlotte but we cannot keep so good a servantmr frost has given up  i have been put out of the school said james from his sofa in his stern sense of truth  we must live on as little as possible and therefore must part with you charlotte though from no fault of yours you must look on us as your friends and in any difficulty apply to us for as mrs frost says we look on you as a charge from my grandmother  charlotte escaped to hide her tears and when a few minutes after the ormersfield carriage arrived and nurses and babies were packed in and her master walked feebly and languidly down stairs and her mistress turned round to say kindly you will let me know charlotte she just articulated thank you maam i will write  mr frosts words had not been news to charlotte  his affairs had been already pretty well understood and discussed and the hard rude grasping comments of the vulgar cooknay even of the genteel nursehad been so many wounds to the little maiden bred up by jane in the simplicity of feudal reverence and affection for all that bore the name of frost dynevor  her mistress left to the tender mercies of some servant such as these some one who might only care for her own ease and profit and not once think of who and what she had been  the little children knocked about by some careless girl  never never  all the doubts and scruples about putting her own weak head and vain heart in the way of being made faithless to tom revived reinforced by her strong and generous affection  a romantic purpose suddenly occurred to her flushing her cheek and brightening her eye  in that one impulse scrubbing washing dishes short lilac sleeves were either forgotten or acquired a positive glory and while the cook was issuing her invitations for a jollification and gossip at the expense of mr and mrs frost charlotte sat in her attic amid janes verbenas which she had cherished there ever since their expulsion from the kitchen and wrote and cried and left off to read over and feel satisfied at the felicity of her phrases and the sentiment of her project   dear and honoured madampardon the liberty i am taking but i am sure that you and my reverend and redoubted master would not willingly have inflicted so much pain as yesterday on a poor young female which was brought up from an orphan child by my dear late lamented mistress and owes everything to her and would never realize the touching lines of the sublime poet            deserted in his utmost need           by those his former bounty fed  as to higher wages and a situation offering superior advantages such as might prove attractive to other minds it has none to me  my turn is for fidelity in obscurity and dear and honoured lady i am a poor unprotected girl which has read in many volumes of the dangers of going forth into the snares of a wealthy and powerful family and begs you not to deprive her of the shelter of the peaceful roof which has been her haven and has been the seen of the joys and sorrows of her career dear lady pardon the liberty that i have taken but it would brake my heart to leave you and master and the dear children espeshilly in the present winter of adversity which i have hands to help in to the best of my poor abilities  dear and honoured lady i have often been idle but i will be so no more i love the dear little ladies with all my heart and i can cook and act in any capacity and wages is no object i will not take none nor beer neitherand the parlour tealeaves will be sufficient  dear and honoured master and mistress forgive the liberty a poor girl has taken and lend a favourable ear to my request for if you persist in parting with me i know i shall not survive it                        your humble and faithful servant                                    charlotte arnold   isabel received this letter while she was at breakfast with lord ormersfield and louis and it was of course impossible to keep it to herself  talking of no wages said the earl  send her off at once  you will despise me said isabel with tears in her eyes but there is something very touching in it in spite of the affectation i believe she really means it  affectation is only matter of taste said louis  half the simplicity of our day is only fashion and charlottes letter with a few stops and signed chloe would have figured handsomely in mrs radcliffes time  it does not depend on me said isabel james could not bear her going before and i am sure he will not now  i think he ought not said louis  poor girl  i do believe the snares of wealthy families and fidelity in obscurity really mean with her the pomps and vanities versus duty and affection  i am sure i would not drive her back to them said isabel but i am only afraid the work will be too much for her strength  the willing heart goes all the way said louis and maybe it will be more wholesome than london and sitting up  isabel coloured and sighed but added that it would be infinite relief on the childrens account to keep some one so gentlehanded and so entirely to be trusted  jamess decision was immediate  he called the letter a farrago but his laugh was mixed with tears at the faithful affection it displayed it was mere folly he said to think of keeping her without wages but if she would accept such as could be afforded after taking a rough village girl for her food to do the hard work the experiment should be made in the hope that the present straits would only endure for a short time  this little event seemed to have done him much good and put him more at peace with the world  he was grateful for lord ormersfields kindness and forbearance and the enforced rest from work was refreshing him while isabel had never been so cheerful and lively in her life as now when braced manfully for her work full of energy and feeling that she must show herself happy and courageous to support his depressed spirits  she was making a beginningshe was practising herself in her nursery duties and to her surprise finding them quite charming and little kitty so delighted with all she did for her that all the hitherto unsounded depths of the motherly heart were stirred up and she could not think why she had never found out her true happiness  she looked so bright and so beautiful that even lord ormersfield remarked it pitying her for trials which he thought she little realized but louis augured better believing that it was not ignorance but resolution which gave animation and brilliancy to her dark eye and cheerfulness to her smile  fitzjocelyn took her to dynevor terrace in the afternoon to settle the matter with charlotte and on the way he took the opportunity of telling her that he had been reading sir hubert and admired him very much discussing him and adeline with the same vivid interest as her own sisters showed in them as persons not mere personages isabel said they already seemed to her to belong to a world much farther back than the last fortnight  there is some puzzle in the middle said louis  i cant make out the hero whose addresses were so inconvenient to adeline and who ran away from the pirates  he began as a crabbed old troubadour who made bad verses and then he went on as a fantastic young viscount skipping and talking nonsense  oh cried isabel much discomposed  did i leave that piece there i took it to estminster by mistake and they told me of it  i should have taken it out  that would have been a pity said louis for the viscount is a much more living man than the old troubadour  when he had so many plans of poems for the golden violet that he made none at all i was quite taken with him  i began to think i was going to have a lesson  isabel blushed and tried to laugh but it was so unsuccessful that louis exclaimed in high gleethere  i do believe i was the fantastic viscount  oh isabel it was too bad  i can fairly acquit myself of skipping ever since i had the honour of your acquaintance  or of running away from the pirates said isabel  no it was a great deal too bad and very wrong indeed  it was when you did not run away that i was so much ashamed that i thought i had torn out every atom  i never told any onenot even virginia  louis had a very hearty laugh and when isabel gaw him so excessively amused she ventured to laugh too at her ancient prejudice and the strange chance which had made the fantastic viscount sir rolands critic  you must restore him said louis returning to business  that old troubadour is the one inconsistency in the story evidently not fitting into the original plot  i shall be delighted to sit for the portrait  i dont think you could now said isabel  i think the motley must have been in the spectacles with which i looked at you  ah it is a true poem said louis it must have been a great relief to your feelings  shall i give it back to you  oh  i cant touch it now cried isabel  you may give it to me and if ever i have time to think again of it i may touch it up but certainly not now  and when you do pray dont omit the viscount  i cant lose my chance of going down to posterity  he went his way while isabel repaired to the terrace and found charlotte awaiting her answer in much trepidation  the low wages instead of none at all were a great disappointment doing away with all the honour and sentiment and merely degrading her in the eyes of her companions but her attachment conquered this objection and face to face with her mistress the affectation departed and left remaining such honest and sincere faithfulness and affection that isabel felt as if a valuable and noblehearted friend had suddenly been made known to her  it was a silly little fanciful heart but it was sound to the core and when isabel said  there will be very hard work charlotte but we will try to do our best for mr frost and the children and we will help each other charlotte felt as if no task could be too hard if it were to be met with such a look and smile  is it settled asked lord fitzjocelyn as charlotte opened the door for him  oh yes thank you my lord  but charlotte one thing is decided  mrs frost can afford no more eau de cologne  the first hysterics and you go  he passed upstairs and found isabel beginning to dismantle the drawingroomwhich you arranged for us she said  a long deep sigh was the answer and louis mused for some moments ere he saidit is hard work to say goodbye to trifles with which departed happiness seems connected  oh no cried isabel eagerly  with such a home the happiness cannot be departed  no not with such a home said louis with a melancholy smile but i was selfish enough to be thinking who hung that picture  i dont think you were the selfish person said isabel  patience and work said louis rousing himself  some sort of good time must comeand he quickly put his hand to assist in putting the dresden shepherd and shepherdess into retirement observing that they seemed the genii of the place and he set his mind on their restoration  i do not think said isabel as she afterwards narrated this scene to her husband that i ever realized his being so much attached to mary ponsonby i thought it was a convenient suitable thing in which he followed his fathers wishes and i imagined he had quite recovered it  he did not look interesting enough  yes he was slow in knowing his own mind but his heart once given there is no recalling it whatever his father may wish  or my mother said isabel smiling  ah  i have never asked you what your party say of him in the london world  they say he quite provokes them by being such a diligent member and that people debate as to whether he will distinguish himself  some say he does not care enough and others that he has too many crotchets  just so  public men are not made of that soft scrupulous stuff which only hardens and toughens when principle is clear before him well as to society  virginia says he is hardly ever to be had he is either at the house or he has something to do for his father he slips out of parties and they never catch him unless they are in great want of a gentleman to take them somewhere and then no one is so useful mamma has been setting innumerable little traps for him but he marches straight through them all and only a little tone of irony betrays that he sees through them  every one likes him and the only complaint is that he is so seldom to be seen keeping almost entirely to his fathers set always with his father  ay i can bear to watch his submission better than formerly  his attentions are in such perfect good taste that they are quite beautiful and his lordship has quite ceased snubbing and begins to have a glimmering that when louis says something never dreamt of in his philosophy the defect may be in his understanding and not in fitzjocelyns  i could excuse him for not always understanding fitzjocelyn  but there never were two kinder people in the world and i could not have imagined that i should ever like lord ormersfield half so much  he is improved  louiss exclusive devotion has not been lost on him holdsworth has been sitting with me and talking of the great change in the parish  he told me that at his first arrival here seven years ago when he was very young he found himself quite disheartened and disgusted by the respectability of the place  every one was cold distant correct and selfesteeming so perfectly contented with themselves and the routine that he felt all his ardour thrown  away and it seemed to him that he was pastor to a steamenginea mere item in the proprieties of ormersfield  he was almost ready to exchange out of weariness and impatience when fitzjocelyn came home and awoke fresh life and interest by his absurdities his wonderful philanthropies and extraordinary schemes his sympathy and earnestness were the first refreshment and encouragement and holdsworth declares that no one can guess the benefit that he was to him even when he was most ridiculous  since that he says the change has been striking though so gradual louis has all the same freshness and energy but without the fluctuation and impetuosity  and his example of humility and sincerity has worked not only in reclaiming the wild outlying people but even awakening the comfortable dependents from their selfsatisfaction  even frampton is far from the impenetrable person he used to be  and i suppose they have done infinite good to the wild marksedge people  some are better some are worse  i believe that people always are worse when they reject good  i am glad to find too that the improvements answer in a pecuniary point of view  his lordship is amazed at his sons sagacity and they have never been so much at ease in money matters  indeed  well i must own that i have always been struck with the very small scale on which things are done here  just the mere margin of what is required by their station barely an indulgence  i fancy you must look into subscriptions for fitzjocelyns means said james and for the rest they have no heart for new furniture till he marries  well  i wonder if mary is worth so much heart  it might be the best thing for him if she would find some worthy merchant  he is very young still and looks younger  i should like him to begin the world again  ha  isabel you want to cook up a romance of your own for him  james was recovering cheerfulness  he thought he was bracing himself to bear bravely with an unmerited wrong  the injustice of his sentence hid from him the degree of justice and with regard to his own temper he knew better what he restrained than what he expressed and habitually gave himself credit for what he did not say or do there was much that was really good in his present spirit and it was on the way to be better but his was not the character to be materially altered by the first brunt of a sudden shock  it was a step that he had brought himself to forgive the trustees  he did not yet see that he had any need to be forgiven  at the end of three weeks james and isabel returned to their home and to their new way of life and fitzjocelyn had only time to see that they were beginning their struggle with good courage before the meeting of parliament summoned him to london  isabel fully justified miss faithfulls prediction  she was too truly highminded to think any task beneath her and with her heart in not out of her immediate work she could not fail to be a happier woman success gave as much pleasure in a household duty as in an accomplishmentnay far more when it was a victory over herself and an increase to the comfort of her husband  her strength was much tried and the children often fatigued and harassed her but there was unspeakable compensation in their fondness and dependence on her and even in the actual services themselves  the only wonder began to be how she could have ever trusted them in any hands but her own her husbands affection and consideration were sources of joy ever renewed and though natural irritability and pressing anxieties might now and then betray him into a hasty word his penitence so far surpassed the momentary pain it might have cost her that she was obliged to do her utmost to comfort him  she sometimes found herself awkward or ignorant and sometimes flagged from overexertion yet throughout jamess approval and her own sense that she was striving to do her best kept her mind at rest  above all the secret of her happiness was that the shock of adversity had awakened her from her previous deadness and sluggishness of soul and made her alive to a feeling of trust and support a frame of mind ever repenting ever striving onwards  thus she went bravely through the very class of trials that she would once have thought merely lowering inglorious and devoid of poetry  what would have been in itself sordid gained a sweetness from the light of love and duty and never in all her dreamy ease had she been as cheerful and lighthearted as in the midst of hardship and rigid economy  her equable temper and calm composure came to her aid and where a more nervous and excitable woman would have preyed upon herself and sunk under imaginary troubles she was always ready to soothe and sustain the anxious and sensitive nature of her husband after all hers was the lightest share of the trial to her the call was to act and to undergo misfortunes occasioned by no fault of hers to him the call was the one most galling to an active and eager mannamely to endure and worse to see endured the penalty of his own errors  in vain did he seek for employment a curacy without a fair emolument would have been greater poverty than their present condition as long as the house was unlet and though he answered advertisements and made applications the only eligible situations failed and he knew among so many candidates the last to be chosen would be a person of violent temper unable to bear rebuke disappointment came upon disappointment and the literary work with which through louiss exertions he had been supplied was not likely to bring in any speedy return  all that he could do was to take more than his part in domestic trifles such as most men would have scorned and to relieve his wife as far as possible of the children often at the cost of his writing he bore the brunt of many a trial of which she was scarcely awareslights from the harsh vulgar and compassion from the kind vulgar and the proud selfassertion was gone which had hardened him to all such stings  to his lot fell the misery of weighing and balancing what comforts could best be cut off without positive injury to his wife and little ones  to consider whether an empty house should be repaired for a doubtful tenant to make the venture and have it rejected was a severe vexation when the expense trenched on absolute necessaries and hardly less trying was it to be forced to accept the rent of the house beautiful knowing how ill it could be spared and yet that without it he must lapse into the hopeless abyss of debt  moreover there was       the terrible heart thrill      to have no power of giving  to some of the poor who had learnt to look to the terrace in his grandmothers time and meals were curtailed that those in greater need might not be left quite unaided  nor was this the only cause for which james underwent actual stern privation  the reign of bad cookery was over  charlotte if unmethodical was delicately neat and though she kept them waiting for their dinner always served it up with the precision of past prosperity  cheap cookery and cottage economy were the study and the results were pronounced admirable but the master was the dispenser and when a modicum of meat was to make nourishing a mountain of rice or an ocean of broth it would occur to him as he helped isabel that the piece de resistance would hardly hold out for the kitchen devourers  he would take the recipe at its word and dine on the surrounding structure and in spite of the cottage economy he was nearly as hungry after dinner as before it and people began to say that he had never recovered his looks since his illness  these daily petty acts of selfdenial and selfrestraint had begun to tame his spirit and open his eyes in a manner that neither precept nor example had yet effected  charlotte had imbibed to the full the spirit of patient exertion which pervaded the house  mrs martha had told her she was a foolish girl and would be tired of the place in a fortnight but when she did not see her tired she would often rush in after her two mistresses were shut up for the evening scold charlotte for her want of method and finish all that was left undone while charlotte went up to the nursery to release her mistress  as to novels and sentiment they had gone after sir hubert and though charlotte was what martha expressively called fairly run off her feet she had never looked better nor happier  her mistress treated her like a friend she doted on the children and the cook was out of the kitchen delaford was off her mind and neither stairs nor even knifecleaning could hurt her feelings  to be sure her subordinate a raw girl from marksgedge devoured all that was set before her and what was not eatable she broke but as she had been sent from home with no injunctions but to look sharp and get stout so she was only fulfilling her vocation and on some question of beer her mother came and raved at charlotte and would have raved at mrs frost if her dignified presence had not overawed her  so she only took the girl away in offence and charlotte was much happier with an occasional charwoman to share her labours  there was much happiness in no 5 notwithstanding that the spring and summer of 1851 were very hard times and perhaps felt the more because the sunny presence of louis fitzjocelyn did not shine there as usual  he was detained in london all the easter recess by his fathers illness  lord ormersfield was bound hand and foot by a severe attack of rheumatism caught almost immediately after his going to london it seemed to have taken a strong hold of his constitution and lingered on for weeks so that he could barely move from his armchair by the fire and began to give himself up as henceforth to be a crippled old mana view out of which louis and sir miles oakstead tried by turns to laugh him indeed sir miles accused him of wanting to continue his monopoly of his sonand of that doublydevoted attention by which louis enlivened his convalescence  society had very little chance with fitzjocelyn now unless he was fairly hunted out by the earl who was always haunted by ungrounded alarms for his health and spirits and never allowed him to fail in the morning rides which were in fact his great refreshment as much from the quiet and the change of scene as from the mere air and exercise  father said he coming in one day a little after easter you are a very wise man  eh said the earl looking up in wonder and expectation excited by this prelude hoping for the fulfilment of some political prediction  he is a wise man proceeded louis who does not put faith in treasures especially butlers also who does not bring a schoolboy to london with nothing to do  what now said the earl  is young conway in a scrape  i am said fitzjocelyn i have made a discovery and i dont exactly see what to do with it  you see i have been taking the boy out riding with me as the only thing i could well do for him these holidays  you must know he is very good and patronizing i believe he thinks he could put me up to a few things in time  well today as we passed a questionablelooking individual walter bowed as if highly elated by the honour of his acquaintance and explained to me that he was the celebratedi forget who but thats owing to my defective education the fact is that this delaford to whom my aunt implicitly trusts has been introducing this unlucky boy to a practical course of bells lifethings that i went through eton and never even heard of  and he detailed some of them  no more than she might have expected said lord ormersfield  and what is to be done  i should say never interfere between people and their servants still less between them and their sons  you will do no good  i cannot see this go on cried louis  the boy told me all by way of showing me his superiority  i believe he wants to introduce me to some of his distinguished friends  they flatter him and make him a great man and as to any scruples about his mother delaford has disposed of her objections as delicate weaknesses  when i began to look grave the poor boy set it down to my neglected training always spending my holidays in the country and not knowing what fast men are up to  and so he goes to destructionjust the sort of boy that does said the earl with due acquiescence in the course of the world  he need not exclaimed louis  he is a nice boy a very nice boy if only he cared for his mother or knew right from wrong  lord ormersfield smiled at these slight exceptions  he is heartily fond of isabel said louis  if i thought jem could do any good i would send for him but he has made my aunt so much afraid of unworldliness just now that i only wonder she lets miss king stay on  you had better leave it alone said the earl unless you can do anything with the boy  i am glad that i am not his guardian  i wish i was sighed louis  i suppose you will grow older some day said lord ormersfield however i see you will not be contented without going your own way to work  when the earl saw his son the next day louis looked radiant at having taken one step  he had seen his aunt and she had endured the revelation with more equanimity than he could have supposed possible it was a house where they took things easily as he said a house where nothing was more feared than a scene and lady conway had thanked her nephew greatly for his communication promised what he did not ask that he should not be betrayed to walter assured him that the butler should be dismissed without giving any reason before the summer holidays and for the few remaining days before walter returned to eton she thought she might reckon on her dear fitzjocelyn for keeping his eye upon him no doubt all would be right when delaford was once gone  it was the old want of a high standardthe love of ease rather than the love of right  the earl laughed at her shortsighted policy and resented her saddling louis with the care of her son while louis philosophized upon goodnature and its use and abuse  whether mr delaford learnt that sir walter had betrayed him to lord fitzjocelyn or whether he took alarm from the young gentleman being kept under surveillance he scented danger and took the initiative by announcing to my lady that he intended to retire from his situation into private life at the months end  lady conway rejoiced in being spared the fabrication by which she had intended to dismiss her paragon without hurting his feelings thanked fitzjocelyn more than ever and was sure that dear walter would do very well  but no sooner had delaford departed than a series of discoveries began to be made  lady conways bills reached back to dates far beyond those of the cheques which she had put into delafords hands to pay them and a tissue of peculation began to reveal itself so alarming and bewildering to her that she implored her nephew to investigate it for her  louis rather against the will of his father who was jealous of any additional tasks thrown on him entered into the matter with the head of an accountant and the zeal of a pursuer of justice and stirred up a frightful mass of petty and unblushing fraud long practised as a mere matter of course upon the mistress who had set the example of easygoing insincere selfseeking  it involved the whole household so completely that there was no alternative but a clearance of every servant whether innocent or guilty and a fresh beginning  indeed so great had been the debts which had accumulated that there was no doubt that the treacherous butler must have been gambling to a great extent with his mistresss money and the loss was so heavy that lady conway found she should be obliged to retrench just when she should have been so glad to have helped poor dear isabel  she must even give up a season in london but dear virginia was far too good and sensible to repine  lord ormersfield who had become much interested in the investigation and assisted much by his advice wanted her to go to thornton conway and louis urged the step warmly as the best hope for walter  but she could not live there she said without far too heavy an expenditure and she would make visits for the present and find some cheap place abroad where the girls could have masters  and so her establishment was broken up and louis wrote warm congratulations to james that poor little charlotte had not been tempted into the robbers den  isabel could not help reading the whole history to charlotte who turned white at the notion of such wickedness and could hardly utter a word though afterwards as she sat rocking little mercy to sleep she bestowed a great deal of good advice on her never to mind what nobody said to her above all when they talked like a book for there were a great many snakes and vipers in the grass and twas best to know good friends when one had them and coupled with her moralizing there was no small degree of humble thankfulness for the impulse that had directed her away from the evil how could she ever have met tom again if she had shared in the stigma on the dishonest household  simplehearted loyalty had been a guard against more perils than she had even imagined     chapter xvi  the valley of humiliation  this valley is that from whence also the king will give to his their vineyards and they that go through it shall sing as christian did for all he met with apollyonpilgrims progress   the close of the session still found lord ormersfield so stiff bent and suffering that louis with some difficulty persuaded him into trying the experiment of foreign baths and in a few weeks time they were both established at the hotel du grand monarque at aixlachapelle  the removing his son to a dull wateringplace when he had so many avocations at home had been a great vexation to the earl but he was delighted at the versatile spirits which made a holiday and delight of the whole and found an endless fund of interest and occupation even in his attendance on the wearisome routine of healthseeking german books natural history the associations of the place and the everfresh study of the inhabitants and the visitors were food enough for his lively conversation and the earl inspirited by improving health thought he had never enjoyed his son so much  they were already old inhabitants of their hotel when one afternoon they were much amused by finding a consequential courier gesticulating vehemently to the whole establishment on the apartments he was to secure for a superb milord anglais who seemed to require half the hotel  their sittingroom overlooking the court was especially coveted and the landlord even followed them upstairs with many excuses to ask if they could exchange it for another for only two days  lord ormersfields negative had all the exceeding politeness of offended dignity and louis was much amused at the surmises with which he consoled himself that this was nothing but some trumpery speculator most likely a successful quack doctorno one else went about in such a style  in a grave grand way he was not a little curious and took care to place himself where he could command a view of the court while louis making no secret of his own amusement worked up an excitement to entertain his father and stood watching at the window  crack crack there are the postilions whips  now for the grand monarque himselfthundering under the archway  why there are only two of them after alla lady and a little yellow old man  father you are right after allhe is the very pattern of a successful quack how tall the lady is  halloo and he stood transfixed for a moment then sprang to the door replying to his fathers astonished questionclara  clara dynevor  the party were in course of proceeding up the principal staircasethe tall figure of a young lady in mourning moving on with so stately so quiet and almost weary a manner that louis for a moment drew back doubting whether the remarkable height had not deceived him  her head was turned away and she was following the host scarcely exerting herself to gaze round when she came close to the open door where louis moved slightly forwards  there was a little ecstatic shriek and both her hands were clasped in his while her face was glowing with animation and delight  i dont know how to believe it she said can you be here  we are curing my father  had you not heard of his illness  i hear nothing said clara sadly as she held out her hand to lord ormersfield who had also come to meet her and her uncle who followed close behind was full of cordial rejoicings on the encounter  there was jane beckett also whom louis next intercepted on her way to the bedrooms laden with bags and smiling most joyously to see him to be sure my young lord  and your papa here too my lord well wholl be coming abroad next i wonder  i wonder at nothing since i have met you here jane  and i am right glad of it my lord  youll cheer up poor miss clara a bit i hopeforbless me wont those frenchmen never learn to carry that box right side up  and off rushed jane to a neverending war of many tongues in defence of claras finery while louis following into the sittingroom found mr dynevor inviting his father to the private dinner which he had ordered for greater dignity  the proposal was accepted for the sake of spending the evening together but little was thus gained for excepting for that one little scream louis would hardly have felt himself in the company of his giraffe  she had become a very finelooking person not quite handsome but not many degrees from it and set off by profuse hair and every advantage of figure and dress while her manner was selfpossessed and formal indifferent towards ordinary people but warm and coaxing towards her uncle  bluntalmost morose to othershe was fondling and affectionate towards her continually looking at the others as if to claim admiration of her appealing to her every moment and even when talking himself his keen eye still seeming to watch every word or gesture  the talk was all switzerland and italyroutes and pictures mountains and cathedralsall by rote and with no spirit nor heart in the discussionnot a single word coming near home nothing to show that dynevor terrace had any existence  louis bade clara goodnight mortified at the absence of all token of feeling for her brother and more than half repenting his advice to remain with her uncle  how could the warmhearted girl have become this cold haughty being speaking by mechanism  he scarcely felt inclined to see her again but early the next morning as he was at breakfast with his father there was a knock at the door and a voice said may i come in and as louis opened there stood the true clara all blushes and abruptness i beg your pardon if it is wrong she said but i could not help it i must hear of himof james  lord ormersfield welcomed her in an almost fatherly manner and made her sit down telling her that she had come at a good moment since louis had just received a letter but he feared that it was not a very good account of isabel  isabel  is anything the matter  you are behindhand  had you not heard of the arrival of number four  i never hear anything said clara her eyes overflowing  ha not since we last met asked the earl  they wrote once or twice but you know they thought me wrong and it has all died away since i went abroad  the last letter i had was dated in november  you know nothing since that time  no i often thought of writing to miss faithfull but i could not bear to show how it was since they would not answer me  so i made bold to come to you for i cannot ask before my uncle  he is quite passionate at the very name  he is kind to you asked lord ormersfield hastily  most kind except for that the only thing i care about  but you have a letter  oh i am famishing to hear of them  she did not even know of the loss of the school and her distress was extreme as she heard of their straits  it must be killing isabel she said if i could but be at home to work for her  isabel has come out beyond all praise said louis  i am afraid there is much for them to undergo but i do believe they are much happier in the midst of it  everybody must be happy in dynevor terrace said clara  louis shook his head and smiled adding but clara i do believe if it were to come over again jem would hardly act in the same way  do you think he has forgiven me  judge for yourself  her hand trembling she caught at the wellknown handwriting that to her seemed as if it could hardly be the property of any one else and it was well for her that louis had partly prepared her for the tone of depression and the heavy trials it revealed when she had been figuring to herself the writer enjoying all the felicity from which she was banished                         no 5 dynevor terrace sept 14th 1851  dear fitzjocelyni ought to have written yesterday but i took the whole duty at ormersfield on sunday and was too lazy the next day to do more than keep the children out of the way and look after isabel for though i am told not to be uneasy she does not regain strength as she has done before  overexertion or bad nursing one or both tell upon her and i wish we may not have too dear a bargain in the nurse whom she chose for cheapness sake  my lectures were to have paid the expenses but the authors need is not always the first consideration the money will not be forthcoming till christmas and meantime we cannot launch out  however ormersfield partridges are excellent fare for isabel and i could return thanks for the abundant supply that would almost seem disproportionate but you can guess the value as substantial comforts  a box of uneatable grouse from beauchastel carriage twelve shillings was a cruel subject of gratitude but those good people mean more kindly than i deserve and when isabel is well again we shall rub on  this little one promises more resemblance to her than the others  we propose to call her frances after my poor mother and sister  do you remember the thrill of meeting their names in cheveleigh church  that memorial was well done of my uncle  if these children were to be left as we were you would i know be their best friend but i have a certain desire to see your own assurance to that effect  dont fancy this any foreboding but four daughters bind a man to life and i sometimes feel as if i hardly deserved to see good days  if i am spared to bring up these children i hope to make them understand the difference between independence and pride  i have been looking back on my life i have had plenty of time during these months of inaction which i begin to see were fit discipline till holdsworth left his parish under my charge the other day for six weeks i have exercised no office of my ministry as you know that mr purviss tone with me cut me off from anything that could seem like meddling with him  i never felt more grateful to any man than i did when holdsworth made the proposal  it was as if my penance were accepted for the spirit against which you too justly warned me before my ordination  sunday was something between a very sorrowful and a very happy day  i did not see the whole truth at first  i was only aware of my unhappy temper which had provoked the immediate punishment but the effort generally a failure to prevent my irritability from adding to the distresses i had brought on my poor wife opened my eyes to much that i had never understood  yet i had presumed to become an instructori deemed myself irreproachable  i believe the origin of the whole was that i never distinguished a fierce spirit of selfexaltation from my grandmothers noble resolution to be independent  it was a demon which took the semblance of good and left no room for demons of a baser sort  even as a boy at the grammarschool i kept out of evil from the pride of proving myself gentlemanly under any circumstances the motive was not a bit better than that which made me bully you   i can never remember being without an angry and injured feeling that my uncles neglect left my grandmother burdened and obliged me to receive an inferior education and with this a certain hope that he would never put himself in the right nor lay me under obligations  you saw how this motive actuated me when i never discerned it i trust that i was not insincere though presumptuous and selfdeceiving i was to an extent which i can only remember with horror  if it approached to sacrilege may the wilful blindness be forgiven  at least i knew it not and with all my heart i meant to fulfil the vows i had taken on me  thus when my uncle actually returned there was a species of revengeful satisfaction in making my profession interfere with his views when he had made it the only one eligible for me  how ill i behavedhow obstinately i set myself against all mediationhow i wrapped myself in selfapprovalyou know better than i do  my conceit and absurdity and thanklessness have risen up before me and i remember offers that would have involved no sacrifice of my clerical obligationsoffers that i would not even considerclassing them all as mere truckling with my conscience  what did i take for a conscience  ever since things have gone from bad to worse grieving my dear grandmothers last year and estranging me from my poor little sister because she would not follow my dictation  at last my sins brought down the penalty and i would not grieve except for the innocent who suffer with me  perhaps but for them i should never have felt it nor do i feel tempted to murmur for there is a strange peace with us throughout in spite of a sad heart and too many explosions of my miserable temper and the sight of the hardships so bravely met by my dear wife  but for all this i should never have known what she is she whispered to me last evening when she saw me looking tired and depressed that she had no fears for the future for this had been the happiest year of her life  nothing can make her forget to soothe me  i have written a long rigmarole all about myself but an outpouring is sometimes a relief and you have borne with me often enough to do so now  my poor claras pardon and some kind of clerical duty are my chief wishes but my failures in the early part of the year have taught me how unworthy i am to stir a step in soliciting anything of the kind did i tell you how some ten of the boys continue to touch their hats to me and smith the butchers son often comes to borrow a book and consult me on some of the difficulties that his father throws in his way  he is a fine fellow and at least i hope that my two years at the school did him no harm  i was much impressed with the orderliness at ormersfield sundayschool  i wish i could have got half as much religious knowledge into my poor boys  i walked through your turnips in the south field and thought they wanted rain  frampton tells me the inglewood harvest is in very good condition but i will see the bailiff and give you more particulars when i can be better spared from home for a few hours  kittys assistance in writing has discomposed these last few lines                                   yours ever                                       jrfd   clara turned away and groaned aloud several times as she read but all she said as she gave it back to louis was what is to be done you must talk to my uncle  ah clara young gentlemen of the nineteenth century make but a bad hand of the part of benevolent fairy  i dont think my speaking would be of any use said clara  oh if this only would have been a boy  lord ormersfield undertook to sound mr dynevor and found an early opportunity of asking whether he had heard of poor jamess misfortune yes he had known it long ago  no wonder with such a temper  kept it from the child though  would not have her always hankering after them  was he aware of his great distress and difficulties  ha ha thought so  fine lady wife  no end of childrenserved him rightto bring down his pride  lord ormersfield hazarded a hint that james had seen his errors and the school was no longer in the way  no no said oliver  too late now  drink as he has brewed  he should have thought twice before he broke my poor mothers heart with his cantankerous ways  cheveleigh beneath him forsooth  im not going to have it cut up for a lot of trumpery girls  ive settled the property and whatever other pickings there may be upon my little claragrateful and worthy of it  her husband shall take dynevor name and armsunless to be sure he had a title of his own  the girl was much admired at rome last winter had a fair offer or two but not a word will she say to any of them  i cant tell whats in her head not i  and he looked knowingly at lord ormersfield and willingly extended his stay at aixlachapelle letting fitzjocelyn organize expeditions from thence to liege and other places in the neighbourhood  the two cousins were so glad to be together and the earl so much pleased that louis should have anything which gave him so much delight as this meeting with his old playfellow that he did all in his power to facilitate and prolong their intercourse  he often sacrificed himself to olivers prosings on the equatorial navigation that the two young people might be at liberty and he invited clara to their early breakfast and walk before her uncle wanted her in the morning  these were claras times of greatest happiness except that it gave her a new and strange sensation to be talked to by his lordship like a grownupnay a sensible woman  once she said to herself laughing he really treats me almost as if i were poor mary herself  and then came another flash perhaps he would even like me on the same terms and then she laughed again and shook her head  no no my lord your son is much too good for that  uncle oliver would not have looked so benignant at us when we were sitting in the gardens last night if he had known that i was giving louis all my lima letters  i wish they were more worth having  it was very stupid of me not to know mary better so that we write like two old almanacs  however my letter from hence will be worth its journey to peru  claras heart was several degrees lighter both from the pleasure of the meeting and a suggestion of the earls upon which she had at once acted and which seemed even as she laid pen to paper to bring her somewhat nearer to her brother  her letter arrived at no 5 on the next monday morning at breakfasttime  it did not at first attract the attention of james the sunday exertions had again left a mental and physical lassitude showing how much care and privation had told upon his strength and isabels still tardy convalescence weighed him down with anxiety for the future and almost with despair as he thought of the comforts for want of which she suffered though so patiently and silently dispensing with them  to his further vexation he had on the previous saturday seen charlotte receiving at the backdoor an amount of meat beyond her orders and having checked himself because too angry and too much grieved to speak at once had reserved the reproof for the monday when charlotte brought in her book of petty disbursements  failing to detect the obnoxious item he said wheres the account of the meat that came in on saturday  there sir said charlotte indicating the legitimate amount but blushing violently  that was not all he said with a look of stern interrogation  oh if you please sir that was nothing  this will not do charlotte  i can have nothing taken into my house without being paid for  i insist on knowing what you could mean  oh sir tearfully exclaimed the girl it is paid forill show you the account if you willwith my own money  id not have had you hear of it for the world but i could not bear that nurses insinuations about her meat five times adayshe that never nursed nothing like a real lady before  but i meant no harm sir and i hope youll excuse the liberty for i did not mean to take none and im sure im quite contented for my own part nor never meant to complain  i know you did not charlotte  you are only too patient and kind but his voice broke down and he was forced silently to sign to her to leave him  can humiliation go farther he thought  my boasted independence ending in this poor faithful servant being stung by the sneers of this hired woman into eking out her scanty meals with her own insufficient wages  little catharine who had been gazing with dilated black eyes came scrambling on his knee to caress him perceiving that he was grieved  ah  kitty kitty he said it is well that you are too young to feel these troubles  papa letter cried kitty waving the unregarded letter in the triumph of discovery  the reverend james frost  it was the writing formed by his own copies which he could not see without a sharp pang of selfreproach for cruel injustice and unkindness  kitty slid down with the empty envelope to act reading to the twins whom she caught by turns as they crawled away and set up straight before her  her operations and their remonstrances though as loud as they were inarticulate passed utterly unheard and unheeded by their father as he read                            hotel du grand monarque aixlachapelle                                       sept 18th  my dearest jamesas a mere matter of honesty and justice i may venture to write to you  you always accepted from dear grandmamma the income from the money in the stocks  i did not know that half of it has since come to me till lord ormersfield paid me this last years dividend and if you will not have his enclosed cheque for it put it in the fire for i will never have it in any form  it is not my uncles but my own and if you would make me very happy write to me here  you must not suppose that i am trying to buy a letter but i look on this as yours and i thought you had it till lord ormersfield told me about it  we met him and louis quite unexpectedlythe best thing that has happened to me for years though they told me much that grieves me exceedinglybut i cannot write about it till i know that i may  tell me of dear isabel and the babes  my heart yearns after them it would leap up at the sight of a stone from the terrace                               your ever affectionate                                        clara   his first impulse was as though he feared to repent to turn to his desk the tears of feeling still in his eyes and dash off these words  your bounty my dearest sister is scarcely less welcome than the forgiving spirit which prompted it  i will not conceal that i was sorely in need of means to supply isabel with the comforts that she requires  that your affection can survive my treatment last year makes me equally grateful to you and ashamed of what then took place  he scarcely dared to look upon those phrases  great as were his needs and kindly as the proffer was made it was new and painful to him to be under any such obligation and he could hardly bend his spirit to know that never again should he be able to feel that he had never been beholden for money to a living creature  and while he felt it due to his sister to own the full extent of the benefit he weighed his words as he wrote on lest the simplest facts should look like a craving for further assistance  charlotte came up to remove the breakfast and he looked up to give an order for some nourishing dainty for her mistress adding what did that mutton come to  no i am not displeased with you but miss clara has sent me some money  his assurance was needed for charlotte went down thinking she had never seen master look so stern  he had spoken from a sense that the truth was due to the generous girl but each word had been intense pain  he wrote on often interrupted by little riots among the children and finally by a sharp contention the twins having possessed themselves of a paperknife which kitty with precocious notions of discipline considered as forbidden and little mercy was rapped over the fingers in the struggle  the roar brought down interference and kitty fell into disgrace but when after long persuasion she was induced to yield the papercutter kiss and make friends mercy instead of embracing locked her fingers into her dark curls and tugged at them in a way so opposite to her name that all kittys offence was forgotten in her merit for stopping her scream halfway at the sight of her fathers uplifted finger and his whisper of poor mamma  that life of worry and baby squabbles the reflection of his own faults was hard to bear and with a feeling of seeking a refuge when the two little ones had fallen into their noonday sleep and were left with their mother to the care of good miss mercy he set out for some parish work at ormersfield still taking with him little kitty whose quicksilver nature would never relieve her elders by a siesta  he was afraid to speak to isabel until he should have composed himself and harassed and weary in spirits and in frame he walked slowly very sore at the domestic discovery and scarcely feeling the diminution of the immediate pressure in the new sense of degradation he could own that it was merited and was arguing with himself that patience and gratitude were the needful proofs that the evil temper had been expelled  he called back his thankfulness for his wifes safety his childrens health the constancy of his kind friends and the undeserved ardour of his young sisters affection as well as poor little charlottes unselfishness  the hard exasperated feeling that once envenomed every favour and barbed every dart that wounded him was gone he could own the loving kindness bestowed on him both from heaven and by man and began to find peace and repose in culling the low fragrant blossoms which cheered even the valley of humiliation  he turned down the shady lane overhung by the beechtrees of mr calcotts park and as he lifted kitty in his arms to allow her the robinredbreast he did not feel out of tune with the birds sweet autumnal notes nor with the childs merry little voice but each refreshed his worn and contrite spirit  the sound of hoofs approaching made him turn his head and while kitty announced horse and man he recognised mr calcott and felt abashed and willing to find a retreat from the meeting but there was no avoiding it and he expected as usual to be passed with a bow but the squire slackened his pace as he overtook him and called out goodhumouredly ha mr frost good morning once it would have been jem  i always know you by the little lady on your shoulder  i was intending to call on you this afternoon on a little business but if you will step up to the house with me i shall be much obliged  jamess heart beat thick with undefined hope but after all it might be only to witness some paper  after what had occurred and mrs calcott considering herself affronted by isabel bare civility was forgiveness and he walked up the drive with the squire who had dismounted and was inquiring with cordial kindness for mrs frost yet with a little awkwardness as if uncertain on what terms they stood more as if he himself were to blame than the young clergyman  arriving at the house james answered for his little girls absence of shyness and she was turned over to the miss calcotts while the squire conducted him to the study and began with hesitation and something of apologyit had struck himit was not worth muchhe hardly liked to propose it and yet till something better should turn upanything was better than doing nothing  to which poor james heartily agreed  the board of guardians where mr calcott presided were about to elect a chaplain to the union workhouse the salary would be only fifty pounds but if mr frost would be willing to offer himself it would be a great blessing to the inmates and there would be no opposition  mr calcott making the proposal from sincere goodwill but with some dread how the pendragon blood would receive it was absolutely astounded by the effect  fifty pounds additional per annum was a boon only to be appreciated after such a pinching year as the past the gratitude for the old squires kind pardon was so strong and the blessing of readmission to pastoral work touched him so deeply that in his weakened and dejected state he could not restrain his tears nor for some moments utter a word  at last he said oh mr calcott i have not deserved this at your hands  there there said the squire trying to laugh it off though he too became husky say no more about it  it is a poor thing and cant be made better but it will be a real kindness to us to look after the place  let me say thus much said james for i cannot be at peace till i have done soi am aware that i acted unjustifiably in that whole affair both when elected and dismissed  no no dont lets go over that again said mr calcott in dread of a scene  an overardent friend may be a misfortune and you were very young  not that i would have taken your resignation if it had been left to me but the world is grown mighty tender  i dare say you never flogged a boy like what i underwent fifty years ago and was the better for it and he launched into some frightful oldworld stories of the like inflictions hoping to lead away from personalities but james was resolved to say what was on his mind it was not severity he said it was temper  i richly deserved some portion of the rebuke and it would have been well for me if that same temper had allowed me to listen to you sir or to reason  well said mr calcott kindly you think very rightly about the matter and a man of sixandtwenty has time to be wiser as i tell mrs calcott when sydney treats us to some of his theories  and now you have said your say you must let me say mine and that is that there are very few young couplesaye or old oneswho would have had the sense to go on as you are doing fighting it out in your own neighbourhood without nonsense or false shame  i honour you and mrs frost for it both of you  james coloured deeply  he could have found commendation an impertinence but the old squire was a sort of patriarch in the county and appreciation of isabels conduct must give him pleasure he stammered something about her having held up wonderfully and the salary being an immense relief and then took refuge in matteroffact inquiries on his intended functions  this lasted till nearly halfpast one and mr calcott insisted on his staying to luncheon   he found the ladies greatly amused with their little guesta very small but extremely forward and spirited child not at all pretty with her brown skin and womanly eyes but looking most thoroughly a lady even in her little brown holland frock and white sunbonnet her mammas great achievement  neither shy nor sociable she had allowed no one to touch her but had entrenched herself in a corner behind a chair through the back of which she answered all civilities with more selfpossession than distinctness and convulsed the party with laughing when they asked if she could play at bopeep by replying that the children did she sprang from her place of refuge to his knee as soon as he entered and occupied that post all luncheon time comporting herself with great discretion there was something touching in the sight of the tenderness of the young father taking off her bonnet and settling her straggling curls with no unaccustomed hands and mrs calcotts heart was moved as she remarked his worn almost hollow cheeks his eyes still quick but sunk and softened his figure spare and thin and even his dress not without signs of poverty and she began making kind volunteers of calling on mrs frost nor were these received as once they would have been  he is the only young man said mr calcott standing before the fire with his hands behind him as soon as the guest had departed except his cousin at ormersfield whom i ever knew to confess that he had been mistaken  thats the difference between them and the rest not excepting your son sydney mrs calcott  mamma and sisters cried in chorus that sydney had no occasion for such confessions  the squire gave his short dry laugh and repeated that jem frost and young fitzjocelyn differed from other youths not in being right but in being wrong  on which topic mrs calcott enlarged compassionating poor mr frost with a double quantity of pity for his helpless beauty of a fine ladywife charitably owning however that she really seemed improved by her troubles  she should have thought better of her if she had not kept that smart housemaid who looked so much above her station and whom the housekeeper had met running about the lanes in the dark the very night when mr frost was so ill  pshaw my dear said her husband cannot you let people be judges of their own affairs  it was what he had said on the like occasions for the last thirty years but mrs calcott was as wise as ever in other folks matters  the fine ladywife had meanwhile been arranging a little surprise for her husband  she was too composed to harass herself at his not returning at midday she knew him and kitty to be quite capable of taking care of each other and could imagine him detained by parish work and disposing of the little maiden with betty gervas or some other ormersfield friend but she had thought him looking fagged and worried she feared his being as tired as he had been on the sunday and she could not bear that he should drink tea uncomfortably in the study tormented by the children  so she had repaired to the parlour and miss mercy after many remonstrances had settled her there and when the good little lady had gone home to her sisters tea isabel lay on the sofa wrapped in her large soft shawl languidly attempting a little work and feeling the room dreary and herself very weak and forlorn and desponding as she thought of jamess haggard face and the fresh anxieties that would be entailed on him if she should become sickly and ailing  the tear gathered on her eyelash as she said to herself i would not exert myself when i could perhaps now i cannot when i would give worlds to lighten one of his cares  and then she saw one little bit of furniture standing awry in the manner that used so often to worry his fastidious eye and in the spirit of doing anything to please him she moved across the room to rectify it and then sat down in the large easy chair wearied by the slight exertion and becoming even more depressed and hopeless though as she told herself all is sure to be ordered well  the past struggle has been goodthe future will be good if we can but treat it rightly  just as the last gleams were fading on the tops of the ormersfield coppices she heard the halldoor and jamess footstep and it was more than the ordinary music of his coming up the stair there was a spring and life in it that thrilled into her heart and glanced in her eye as she sat up in her chair to welcome him with no forced smile  and as he came in with a pleased exclamation his voice had no longer the thin worn sound as if only resolute resignation prevented peevishness there was a cheerfulness and solidity in the tone as he came fondly to her side regretted having missed her first appearance and feared she had been long alone  oh no but i was afraid you would be so tired  carrying kitty all the way too  but you look so much brighter  i am brighter said james  two things have happened for which i ought to be very thankful  my dear can you bear to be wife to the chaplain of the union at fifty pounds ayear  oh have you something to do cried isabel i am so glad  now we shall be a little more off your mind  and you will do so much good i have heard miss mercy say how much she wished there were some one to put those poor people in the right way  yes i hope that concentrated earnestness of attention may do something to make up for my deficiency in almost every other qualification said james  at least i feel some of the importance of the charge and never was anything more welcome  and how did it happen  people are more forgiving than i could have hoped  mr calcott has offered me this in the kindest way and as if that were not enough see what poor little clara says  poor little clara said isabel reading the letter you dont mean to disappoint her  i should be a brute if i did no i wrote to her this morning to thank her for her pardoning spirit  you should have told me i should like to send her my love  i am glad she has not quite forgotten us though she mistook the way to her own happiness  isabel unless i were to transport you to cheveleigh a year ago nothing would persuade you of my utter wrongheadedness  nor that perhaps said isabel with a calm smile  not my having brought you to be grateful for the union chaplaincy  not if you had brought me to the union literally said isabel smiling  indeed dear james i think we have both been so much the better and happier for this last year that i would not have been without it for any consideration and if any mistakes on your part led to it they were mistakes on the right side  dont shake your head for you know they were what only a good man could have made  that may be all very well for a wife to believe  and the rest of the little dispute was concluded as charlotte came smiling up with the tea     chapter xvii  bide a wee    come unto these yellow sands   and then take hands                      tempest   the ponsonby family were spending the hot season at chorillos the peruvian wateringplace an irregular assembly of canebuilt mudbesmeared ranches close on the shore of the pacific with the mountains seeming to rise immediately in the rear  they had gone for mr ponsonbys health and rositas amusement and in the latter object they had completely succeeded  in her bathingdress full trousers and a beautifullyembroidered blouse belted at the waist a broadbrimmed straw hat and her raven hair braided in two long tresses she wandered on the shore with many another fair limenian or entered the sea under the protection of a brown indian and supported by mates or gourds would float for hours together among her companions splashing about and playing all sorts of frolics like so many mermaids  in the evening she returned to more terrestrial joys and arraying herself in some of her infinite varieties of balldresses with flowers and jewels in her hair a tiny panama hat cocked jauntily on the top of her head and a rich shawl with one end thrown over the shoulder she would step daintily out in her black satin shoes with old xavier in attendance or sometimes with robson as her cavalier to meet her friends on the beach or make a call in the lamplit corridor of some other rancho  there were innumerable balls dances and picnics to the rich and fertile villages and haciendas around and fetes of every description almost every evening visits to the tombs of the old peruvians whose graves were often rudely and lightly searched for the sake of their curious images and golden ornaments  the senora declared it was the most lovely summer she had ever spent and that nothing should induce her to return to lima while her friends remained there  the other object of reinvigorating mr ponsonby had not been attained  he had been ailing for some time past and instead of deriving benefit from the seabreezes only missed the comforts of home  he was so testy and exacting that mary would have seldom liked to leave him to himself even if she had been disposed to lead the life of a fish and she was seldom away from him unless robson came down from lima to transact business with him  mary dreaded these interviews for her father always emerged from them doubly irritable and dispirited and when rosita claimed the senor robson as her knight for her evening promenade and the father and daughter were left alone together he would blame the one lady for going the other for stayingthen draw out his papers again and attempt to go over them with a head already aching and confusedbe angry at marys entreaties that he would lay them aside or allow her to help himand presently be obliged with a sigh to desist and lie back in his chair while she fanned him or cooled his forehead with iced water  yet he was always eager and excited for robson to come and a delay of a day would put his temper in such a state that his wife kept out of his sight leaving mary to soothe him as she might  mary said her father one evening when she was standing at the window of the corridor refreshing her eye with gazing at the glorious sunset in the midst of a pile of crimson and purple clouds reflected in the oceanmary ward is going to mew york next week  so soon said mary  aye and he is coming here tomorrow to see you  mary still looked out with a sort of interest to see a little gold flake change its form as it traversed a grand violet tower  i hope you will make him a more reasonable answer than you did last time said her father it is too bad to keep the poor man dangling on at this rate  and such a man  i am very sorry for it but i cannot help it said mary no one can be kinder or more forbearing than he has been but i wish he would look elsewhere  so you have not got that nonsense out of your head exclaimed mr ponsonby with muttered words that mary would not hear  all my fault for ever sending you among that crew  coming between you and the best match in limathe best fellow in the worldstrict enough to content melicent or your mother either  what have you to say against him mary  i desire to know that  nothing papa said mary except that i wish he could make a better choice  i tell you you and he were made for each other  it is the most provoking thing in the world that you will go on in this obstinate way  i cant even ask the man to do me a kindness with having an eye to these abominable affairs that are all going to the dogs theres old dynevor left his senses behind him when he went off to play the great man in england writing every post for remittances when he knows what an outlay weve been at for machinery and theres the equatorial company cutting its own throat at guayaquil and that young fellow up at the san benito not half to be trustedrobson cant make out his accounts and here am i such a wretch that i can hardly tell what two and two make and heres ward the very fellow to come in and set all straight in the nick of time and i cant ask him so much as to look at a paper for me because im not to lay myself under an obligation  but papa if our affairs are not prosperous it would not be fair to connect mr ward or any one with them  never you trouble yourself about that  youll come in for a pretty fortune of your own whatever happens to that abominable cheat of a company and that might be saved if only i was the man i was or dynevor was here  if ward would give us a loan and turn his mind to it we should be on our legs in an instant  it is touch and go just nowi declare mary he broke out again after an interval i never saw anything so selfish as you are  lingering and pining on about this foolish young man who has never taken any notice of you since you have been out here and whom you hear is in love with another womanmarried to her very likely by this timeor maybe only wishing you were married and out of his way  i do not believe so answered mary stoutly  what you did not see olivers letter from that german place  yes i did said mary but i know his manner to clara  you do  you take things coolly upon my word  no said mary  i know they are like brother and sister and clara could never have written to me as she has done had there been any such notion  but that is not the point papa  what i know is that while my feelings are what they are at present it would not be right of me to accept any one and so i shall tell mr ward if he is still determined to see me  pray forgive me dear papa  i do admire and honour him very much but i cannot do any more and i am sorry i have seemed pining or discontented for i tried not to be so  a grim grunt was all the answer that mr ponsonby vouchsafed  his conscience though not his lips acquitted poor mary of discontent or pining as indeed it was the uniform cheerfulness of her demeanour that had misled him into thinking the unfortunate affair forgotten  he showed no symptoms of speaking again and mary leaning back in her chair had leisure to recover herself after the many severe strokes that had been made at her  there was one which she had rebutted valiantly at the moment but which proved to have been a poisoned dartthat suggestion that it might be selfish in her not to set louis even more free by her own marriage  she revolved the probabilities clara formed guided supported by himself the companion of his earlier youth preferred to all others and by this time no doubt developed into all that was admirable what would be more probable than their mutual love  and when mary went over all the circumstances of her own strange courtship she could not but recur to her mothers original impression that louis had not known what he was doing  those last weeks had made her feel rather than believe otherwise but they were far in the distance now and he had been so young  it was not unlikely that even yet while believing himself faithful to her his heart was in claras keeping and that the news of her marriage would reveal to them both in one rush of happiness that they were destined for each other from the first  mary felt intense pain and yet a strange thrill of joy to think that louis might at last be happy  she drew claras last letter out of her basket and reread it in hopes of some contradiction  claras letters had all hitherto been stiff  she had not been acknowledged to be in the secret of marys engagement while it subsisted and this occasioned a delicacy in writing to her on any subject connected with it and so the mention of the meeting at the grand monarque came in tamely and went off quickly into lord ormersfields rheumatism and charlemagnes tomb but the remarkable thing in the letter was the unusual perfume of happiness that pervaded it the conventional itinerary was abandoned and there was a tendency to droll sayingsnay some shafts from a quiver at which mary could guess  she had set all down as the exhilaration of louiss presence but perhaps that exhilaration was to a degree in which she alone could sympathize  mary was no daydreamer and yet ere rositas satin shoe was on the threshold she had indulged in the melancholy fabric of a castle at ormersfield in which she had no share except the consciousness that it had been her selfsacrifice that had given louis at last the felicity for which he was so well fitted  but at night in her strange little room lying in her hammock and looking up through her one unglazed window high up in the roof to the stars that slowly travelled across the space she came back to a more collected opinion  she had no right to sacrifice mr ward as well as herself  louis could not be more free than she had made him already and it would be doing evil that good might come to accept the addresses of one man while she could not detach her heart from another have i ever really tried yet she thought  perhaps i am punishing him and poor mr ward because as papa says i have languished and have never tried in earnest to wean my thoughts from him  he was the one precious memory besides my dear mother and she never thought it would come to good  he will turn out to have been constant to clara all the time though he did not know it  even if mr ponsonby had been in full health he would have had no inclination to spare mary the conversation with mr ward who took his hot nine miles ride from lima in the early morning before the shadow of the mountains had been drawn up from the arid barren slope leading to chorillos  he came in time for the late breakfast when the table was loaded with various beautiful tropical fruits tempting after his ride and in his state of suspense  he talked of his journey and of his intended absence and his regret in a manner half mechanical half dreamy which made mary quite sorry for him it was melancholy for a man of his age to have fixed so many fond hopes where disappointment was in store for him  she wished to deal as kindly with him as she could and did not shrink away when her father left them muttering something about a letter and rosita went to take her siesta  with anxious diffidence he ventured to ask whether she remembered what had passed between them on the san benito mountain  yes mr ward but i am afraid i do not think differently now in spite of all your kindness  poor mr wards countenance underwent a change as if he had hoped more  your father had given me reason to trust he said that you had recovered your spirits otherwise i should hardly have presumed to intrude on you  and yet before so long an absence you cannot wonder that i longed to hear something decisive  indeed i wished what i said before to be decisive  i am very sorry to give pain to one so much kinder than i deserve and to whom i look up so much but you see mr ward i cannot say what is untrue  miss ponsonby said mr ward i think you may be acting on a most noble but mistaken view  i can well believe that what you have once experienced you can never feel again  that would be more than i should dare to ask  my own feeling for you is such that i believe i should be able to rejoice in hearing of the fulfilment of your happiness in your own way but since there seems no such probability cannot you grant me what you can still give which would be enough to cause me the greatest joy to which i have ever aspired and if my most devoted affection could be any sufficient return you know that it is yours already  the grave earnestness with which he spoke went to marys heart and the tears came into her eyes  she felt it almost wrong to withstand a man of so much weight and worth but she spoke steadilythis is very kindvery kind indeed but i do not feel as if it would be right  will you not let me be the judge of what will satisfy me  you cannot judge of my feelings mr ward  you must believe me that with all my esteem and gratitude i do not yet feel as if i should be acting rightly by you or by any one else under my present sentiments  you do not yet feel  mary felt that the word was a mistake  i do not think i ever shall she added  you will not call it persecution if i answer that perhaps i may make the venture once more he said  i shall live on that word yet while i am at new york  i will tease you no more now but remember that though i am too old to expect to be a young ladys first choice i never saw the woman whom i could love or of whom i could feel so sure that she would bring a blessing with her and i do believe that if you would trust me i could make you happy  there i ask no answer i only shall think of my return next year and not reckon on that  i know you will tell me whatever is true  he pressed her hand and would fain have smiled reassuringly  he took leave much more kindly than mary thought she deserved and did not appear to be in low spirits  she feared that ahe had raised unwarrantable hopes but the truth was that mr ponsonby had privately assured him that though she could not yet believe it poor girl the young man in england would be married before many months were over to old dynevors niece  there would be no more difficulty by the time he came back for she liked him heartily already and was a sensible girl  so mr ward departed and mary was relieved although she missed his honest manly homage and sound wise tone of thought where she had so few to love or lean on  she thought that she ought to try to put herself out of the way of her cousins at home as much as possible and so she did not try to make time to write to clara and time did not come unsought for her fathers health did not improve and when they returned to lima he engrossed her care almost entirely while his young wife continued her gaieties and mary had reason to think the saya y manto disguise was frequently donned but it was so much the custom of ladies of the same degree that mary thought it neither desirable nor likely to be effectual to inform her father and incite him to interfere  she devoted herself to his comfort and endeavoured to think as little as she heard of english cousins  there was not much to hear  after returning home quite well lord ormersfield was laid up again by the first cold winds and another summer of german brunnens was in store for him and louis  lady conway had taken a cottage in the isle of wight where walter having found the christmas holidays very dull and shown that he could get into mischief as well without delaford as with him she sent him off in a sort of honourable captivity to james and isabel expecting that he would find it a great punishment  instead of this the change from luxury to their hard life seemed to him a sort of picnic  he enjoyed the fun of the waiting on themselves had the freedom of ormersfield park for sport and at home his sister whom he had always loved and respected more than any one else  james had time to attend to him and to promote all his better tastes and feelings and above all he lost his heart to his twin nieces  it was exceedingly droll to see the half quarrelsome coquetries between the three and to hear walters grand views for the two little maidens as soon as he should be of age  james and louis agreed that there could not be much harm in him while he could conform so happily to such a way of life  everything is comparative and the small increase to jamess income had been sufficient to relieve him from present pinching and anxiety in the scale of life to which he and isabel had become habituated  his chaplaincy gave full employment for heart and head to a man so energetic and earnest he felt himself useful there and threw himself into it with all his soul and what was more wonderful he had never yet quarrelled with the guardians and the master told mr calcott that he had heard mr frost was a fiery gentleman but he had always seen him particularly gentle especially with the children in school  the old women could never say enough in his praise and doated on the little brown fairy who often accompanied him  there was plenty to be done at homelittle luxury and not much rest but isabels strength and spirits seemed a match for all in her own serene quiet way and the days passed very happily  charlotte had a workhouse girl under her who neither ate nor broke so vehemently as her predecessor  one night when charlotte sat mending and singing in the nursery the girl came plodding up in her heavy shoes saying theres one wanting to see ye below  one  who can it be cried charlotte her heart bounding at the thought of a denouement to her own romance  he looks like a gentleman said the girl and he wanted not to see master but miss arnold most particular  more hopes for charlotte she had nearly made one bound downstairs but waited to lay awful commands on the girl not to leave the children on no account then flew down pausing at the foot of the stairs to draw herself up and remember dignity and maidenliness  alas for her hopes  it was delaford  his whiskers still were sleek and curly he still had a grand air but his boots were less polishedhis hat had lost the glossand he looked somewhat the worse for wear  poor charlotte started back as if she had seen a wild beast in her kitchen  she had heard of his dishonesty and her thoughts flew distractedly to her spoons murder and the children  and here he was advancing gracefully to take her hand  she jumped back and exclaimed faintly mr delaford please go away  i cant think what you come here for  ah i see you have listened to the voice of unkind scandal said mr delaford  i have been unfortunate miss arnoldunfortunate and misunderstoodguilty never  on the brink of quitting for ever an ungrateful country i could not deny myself the last sad satisfaction of visiting the spot where my brightest hours have been passed and he looked so pathetic that charlotte felt her better sense melting and spoke in a hurry  please dont mr delaford ive had enough of all that  please go and take my best wishes as long as you dont come here for i know all about you  but the intruder only put his hand upon his heart and declared that he had been misrepresented and let a cruel world think of him as it might there was one breast in which he could not bear that a false opinion of him should prevail  and therewith he reached a chair and charlotte found herself seated and listening to him neither believing nor wishing to believe him longing that he would take himself away but bewildered by his rhetoric  in the first place he had been hastily judged he had perhaps yielded too much to sir walterbut youth c and when lady conways means were in his hands it had seemed betterhe knew now that it had been a weakness but so he had judged at the timeto supply the young gentlemans little occasions than to make an eclat  moreover if he had not been the most unfortunate wretch in the world a few lucky hits would have enabled him to restore the whole before lord fitzjocelyn hurried on the inquiry but the young gentleman thought he acted for the best and mr delaford magnanimously forgave him  charlotte could not follow through half the labyrinth and sat pinching the corner of her apron with a vague idea that perhaps he was not so bad as was supposed but what would happen if her master should find him there   she never looked up nor made any answer till he began to give her a piteous account of his condition how he did not know where to turn nor what to do and was gradually beginning to sell off his little wardrobe to purchase the necessaries of life  then the contrast began to tell on her soft heart and she looked up with a sound of compassion  in the wreck of his fortunes and hopes he had thought of her he knew she had too generous a spirit to crush a wretch trodden down by adversity who had loved her truly and who had once had some few hopes of requital  those were alas at an end yet still he saw that woman lovely woman in our hours of easeand here he stumbled in his quotation but the fact was that his hopes being blasted in england he had decided on trying his fortune in another hemisphere but unfortunately he had not even sufficient means to pay for a passage of the humblest description and if he could venture to entreat for ain fact a loanit should be most faithfully and gratefully restored the moment the fickle goddess should smile on him  charlotte felt a gleam of joy at the prospect of getting rid of him on any terms  she belonged to a class who seldom find the golden mean in money matters being either exceedingly close and saving or else lavish either on themselves or other people  good old jane had never succeeded in saving all her halfpence went to the beggars and all her silver melted into halfpence or into little presents and on the receipt of her wages she always rushed on to the shop like a child with a new shilling  reading had given charlotte a few theories on the subject but her practice had not gone far  she always meant to put into the savings bank but hiring books and daintiness though not finery in dress had prevented her means from ever amounting to a sum in her opinion worth securing  the spirit of economy in the household had so far infected her that she had in spite of her small wages more in hand than ever before and when she found what mr delaford wanted a strange mixture of feelings actuated her  she pitied the change in his fortunes she could not but be softened by his flattering sayingsshe could not bear that he should not have another chance of retrieving his charactershe knew she had trifled unjustifiably with his feelings if he had anyand she had a sense of being in fault and so the little maiden ran upstairs peeped into her redleather workbox pulled out her beadpurse and extracted therefrom three bright gold sovereigns and ran downstairs again trembling at her own venturesomeness afraid that their voices might be heard  she put the whole before delaford saying  therethat is all that lays in my power  dont mention it pray now please go and a happy journey to you  how she wished his acknowledgments and faithful promises were over he did hint something about refreshment breadandcheese and beer fare which he used to despise as decidedly low but charlotte was obdurate here and at last he took his leave  there stood the poor foolish generous little thing raking out the last embers of the kitchen fire conscious that she had probably done the silliest action of her life very much ashamed and afraid of any one knowing it and yet strangely light of heart as if she had done something to atone for the past permission that she had granted him to play with her vanity  some day she might tell tom all about it and she did not think he would be angry for he knew what it was to have nowhere to go and to want to try for one more chance     chapter xviii  the crash    late and early at employ     still on thy golden stores intent     thy summer in heaping and hoarding is spent   what thy winter will never enjoy                                      southey   stitch stitch said james frost entering the nursery on a fine august evening and finding his wife with the last beams of sunshine glistening on her black braids of hair as she sat singing and working beside the cot where slept all tossed and rosy the yearling child stitch stitch  if i could but do needlework  ah said isabel playfully lifting up a sweeter face than had ever been admired in miss conway if you will make your kittens such little romps what would you have but mending  is it my fault  i am very sorry i entailed such a business on you you were at that frock when i went to evening prayers at the union and it is not mended yet  almost and see what a perfect performance it is all the spots joining as if they had never been rent  i never was so proud of anything as of my mending capabilities  besides i have not been doing it all the time this naughty little fanny was in such a laughing mood that she would neither sleep herself nor let the rest do so and kitty rose up out of her crib and lectured us all  now dont wake themno you must not even kiss the twin cherries for if they have one of papas riots they will hardly sleep all night  then you must take me away it is like going into a flowergarden and being told not to gather  charlotte is almost ready to come to them and in the meantime here is something for you to criticise said she taking from the recess of her matronly workbasket a paper with a pencilled poem on the martyrs of carthage far more terse and expressive than anything she used to write when composition was the object of the day  james read and commented and was disappointed when they broke off short ah there baby woke  some day i shall give you a subject  do you know how sta francesca romana found in letters of gold the verse of the psalm she had been reading and from which she had been five times called away to attend to her household duties  i thought you were never to pity me again  do you call that pitying you  worse said isabel smiling  well then what i came for was to ask if you can put on your bonnet and take a walk in the lanes this lovely evening  a walk was a rare treat to the busy mother and with a look of delight she consented to leave her mending and her children to charlotte  there seldom were two happier beings than that pair as they wandered slowly arminarm in the deep green lanes in the summer twilight talking sometimes of the present sometimes of the future but with the desultory vague speculation of those who feared little because they knew how little there was to fear  it is well they are all girls said james speaking of that constant topic the children  we can manage their education pretty well i flatter myself by the help of poor claras finishing governess as louis used to call you  if the edge of my attainments be not quite rusted off  meantime you teach kitty and i teach nothing  you dont lose your singing  your voice never used to be so sweet  it keeps the children good  but you should have seen kitty chaunting edwin and angelina to the twins this morning and getting up an imitation of crying at turn angelina ever dear because she said charlotte always did  that is worth writing to tell fitzjocelyn  it will be a great disappointment if they have to stay abroad all this winter but he seems to think it the only chance of his father getting thoroughly well so i suppose there is little hope of him  i should like for him to see kitty as she is now she is so excessively droll  yes and it must be a great deprivation to have to leave all his farm to itself just as it is looking so well only he makes himself happy with whatever he is doing  how he would enjoy this evening  i never saw more perfect rest  yesthe sounds of the town come through the air in a hush and the very star seems to twinkle quietly  they stood still without speaking to enjoy that sense of stillness and refreshment looking up through the chestnut boughs that overshadowed the deep dewy lane where there was not air enough even to waft down the detached petals of the wild rose  such moments as these must be meant to help one on said james to hinder daily life from running into drudgery  and it is so delightful to have a holiday given now and then instead of having a life all holiday  ah theres a glowwormlook at the wonder of that green lamp  i must show it to kitty said james taking it up on a cushion of moss  her acquaintance will begin earlier than mine  do you remember showing me my first glowworm at beauchastel  i used to think that the gem of my walks before i knew better  it is a great treat to have poor walter here in the holidays so good and pleasant but i must say one charm is the pleasure of being alone together afterwards  a pleasure it is well you do not get tired of my dear and i am afraid it will soon be over for the present  i do believe that is richardson behind us  an attorney among the glowworms is more than i expected  good evening sir said the attorney coming up with them is mrs frost braving the dew  and then after some moments have you heard from your sister lately mr frost  about three weeks ago  she did not mention then said mr richardson hesitating mr dynevors health  no  have you heard anything  i thought you might wish to be aware of what i learnt from i fear too good authority  it appears that mr dynevor paid only a part of the purchasemoney of the estate giving security for the rest on his property in peru and now owing to the failure of the equatorial steam navigation company mr dynevor is i fear actually insolvent  did you say he was ill  i heard mentioned severe illnessparalytic affection but as you have not heard from miss clara i hope it may be of no importance  after a few more inquiries and additional information being elicited goodnights were exchanged and mr richardson passed on at first neither spoke till isabel said  and clara never wrote  she would identify herself too much with her uncle in his misfortune poor dear child what may she not be undergoing  you will go to her  i must  whether my uncle will forgive me or not to clara i must go shall i write first  oh no it will only make a delay and your uncle might say dont come  right delay would prolong her perplexities  i will go tomorrow and mr holdsworth will see to the workhouse people  his alert air showed how grateful was any excuse that could take him to clara the impulse of brotherly love coming uppermost of all his sensations  then came pity for the poor old man whose cherished design had thus crumbled and the anxious wonder whether he would forgive and deign to accept sympathy from his nephew  my dear said james doubtfully supposing what i hardly dare to imagine that he should consent what should you say to my bringing him here  i believe it would make you happy said isabel  oh yes pray doand then we should have clara  i should rejoice to offer anything like reparation though i do not dare to hope it will be granted and i do not know how to ask you to break up the home comfort we have prized so much  it will be all the better comfort for your mind being fully at ease and i am sure we should deserve none at all if we shut our door against him now that he is in distress  you must bring him poor old man and i will try with all my might to behave well to him  it is a mere chance but i am glad to take your consent with me as to our affording it i suppose he may have at the worst an allowance from the creditors so you will not have to retrench anything  dont talk of that dearest  we never knew how little we could live on till we tried and if no 12 is taken and you are paid for the new edition of the lectures and walters pay besides  and sir hubert added james  of course we shall get on said isabel  i am not in the least afraid that the little girls will suffer if they do live a little harder for the sake of their old uncle  i only wish you had had your new black coat first for i am afraid you wont now  you need not reckon on that  i dont expect that i shall be allowed the comfort of doing anything for him  but see about them i must oh may i not be too late  early the next morning james was on his way travelling through the long bright summer day and when after the close stifling railway carriage full of rough loudvoiced passengers he found himself in the cool of the evening on the bare heath where the slanting sunbeams cast a red light he was reminded by every object that met his eye of the harsh and rebellious sensations that he had allowed to reign over him at his last arrival there which had made him wrangle over the bier of one so loving and beloved and exaggerate the right till it wore the semblance of the wrong  by the time he came to the village the parting light was shining on the lofty church tower rising above the turmoil and whirl of the darkening world below almost as sacred old age had lifted his grandmother into perpetual peace and joy above the fret and vexation of earthly cares and dissensions  the recollection of her confident trust that reconciliation was in store came to cheer him as he crossed the park and the aspect of the house assured him that at least he was not again too late  the servant who answered the bell said that mr dynevor was very ill and miss dynevor could see no one  james sent in his card and stood in an agony of impatience imagining all and more than all he deserved to have taken placehis uncle either dying or else forcibly withholding his sister from him  at last there was a hurried step and the brother and sister were clasping each other in speechless joy  o jem dear jem this is so kind cried clara as with arms round each other they crossed the hall  now i dont care for anything  my uncle  much better said clara he speaks quite well again and his foot is less numb  was it paralysis  yes brought on by trouble and worry of mind  but how did you know jem  richardson told me  oh clara had i offended too deeply for you to summon me  no indeed said clara pressing his arm i knew you would help us as far as you could but to throw ourselves on you would be robbing the children so i wanted to have something fixed before you heard  my poor child what could be fixed  you gave me what is better than house and land said clara  i wrote to miss brigham she will give me employment in the school till i can find a place as daily governess and she is to take lodgings for us  and is this what it has come to my poor clara  oh dont pity me my heart has felt like an indiarubber ball ever since the crash  even poor uncle oliver being so ill could not keep me from feeling as if the burthen were off my back and i were little clara frost again  it seemed to take away the bar between us and so it has  o jem this is happiness  tell me of isabel and the babies  you will come home to them  do you think my uncle would consent  she answered with an embrace a look of rapture and of doubt and then a negative  oh no we cannot be a burthen on you  you have quite enough on your hands  and oh you have grown so spare and thin  i mean to maintain my uncle if and her spirited bearing softened into thoughtfulness as if the little word conveyed that she meant not to be selfconfident  but clara is this actual ruin  i know only what richardson could tell me  i do not fully understand said clara  it had been plain for a long time that something was on uncle olivers mind he was so restless all the winter at paris and at last arranged our coming home very suddenly  i think he was disappointed in london for he went out at once and came back very much discomposed  he even scolded me for not having married and when i tried to coax him out of it he said it was for my good and he wanted to see after his business in peru  i put him in mind how dear granny had begged him to stay at home but he told me i knew nothing about it and that he would have gone long ago if i had not been an obstinate girl and had known how to play my cards  i said something about going home but that made him more furious than ever  but after all it is not fair to tell all about the last few months  dr hastings says his attack had been a long time coming on and he must have been previously harassed  and you had to bear with it all  he was never unkind  oh no but it was sad to see him so miserable and not to know whyand so uncertain too  sometimes he would insist on giving grand parties and yet he was angry with the expense of my poor little ponycarriage  i dont think he always quite knew what he was about and while he hoped to pull through i suppose he was afraid of any one guessing at his embarrassments  on this day fortnight he was reading his letters at breakfasti saw there was something amiss and said something stupid about the hot rolls because he could not bear me to notice  i think that roused him for he got up but he tottered and by the time i came to him he seemed to slip down into my arms quite insensible  the surgeon in the village bled him and he came to himself but could not speak i had almost sent for you then but dr hastings came and thought he would recover and i did not venture  indeed jane forbade me she is a sort of lioness and her whelps  well the next day came mr morrison who is the mr richardson to this concern and byandby he asked to see me  he kept the doctor in the next room  i believe he thought i should faint or make some such performance for he began about his painful duty and frightened me lest my poor uncle should be worse only he was not the right man to tell me  so at last it came out that we were ruined and i was not an heiress at all at all  if it had not been for poor uncle oliver i should have cried hurrah  i did nearly laugh to hear him complimenting my firmness i believe the history is thishearing that this place was for sale brought uncle oliver home before his affairs could well do without him  he paid half the price and promised to pay the rest in three years giving security on the mines and the other property in peru but somehow the remittances have never come properly and he trusted to some great success with the equatorial company to set things straight but it seems that it has totally failed and that was the news that overthrew him  then the creditors who had been put off with hopes all came down on him together and there seems to be nothing to be done but to give up everything to them  poor uncle oliveri sat watching him that evening and thinking how louis would say the sea had swept away his whole sand castle with one wave  does he know it  have any steps been taken  mr morrison showed me what my poor uncle had done  he had really executed a deed giving me the whole estate he would have borne all the disgrace and persecution himselffor you know it would have been a most horrible scrape as he had given them security on property that was not really secure  mr morrison said the deed would hold and that he would bring me counsels opinion if i liked  but oh jem  i was so thankful that my birthday was over and i was my own woman  i made him draw up a paper and i signed it undertaking that they shall have quiet possession provided they will come to an amicable settlement and not torment my uncle  i hope he is a man of sense who will make the best terms  you may see to that now  im sure he is a man of compliments  he tells me grand things about my disinterestedness and the creditors and they have promised to let us stay unmolested as long as i please which will be only till my uncle can move for i must get rid of all these servants and paraphernalia and in the meantime they are concocting the amicable adjustment and mr morrison said he should try to stipulate for a maintenance for my uncle but he was not sure of it without giving up what may yet come from peru  janes annuity is safethat is a comfort  what work i had to make her believe it and now she wants us all to live upon it  that was a rare and beautiful power by which my grandmother infused such faithful love into all her dependants  but now for the person really to be pitied  it was only three days ago that it was safe to speak of it but then he had grown so anxious that the doctors said i must begin  so i begged and prayed him to forgive me and then told what i had done and he was not so very angry  he only called me a silly child and said i did not know what i had done in those few days that i had been left to myself  so i told him dear granny had had it and that was all that signified and that i never had any right here  then said clara tearfully he began to cry like a child and said at least she had died in her own home and he called me henrys child and then jane came and turned me out and wont let me go near him unless i promise to be good and say nothing  but i must soon for however she pats him and says dont master oliver i see his mind runs on nothing else and the doctor says he may soon hear the plans and be moved  can you venture to tell him that i am here  before clara could answer jane opened the doormiss clara your uncle and there she stopped at the unexpected sight of the brother and sister still hand in hand  here jane do you see him cried clara and james came forward with outstretched hand but he was not graciously received  now master james you aint coming here to worrit your poor uncle  no indeed jane  i am come in the hope of being of some use to him  id rather by half it had been lord fitzjocelyn muttered jane he was always quieter  now jane you should not be so cross cried clara when it is your own jemmy come on purpose to help and comfort us all  you are going to tell uncle oliver and make him glad to see him as you know you are  i know said james that last time i was here i behaved ill enough to make you dread my presence jane but i have learnt and suffered a good deal since that time and i wish for nothing so much as for my uncles pardon  mrs beckett would have been more impressed had she ever ceased to think of master jemmy otherwise than as a selfwilled but candid boy and she answered as if he had been throwing himself on her mercy after breaking a window or knocking down lord fitzjocelyn  well sir that is all you can say  im glad you are sorry  ill see if i can mention it to your uncle  off trotted jane while claras indignation and excited spirits relieved themselves by a burst of merry laughter as she hung about her brother and begged to hear of the dear old home  the old servant in her simplicity went straight upstairs and up to her nursling as he had again become  master oliver said she he is come  master jem is come back and twould do your heart good to see how happy the children are togetherjust like you and poor master henry  did she ask him here said mr dynevor uneasily  no sir he came right out of his own head because he thought she would feel lost  oliver vouchsafed no reply and jane pressed no farther  he never alluded to his guest but when clara came into the room his eye dwelt on her countenance of bright content and animation and the smiles that played round her lips as she sat silent  her voice was hushed in the sickroom but he heard it about the house with the blithe lively ring that had been absent from it since he carried her away from northwold and her steps danced upstairs and along the galleries with the light bounding tread unknown to the constrained dignified miss dynevor  ah the notice he took that night was to say petulantly when clara was sitting with him dont stay here you want to be downstairs  oh no dear uncle i am come to stay with you  i dont want in the least to be anywhere but here  he seemed pleased although he growled and next morning jane reported that he had been asking for how long his nephew had come and saying he was glad that miss dynevor had someone to look after hera sufferance beyond expectation  in his helpless state jane had resumed her nursery relations with him and he talked matters over with her so freely that it was well that the two young people were scarcely less her children and had almost an equal share of her affection so that clara felt that matters might be safely trusted in her hands  claras felicity could hardly be described with her fond affections satisfied by her brothers presence and her fears of managing ill removed by reliance on him and many as were the remaining cases and great as was the suspense lest her uncle should still nourish resentment nothing could overcome the sense of restored joy ever bubbling up not even the dread that james might not bear patiently with continued rebuffs  but james was so much more gentle and tolerant than she had ever known him that at first she could not understand missing the retort the satire the censure which had seemed an essential part of her brother  she was always instinctively guarding against what never happened or if some slight demonstration flashed out he caught himself up and asked pardon before she had perceived anything till she began to think marriage had altered him wonderfully and almost to owe isabel a grudge for having cowed his spirit  she could hardly believe that he was waiting so patiently in the guise of a suppliant when she thought him in the right from the first though she could perceive that the task was easier now that the old man was in adversity and she saw that he regarded his exclusion from his uncles room in the light of a just punishment to be endured with humility  james on his side was highly pleased with his sister  having only seen her as the wild untamed giraffe he was by no means prepared for the dignity and decision with which miss dynevor reigned over the establishment  her tall figure and the simple straightforward ease of her movements and manners seemed made to grace those large lofty rooms and as he watched her playing the part of mistress of the house so naturally in the midst of the state the servants the silver covers and the trappings he felt that heiressship became her so well that he could hardly believe that her tenure there was over and unregretted  even isabel could not do it better he said smiling and she made a low curtsey for the compliment and laughed back im glad you have come to see my performance  it has been a very long dull pageant and here comes mr morrison i hope with the last act  morrison was evidently much relieved that miss dynevor should have some relative to advise with since he did not like the responsibility of her renunciation though owning that it was the only thing that could save her uncle from disgraceful ruin and perhaps from prosecution whereas now the gratitude and forbearance of the creditors were secured and he hoped that mr dynevor might be set free from the numerous english involvements without sacrificing his remaining property in peru  the lawyer seemed to have no words to express to james his sense of miss dynevors conduct in the matter her promptitude and good sense having apparently struck him as much as her generosity and there was no getting him to believe as clara wished that the sacrifice was no sacrifice at allnothing as she said but common honesty and a great riddance  he promised to take steps in earnest for the final settlement with the creditors and though still far from the last act clara began to consider of hastening her plans it was exceedingly doubtful whether oliver would hear of living at dynevor terrace and clara could not be separated from him besides which she was resolved that her brother should not be burthened and she would give james no promises conditional or otherwise  mr dynevor had discovered that morrison had been in the house and was obviously restless to know what had taken place  byandby he said to jane with an air of inquiry why does not the young man come near me  mrs beckett was too happy to report the invitation telling master jem at the same time that he was not to rake up nothing gone and past there was quite troubles enough for one while  clara thought the same and besides was secretly sure that if he admitted that he had been wrong in part his uncle would imagine him to mean that he had been wrong in the whole  their instructions and precautions were trying to james whose chaplaincy had given him more experience of the sick and the feeble than they gave him credit for but he was patient enough to amaze clara and pacify jane who ushered him into the sickchamber  there even in his worst days he must have laid aside illfeeling at the aspect of the shrunken broken figure in the pillowed armchair prematurely aged his hair thin and white his face shrivelled his eyelid drooping and mouth contracted  he was still some years under sixty but this was the result of toil and climateof the labour generously designed but how conducted how resulting  he had not learned to put out his left handhe only made a sharp nod as james with tender and humble respect approached feeling that how his grandmother was gone this frail old man his fathers brother was the last who claimed by right his filial love and gratitude  how different from the rancour and animosity with which he had met his former advances  he ventured gently on kindly hopes that his uncle was better and they were not ill taken though not without fretfulness presently oliver said come to look after your sister  thats rightgood girl good girl  that she is exclaimed james heartily  too hasty too great hurry resumed oliver she had better have waited saved the old placenever mind what became of the old man onehalf dead already  she would not have been a clara good for much if she had treated you after that fashion sir said james smiling  he gave his accustomed snort  the mischief a girl let alone can do in three days when once shes of age and one cant stop her  women ought never to come of age aint fit for it undo all the work of my lifetime with a stroke of her pen  for your sake sir  pshaw  pity but shed been safe marriedtied it up well with settlements then out of her power  cant think what that young fitzjocelyn was afterit aint the old affair  ponsonby writes me that things are to be settled as soon as ward comes back  indeed  aye good sort of fellowno harm to have him in our concernsi hope hell look into the accounts and find what robson is at  after all i shall soon be out there myself and make master robson look about him mad to allow myself to staybut ill wait no longer morrison may put the fellows offill give him a hint well save the place after all when i once get out to lima  if only i knew what to do with that girl  james could not look at him without a conviction that he would never recover the use of his hand and foot but this was no time to discourage his spirits and the answer wasmy sisters natural home would be with me  ha the child would like it i suppose  id make a handsome allowance for her  i shall manage that when my affairs are in my own hands but i may as well write to the mountains as to ponsonby  aye aye  clara might go to you  shell have enough any way to be quite worth young fitzjocelyns while you may tell him  that mine in the san benito would retrieve all and ill not forget  pray how many children have you by this time  four little girls sir said james restraining the feeling which was rising in the contact with his uncle revealing that both were still the same men  hm  no time lost however  well we shall see  any way an allowance for claras board wont hurt  whats your notion  jamess notion was profound pity for the poor old man  indeed sir he said clara is sure to be welcome  all we wish is that you would kindly bring her to us at once  perhaps you would find the baths of service we would do our utmost to make you comfortable and we are not inhabiting half the house so that there would be ample space to keep the children from inconveniencing you  clara is set on it ill warrant  clara waits to be guided by your wishes but my wife and i should esteem it as the greatest favour you could do us  ha well see what i can manage  i must see morrisonand he fell into meditation presently breaking from it to say fretfully i say roland would you reach me that tumbler  never had james thought to be grateful for that name  he would gladly have been roland dynevor for the rest of his days if he could have left behind him the transgressions of james frost  but the poor mans shattered thoughts had been too long on the stretch and without further ceremony jane came in and dismissed his nephew  clara hardly trusted her ears when she was told shortly after by her uncle that they were to go to northwold  roland wished it and poor fellow the board and lodging were a great object to him  he seemed to have come to his senses now it was too late and if clara wished it and did not think it dull there she might stay while he himself was gone to lima  a great object the other way clara had nearly cried in her indignation that james could not be supposed disinterested in an invitation to an old man who probably was destitute  brother and uncle appeared to have left her out of the consultation but she was resolved not to let him be a burthen on those who had so little already and she called her old friend jane to take counsel with her whether it would not be doing them an injury to carry him thither at all  so much of janes heart as was not at cheveleigh was at dynevor terrace and her answer was decided  to be sure miss clara nothing couldnt be more natural  nothing indeed but i cant put them to trouble and expense  ill warrant said jane that ill make whatever they have go twice as far as charlotte ever will  why you know i keeps myself and for the rest it will be a mere saving to have me in the kitchen theres no air so good for master oliver  i see you mean to go jane said clara  now i have to look out for myself  bless me miss clara dont you do nothing in a hurry  go home quiet and look about you  jane had begun to call northwold home and in spite of her mournings over the old place clara thought she had never been so happy there as in her present dominion over master oliver and her prospects of her saucepans and verbenas at no 5  poor oliver what a scanty measure of happiness had his lifelong exertions produced  many a human sacrifice has been made to a grim and hollow idol failing his devotees in time of extremity  had it not been thus with oliver dynevors selfdevotion to the honour of his family     chapter xix  farewell to greatness    soon from the halls my fathers reared   their scutcheons must descend                                    scott   mr holdsworth contrived to set james at liberty for a fortnight and he was thus enabled to watch over the negotiation and expedite matters for the removal  the result was that the resignation of the estate furniture and of claras jewels honourably cleared off the debts contracted in poor mr dynevors eagerness to reinstate the family in all its pristine grandeur and left him totally dependent on whatever might be rescued in peru  he believed this to be considerable but the brother and sister founded little hopes on the chance as whatever there might be had been entangled in the equatorial company and nothing could be less comprehensible than mr robsons statements  clara retained her own seventy pounds per annum which thrown into the common stock would james assured her satisfy him in a pecuniary point of view that he was doing no wrong to his children though he added that even if there had been nothing he did not believe they would ever be the worse for what might be spent on their infirm old uncle  notice was sent to isabel to prepare and she made cordial reply that the two rooms on the groundfloor were being made ready for mr dynevor and claras own little room being set in order miss mercy faithfull helping with all her might and little kitty stamping about thinking her services equally effectual  oliver was in haste to leave a place replete with disappointment and failure and was so helpless and dependent as to wish for his nephews assistance on the journey and it was therefore fixed for the end of jamess second week  no one called to take leave except the curate and good mr henderson who showed clara much warm kind feeling and praised her to her brother  she begged james to walk with her for a farewell visit to her grandmothers other old friend  great was her enjoyment of this expedition she said she had not had a walk worth having since she was at aixlachapelle and liberty and companionship compensated for all the heat and dust in the dreary tract full of uncomfortable shabbygenteel abodes and an unpromising population  one cannot regret such a tenantry said clara  poor creatures said james  i wonder into whose hands they will fall  your heart may be free clara you have followed the clear path of duty but it is a painful thought for me that to strive to amend these festering evils caused very likely by my grandfathers speculations might have been my appointed task  i should not have had far to seek for occupation  when i was talking to the curate yesterday my heart smote me to think what i might have done to help him  it would all have been over now  it ought not  nay perhaps my presence might have left my uncle free to attend to his own concerns  i really believe you are going to regret the place  after all clara i was a dynevor before my uncle came home  it might have been my birthright  but as isabel says what we are now is far more likely to be safe for the children  i was bad enough as i was but what should i have been as a pampered heir  let it go  yes let it go said clara it has been little but pain to me  we shall teach my poor uncle that home love is better than old family estates  i almost wish he may recover nothing in peru that he may learn that you receive him for his own sake  that is more than i can wish said james  a hundred or two ayear would come in handily  besides i am afraid that mary ponsonby may be suffering in this crash  she seems to have taken care of herself said clara  she does not write to me and i am almost ready to believe her father at last  i could not have thought it of her  isabel has always said it was the best thing that could happen to louis  isabel never had any notion of louis  i dont mean any offence but if she had known what he was made of she would never have had you  thank you clara  i always thought it an odd predilection but no one can now esteem fitzjocelyn more highly than ahe does  very likely but if she thinks louis can stand marys deserting him  it will be great pain no doubt but once over he will be free  it never will be over  that is youngladyism  i never was a young lady and i know what i mean  mary may not be all he thinks her and she may be dull enough to let her affection wear out but i do not believe he will ever look at any one again as he did after mary on your weddingday  so you forbid him to be ever happy again  not at all only in that one way  there are many others of being happy  that one way meaning marriage  i mean that sort of perfect marriage that according to the saying is made in heaven  whether that could have been with mary i do not know her well enough to guess but i am convinced that he will always have the same kind of memory of her that a man has of a first love or first wife  it may have been a mistake to drive him into the attachment which isabel thinks has been favoured by absence leaving scope for imagination but i cannot give up the hope that his days of happiness are yet to come  nor do i give up mary yet said clara  till she announces her defection i shall not believe it for it would be common honesty to inform poor louis and in that she never was deficient  it is not a plant that seems to thrive on the peruvian soil  no and i am dreadfully afraid for tom madison  there were hints about him in mr ponsonbys letters which make me very anxious and from what my uncle says it seems that there is such an atmosphere of gambling and trickery about his office that he thinks it a matter of course that no one should be really true and honest  that would be a terrible affair indeed  i dont know for which i should be most concerned louis or our poor little charlotte  but after all clara we have known too many falsehoods come across the atlantic to concern ourselves about anything without good reason  so they talked enjoying the leisure the walk gave them for conversation and then paying the painful visit when clara tried in vain to make it understood by the poor old lady that she was going away and that james was her brother  they felt thankful that such decay had been spared their grandmother and clara sighed to think that her uncle might be on the brink of a like loss of faculties and then felt herself more than ever bound to him  on the way home they went together to the church and pondered over the tombs of their ancestryranging from the grim defaced old knight through the polished brass the kneeling courtier and the dishevelled grief embracing an urn down to the mural arch enshrining the dear revered name of catharine daughter of roland and wife of james frost dynevor the last of her line whose bones would rest there  her grave had truly been the sole possession that her sons labours had secured for her that grave was the only spot at cheveleigh that claimed a pang from claras heart  she stood beside it with deep fond clinging love and reverence but with no painful recollections to come between her and that fair bright vision of happy old age  alas for the memories that her brother had sown to spring up round him now  apart from all these vipers of his own creating james after all felt more in the cession of cheveleigh than did his sister  these were days of change and of feudal feeling wearing out but james long as he had pretended to scorn being sentimental about his forefathers was strongly susceptible of such impressions and he was painfully conscious of being disinherited  he might have felt thus without any restoration or loss as the mere effect of visiting his birthright as a stranger but as he received all humbly instead of proudly the feeling did him no harm  it softened him into sympathy with his uncle and tardy appreciation of his singleminded devotion to the estate which he had won not for himself but for others only to see it first ungratefully rejected and then snatched away  then with a thrill of humiliation at his own unworthiness came the earnest prayer that it might yet be vouchsafed to him to tend the exhausted body and train the contracted mind to dwell on that inheritance whence there could be no casting out  poor oliver was fretful and restless insisting on being brought down to his study to watch over the packing of his papers and miserable at being unable to arrange them himself  even the tenderest pity for him could not prevent him from being an exceeding trial and james could hardly yet have endured it but for pleasure and interest in watching his sisters lively goodhumour saucy and determined when the old man was unreasonable and caressing and affectionate when he was violent in his impotence never seeming to hear see or regard anything unkind or unpleasant and absolutely pleased and gratified when her uncle in his petulance sometimes ungraciously rejected her services in favour of those of roland who he took it for granted must as a man have more sense  it would sometimes cross james how would isabel and the children fare with this illhumour but he had much confidence in his wifes sweet calm temper and more in the obvious duty and on the whole he believed it was better not to think about it  the suffering that the surrender cost oliver was only shown in this species of petty fractiousness until the last morning when his nephew was helping him across the hall and clara close at his side he made them stand still beside one of the pillars and groaned as he said here i waited for the carriage last time  here i promised to get it back again  i wish every one kept promises as you did said james looking about for something cheerful to say  i had hope then said oliver and well might he feel the contrast between the youth with such hopes energies and determination mighty within him and the broken and disappointed man  hope yet and better hope james could not help saying  not while theres such a rascal in the office at lima cried oliver testily  oh uncle oliver he did not mean that exclaimed clara  mr dynevor grumbled something about parsons which neither of them chose to hear and clara cut it short by saying after all uncle oliver you have done it all  dear grandmamma came back and was happy here and that was all that signified  you never wanted it for yourself you know and my dear father was not here to have it  and for you what could you have had more than your nephew and niece toto try to be like your children  and hadnt you rather have them without purchase than with  and as she saw him smile in answer to her bright caress she added merrily theres nothing else to pity but the fir trees and gold fish and as they have done very happily before without the pendragon reign i dare any they will again so i cant be very sorry for them  this was claras farewell to her greatness and cheerily she enlivened her uncle all the way to london and tried to solace him after the interviews that he insisted on with various men of business and which did not tend to make him stronger in health or spirits through the next days journey  the engine whistled its arriving shriek at northwold  happy clara what was the summer rain to her  every house every passenger were tokens of home and the damp rainmottled face of the terrace looking like a child that had been crying was more welcome to her longing eyes than ever had been lake or mountain  isabel and little catharine stood on the step but as mr dynevor was lifted out the little girl shrank out of sight with a childish awe of infirmity  the diningroom had been made a very comfortable sittingroom for him and till he was settled there nothing else could be attended to but he was so much fatigued that it was found best to leave him entirely to jane and clara after a few moments followed her brother from the room  as she shut the door she stood for some seconds unobserved and unwilling to interfere with the scene before her  halfway upstairs james had been pulled down to sit on the steps surrounded by his delighted flock  the baby was in his arms flourishing her hands as he danced her kitty from above had clasped tightly round his neck chattering and kissing with breathless velocity one twin in front was drumming on his knee and shrieking in accordance with every shout of the baby and below leaning on the balusters stood their mothers graceful figure looking up at them with a lovely smiling face of perfect gladness  she was the first to perceive clara and with a pretty gesture to be silent she pointed to the stand of the wedgewood jar under which sat the other little maid her two fat arms clasped tight round her papas umbrella and the ivory handle indenting her rosy cheek as she fondled it in silent transport  my little salome whispered isabel squeezing claras hand our quiet one  she could not sleep for expecting papa and now she is in a fit of shy delight she cant shout with the others she can only nurse his umbrella  just then james made a desperate demonstration amid peals of laughter from his daughters  we are stopping the way  get out you unruly monsters  let go kittymercy i shall kick  mamma catch this ball making a feint of tossing the crowing fanny at her  assuredly thought clara pity was wasted there was not one too many and then began the happy exulting introductions and a laugh at little mercy who stood blank and openmouthed gazing up and up her tall aunt as if there were no coming to the top of her  clara sat down on the stairs to bring her face to a level and struck up a friendship with her on the spot while james lilted up his little salome her joy still too deep and reserved for manifestation only without a word she nestled close to him laid her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes as if languid with excess of rapturea pretty contrast to her sisters frantic delight which presently alarmed james lest it should disturb his uncle and he called them upstairs  but clara must first run to the house beautiful and little mercy must needs come to show her the way and trotted up before her consequentially announcing aunt cara  miss faithfull alone was present and without speaking clara dropped on the ground laid her head on her dear old friends lap and little mercy exclaimed in wondering alarm aunt cara naughtyaunt cara crying  my darling said miss faithfull as she kissed claras brow and stroked her long flaxen hair you have gone through a great deal we must try to make you happy in your poor old home  oh no oh no  it is happiness  oh such happiness but i dont know what to do with it and i want granny  she was almost like little salome the flood of bliss in returning home joined with the missing of the one dearest welcome had come on her so suddenly that she was almost stifled till she had been calmed and soothed by the brief interval of quiet with her dear old friend she returned to no 5 there to find that her uncle was going to bed and charlotte pink and beautiful with delight was running about in attendance on jane  she went up straight to her own little room which had been set out exactly as in former times so that she could feel as if she had been not a day absent and she lost not a moment in adding to it all the other little treasures which made it fully like her own she looked out at the ormersfield trees and smiled to think how well louiss advice had turned out and then she sighed in the fear that it might yet be her duty to leave home  if her uncle could live without her she must tear herself away and work for his maintenance  however for the present she might enjoy to the utmost and she proceeded to the little parlour which to her extreme surprise she found only occupied by the four childrenkitty holding the youngest upon her feet till at the new apparition fanny suddenly seated herself for the convenience of staring  are you all alone here exclaimed clara  i am taking care of the little ones replied kitty with dignity  wheres mamma  she is gone down to get tea  papa is gone to the union but we do not mean to wait for him answered the little personage with an air capable the more droll because she was on the smallest scale of much less substance than the round fat twins and indeed chiefly distinguishable from them by her slender neat shape for the faces were at first sight all alike brown smallfeatured with large dark eyes and dark curly hairmercy with the largest and most impetuous eyes and salome with a dreamy look more like her mother  fanny was in a different style and much prettier but her contemplation ended in alarm and inclination to cry whereupon kitty embraced her and consoled her like a most efficient guardian then seeing mercy becoming rather rude in her familiarities with her aunt held up her small forefinger and called out gravely mercy recollect yourself  wonders would never cease  here was isabel coming up with the teatray in her own hands  my dear do you always do that  no only when charlotte is busy and as she picked up the baby now kitty may bring the rest  so in various little journeys the miniature womans curly head arose above the loaf and the butterdish and even the milkjug held without spilling while isabel would have set out the teathings with one hand if clara had not done it for her and the workhouse girl finally appeared with the kettle  was this the same isabel whom clara last remembered with her baby in her lap beautiful and almost as inanimate as a statue  there was scarcely more change from the longfrocked infant to the bustling important sprite than from that fair piece of still life to the active housemother  unruffled grace was innate every movement had a lofty placid deliberation and simplicity that made her like a disguised princess and though her beauty was a little worn what it had lost in youth was far more than compensated by sweetness and animation  the pensive cast remained but the dreaminess had sobered into thought and true hope  her dress was an old handsome silk frayed and worn but so becoming to her that the fading was unnoticed in the delicate neatness of the accompaniments  and the dear old room  it looked like a cheerful habitation but claras almost instant inquiry was for the porcelain arcadians and could not think it quite as tidy and orderly as it used to be in old times when she was the only fairy disorder however ill see to that quoth she to herself  and she gave herself up to the happy teadrinking when james was welcomed by another tumult and was pinned down by kitty and salome on either sidemamma making tea in spite of fanny on her lapmercy adhering to the newcomerthe eager conversationkitty thrusting in her little oar and being hushed by mammathe grand final game at romps ending with isabel carrying off her little victims one by one to bed and james taking the teatray down stairs  clara followed with other parts of the equipage and then both stood together warming themselves and gossiped over the dear old kitchen fire till isabel came down and found them there and then before any of the grand news was discussed all the infant marvels of the last fortnight had to be detailed and the young parents required claras opinion whether they were spoiling kitty  next clara found her way to the cupboard brought the shepherd and shepherdess to light looked them well over and satisfied herself that there was not one scar or wound on eithernay it is not absolutely certain that she did not kiss the damsels delicate pink cheekset them up on the mantelpiece promised to keep them in order and stood gazing at them till james accused her of regarding them as her penates  why jem she said turning on him you are a mere recreant if you can feel it like home without them  i have other porcelain figures to depend on for a home said james  take care james said his wife with the fond sadness of one whose cup overflowed with happiness claras shepherdess may look fragile but she has kept her youth and seen many a generation pass by of such as you depend on  she once was turned out of cheveleigh too and has borne it as easily as clara said james smiling  i suspect her worst danger is from fanny  theres a lady who i warn you can never withstand fanny  isabel took up her own defence and they laughed on  poor uncle oliver could he but have known how little all this had to do with cheveleigh     chapter xx  western tidings    o lady worthy of earths proudest throne   nor less by excellence of nature fit   beside an unambitious hearth to sit   domestic queen where grandeur is unknown   queen and handmaid lowly                              wordsworth   a house in the terrace was let and the rent was welcome and shortly after clara had an affectionate letter from her old schoolenemy miss salter begging her to come as governess to her little brother promising that she should be treated like one of the family and offering a large salary  clara was much afraid that it was her duty to accept the proposal since her uncle seemed very fairly contented and was growing very fond of roland and the payment would be so great an assistance but james and isabel were strongly averse to it and her conscience was satisfied by miss mercy faithfulls discovery of a family at the baths in search of a daily governess  miss frost was not a person to be rejected and in another week she found herself setting out to breakfast with a girl and three boys infusing latin french and geography all the forenoon dining with them sometimes walking with them and then returning to the merry evening of dynevor terrace  mr dynevor endured the step pretty well  she had ascendancy enough over him always to take her own way and he was still buoyed up by the hope of recovering enough to rectify his affairs in peru  he was better though his right side remained paralysed and mr walby saw little chance of restoration  rising late and breakfasting slowly the newspaper and visits from james wiled away the morning  he preferred taking his meals alone and after dinner was wheeled out in a chair on fine days  clara came to him as soon as her days work was over and when he was well enough to bear it the whole party were with him from the childrens bedtime till his own  altogether the invalidlife passed off pretty well  he did not dislike the children and kitty liked anything that needed to be waited on  he took claras services as a right but was a little afraid of mrs dynevor and highly flattered by any attention from her and with james his moods were exceedingly variable and often very trying but in general very well endured  peruvian mails were anticipated in the family with a feeling most akin to dread  the notice of a vessel coming in was the signal for growlings at everything from the postoffice down to his dinner and the arrival of letters made things only worse  as clara said the galleons were taken by the pirates the equatorial company seemed to be doing the work of caleb balderstons thunderstorm and to be bearing the blame of a deficit such as oliver could not charge on it the whole statement was backed by mr ponsonby whose short notes spoke of indisposition making him more indebted than ever to the exertions of robson  this last was gone to guayaquil to attempt to clear up the accounts of the equatorial company leaving the office at lima in the charge of madison and the new clerk ford and mr dynevor was promised something decisive and satisfactory on his return  of mary there was no mention except what might be inferred in a postscriptward is expected in a few weeks  mr dynevor was obliged to resign himself and so exceedingly fractious was he that clara had been feeling quite dispirited when her brother called her to tell her joyously that lord ormersfield and louis were coming home and would call in on their way the next evening  those wretched children must not take her for a walk  nevertheless the wretched children did want to walk and clara could not get home till halfanhour after she knew the train must have come in and she found the visitors in her uncles room  louis came forward to the door to meet her and shook her hand with all his heart saying under his breath  i congratulate you  thank you she said in the same hearty tone  and now look at him look at my father  have not we made a good piece of work of keeping him abroad all the winter  does not he look as well as ever he did in his life  this was rather strong for lord ormersfield was somewhat grey and a little bent but he had resumed all his look of health and vigour and was a great contrast to his younger but far olderlooking cousin  he welcomed clara with his tone of courteous respect and smiled at his sons exultation saying fitzjocelyn deserved all the credit for he himself had never thought to be so patched up again and poor oliver was evidently deriving as much encouragement as if rheumatism had been paralysis  i must look in at the house beautiful said louis presently clara i cant lose your company  wont you come with me  of course she came and she divined why instead of at once entering the next house he took a turn along the terrace and after a pause asked clara when did you last hear from lima  not for a long time  i suppose she is taken up by her fathers illness  he paused collected himself and asked again have you heard nothing from your uncle  yes said clara sadly but louis she added with a lively tone what does not come from herself i would not believe  i do not  thats right dont be vexed when it may be nothing  no if she had found any one more worthy of her she would not hesitate in making me aware of it  i ought to be satisfied if she does what is best for her own happiness  miss ponsonby believes that this is a man of sterling worth probably suiting her better than i might have done  she was a good deal driven on by circumstances before and perhaps it was all a mistake on her side  and he tried to smile  clara exclaimed that mary could not have been all he had believed if  no he said she is all and more than all  i comprehend her better now and could have shown her that i do  she has been the blessing of my life so far and her influence always will be so  i shall always be grateful to her be the rest as it may and i mean to live on hope to the last  now for the good old ladies  really clara the old dynevor terrace atmosphere has come back and there seems to be the same sort of rest and cheering in coming into these old iron gates  after all isabel is growing almost worthy to be called mrs frost  and in this manner he talked on up to the very door of the house beautiful as if to cheat himself out of despondency  that was a very pretty meeting said isabel to her husband when no witness was present but little fanny  what between his lordship and my uncle  you know better  my dear your mother once tried matchmaking for fitzjocelyn  be warned by her example  i am doing no such thing  i am only observing what every one sees  dont be so commonplace  thats all disdainyou must condescend  i have been hearing from mr dynevor of the excellent offers that clara refused  do you think uncle oliver and clara agree as to excellence  still continued isabel considering how uncomfortable she was it does not seem improbable that she would have married unless some attachment had steeled her heart and raised her standard  i know she was unconscious but it was fitzjocelyn who formed her  he has been a better brother to her than i have been but look only at their perfect ease  now it is my belief that they were made for each other and can venture to find it out since she is no longer an heiress and he is free from his peruvian entanglement  fanny do you hear what a scheming mamma you have  i hope she will have used it all upon sir hubert before you come out as the beauty of the terrace  well i mean to sound clara  you had better leave it alone  do you forbid me  why no for i dont think you have the face to say anything that would distress her or disturb the friendship which has been her greatest benefit  thank you  all i intend is that if it should be as i suppose the poor things should not miss coming to an understanding for want  of a christmastree said james laughing  you may have your own way  i have too much confidence in your discretion and in theirs to imagine that you will produce the least effect  isabels imagination was busily at work and she was in haste to make use of her husbands permission but it was so difficult to see clara alone that some days passed before the two sisters were left together in the sittingroom while james was writing a letter for his uncle isabels courage began to waver but she ventured a commencement  mr dynevor entertains me with fine stories of your conquests clara  clara laughed blushed and answered bluntly what a bother it was  you are very hardhearted  you ought to remember the troubles of young ladyhood enough not to wonder  i never let things run to that length but then i had no fortune but seriously clara were all these people objectionable  do you think one could marry any man only because he was not objectionable  there was no harm in one or two but i was not going to have anything to say to them  really clara you make me curious  had you made any resolution  i know only two men whom i could have trusted to fulfil my conditions said clara  conditions  of course that if cheveleigh was to belong to any of us it should be to the rightful heir  my dear noble clara was that what kept you from thinking of marriage  wasnt it a fine thing to have such a test  not that i ever came to trying it  simple no answered my purpose  i met no one who tempted me to make the experiment  two men said isabel if you had said one it would have been marked  jem and louis of course said clara  oh that is as good as saying one  as good as saying none said clara with emphasis  there may be different opinions on that point returned isabel not daring to lift her eyes from her work though longing to study claras face and feeling herself crimsoning  extremely unfounded opinions and rather  rather what  impertinent i was going to say begging your pardon dear isabel  nay i think it is i who should beg yours clara  no no said clara laughing but speaking gravely immediately after lookerson do not always see most of the game  i have always known his mind so well that i could never possibly have fallen into any such nonsense  i respect him far too much  isabel felt as if she must hazard a few words morecan you guess what he will do if mr ponsonbys reports prove true  i do not mean to anticipate misfortunes said clara  isabel could say no more and when clara next spoke it was to ask for another of jamess wristbands to stitch  then isabel ventured to peep at her face and saw it quite calm and not at all rosy if it had been the colour was gone  thus it was and there are happily many such friendships existing as that between louis and clara  many a woman has seen the man whom she might have married and yet has not been made miserable  if there be neither vanity nor weak selfcontemplation on her side nor trifling on his part nor unwise suggestions forced on her by spectators the honest genuine affection need never become passion  if intimacy is sometimes dangerous it is because vanity folly and mistakes are too frequent but in spite of all these where women are truly refined and exalted into companions and friends there has been much more happy frank intercourse and real friendship than either the romantic or the sagacious would readily allow  the spark is never lighted there is no consciousness no repining and all is well  fresh despatches from lima arrived and after a day when oliver had been so busy overlooking the statement from guayaquil that he would not even take his usual airing he received clara with orders to write and secure his passage by the next packet for callao  dear uncle you would never dream of it  you could not bear the journey she cried aghast  it would do me good do not try to cross me clara  no one else can deal with this pack of rascals  your brother has not been bred to it and is a parson besides and theres not a soul that i can trust ill go  what dye think i can live on him and on you when there is a competence of my own out there embezzled among those ragamuffins  i am sure we had much rather  no stuff and nonsense  here is roland with four children alreadyvery likely to have a dozen more  if you and he are fools im not and i wont take the bread out of their mouths  ill leave my will behind bequeathing whatever i may get out of the fire evenly between you two as the only way to content you and if i never turn up again why youre rid of the old man  very well uncle i shall take my own passage at the same time  you dont know what you are talking of  you are a silly child and your brother would be a worse if he let you go  if jem lets you go he will let me  he shall let me  dont you know that you are never to have me off your hands uncle  no no i shall stick to you like a burr  you may go up to the tiptop of chimborazo if you please but youll not shake me off  it was her fixed purpose to accompany him and she was not solicitous to dissuade him from going for she could be avaricious for jamess children and had a decided wish for justice on the guilty party and besides clara had a private vision of her own which made her dance in her little room  mary had written in her fathers steadthere was not a word of mr wardindeed mr ponsonby was evidently so ill that his daughter could think of nothing else  might not clara come in time to clear up any misunderstandingconvince mr ponsonbydescribe louiss singlehearted constancy during all these five years and bring mary home to him in triumph  she could have laughed aloud with delight at the possibility and when the other alternative occurred to her she knit her brows with childish vehemence as she promised miss mary that she would never be her bridesmaid  presently she heard fitzjocelyns voice in the parlour and going down found him in consultation over a letter which charlotte had brought to her master  it was so well written and expressed that louis turned to the signature before he could quite believe that it was from his old pupil  tom wrote to communicate his perplexity at the detection of the frauds practised on his employers  he had lately been employed in the office at lima where much had excited his suspicion and finally from having opened a letter addressed by mistake to the firm but destined for an individual he had discovered that large sums supposed to be required by the works or lost in the equatorial failure had been in fact invested in america in the name of that party  the secret was a grievous burthen  mr ponsonby was far too ill to be informed besides that he should only bring suspicion on himself and miss ponsonby was so much occupied as to be almost equally inaccessible  tom had likewise reason to believe that his own movements were watched and that any attempt to communicate with her or her father would be baffled and above all he could not endure himself to act the spy and informer he only wished that if possible without mentioning names charlotte could give a hint that mr dynevor must not implicitly trust to all he heard  james was inclined to suppress such vague information which he thought would only render his uncle more restless and wretched in his helplessness and was only questioning whether secrecy would not amount to deceit  the obvious thing is for me to go to peru said louis  my uncle and i were intending to go said clara  how many more of you exclaimed james       i would not change my native land       for rich peru and all her gold  chanted little kitty from the corner where she was building houses for the little ones  extremely to the purpose said louis laughing  follow her example clara  make your uncle appoint me his plenipotentiary and i will try what i can to find out what these rogues are about  are you in earnest  never more so in my life  james beckoned him to the window and showed him a sentence where tom said that the best chance for the firm was in miss ponsonbys marriage with mr ward but that engagement was not yet declared on account of her fathers illness  the very reason said louis i cannot go on in this way  i must know the truth  and your father  it would be much better for him that the thing were settled  he will miss me less during the session when he is in london with all his old friends about him  it would not take long going by the isthmus  ill ride back at once and see how he bears the notion say nothing to mr dynevor till you hear from me but i think he will consent  he will not endure that she should be left unprotected her father perhaps dying left to the mercy of these rascals  and forgive me louis if you found her not needing you  if she be happy i should honour the man who made her so  at least i might be of use to you  i should see after poor madison  i have sent him to the buccaneers indeed  goodbye  i cannot rest till i see how my father takes it  it was long since louis had been under an excess of impetuosity but he rode home as fast as he had ridden to northwold to canvass for james and had not long been at ormersfield before his proposition was laid before his father  it was no small thing to ask of the earl necessary as his son had become to him and the project at first appeared to him senseless he thought mary had not shown herself sufficiently sensible of his sons merits to deserve so much trouble and if she were engaged to mr ward fitzjocelyn would find himself in an unpleasant and undignified position  besides there was the ensuing session of parliament  no oliver must send out some trustworthy man of business with full powers  louis only answered that of course it depended entirely on his fathers consent and byandby his submission began to work  lord ormersfield could not refuse him anything and took care on parting for the night to observe that the point was not settled only under consideration  and consideration was more favourable than might have been expected the earl was growing anxious to see his son married and of that there was no hope till his mind should be settled with regard to mary  it would be more for his peace to extinguish the hope if it were never to be fulfilled  moreover the image of mary had awakened the earls own fatherly fondness for her and his desire to rescue her from her wretched home  even mr ponsonby could hardly withstand louis in person he thought and must be touched by so many years of constancy the rest might be only a misunderstanding which would be cleared up by a personal interview  added to this lord ormersfield knew that clara would not let her uncle go alone and did not think it fit to see her go out alone with an infirm paralytic james could not leave his wife or his chaplaincy and the affair was unsuited to his profession a mere accountant would not carry sufficient authority nor gain madisons confidence in fact fitzjocelyn and no other was the trustworthy man of business and so his lordship allowed when louis ventured to recur to the subject the next morning and urge some of his arguments  the bright clearing of louiss face spoke his thanks and he began at once to detail his plans for his fathers comfort lord ormersfield listening as if pleased by his solicitude though caring for little until the light of his eyes should return  the next point is that you should give me a testimonial that i am a trustworthy man of business  i will ride into northwold with you and talk it over with oliver  here lay the knotty point but the last five years had considerably cultivated fitzjocelyns natural aptitude for figures by his attention to statistics his own farmingbooks and the complicated accounts of the ormersfield estateso that both his father and richardson could testify to his being an excellent man of business and his coolness and mildness of temper made him better calculated to deal with a rogue than a more hasty man would have been  they found on arriving that james had been talking to mr walby who pronounced that the expedition to lima would be mere madness for mr dynevor since application to business would assuredly cause another attack and even the calculations of the previous day had made him very unwell and so petulant and snappish that he could be pleased with nothing and treated as mere insult the proposal that he should entrust his affairs to such a lad  even james hesitated to influence him to accept the offer  i scruple he said drawing the earl aside because i thought you had a particular objection to fitzjocelyns being thrown in the way of speculations  i thought you dreaded the fascination  thank you james i once did so said the earl  i used to believe it a family mania i only kept it down in myself by strong resolution in the very sight of the consequences but i can trust fitzjocelyn  he is too indifferent to everything apart from duty to be caught by flattering projects and you may fully confide in his right judgment i believe it is the absence of selfishness or conceit that makes him so clearsighted  what a change what a testimony triumphantly thought james  it might be partial but he was not the man to believe so  that day was one of defeat but on the following a note from james advised fitzjocelyn to come and try his fortune again mr dynevor would give no one any rest till he had seen him  thereupon louis was closeted with the old merchant who watched him keenly and noted every question or remark he made on the accounts then twinkled his eyes with satisfaction as he hit more than one of the very blots over which oliver had already perplexed himself  so clearheaded and accurate did he show himself that he soon perceived that mr dynevor looked at him as a good clerk thrown away and he finally obtained from him full powers to act to bring the villain to condign punishment and even if possible to dispose of his share in the firm  miss ponsonby was much relieved to learn that lord fitzjocelyn was going out though fearing that he might meet with disappointment but at least her brother would be undeceived as to the traitor in whom he was confiding  no letters were to announce louiss intentions lest the enemy should take warning but he carried several with him to be given or not according to the state of affairs and when on his way through london he went to receive miss ponsonbys commissions she gave him a large packet addressed to mary  am i to give her this at all events he asked faltering  it would serve her right  then i should not give it to her  pray write another for she does not deserve to be wounded however she may have decided  i do not know how i shall ever forgive her sighed aunt melicent  people are never so unforgiving as when they have nothing to forgive  ah lord fitzjocelyn that is not your case  this might have been far otherwise had i not misjudged you at first  do not believe so  it would have been hard to think me more foolish than i was  this probation has been the best schooling for me and let it end as it may i shall be thankful for what has been  and in this spirit did he sail and many an anxious thought followed him no heart beating higher than did that of little charlotte who founded a great many hopes on the crisis that his coming would produce seven years was a terrible time to have been engaged and the little workhouse girl thought her getting almost as old as mrs beckett  she wondered whether tom thought so too  she did not want to think about marthas first cousin who was engaged for thirtytwo years to a journeyman tailor and when they married at last they were both so cross that she went out to service again at the end of a month charlotte set up all her caps with toms favourite colour and turned angelina twenty times aday  then came the wellknown peruvian letters and a thin one for charlotte  without recollecting that it must have crossed lord fitzjocelyn on the road she tore it open the instant she had carried in the parlour letters  alas poor charlotte   i write to you for the last time lest you should consider yourself any longer bound by the engagements which must long have been distasteful  when i say that mr ford has for some months been my colleague you will know to what i allude without my expressing any further  i am already embarked for the u s  my enemies have succeeded in destroying my character and blighting my hopes  i am at present a fugitive from the hands of socalled justice but i could have borne all with a cheerful heart if you had not played me false you will never hear more of one who loved you faithfully                                      th madison   poor charlotte  the wound was a great deal too deep for her usual childish tears or even for a single word  she stood still cold and almost unconscious till she heard a step then she put the cruel letter away in her bosom and went about her work as usual  they thought her looking very pale and jane now and then reproached her with eating no more than a sparrow and told her she was getting into a dwining way but she made no answer except that she could do her work  at last one sunday evening when she had been left alone with the children her mistress found her sitting at the foot of her bed among the sleeping little ones weeping bitterly but silently isabels kindness at length opened her heart and she put the letter into her hand  poor little thing it was very meekly borne please dont tell no one maam she said i couldnt hear him blamed  but what does he mean  he must be under some terrible error  who is this ford  it is delaford maam i make no doubt though however he could have got there  and oh dear me if i had only told poor tom the whole that i was a silly girl and liked his flatteries now and then but constant in my heart i always was  isabel could not but suppose that delaford if it were he might have exaggerated poor charlottes little flirtation but there was small comfort here since contradiction was impossible  the u s over which the poor child had puzzled in vain was no field in which to follow him uphe had not even dated his letter and it was a very very faint hope that lord fitzjocelyn might trace him out especially as he had evidently fled in disgrace and poor charlotte sobbed bitterly over his troubles as well as her own  she was better after she had told her mistress though still she shrank from any other sympathy  even janes pity would have been too much for her and her tender nature was afraid of the tongues that would have discussed her grief  perhaps the hightoned nature of isabel was the very best to be brought into contact with the poor girls spirit which was of the same order and many an evening did isabel sit in the twilight beside the childrens beds talking to her or sometimes reading a few lines to show her how others had suffered in the same way  it is my own fault said poor charlotte it all came of my liking to be treated like one above the common and it serves me right yes maam that was a beautiful text you showed me last night i thought of it all day and ill try to believe that good will come out of it  i am sure you are very good to let me love the children  im certain sure miss salome knows that im in trouble for she never fails to run and kiss me the minute she comes in sight and shell sit so quiet in my lap the little dear and look at me as much as to say charlotte i wish i could comfort you  but it was all my own fault maam and i think i could feel as if i was punished right so i knew poor tom was happy  alas thought isabel after hearing charlottes reminiscences how close i have lived to a world of which i was in utter ignorance  how little did we guess that by the careless ease and inattention of our household we were carrying about a firebrand endangering not only poor walter but doing fearful harm wherever we went     chapter xxi  stepping westward     on dariens sands and deadly dew                         rokeby   enterprise and speed both alike directed fitzjocelyns course across the isthmus of panama which in 1853 had newly become practicable for adventurous travellers  a canal conducted him as far as cruces after which he had to push on through wild forest and swamp under the escort of the muleteers who took charge of the various travellers who had arrived by the same packet  it was a very novel and amusing journey even in the very discomforts and the strange characters with whom he was thrown and more discontented travellers used to declare that don luis as he told the muleteers to call him always seemed to have the best success with the surly hotelkeepers though when he resigned his acquisitions to any resolute grumbler it used to be discovered that he had been putting up with the worst share  a place called guallaval seemed to be the most squalid and forlorn of all the stationsoutside an atmosphere of mosquitoes inside an atmosphere of brandy and smoke the master an aguestricken yankee who sat with his bare feet high against the wall and only deigned to jerk with his head to show in what quarter was the drink and food and to guess that strangers must sleep on the ground for firstcomers had all the bedshammocks slung up in a barn or unwholesome cupboards in the wall  at the dirty board sat several of the party first arrived washing down tough stringy beef with brandy  louis was about to take his place near a very blackbearded young man who appeared more civilized than the rest and who surprised him by at once making room for him leaving the table with an air of courtesy and when in his halting spanish he begged his grace not to disturb himself he was answered in the same tongue i have finished  after the meal such as it was he wandered out of the hut to escape the fumes and the company within but he was presently accosted by the same stranger who touching his slouched panama hat made him a speech in spanish too long and fluent for his comprehension at the same time offering him a cigar  he was civilly refusing when to his surprise the man interrupted him in good english  these swamps breed fever to a certainty  a cigar is the only protection and even then there is nothing more dangerous than to be out at sunset  thank you i am much obliged said louis turning towards the hut have you been long out here  the first time on the isthmus but i know these sort of places pray go in my lord  the title and the accent startled louis and he exclaimed you must be from the northwold country  he drew back and said bluntly never mind me only keep out of this pestiferous air  but the abrupt surliness completed the recognition and seizing his hand louis cried tom how are you  you have turned into a thorough spaniard and taken me in entirely  only come in my lord i would never have spoken to you but that i could not see you catching your death  i am coming but whats the matter  why avoid me when you are the very man i most wished to see  im done for said tom  the fellows up there have saddled their rogueries on me and im off to the states  i  what do you say  there i am coming in  be satisfied tom i am come out with a commission from mr dynevor to see what can be arranged  thats right cried tom now poor miss ponsonby will have one friend  your letter to charlotte brought me out began louis but madison broke in with an expression of dismay and selfreproach at seeing him walking somewhat lame  it is only when i am tired and not thinking of it said louis do you know that old ash stick tom my constant friend  see here are the names of all the places i have seen cut out on it  i knew it and you the moment you sat down by the table said tom in a tone of the utmost feeling as louis took his arm  you are not one to forget  and yet you were going to pass me without making yourself known  a disgraced man has no business to be known said tom low and hoarsely  no i wish none of them ever to hear my name again and but for the slip of the tongue that came so naturally you should not but i was drawn to you and could not help it  i am glad i have seen you once more my lord  he would have left him at the entrance but louis held him fast  you are the very man i depend on for unravelling the business  a man cannot be disgraced by any one but himself and that is not the case with you tom  no thank heaven said tom fervently ive kept my honesty if i have lost all the rest  little more was needed to bring madison to a seat on a wooden bench beside fitzjocelyn answering his anxious inquiries  the first tidings were a shockmr ponsonby was dead  he had long been declining and the last thing tom had heard from lima was that he was dead but of the daughter there was no intelligence tom had been too much occupied with his own affairs to know anything of her robson had returned from guayaquil some weeks previously and in the settlement of accounts consequent on mr ponsonbys death tom had demurred giving up all the valuable property at the mines under his charge until he should have direct orders from mr dynevor or miss ponsonby  a hot dispute ensued and robson became aware that tom was informed of his nefarious practices and had threatened him violently but a few hours after he had returned affecting to have learnt from the new clerk ford that madisons peculations required to be winked at with equal forbearance and giving him the alternative of sharing the spoil or of being denounced to the authorities  he took a night to consider and as louis started at hearing of any deliberation he said sadly you would not believe me my lord but i had almost a mind  they would take away my character any way and what advantage was my honesty without that and as to hurting my employers they would only take what i did not and such as that is thought nothing of by very many  id got no faith in man nor woman left and id got nothing but suspicion by my honesty so why should i not give in to the way of the world and try if it would serve me  but then my lord it struck me that if i had nothing else i had still my god left  louis grasped his hand  yes im thankful that miss ponsonby asked me to read to the cornish miners said madison  one gets soon heathenish in a heathenish place and but for that i dont believe i should ever have stood it out  but josephs words how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god kept ringing in my ears like a peal of bells all night and by morning i sent in a note to mr robson to say no to what he proposed  every other principle would have cracked in such a conflict and louis looked up at tom with intense admiration while the young man spoke on not conscious that it had been noble but ashamed of owning himself to have been brought to a pass where mere integrity had been an effort  he had gone back at once to his mines in some hopes that the threats might yet prove nothing but blustering but he had scarcely arrived there when an indian muleteer to whom he had shown some kindness brought him intelligence that la justida was in quest of him but in difficulties how to get up the mountains  the poor indians guided his escape conducting him down wonderful paths only known to themselves hiding him in strange sequestered huts and finally guiding him safely to callao where he had secretly embarked on board an american vessel bound for panama  louis asked why he had fled instead of taking his trial and confuting robson but he smiled and said my lord knew little of foreign justice besides ford was ready to bear any witness that robson might put into his mouthand his face grew dark  who was this ford  he could not tell mr robson had picked him up a few months back when there was a want of a clerk like loved like he supposed but it was no concern of his would it be safe for him to venture back to peru under fitzjocelyns protection and assist him in unmasking the treacherous robson  to this he readily agreed catching at the hope of establishing his innocence but declaring that he should then go at once to the stateswhat not even go home to see charlotte  ive got a letter for you when i can get at it  tom made no answer and fitzjocelyn feared that in spite of all his good qualities his fidelity in love had not equalled his fidelity to his employers  he could not understand his protege during the few days of their journey  he was a great acquisition to his comfort with his knowledge of the language and people and his affectionate deference at home where all were courtly he had been almost rude but here in the land of ill manners his attentions were so assiduous that louis was obliged to beg him to moderate them lest they should both be ridiculous  he had become a finelooking young man with a foreign air and dress agreeing well with his dark complexion and he had acquired much practical ability and information  mountains authority and a good selection of books had been excellent educators he was a very superior and intelligent person and without much polish had laid aside his peasant rusticities and developed some of the best qualities of a gentleman but though open and warmhearted on many points with his early friend there was a gloom and moodiness about him which louis could only explain by thinking that his unmerited disgrace preyed on him more than was quite manly  to this cause likewise louis at first attributed his never choosing to hear a word about charlotte but as the distastenay almost sullenness evoked by any allusion to her became more apparent louis began unwillingly to balance his suspicions between some fresh attachment or unworthy shame at an engagement to a maidservant  the poor little damsels sweet blushing face and shy courtesy and all her long and steady faithfulness made him feel indignant at such a suspicion and he resolved to bring madison to some explanation but he did not find the opportunity till after they had embarked at the beautiful little islet of toboga for callao  on board he had time to find in his portmanteau the letter with which she had entrusted him and seeking madison on deck gave it to him  he held it in his hand without opening it but the sparkle in his dark eye did not betoken the bashfulness of fondness and louis taking a turn along the deck to watch him unperceived saw him raise his hand as if to throw the poor letter overboard at once  a few long steps and louis was beside him exclaiming what now tomis that the way you treat your letters  the little hypocrite  i dont want no more of her false words muttered tom returning in his emotion to his peasants emphatic double negative  hypocrite  do you know how nobly and generously she has been helping mr and mrs frost through their straits how faithfully  i know better said tom hoarsely dont excuse her my lord you know little of what passes in your own kitchens  too true i fear in many cases said louis but i have seen this poor child in circumstances that make me feel sure that she is an admirable creature  what misunderstanding can have arisen  no misunderstanding my lord  i saw as plain as i see you her name and her writing in the book that she gave to fordher copying out of his lovepoems my lord in the blank pagesif i had wanted any proof of what he alleged  and he had nearly thrown the letter into the pacific but louis caught his arm  did you ever read cymbeline tom  yes to be sure i have growled tom in surprise  then remember iachimo and spare that letter  what did he tell you  with some difficulty fitzjocelyn drew from madison that he had for some time been surprised at fords knowledge of northwold and the neighbourhood but had indulged in no suspicions till about the epoch of robsons return from guayaquil  chancing to be waiting in his fellowclerks room he had looked at his books and always attracted by poetry as the rough fellow was had lighted on a crimson wateredsilk volume in the first page of which he had to his horror found the name of charlotte arnold borne aloft by the two doves and in the blank leaves several extremely flowery poems in her own handwriting  with illsuppressed rage he had demanded an explanation and had been met with provokingly indifferent inuendoes  the book was the gift of a young lady with whom ford had the pleasure to be acquainted the little effusions were trifles of his own inscribed by her own fair hands oh yes he knew miss arnold very wellvery pretty very complaisant ah he was afraid there were some broken hearts at home  poor little thing he should never forget how she took leave of him after forcing upon him her little savings  he was sorry for her too but a man cannot have compassion on all the pretty girls he sees  and you could be deceived by such shallow coxcombry as this said louis  i tell you there was the book returned tom  well tom if mr ford prove to be the ford i take him to be ill undertake that you shall see through him and be heartily ashamed of yourself  give me back the letteryou do not deserve to have it  i dont want it said tom moodily she has not been as true to me as ive been to her and if she isnt what i took her for i do not care to hear of her again  i used to look at the mountaintops and think she was as pure as they and that she should have been making herself the talk of a fellow like that and writing so sweet to me all the timeno my lord theres no excusing it and twas her being gone after the rest that made it so bitter hard to me  if she had been true i would have gone through fire and water to be an honest man worthy of her but when i found how she had deceived me it went hard with me to cut myself off from the wild mountain life that id got to love and my poor niggers that will hardly have so kind a master set over them  you have stood the fiery ordeal well said louis and i verily believe that you will soon find that it was only an ordeal  the care of tom was a wholesome distraction to the suspense that became almost agony as louis approached peru and beheld the gigantic summits of the more northern andes which sunset revealed shining out white and fitfully like the pilgrims vision of the celestial city although owing to their extreme distance even on a bright noonday nothing was visible but clear deepblue sky  they seemed to make him realize that the decisive moment was near when he should tread the same soil with mary and yet as he stood silently watching those glorious heights human hopes and cares seemed to shrink into nothing before the eternity and infinite greatness of which the depth and the height spoke  yet he remembereth the hairs of our heads who weigheth the mountains in the balance and counteth the isles as a very little thing  louis took comfort but nerved himself for resignation his prayer was more that he might bear rightly whatever might be in store than that he should succeed  he could hardly have made the latter petition with that submissiveness and reserve befitting all entreaty for blessings of this passing world     chapter xxii  rather sudden    o would you hear of a spanish lady     how she wood an englishman   garments gay as rich as may be     decked with jewels she had on                          old ballad   the white buildings of callao looked out of the palm gardens and with throbbing heart fitzjocelyn was set on shore leaving madison on board until he should hear from him that evening or the next morning  hiring a calesa he drove at once to lima to the house of the late mr ponsonby  the heavy folding gates admitted him to the archway where various negroes were loitering and as he inquired for the ladies one of them raised a curtain and admitted him into the large cool twilight hall so dark that with eyes dazzled by the full glare of day he could hardly discern at the opposite end of the hall where a little more light was admitted from one of the teatina windows two figures seated at a table covered with ledgers and papers  as if dreaming he followed his barefooted guide across the soft india matting and heard his spanish announcement that might it please her grace here was a senor from england  both rose the one a welldressed man the otherit was the wellknown actionmary it was all that he had the power to say he was hardly visible but what tone was ever like that low distinct earnest voice  mary clasped her hands together as if in bewilderment  xavier should noti will speak whispered her companion to her and beginning address yourself to me sir  but mary sprang forward signing him back with her hand  it is my cousin lord fitzjocelyn she said as if breath and effort would serve no more and she laid her hand in that of louis  mr ward said louis barely able to frame the question yet striving for a manner that might leave no thorns behind  no oh no  mr robson  the very sound of the no made his heart bound up again and his hand closed fast on that which lay within it while a bow passed between him and robson  and you are come as if it were too incredible  i told you i should he answered  i will leave you miss ponsonby said robson we will continue our little business when you are less agreeably engaged  he began to gather the papers together an action which suddenly recalled louis to the recollection of toms cautions as to prudence and alertness and he forced himself to a prompt tone of business  i hope to be able to be of use he said turning to mary  mr dynevor has given me a commission to look into his affairs and he put into robsons hands the letter written by james and signed by oliver  thank you lord fitzjocelyn i shall be very happy to give any explanations you may wish said robson measuring with his eye his youthful figure and features and piling up the books  i should prefer having these left with me said louis i have but little time before me and if i could look them over tonight i should be prepared for you tomorrow  allow me  you would find it impossible to understand these entries there is much to be set in order before they would be ready for the honour of your lordships inspection  i particularly wish to have them at once  you give me authority to act for you miss ponsonby he added looking at her as she stood holding by the table as one half awake  oh yes i put the whole into your hands she answered mechanically obeying his eye  allow me my lord said robson as fitzjocelyn laid the firm hand of detention on the heavy ledgers and great leathern pocketbook  yes we had better know exactly what you leave in my charge mr robson said louis beginning to suspect that the clerk fancied that the weight and number of the books and bundles of bills might satisfy his unpractised eye and that the essential was to be found in the pocketbook on which he therefore retained a special hold asking as robson held out his hand for it is this private property  why yes no it is and it is not said robson looking at the lady as though to judge whether she were attending  i only brought it here that miss ponsonby might have before heralways a satisfaction to a lady you know sirthough miss ponsonbys superior talents for business quite enable her to comprehend  but our affairs are not what i could wish  the equatorial bubble was most unfortunate and that unfortunate young man who has absconded after a long course of embezzlement has carried off much valuable property  i was laying the case before miss ponsonby and showing her what amount had been fortunately secured  what is in the pocketbook asked louis of mary and though she was apparently conscious of nothing around her he obtained a direct reply  the vouchers for the shares  in the equatorial  unlucky speculationso much waste paper interrupted robson  your lordship had better let me clear away the trash which will only complicate the matter and distract your understanding  thank you as you say there has been fraud i should be better satisfied to be able to tell mr dynevor that the papers have never been out of my hands  i will call on you early tomorrow  mr robson waited to make many inquiries for mr dynevors health and to offer every attention to lord fitzjocelyn to introduce him to the consul to find apartments for him c but at last he took leave and louis was free to turn to the motionless mary who had done nothing all this time but follow him with her eyes  all his doubts had returned and in the crisis of his fate he stood irresolute daring neither to speak nor ask lest feelings should be betrayed which might poison her happiness  is it you were her first words as though slowly awakening  it is i come to be whatever you will let me be he answered as best he could  oh louis she said this is too much  and she hid her face in her hands  tell meone word mary and i shall know what to do and will not harass nor grieve you  grieve me  you exclaimed mary in an inexpressibly incredulous tone  enough  it is as it was before and he drew her into his arms as unresistingly as five years ago and his voice sank with intense thankfulness as he said my marymy mary has he not brought it to pass  the tears came dropping from her eyes and then she could speak  louis my dear father withdrew his anger  he gave full consent and blessing if you still  then nothing is wantingall is peace said louis  you know how you are longed for at home  that you should have comecome all this way  that lord ormersfield should have spared you exclaimed mary breaking out into happy little sentences as her tears relieved her  oh how far off all my distress and perplexity seem now  how foolish to have been so unhappy when there you were close by  but you must see dona rosita cried she recollecting herself after an interval i must tell her  mary hurried into another room by a glass door and louis heard her speaking spanish and a languid reply then returning she beckoned to him to advance whispering dont be surprised these are the usual habits  we can talk before her she never follows english  he could at first see no one but presently was aware of a grass hammock swung from the richlycarved beams and in it something white then of a large pair of black eyes gazing full at him with a liquid soft stare  he made his bow and summoned his best spanish and she made an answer which he understood by the help of mary to be a welcome then she smiled and signed with her head towards him and mary and said what mary only interpreted by colouring as did louis for such looks and smiles were of all languages  then it was explained that only as a relation did she admit his excellency el visconde before her evening toilette in her duelos was mademary would take care of him  and dismissing them with a graceful bend of her head she returned to her doze and her cigarito  mary conducted louis to the cool shaded arched doorway opening under the rich marble cloister of the courtyard where a fountain made a delicious bubbling in the centre  she clapped her handsa little negro girl appeared to whom she gave an order and presently two more negroes came in bringing magnificent oranges and pomegranates and iced wine and water on a silver tray covered with a richlyembroidered napkin  he would have felt himself in the alhambra if he could have felt anything but that he was beside mary  sit down sit down you have proved yourself mary enough already by waiting on me  i want to look at you and to hear you  you are not altered he cried joyfully as he drew her into the full light you have your own eyes and thats your very smile only grown handsomer thats all  she really was  she was a woman to be handsomer at twentyseven than at twentyone and with the glow of unexpected bliss over her fine countenance it did not need a lovers eye to behold her as something better than beautiful  and for her who shall tell the marvel of scarcelycredited joy every time she heard the music of his softlydropped distinct words and looked up at the beloved face perhaps a little less fair with rather less of the boyish delicacy of feature but more noble more definedas soft and sweet as ever but with all the indecision gone all that expression that had at times seemed like weakness  he was not the mere lad she had loved with a guiding motherly love but a man to respect and rely onready collected dealing with easy coolness with the person who had domineered over that house for years  he was all and more than all her fondest fancy had framed and coming to her aid at the moment of her utmost difficulty brought to her by the love which she had not dared to confide in nor encourage  no wonder that she feared to move lest she should find herself awakened from a dream too happy to last  but oh louis said she as if it were almost a pledge of reality to recollect a vexation i must tell you first for it will grieve you and we did not take pains enough to keep him out of temptation that unhappy runaway clerk  is safe at callao said louis and is to help me to release you from the meshes they have woven round you  save for the warning he sent home i could never have shown cause for coming to you mary while you would not summon me  that was too bad you know since you had the consent  that was only just at last faltered mary  it was so kind of him for i had disappointed him so much  what  i know mary his letters kept me in a perpetual fright for the last year and not one did you write to poor little clara to comfort us  it was not right in me said mary but i thought it might be so much better for you if you were never put in mind of me  i beg your pardon louis  we should have trusted each other better if people would have let us alone said louis  in fact it was trust after all  it always came back again if it were scared away for a moment  till i began to doubt if i were doing what was kind by you said mary  oh that was the most distressing time of all i thought if i were out of the way you might begin to be happy and i tried to leave off thinking about you  am i to thank you  i could notthat is the truth of it said mary  i was able to keep you out of my mind enough i hope for it not to be wrong but as to putting any one else therei was forced at last to tell poor papa so when he wanted to send for mr ward and thenhe said that if you had been as constant he supposed it must be and he hoped we should be happy and he said you had been a pet of my mother and that lord ormersfield had been a real friend to her  it was so kind of him for i know it would have been the greatest relief to his mind to leave things in mr wards charge  mary had been so much obliged to be continually mentioning her father that though the loss was still very recent she was habituated to speak of him with firmness and it was an extreme satisfaction to tell all her sorrows and all the little softening incidents to louis  mr ponsonby had shown much affection and gratitude to her during the few closing days of his illness and had manifested some tokens of repentance for his past life but there had been so much pain and torpor that there had been little space for reflection and the long previous decline had not been accepted as a warning  perhaps the intensity of marys prayers had been returned into her bosom in the strong blindness of filial love for as she dwelt fondly on the few signs of better things the narration fell mournfully on louiss ears as that of an unhopeful deathbed  an exceeding unwillingness to contemplate death had prevented mr ponsonby from making a new will  by one made many years back he had left the whole of his property without exception to his daughter his first wife having been provided for by her marriage settlements and now with characteristic indolence and selfishness he had deferred till too late the securing any provision for his limenian wife and only when he found himself dying had he said to mary you will take care to provide for poor rosita  so mary had found herself heiress to a share in the miserablyinvolved affairs of dynevor and ponsonby and as soon as she could think of the future at all had formed the design of settling rosita in a convent with a pension and going herself to england  but rosita was not easily to be induced to give up her gaieties for a convent life and moreover there was absolutely such a want of ready money that mary did not see how to get home though robson assured her there was quite enough to live upon as they were at present  nor was it possible to dispose of the mines and other property without mr dynevors consent and he might not be in a state to give it  the next stroke was young madisons sudden disappearance and the declaration by robson that he had carried off a great deal of propertya disappointment to her even greater than the loss  robson was profuse in compliments and attentions but continually deferred the statement of affairs that he had promised and mary could not bear to accept the help of mr ward the only person at hand able and willing to assist her  she had at last grown desperate and resolved to have something positive to write to mr dynevor as well as not to go on living without knowing her means she had insisted on robson bringing his accounts  she knew just enough to be dissatisfied with his vague statements and the more he praised her sagacity the more she saw that he was taking advantage of her ignorance which he presumed to be far greater than it really was at the very moment when she was most persuaded of his treachery and felt the most lonely and desolatewhen he was talking fluently and she was seeking to rally her spirits and discover the path of right judgment where the welfare of so many was concernedit was then that fitzjocelyns voice was in her ear  she had scarcely explained to louis why his coming was if possible doubly and trebly welcome when the negro admitted another guest whom rosita received much as she had done his predecessor only with less curiosity  mary rose blushing deeply and crossing the room held out her hand and said simply but with something of apology mr ward this is lord fitzjocelyn  mr ward raised his eyes to her face for one moment  i understand he said in a low not quite steady voice  it is well  will you present me he added as though collecting himself like a brave man after a blow  here is my kindest friend she said as she conducted him to louis and they shook hands in the very manner she wished to see learning mutual esteem from her tone and each others aspect  i am sorry to have intruded said mr ward  i came in the hope that you might find some means of making me of use to you and perhaps i may yet be of some assistance to lord fitzjocelyn  he enforced the proposal with so much cordiality and showed so plainly that it would be his chief pleasure and consolation to do anything for miss ponsonby that they did not scruple to take him into their counsels and mary looked on with exulting wonder at the ability and readiness displayed by louis in the discussion of business details even with a man whose profession they were  in remote space almost beyond memory save to enhance the present joy of full reliance was the old uncomfortable sense of his leaning too much upon her  to have him acting and thinking for her and with one touch carrying off her whole burthen of care was comfort and gladness beyond what she had even devised in imagination  the only drawback besides compassion for mr ward was the shock of hearing of the extent of the treachery of robson in whom her father had trusted so implicitly and to whom he had shown so much favour  they agreed that they would go to the consul and concert measures mary only begging that robson might not be hardly dealt with and they went away leaving her to her overwhelming happiness which began to become incredible as soon as louis was out of sight  byandby he came back to the evening meal when rosita appeared with her uncovered hair in two long unadorned tresses plaited and hanging down on each shoulder and arrayed in black robes which by their weight and coarseness recalled eastern fashions of mourning which spain derived from the moors  she attempted a little spanish talk with el visconde much to his inconvenience though he was too joyous not to be doubly goodnatured especially as he pitied her and regarded her as a very perplexing charge newly laid on him  he had time to tell mary that he was to sleep at the consuls whence he had sent a note and a messenger to fetch tom madison since it appeared that the prosecution the rumour of which had frightened the poor fellow away had not been actually set on foot before he decamped and even if it had been there were many under worse imputations at large in the peruvian republic  fitzjocelyn had appointed that robson should call on him early in the morning and if he failed to detect him intended to confront him with madison before the consul when there could be little doubt that his guilt would be brought home to him  he found that the consul and mr ward had both conceived a bad opinion of robson and had wondered at the amount of confidence reposed in him whereas madison had been remarked as a young man of more than average intelligence and steadiness entirely free from that vice of gambling which was the bane of all classes in spanish south america  mary sighed as she heard louis speak so innocently of all classesit was too true as he would find to his cost when he came to look into their affairs and learn what rosita had squandered  next he asked about the other clerk ford of whom mary knew very little except that she had heard robson mention to her father when preparing to set out for guayaquil that in the consequent press of business he had engaged a new assistant who had come from rio as servant to a traveller  she had sometimes heard robson speak in praise of his acquisition and exalt him above madison and once or twice she had seen him and fancied him like some one whom she had known somewhere but she had for many months seldom left her fathers room and knew little of what passed beyond it  louis took his leave early as he had to examine his prize the pocketbook and make up his case before confronting robson and he told mary that he should refrain from seeing her on the morrow until the tug of war should be over  mr ward promises to come to help me he added  really mary i never saw a more generous or considerate person  i am constantly on the point of begging his pardon  i must thank him some way or other said mary his forbearance has been beautiful  i only wish he would have believed me for i always told him the plain truth  it would have spared him something but nobody would trust my account of you  the morning came and with it madison but patient as fitzjocelyn usually was he was extremely annoyed at finding his precious time wasted by robsons delay in keeping his appointment  after allowing for differing clocks for tropical habits and every other imaginable excuse for unpunctuality he decided that there must have been some mistake and set off to call at the countinghouse  a black porter opened the door and he stepped forward into the inner room where leaning lazily back before a desk smoking a cigar over his newspaper arrayed in a loose white jacket with open throat and slippered feet reposed a gentleman much transformed from the spruce butler but not difficult of recognition  he started to his feet with equal alacrity and consternation and bowed not committing himself until he should see whether he were actually known to his lordship fitzjocelyn was in too great haste to pause on this matter and quickly acknowledging the salutation as if that of a stranger demanded where mr robson was  in genuine surprise and alarm ford exclaimed that he had not seen him he thought he was gone to meet his lordship at the consular residence no could he be at his own house  it was close by and the question was asked but the senor robson had gone out in the very early morning ford looked paler and paler and while louis said he would go and inquire for him at miss ponsonbys offered to go down to the consuls to see if he had arrived there in the meantime  mary came to meet louis in the sala saying that she was afraid that they had not shown sufficient consideration for poor dona rosita who really had feeling she had gone early to her convent and had not yet returned though she had been absent two hours  louis had but just explained his perplexity and vexation when the old negro xavier came in with looks of alarm begging to know whether la senora were come in and excusing himself for having lost sight of her she had not gone to the convent but to the cathedral and he kneeling in the crowded nave while she passed on to one of the side chapels had not seen her again and after waiting far beyond the usual duration of her devotions had supposed that she had gone home unattended  as he finished his story there was a summons to lord fitzjocelyn to speak to mr ford and on marys desiring that he should be admitted he came forward exclaiming my lord he has not been at the consuls i beg to state that he has the keys of all the valuables at the office nothing is in my charge  louis turned to consult mary but as if a horrible idea had come over her she was already speeding through the door of the quadra and appearing there again in a few seconds she beckoned him with a countenance of intense dismay and whispered under her breath louis louis her jewels are gone  poor thing poor thing what will become of her  mary had more reasons for her frightful suspicion than she would detain him to hear  robson always polite had been especially so to the young limenian she had been much left to his society and mary had more than once fancied that they were more at ease in her own absence she was certain that the saya y manto had been frequently employed to enable rosita to enjoy dissipation when her husbands condition would have rendered her public appearance impossible and at the opera or on the alameda robson might have had every opportunity of paying her attention and forwarding her amusements there could be no doubt that she had understood more of their plans than had been supposed had warned him and shared his flight  pursuit capture and a nunnery would be far greater kindness to the poor childish being than leaving her to the mercy of a runaway swindler and all measures were promptly taken ford throwing himself into the chase with greater ardour and indignation than even madison for he had trusted to robsons grand professions that he could easily throw dust into the young lords inexperienced eyes come off with flying colours and protect his subordinate  if he had changed his mind since the senoras warning he had not thought it necessary to inform his confederate and ford was not only furious at the desertion but anxious to make a merit of his zeal and encouraged by having as yet seen no sign that he was recognised  regardless of heat and fatigue fitzjocelyn mr ward and the two clerks were indefatigable throughout the day but it was not till near sunset that a spanish agent of mr wards brought back evidence that a limenian lady and english gentleman had been hastily married by a village padre in the early morning and madison shortly after came from callao having traced such a pair to an american vessel which was long since out of harbour  it was well that the pocketbook had been saved for it contained securities to a large amount which robson after showing to mary to satisfy her doubtless intended to keep in hand for such a start as the present  without it he had contrived as madison knew to secure quite sufficient to remove any anxieties as to the senora rosita owning a fair share of her late husbands property  the day of terrible anxiety made it a relief to mary to have any certainty though she was infinitely shocked at the tidings which louis conveyed to her at once  mrs willis whom mr ward had sent to be her companion went to her brother in the outer room and left the lovers alone in the quadra where mary could freely express her grief and disappointment her sorrow for the insult to her father and her apprehensions for the poor fugitive herself whom she loved enough to lament for exceedingly and to recall every excuse that could be found in a wretched education a miserable state of society a childish mind and religion presented to her in a form that did nothing to make it less childish  marys first recovery from the blow was shown by her remembering how fatigued and heated louis must be and when she had given orders for refreshment for him and had thus resumed something of her ordinary frame he sat looking at her anxiously and presently said and what will you do next mary  i cannot tell  mrs willis and mrs  have both been asking me very kindly to come to them but i cannot let mrs willis stay with me away from her children  yet it seems hard on mr ward that you should be coming to me there  i suppose i must go to mrs  but i waited to consult you  i had rather be at home if it were right  it may easily be made right quietly said louis  how asked mary  i find he continued that the whole affair may be easily settled if you will give me authority  i thought i had given you authority to act in my name  it might be simplified  shall i sign my name  yesonceto make mine yours  if your claims are mine i can take much better care of the dynevor interest  mary rested her cheek on her hand and looked at him with her grave steady face not very much discomposed after the first glimpse of his meaning  will you mary  you know i will she said  then there is no time to be lost  let it be tomorrow  yesgoing on in the quiet deliberate tone that made it so difficult to interrupt himthen i could in my own person negotiate for the sale of the mines  i find there is an offer that robson kept secret i could wind up the accounts see what can be saved for the northwold people and take you safe home by the end of a fortnight  oh louis cried mary almost sobbing this will not do  i cannot entangle you in our ruinous affairs  insufficient objections are consent said louis smiling  do you trust me mary  it is of no use to ask  you think i am not to be trusted with affairs that have become my own i believe i am mary  you know i must do my utmost for the dynevors and i assure you i see my way  i have no reasonable doubt of clearing off all future liabilities  you mean to let me arrange  yes but  then why not obviate all awkward situations at once  my father  you should not ask it louis  i would not hasten you but for the sake of my own father mary  he is growing old and i could not have left him for anything but the hope of bringing him his own chosen daughter  i want you to help me take care of him and we must not leave him alone to the long evenings and cold winds  mary was yieldingi must not keep you from him she said but tomorrowa sunday too  ah  mary do you want gaiety  no if we cannot have it in a holy place let it at least have the consecration of the daylet us have fiftytwo wedding days a year instead of one  indeed i would not press you but that i could take care of you so much better and it is not as if our acquaintance had not begunhow long agotwentyseven years i think  settle it as you like she managed to say with a great flood of tearsbut what soft bright tears  i trust you  he saw she wanted solitude he only stayed for a few words of earnest thanks and the assurance that secrecy and quietness would be best assured by speed  i will come back he said when i have seen to the arrangement  and there is one thing i must do first one poor fellow who must not be left in suspense any longer  tired as he ought to have been he lightly crossed the sala to the room appropriated to business where he had desired the two clerks to wait for him and where tom madison stood against the wall with folded arms while ford lounged in a disengaged attitude on a chair but rose alert and respectful at his appearance  louis asked one or two necessary questions on the custody of the office for the night and ensuing day and ford made repeated assurances that nothing would be found missing that had been left in his charge  i believe you mr delaford said fitzjocelyn quietly  i do not think the lower species of fraud was ever in your style  delaford tried to open his lips but visibly shook  louis answered what he had not yet said i do not intend to expose you  i think you had what excuse neglect can give and unless i should be called on conscientiously to speak to your character i shall leave you to make a new one  delaford began to stammer out thanks and promises of explaining the whole of robsons peculations little he knew the whole of them  there is one earnest of your return to sincerity that i require said louis  explain at once the degree of your acquaintance with charlotte arnold  tom madison still stood moodyaffecting not to hear  oh my lord i did not know that you were interested in that young person  i am interested where innocence has been maligned said louis sternly  i am sure my lord nothing has ever passed at which the most particular need take umbrage exclaimed delaford  if mr madison will recollect i mentioned nothing as the most fastidious need  mr madison would not hear  you only inferred that she had not been insensible to your attractions  why indeed my lord i flatter myself that in my time i have had the happiness of not being unpleasing to the sex said delaford with a sigh and a simper  it is a mortifying question but you owe it to the young woman to answer whether she gave you any encouragement  no my lord  i must confess that she always spoke of a previous attachment and dashed my earlier hopes to the ground  and the book of poems  how came that to be in your possession  delaford confessed that it had been a little tribute returned upon his hands by the young lady in question  one question more mr delaford what was the fact as to her lending you means for your voyage  delaford was not easily brought to confession on this head but he did at length own that he had gone in great distress to charlotte and had appealed to her bounty but he distinctly acknowledged that it was not in the capacity of suitor in fact as he ended by declaring he had the pleasure of saying that there was no young person whom he esteemed more highly than miss arnold and that she had never given him the least encouragement such as need distress the happy man who had secured her affections  the happy man did not move till delaford had left the room when louis walked up to him and said i can further tell you of my own knowledge that that good girl refused large wages and a ladysmaids place partly because she would not live in the same house with that man and she has worked on with a faithful affection and constancy beyond all praise as the single servant to mr and mrs frost in their distress  dont talk to me my lord cried tom turning away im the most unhappy man in the world  i did not ask you to shake hands with delaford tonight  you will another day  he is only a vain coxcomb and treated you to a little of his conceit with perhaps a taste of spite at a successful rival but he has only shown you what a possession you have in her  you dont know what ive done my lord  i have written her a letter that she can never forgive  you dont know what ive done tom  i posted a letter by the mail just starting from callaoa letter to mr frost with a hint to charlotte that you were labouring under a little delusion i knew from your first narration that ford could be no other than my old friend shorn of his beams  that letter still muttered tom  shell forgive and like you all the better for having afforded her a catastrophe tom  you may write by the next mail unless what is better still you come home with us by the same and speak for yourself  if i am your master then ill give you the holiday  yes tom it was important to me to clear up your countenance for i want to bespeak your services tomorrow as my friend  my lord cried tom aghast  if you do require any such service though i should not have thought it there are many nearer your own rank officers and gentlemen fitter for an affair of the kind  i never knew anything about firearms since i gave up poaching  indeed tom i am very far from intending to dispense with your services  i want you to guide me to procure the required weapon  surely said tom with a deep reluctant sigh you never crossed the isthmus without one  yes indeed i did i never saw the party there whom i should have liked to challenge in this way  why tom did you really think i had come out to peru to fight a duel on a sunday morning  thats what comes of living in this sort of place  duels are meat and drink to the people here said tom ashamed and relieved and there have been those who told me it was all that was wanting to make me a gentleman  but in what capacity am i to serve you my lord  in the first place tell me where i may procure a weddingring yes tom thats the weapon   youve no objection to being my friend in that capacity  toms astonished delight went beyond the bounds of expression and therefore was compressed into an almost grim whatever you will my lord but two hot tears were gushing from his eyes  he dashed them away and added what a fool i am  youll believe me my lord though i cant speak that though there may be many nearer and more your equals theres none on earth more glad and happy to see you so than myself  i believe it indeed tom shake hands to wish me joy i am right glad to have one here from ormersfield to make it more homelike for though it is a hurry at last you can guess what she has been to me from the first  knowing her thoroughly has been one of the many many benefits that ferny dell conferred on me  there was no time for more than to enjoin silence  louis had to hurry to the consul and the chaplain and to overcome their astonishment  on the other hand mary was as usual seeking and recovering the balance of her startled spirits in her own chamber  she saw the matter wisely and simply and had full confidence in louis with such a yearning for his protection that it may be the strange suddenness of the proposal cost her the less  she came forth and announced her intention to mrs willis who was inclined to resent it as derogatory to the dignity of womanhood and the privileges of a bride but mary smiled and answered that when he had taken so much trouble for her she could not give him any more by things of that sort  she must be as little in his way as possible  and mrs willis sighed and pitied her but was glad that she should be off her poor brothers mind as soon as might be and was glad to resign her task of chaperoning her  only three persons beyond the consuls family knew what was about to happen when miss ponsonby in her deep mourning attended the morning service in the large hall at the consulhouse and such eyes as were directed towards the handsome stranger only gazed at the unwonted spectacle of an english nobleman not with the more eager curiosity that would have been attached to him had all been known  mr ward lingered a few moments and begged for one word with miss ponsonby she could not but comply and came to meet him blushing but composed in that simple frank kindness which only wished to soften the disappointment  mary he said i am not come to harass you  i have done so long enough and i would not have tormented you but on that one head i did not do justice to your judgment  i see now how vain my hope was i am glad to have met himi am glad to know how worthy of you he is and to have seen you in such hands  you are very kind to speak so said mary  yes mary i could not have borne to part with you if i were not convinced that he is a good man as well as an able man  i might have known that you would not choose otherwise  i shall see your name among the great ladies of the land  i came to say something else  i wished to thank you for the many happy hours i have spent with you though you never for a moment trifled with me  it was i who deceived myself goodbye mary  perhaps you will write to my sister and let her know of your arrival  i will write to you if you please said mary  it will be a great pleasure he said earnestly  and will you let me be of any use in my power to you and lord fitzjocelyn  indeed we shall be most grateful   you have been a most kind and forbearing friend  i should like to know that you were happy said mary lingering and hardly knowing what to say  my little nieces are fond enough of their uncle  my sister wants me in short you need not vex yourself about me  some day when i am an old man i may come and bring you news of lima  meanwhile you will sometimes wear this bracelet and remember that you have an old friend i shall call on lord fitzjocelyn at the office tomorrow and see if we can find any clue to robsons retreat  goodbye and blessings on you mary  mary rejoined louis to speak to him of the kind and noble man who so generously and resolutely bore the wreck of his hopes  they walked up and down together in the cool shade of the trees in the consuls garden and they spoke of the unselfishness which seemed to take away the smart from the wound of disappointment  they spoke sometimes but the day was for the most part spent in the sweetness of pensive happy silence musing with full hearts over this crowning of their long deferred hopes and not without prayer that the same protecting hand might guide them as they should walk together through life  byandby mary disappeared  she would perhaps have preferred her ordinary dressbut the bridal white seemed to her to be due both to louis and to the solemn rite and mystery and when the time came she met him in her plain white muslin and long veil confined by a few sprays of real orange flowers beneath which her calmly noble face was seen simple and collected as ever forgetting in her earnestness all adjuncts that might have been embarrassing or distressing  the large hall was darkening with twilight and the flowers and branches that decked it showed gracefully in the subdued light prayer and praise had lately echoed there and louis and mary could feel that he was with them who blessed the pair at cana far distant as they were from their own churchtheir own home  yes the church their mother their home was with them in her sacred ritual and her choice blessings and their consciences were free from selfwill or selfpleasing such as would have put far from them the precious gifts promised in the name of their lord  when it was over and they first raised their eyes to one anothers faces each beheld in the other a look of entire thankful content not the less perfect because it was grave and peaceful  i think mamma would be quite happy said mary     chapter xxiii  the marvel of peru    turn angelina ever dear     my charmer turn to see   thy own thy longlost edwin here     restored to love and thee                               goldsmith   lord ormersfield sat alone in the library where the fire burnt more for the sake of cheerfulness than of warmth  his eyes were weary with reading and taking off his spectacles he turned his chair away from the table and sat gazing into the fire giving audience to dreamy thoughts  he missed the sunny face ever prompt to watch his moods and find or make time for the cheerful word or desultory chat which often broke and refreshed drier occupation  he remembered when he had hardly tolerated the glass of flowers the scraps of drawing the unbusinesslike books at his sons end of the table but the room looked dull without them now and he was ready to own the value of the grace and finish of life hindering the daily task from absorbing the whole man as had been the case with himself in middle life  somewhat of the calm of old age had begun to fall on the earl and he had latterly been wont to think more deeply  these trifles could not have spoken to his heart save for their connexion with his son and even louiss tastes would have worn out with habit had it not been for the radiance permanent in his own mind namely the thankful adoring love that finds the true brightness in whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report this spirit it was which had kept his heart fresh his spirit youthful and changed constitutional versatility into a power of hearty adaptation to the least congenial tastes  gentleness affection humility and refinement were in his nature mrs frost had trained these qualities into the beauty of christian graces and mrs ponsonby and her daughter had taught him to bring his high principles to supply that which was wanting  indolence of will facility of disposition unsteadiness of purpose inconsiderate impulses without perseverance had all betokened an inherent weakness which the earls cure ambition had been powerless to remedy but duty had been effectual in drawing strength out of what had been feeble by nature  it was religion that had made a man of louis and his father saw and owned it no longer as merely the womans guide in life and the mans resource chiefly in death to be respected and moderately attended to but never so as to interfere unreasonably with the world no he had learnt that it was the only sure and sound movingspring he knew it as his sons strengthening brightening thread of life and began to perceive that his own course might have been less gloomy and less harsh devoid of such dark strands had he held the right clue the contrast brought back some lines which without marking he had heard louis and his aunt reading together and albeit little wont to look into his sons books he was so much haunted by the rhythm that he rose and searched them out            yea mark him well ye cold and proud           bewildered in a heartless crowd             starting and turning pale               at rumours angry din             no storm can now assail               the charm he bears within           rejoicing still and doing good           and with the thought of god imbued             no glare of high estate               no gloom of woe or want             the radiance may abate               where heaven delights to haunt   the description went to his heart so well did it agree with louis yet there was a sad feeling for the south american mail had been some days due and he had not heard of his son since he was about to land at callao  five months was a long absence and as the chances of failure disappointment climate disease and shipwreck arose before him he marvelled at himself for having consented to peril his sole treasure and even fancied that a solitary childless old age might be the penalty in store for having waited to be led heavenward by his son  it was seldom that the earl gave way and reproaching himself for his weakness he roused himself and rang the bell for better light there was a movement in the house and for some moments the bell was not answered but presently the door was opened  bring the other lamp  yes my lord  the slow soft voice did not belong to frampton  he started up and there stood louis  my dear father he said and lord ormersfield sprang up grasped his sons hand and laid the other hand on his shoulder but durst ask no questions for the speedy return seemed to bespeak that he had failed he looked in louiss face and saw it full of emotion with dew on the eyelashes but suddenly a sweet archness gleamed in the eyes and he steadied his trembling lip to say with a smile  lady fitzjocelyn  and that very moment mary was in lord ormersfields arms  my children my dear children happy at last  god bless you  this is all i ever wished  he held a hand of each and looked from one to the other till mary turned away to hide her tears of joy and louis with his eyes still moist began talking to give her time to recover  you will forgive our not writing  we landed this morning found the last mail was not come in and could not help coming on  we knew you would be anxious and thought you would not mind the suddenness  no indeed said his father if all surprises were like this one but you are the loser mary  i am afraid this is not the reception for a bride  mary has dispensed with much that belongs to a bride said louis see here and seizing her hand he began pulling off her glove till she did it for him did you ever see such a weddingringa great solid thing of peruvian gold with a spanish posy inside  i like it said mary it shows  what you are worth eh mary  well here we are  it seems real at last  and you father have you been well  yes well indeed now i have you both  but how came you so quickly you never brought her across the isthmus  indeed i did  she would come  it was her first act of rebellion for we were not going to let you meet the frosts alonethe october frosts i mean i hope the dynevor frosts are all right  frampton was here seen at the open door doubtful whether to intrude yet impelled by necessity as he caught fitzjocelyns eye he hesitating said  my lord the spanish gentleman  the greatest triumph of my life cried louis actually clapping his hands together with ecstacy to the butlers extreme astonishment  why frampton dont you know him  my lord  let me introduce you then tomr thomas madison and as frampton still stood perplexed looking at the fine foreignlooking man who was keeping in the background busied with the luggage louis continued you cannot credit such a marvel of peru  young madison my lord repeated frampton slowly coming to his senses  no other  he has done lady fitzjocelyn and all of us infinite service continued louis quickly to prevent madisons reception from receiving a fall in proportion to the grandeur of the first impression he is to stay here for a short time before going to his appointment at bristol in mr wards countinghouse with a salary of 180 pounds i shall be much obliged if you will make him welcome  and returning in his glee to the library louis found mary explaining how a gentleman at lima who had long professed to covet so good a clerk as madison had on the breakup of their firm offered him a confidential post for which he was well fitted by his knowledge of the spanish language and the south american trade to receive the cargoes sent home  in truth said louis coming in i had reason to be proud of my pupil  we could never have found our way through the accounts without him and the old cornish man whom we sent for from the mines gave testimony to him such as will do mr holdsworths heart good  but nothing is equal to framptons taking him for a spanish don  and poor delafords witness was quite as much to his credit said mary  ay if delaford had not been equally willing to depose against him when he was the apparent catiline said louis  poor delaford he was very useful to us after all and i should be glad to know he had a better fate than going off to the diggings with a years salary in his pocket  footnote  a recent writer relates that he found the near relation of a nobleman gaining a scanty livelihood as shoeblack at the diggings query  might not this be mr delaford  then everything is settled asked his father  almost everything  the mines are off our hands and the transfer will be completed as soon as oliver has sent his signature and theres quite enough saved to make them very comfortable  you have told me nothing of them yet  they are all very well  james has been coming here twice aweek since i have been at home and has been very attentive and pleasant but i have not been at the terrace much  there never was such a houseful of children  olivers room is the only place where one is safe from falling over two or three  however they seem to like it and to think the more the better  james came over here the morning after the boy was born as much delighted as if he had had any prospects  a boy at last  poor mr dynevor  does he take it as an insult to his misfortunes  he seems as well pleased as they and in fact i hope the boy may not after all be unprovided for  mr mansell wrote to offer to be godfather and i thought i could not do otherwise than ask him to stay here  i am glad i did so for he told me that now he has seen for himself the noble way they are going on in he has made up his mind he has no relation nearer than isabel and he means to make his will in favour of her son  he asked whether i would be a trustee but i said i was growing old and had little doubt you would be glad enough  you will have plenty of such work louis  it is very dangerous to be known as a good manofbusiness and goodnatured  pray how does jem bear it  with tolerable equanimity  it may be many years before the child is affected by it if mrs mansell has it for her life  besides james is a wiser man than he used to be  he has been somewhat like robinson crusoes old goat said louis poor jem the fall and the scanty fare tamed him  i liked him so well before that i did not know how much better i was yet to like him mary you must see his workhouse  giving up his time to it as he does he does infinite good there  yes mr calcott says that he lives in fear of some one offering him a living said lord ormersfield  and the dear old giraffe said louis  clara  she is looking almost handsome  i wish some good man would marry her  she would make an excellent wife  i am not ready to spare her yet said mary i must make acquaintance with her before any excellent man carries her off  but there is a marriage that will surprise you said the earl your eldest cousin whose name i can never remember  virginia cried louis  captain lonsdale i hope  what could have made you fix on him  because the barricades could not have been in vain and he was an excellent fellow to whom i owe a great deal of gratitude  he kept my aunts terrors in abeyance most gallantly and little virginia drank in his words and built up a hero  but how was it  you remember that lady conway would not take our advice and stay quietly at home  on the first steamer she fell in with this captain and it seems that she was helpless enough without her former butler to be very grateful to him for managing her passports and conducting her through germany  and the conclusion was that she herself had encouraged him so far that she really had not any justification in refusing when he proposed for the young lady as he is fairly provided for  my poor aunt  no one ever pities her when she is hoist with her own petard  i am glad poor virginia is to be happy in her own way  i shall send my congratulations tomorrow said the earl smiling triumphantly and a piece of intelligence of my own  at h b m consuls limawhat day was it louis  mary ran away to take off her bonnet as much surprised by the earls mirth as if she had seen primroses in december  yet such blossoms are sometimes tempted forth and affection was breathing something like a second spring on the life so long unnaturally chilled and blighted if his shoulders were bowed his figure had lost much of its rigidity and though his locks were thinned and whitened and his countenance slightly aged yet the softened look and the more frequent smile had smoothed away the sternness and given gentleness to his dignity  no sooner was she out of the room than lord ormersfield asked and what have you done with the spanish woman  the answer excited a peal of laughter which made louis stand aghast both at such unprecedented merriment and at the cause for hitherto he had so entirely felt with mary as never to have seen the ludicrous aspect of the elopement  presently however he was amused by perceiving that his father not merely regarded it as a relief from an embarrassing charge but as an entire acquittal for his own conscience for any slanders he had formerly believed of dona rosita  louis briefly explained that the poor lady being provided for by robsons investments in america he had thought it right that the ponsonby share of the firm should bear the loss through these embezzlements and he had found that her extravagance had made such inroads on the property that while the dynevor share always the largest resulted in a fair competence louis had saved nothing out of the wreck of the ponsonby affairs but mary herself  can you excuse it father he said with all the old debonnaire manner  you will never be a rich man louis  you and she will have some cares but and his voice grew thickyou are rich in what makes life happy  you have left me nothing more to ask or wish for  except that i may be worthy of her father  you first taught me how she ought to be loved  you have been very patient with me all this time  i feel as if i must thank you for her and then changing his tone as she opened the doorlook at her now she has her bonnet offdoes not she look natural  i am sure i feel so said mary  you know this always seemed more like home than anything else  yes and now i do feel sure that i have you at last mary  that moorish castle of yours used to make me afraid of wakening it was so much fitter for isabels fantastic viscount  bythebye has she brought that book out  oh yes and james is nearly as proud of it as he is of his son  he actually wanted me to read it  he tells me it is selling very well and i hope it may really bring them in something  now thentheres the tea  sit down mary and look exactly as you did the morning i came home and found you  im afraid i cannot said mary looking up in his face with an arch deprecating expression  why not  dont you know that i am so much happier  before breakfast next morning fitzjocelyn must visit his farm and mary must come with him  how delicious was that english morning after their voyage the slant rays of the sun silvering the turf and casting rainbows across the gossamer threads from one brown bent to another the harvest fields on the slopes dotted with rich sheaves of wheat the coppices in their summer glory here and there touched with the gold of early autumn and the slopes and meadows bright with lively green a pleasant change for eyes fresh from the bare rugged mountainside and the rank unwholesome vegetation of panama  shaggy little scottish oxen were feeding on the dewy grass their black coats looking sleek in the sun beyond the long shadows of the thorns but as mary said laughing only farmer fitzjocelyns cattle came here now and she stopped more than once to be introduced to some notable animal or to hear the history of experiments in fatting beasts  there they have found you out  thats for you said louis as a merry peal of bells broke out from the church tower and came joyously up through the tranquil air  yes ormersfield you are greeting a friend  you may be very glad old place  i wish mr holdsworth would come up to breakfast  is it too wet for you this way mary  this way was into fernydell and mary answered oh nono it is where i most wanted to go with you  we have never been there together since  no you never would walk with me after i could go alone said louis with a playful tone of reproach veiling deep feeling  in silence he handed her down the rocky steps plunging deeper among the hazels and rowantrees then pausing he turned aside the luxuriant leaves of a tuft of hartstongue and showed her cut on a stone veiled both by the verdure and the form of the rock the letters                    deo gratias                    l f 1847   i like that was all that marys full heart allowed her to say  yes said louis i feel quite as thankful for the accident as for the preservation  and that dear mamma was with us added mary  between her and you it was a blessing to us all  i see these letters are not new you must have cut them out long ago  as soon as i could get here without help he answered  i thought i should be able to find the very spot where i lay by remembering the cross which the bare mountainash boughs made against the sky but by that time they were all leaf and flower and now do you see there they are with the fruit just formed and blushing  like other things said mary reaching after the spray once all blossom now  fruit very unripe as he said between a smile and a sigh but there is some encouragement in the world after all and every project of mine has not turned out like my two specimens of copper ore  you remember them mary and our first encounter  remember it said mary  i dont think i forgot a day of that summer  what i brought you here for said louis was to ask you to let me do what i have long wishedto let me put the letter m here  i think you might have done it without leave said mary  so i might at first but by the time i came here again mary you had become in my estimation a little more than kin and less thanno i wont say that but one could not treat you as comfortably as clara  i lost a cousin one august day and never found her again  never  neverbut the odd thing is that i cannot believe that what i did find has been away these seven years  yes that is very strange said mary i have felt it so  wo do seem to understand and guess each others thoughts as if we had been going on together all this time  i believe it is because you gave me the first impulse to think and taught me the way  and i know who first taught me to think to any purpose said louis smiling  but who is this descending on us  it was the spanish gentleman reddening all over at such an encounter in midcareer towards her at the terrace and muttering something breathless and almost surly about begging pardon  look here tom said louis lifting the leaves to show the letters that is all i ever could feel on that matter and so should you there no more about ityou want to be on your way and tell mr frost that we shall be at northwold in the afternoon  about half an hour after clara was delicately blowing the dust out of the wreath of forgetmenots on the porcelain shepherdesss hat when a shriek resounded through the house and barely saving the arcadian in her start she rushed downstairs  james in his shirtsleeves was already on his way to the kitchen  there kitty was found too much frightened to run away making lunges with the toastingfork at a blackbearded figure who held in his arms charlotte arnold in a fit of the almost forgotten hysterics  the workhouse girl shrieked for the police jane was at master olivers door prepared for flight or defence isabel stood on the stairs with her baby in her arms and her little flock clinging to her skirts when clara darted back laughing too much to speak distinctly as she tried to explain who the ruffian really was  and louis is coming and mary  oh isabel he has her at last  oh jem jem did we ever want dear granny so much  i always knew it would come right at last  jane jane do you hear lord fitzjocelyn is married  let me in i must go and tell uncle oliver  james looked at isabel and read in her smile claras final acquittal from all suspicions beneath the dignity of both  uncle oliver would have damped her joy had it been in his power  he gave up his affairs as hopeless as soon as he found that young fitzjocelyn had only made them an excuse for getting married and he was so excessively angry with her for being happy that she found she must carry her joyous face out of his sight  it was not easy to be a dignified steady governess that morning and when the lessons were finished she could have danced home all the way she had scarcely reached the terrace gate when the wellknown sound of the wheels was heard and in another moment she was between the two dear cousins fitzjocelyns eyes dancing with gladsomeness and marys broad tranquil brow and frank kindly smile free from the shadow of a single cloud  claras heart leapt up with joy joy full and unmixed the guerdon of the spirit untouched by vanity or selfishness without one taint that could have mortified into jealous disappointed pain it was bliss to one of those whom she loved best it was the winning of a brother and sister and perhaps claras life had never had a happier moment  lord ormersfield could have thanked her for that joyous innocent welcome  he had paid her attentions for his sons sake of which he had become rather ashamed and as louis and mary hastened on to meet james and isabel he detained her for a moment to say some special words of kindness  clara perhaps had an intuitive perception of his meaning and reference to her past heiress state for she laughed gaily and said yes i never was more glad of anything  he was so patient that i was sure he deserved it  i always trusted to such a time as this when he used to talk to me for want of dear grandmamma  mary was led upstairs to be introduced to the five children while the gentlemen went over the accounts in olivers room  enough had been rescued from the ruin to secure not wealth but fair competence the mines were disposed of to a company which would pay the value by instalments and all the remainder of the business was in train to be easily wound up by mr ward  mr dynevors gratitude was not overpowering he was short and dry privately convinced that he could have managed matters much better himself and charging all the loss on fitzjocelyns folly in letting robson escape  but though james was hurt at his unthankfulness and lord ormersfield could have been very angry the party most concerned did not take it much to heart he believed he had done his best but an experienced eye might detect blunders and he knew it was hard to trust affairs out of ones own hands  even the earl was glad to escape to the sittingroom though every one was talking at once and mercy the loudest and louis as the children would call him in spite of their mamma was at once seized on by kitty to be introduced to our brother  and what is his name kitty  woland shouted all the young ladies in chorus  sir woland is in the book that mamma did make said kitty  louis looked at isabel with laughing eyes  it was uncle olivers great wish she said and we did not wish to remember the days of sir hubert  before lord ormersfield was quite deafened louis recollected that they must show mary at the house beautiful and they took leave  the earl begged james to come back to dinner with them and louis asked if clara could not find room in the carriage too  it was the earnest of what ormersfield was to be to her henceforth and she was all delight and earnestness to be allowed to walk home with james by starlight  and the evening realized all she could wish  the gentlemen had their conversation in the diningroom and mary and clara sat on the steps together in the warm twilight and talked of granny and clara poured out all that mary did not yet know of louis  i hear you have been in hysterics again had been lord fitzjocelyns greeting to charlotte  you are prepared for the consequences  charlotte was prepared  the mutual pardon had not been very hard to gain and tom had only to combat her declarations that it was downright presumptuous for her to have more than master had a year and her protests that she could not leave her mistress and the dear children in their poverty  the tidings that they were relieved from their present straits answered this scruple and charlotte was a pretty picture of shrinking exultation when she conducted her betrothed to mrs martha who however declared that she would not take his hundred and eighty pounds a yearno nor twice thatto marry him in that there black beard  mrs beckett made him exceedingly welcome and he spent the chief part of his time at no 5 where he was much more at ease than at ormersfield  he confessed that though not given to bashfulness before any man there was something in mr framptons excessive civility that quite overcame him and made him always expect to be kicked out of doors the next minute for sauciness  charlottes whirlwinds of feeling had nearly expended themselves in that one shock of meeting  the years of cheerful toil and the weeks of grief and suspense had been good training for that silly little heart and the prospect of her new duties brought on her a sobering sense of responsibility  she would always be tender and clinging but the fragrant woodbine would be trained round a sound sturdy oak and her modesty gentleness and sincerity gave every promise of her being an excellent wife  tom had little time to spare before undertaking his new office and it was better that the parting should be speedy for it was a grievous one both to the little bride and to isabel and the children  friend rather than servant her place could be ill supplied by the two maids who were coming in her room and isabel could have found it in her heart to sympathize with mercy and salome in their detestation of the black man who was coming to take away their dear charlotte  claras first outlay on her restoration to comparative wealth was on charlottes weddingdress  it was a commission given to mary when with fitzjocelyn she went to london for one day to put the final stroke to the dissolution of the unfortunate firm and to rejoice aunt melicent with the sight of her happiness  good old miss ponsonbys heart was some degrees softer and less narrow than formerly  she had a good many prejudices left but she did not venture on such sweeping censures as in old times and she would have welcomed lord ormersfield with real cordiality for the sake of his love to her mary  indeed louiss fascinations and marys bright face had almost persuaded her into coming home with them but the confirmed londoner prevailed and she had a tyrant maidservant who would not let her go even to the festival at ormersfield in honour of her niece  the earl was bent on rejoicings for his sons marriage and louis dexterously managed that the banquet should take place on the day fixed for toms wedding thus casting off all oppressive sense of display by regarding it as madisons feast instead of his own clara who seemed to have been set free from governess tasks solely to be the willing slave of all the world worked as hard as mary and louis at all the joyous arrangements nor was the festival itself like many such events less bright than the previous toils  the wedding took place in ormersfield church on a bright september morning james frost performed the marriage lord fitzjocelyn gave the bride away and little kitty was the bridesmaid  the ring was of peruvian gold and the brooch that clasped the brides lace collar was of silver from the san benito mine  in her white bonnet and dovecoloured silk she looked as simple and ladylike as she was pretty and a very graceful contrast to her spanish gentleman bridegroom  the ormersfield bowlinggreen which was wont to be so still and deserted hemmed in by the dark ilex belt beheld such a scene as had not taken place there since its present master was a boy  there were long tables spread for guests of all ranks and degrees  louis had his own way with the invitations and had gathered a miscellaneous host sir miles oakstead had come to see his old friend made happy and to smile as he was introduced to the rosecoloured pastor in his glass case  mr calcott was there and mrs calcott all feuds with mrs james frost long since forgotten and sir gilbert brewster shone in his colonels uniformfor lady fitzjocelyn had intimated a special desire that all the members of the yeomanry should appear in costume and many a young farmers wife and sister came all the more proudly in the fond belief that her own peculiar hero looked in his blue and silver as well as lord fitzjocelyn himself  and miss mercy faithful was there watching over oliver to make up for the want of her sister  and old mr walby was bowing and gossiping with many a patient and james with his little brown woman in his hand was looking after the party of paupers for whom he had obtained a holiday and mr holdsworth was keeping guard over his village boys whose respectable parents remained in two separate throngs male and female and clara frost was here there and everywherenow setting mrs richardson at ease now carrying little mercy to look at the band now conveying away salome when frightened now finding a mother for a village child taken with a sobbing fit of shyness now conducting a stray schoolboy to his companions now running up for a few gay words to her old uncle to make sure that he was neither chilly nor tired  how pleasant it was to her to mingle with group after group of people and hear from one and another how handsome and how happy lord fitzjocelyn looked and lady fitzjocelyn quite beautiful and then as they walked from party to party setting all at ease and leaving pleased looks wherever they went to cross them now and then and exchange a blithe smile or merry remark  no melancholy gaps here thought she as she helped her uncle to the easy chair prepared for him at the dinnertable no spiritless curiosity no forced attempts to display what no one felt  there must needs be toasts and such as thought themselves assembled for the sake of the marriage in high life were taken by surprise when lord fitzjocelyn rose and began by thanking those assembled for assisting in doing honour to the event of the daythe marriage of two persons for each of whom he himself as well as those most dear to him felt the warmest respect and gratitude for essential services and disinterested attachment alike in adversity and in prosperity unpleasant as he knew it was to have such truths spoken to ones face he could not deny himself the satisfaction of expressing a portion of the esteem and reverence he felt for such noble conduct as had been displayed by those whose health he had the pleasure to proposemr and mrs thomas madison  there was his aside as he sat down i only hope i have not made him surly poor fellow i have put him in a predicament but it could not be otherwise  clara had tears in her eyes but not like those she had shed at cheveleigh james gave louis a look of heartfelt gratitude bowed the lowest to the happy pair and held up little kitty that her imitative nod and sip might not be lost upon them  mrs beckett said well i never  if ever a girl deserved it choked and flourished her white handkerchief frampton saluted like my lord and louis xiv rolled into one and warren and gervas privately agreed that they did not know what was coming of the world since marksedge poachers had only to go to foreign parts to be coined goold in the silver mines  mrs madisons pretty face was all blushes smiles and tears  mr madison rose to reply with unexpected alacrity and louis was soon relieved from anxiety at least as far as regarded his eloquence for he thought in the majestic spanish idiom and translated as he went  my lords he began gentlemen and ladies and neighbours my lord fitzjocelyn has done my wife and myself an honour as unlookedfor as undeserved and the manner of the favour is such that we shall carry the grateful remembrance to the end of our lives  he has been so condescending as to speak of such services as it was in our power to render but he has passed over in silence that which gives him a claim to the utmost that i could place at his feet  he will forgive me for speaking openly for i cannot refrain from disburthening my mind and letting you know even more than you are at present aware of what your senorwhat your lord truly is  most of you have known me but too well  it is not ten years since i was a rude untaught boy upon the heath such as a large proportion of those present would deem beneath their notice lord fitzjocelyn did not think so  his kindness of manner and encouraging words awakened in me new life and energy  he gave me his time and his teaching and what was far more he gave me his sympathy and his example  it was these which gave vitality to lessons dimly understood or which had fallen dead on my ears when only heard in my irregular attendance at school but the work in me was tardy and at first i requited his kindness with presumption insubordination and carelessness  then when i had been dismissed and when my wilful neglect had occasioned the accident of which the traces are still only too visible then did i not merit to be exposed and cast off for ever  i knew it and i fled as if i could leave behind me my grief and my shame  little did i dare to guess that he was dealing with me as though i had been his own brother and scrupulously concealing my share in the misfortune  when i returned sullen and overwhelmed he aloneyes and while still suffering severelyspoke a kind word to me and exerted himself to rescue me from the utter ruin and degradation to which despair would have led me he placed me in the situation which conducted me to my present position he gave me the impulse to improve myself and above all he infused into me the principles without which the rest would have been mere temptations  if i have been blest beyond my desertsif i have been prosperous beyond reasonable expectationif among numerous failures i have withstood some evilsall under the greatest and highest benefactor is owing to the kindness and above all to the generous forbearance of lord fitzjocelyn  i wish i could testify my gratitude in any better manner than by speaking of him to his face but i am sure you will all drink his health more heartily if possible for knowing one more trait in addition to your own personal experience of his character  alas that all things hidden and yet to be proclaimed on the housetops would bear the light as well as fitzjocelyns secret  the revelation of this unobtrusive act of patience and forbearance excited a perfect tumult of enthusiasm among persons already worked up to great ardour for one so beloved and shouts and even tears on every side strove in vain to express the response to madisons words  too bad tom was louiss muttered comment  you are paid in your own coin retorted mary raising her glistening eyes full of archness  i perceive it is no surprise to you lady fitzjocelyn said sir miles oakstead and i own nothing from that quarter nodding at louis surprises me greatly  she practised eavesdropping said louis when the poor fellow was relieving his mind by a confession to the present mrs madison  and i think mrs madison and i deserve credit for having kept the secret so long said mary  it explains observed mr holdsworth  i did not understand your power over madison  it was the making of us both said louis and a very fine specimen of the grandeur of that rough diamond  it elucidates what i have always said that if you can but find the one vulnerable place there is a wonderful fund of nobleness in some of these people  do you take this gentleman as an average specimen  every ploughboy is not an undeveloped madison but in every parish there may be some one with either the thinking or the rising element in his composition and if the right ingredient be not added the fermentation will turn sour as my neglect had very nearly made it do with him  he would have been a fine demagogue by this time if he had not had a generous temper and sundayschool foundation  hush said mary smilingyou must not moralize  i believe you are doing it that poor farmer norris may not catch your eye  louis gave a debonnaire glance of resignation and the farmer rising in the full current of feeling caused by madisons speech said with thorough downright emotion that he knew it was of no use to try to enhance what had been already so well expressed but he believed there was scarcely a person present who did not feel equally with mr madison the right to claim lord fitzjocelyn as a personal friendand an irrepressible hum of fervent assent proved how truly the farmer spoke  yeseach had in turn experienced so much of his friendly kindness and what was more of his sympathy that he could confidently affirm that there was scarcely one in the neighbourhood who had not learnt the news of his happiness as if some good thing had happened to himself individually  they all as one man were delighted to have him at home again and to wish him joy of the lady whom many of them know already well enough to rejoice in welcoming her for her own sake as well as for that of lord fitzjocelyn  again and again did the cheers break forthhearty homely and sincere and such were the bright tearful loving eyes which sought those of fitzjocelyn on every side that his own filled so fast that all seemed dazzled and misty and he hastily strove to clear them as he arose but the swelling of his heart brought the happy dew again and would scarcely let him find voice  my friends my dear good friends you are all very kind to me  it is of no use to tell you how little i deserve it but you know how much i wish to do so and here is one who has helped me and who will help me  we thank you with all our hearts you may well wish my father and me joy and yourselves too  thank you you should not look at me so kindly if you wish me to say more  the earl who had studied popularity as a useful engine but had never prized love beyond his own family was exceedingly touched by the ardour of enthusiastic affection that his son had obtainednot by courting suffrages not by gifts not by promises but simply by real openhearted love to every one  lord ormersfield himself came in for demonstrations of warm feeling which he would certainly never have sought nor obtained ten years ago when he was respected and looked up to as an upright representative of certain opinions but personally either disliked or regarded with coldness  he knew what these cheers were worth and that even fitzjocelyn might not long be the popular hero but he was not the less gratified and triumphant and felt that no success of his whole life had been worth the present  after all clara said oliver dynevor as his nephew and niece were assisting him to the carriage they have managed these things better than we did though they did not have gunter  gunter cant bring hearts love down from town in a box said clara in a flash of indignation  no dear uncle there are things that cant be got unless by living for them  nor even by living for them clara said james you must live for something else  lord ormersfield had heard these few last words and there was deep thought in his eye as he bade his cousins farewell at the hall door  clara was the last to take her place and as she turned round with a merry smile to wish him goodbye he said you have been making yourself very useful clara i am afraid you have had no time to enjoy yourself  thats a contradiction said clara laughing heres busy little kitty who never is thoroughly happy but when she thinks she is useful and i am child enough to be of the same mind  i never was unhappy but when i was set to enjoy myself  it has been the most beautiful day of my life  thank you for it  goodbye  the earl crossed the hall and found mary standing alone on the terrace steps looking out at the curling smoke from the cottage chimneys and on the coppices and hedgerows  are you tired my dear he said  oh no  i was only thinking of dear mammas persuading louis to go on with the crumpled plans of those cottages  how happy she would be  i was thinking of her likewise said the earl  she spoke truly when she told me that he might not be what i then wished to make him but something far better  mary looked up with a satisfied smile of approval saying i am so glad you think so  yes said lord ormersfield i have thought a good deal since  i have been alone here and i think i see why louis has done better than some of his elders  it seems to me that some of us have not known the duties that lay by the wayside so to speak from the main purpose of life  i wish i could talk it over with your mother my dear what do you think she would say  mary thought of louiss vision of the threads  i think she said that i have heard her say something like it  the real aim of life is out of sight and even good people are too apt to attach themselves to what is tangible like friendship or family affection or usefulness or public spirit but these are like the paths of glory which lead but to the grave and no farther  it is the singlehearted faithful aim towards the one thing needful to which all other things may be added as mere accessories  it brings down strength and wisdom  it brings the life everlasting already to begin in this life and so makes the path shine more and more unto the perfect day     the end
