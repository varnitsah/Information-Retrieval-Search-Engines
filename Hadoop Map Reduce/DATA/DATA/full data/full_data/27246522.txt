since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through europe on foot after much thought i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle so i determined to do it this was in march 1878  i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent and finally hired a mr harris for this service  it was also my purpose to study art while in europe mr harris was in sympathy with me in this he was as much of an enthusiast in art as i was and not less anxious to learn to paint i desired to learn the german language so did harris  toward the middle of april we sailed in the holsatia captain brandt and had a very pleasant trip indeed  after a brief rest at hamburg we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather but at the last moment we changed the program for private reasons and took the expresstrain  we made a short halt at frankfortonthemain and found it an interesting city i would have liked to visit the birthplace of gutenburg but it could not be done as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead the city permits this house to belong to private parties instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it  frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred charlemagne while chasing the saxons as he said or being chased by them as they said arrived at the bank of the river at dawn in a fog the enemy were either before him or behind him but in any case he wanted to get across very badly he would have given anything for a guide but none was to be had presently he saw a deer followed by her young approach the water he watched her judging that she would seek a ford and he was right she waded over and the army followed so a great frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided and in order to commemorate the episode charlemagne commanded a city to be built there which he named frankfortthe ford of the franks none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at  frankfort has another distinctionit is the birthplace of the german alphabet or at least of the german word for alphabet buchstaben they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticksbuchstabehence the name  i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars by way of experiment i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents the man gave me 43 cents change  in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg too and in the villages along the road even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a bodys lap and as for the uniforms of the soldiers they were newness and brightness carried to perfection one could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them the streetcar conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox and their manners were as fine as their clothes  in one of the shops i had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death it is entitled the legends of the rhine from basle to rotterdam by f j kiefer translated by l w garnham ba  all tourists mention the rhine legendsin that sort of way which quietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his life and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of thembut no tourist ever tells them so this little book fed me in a very hungry place and i in my turn intend to feed my reader with one or two little lunches from the same larder i shall not mar garnhams translation by meddling with its english for the most toothsome thing about it is its quaint fashion of building english sentences on the german planand punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all  in the chapter devoted to legends of frankfort i find the following  the knave of bergen in frankfort at the romer was a great maskball at the coronation festival and in the illuminated saloon the clanging music invited to dance and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and charms of the ladies and the festively costumed princes and knights all seemed pleasure joy and roguish gaiety only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention and his tall figure as well as the noble propriety of his movements attracted especially the regards of the ladies   who the knight was nobody could guess for his vizier was well closed and nothing made him recognizable proud and yet modest he advanced to the empress bowed on one knee before her seat and begged for the favor of a waltz with the queen of the festival and she allowed his request with light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent dancer but also by the grace of his manner and fine conversation he knew to win the queen and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged a third and a fourth as well as others were not refused him how all regarded the happy dancer how many envied him the high favor how increased curiosity who the masked knight could be  also the emperor became more and more excited with curiosity and with great suspense one awaited the hour when according to masklaw each masked guest must make himself known this moment came but although all other unmasked the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen till at last the queen driven by curiosity and vexed at the obstinate refusal commanded him to open his vizier   he opened it and none of the high ladies and knights knew him but from the crowded spectators 2 officials advanced who recognized the black dancer and horror and terror spread in the saloon as they said who the supposed knight was it was the executioner of bergen but glowing with rage the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death who had ventured to dance with the queen so disgraced the empress and insulted the crown the culpable threw himself at the emperor and said   indeed i have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here but most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen the queen is insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason but no punishment even blood will not be able to wash out the disgrace which you have suffered by me therefore oh king allow me to propose a remedy to efface the shame and to render it as if not done draw your sword and knight me then i will throw down my gauntlet to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully of my king  the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal however it appeared the wisest to him you are a knave he replied after a moments consideration however your advice is good and displays prudence as your offense shows adventurous courage well then and gave him the knightstroke so i raise you to nobility who begged for grace for your offense now kneels before me rise as knight knavish you have acted and knave of bergen shall you be called henceforth and gladly the black knight rose three cheers were given in honor of the emperor and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the queen danced still once with the knave of bergen     chapter ii  heidelberg  landing a monarch at heidelberg   we stopped at a hotel by the railwaystation next morning as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way in front of another hotel first the personage who is called the portier who is not the porter but is a sort of firstmate of a hotel 1 see appendix a appeared at the door in a spickandspan new blue cloth uniform decorated with shining brass buttons and with bands of gold lace around his cap and wristbands and he wore white gloves too   he shed an official glance upon the situation and then began to give orders two womenservants came out with pails and brooms and brushes and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door beyond these we could see some menservants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it then brought back and put down again the brass stairrods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there now came some more chambermaids and retouched the sidewalk and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone the portier cast his eye along it and found it was not absolutely straight he commanded it to be straightened the servants made the effortmade several efforts in factbut the portier was not satisfied he finally had it taken up and then he put it down himself and got it right  at this stage of the proceedings a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the curbstone along the center of the black carpet this red path cost the portier more trouble than even the black one had done but he patiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement some with their schoolknapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets others with arms full of bundles and all absorbed in the show occasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side this always visibly annoyed the portier   now came a waiting interval the landlord in plain clothes and bareheaded placed himself on the bottom marble step abreast the portier who stood on the other end of the same steps six or eight waiters gloved bareheaded and wearing their whitest linen their whitest cravats and their finest swallowtails grouped themselves about these chiefs but leaving the carpetway clear nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited  in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street two or three open carriages arrived and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of baden a stately man in uniform who wore the handsome brassmounted steelspiked helmet of the army on his head last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of baden in a closed carriage these passed through the lowbowing groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads and then the show was over  it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship  but as to heidelberg the weather was growing pretty warmvery warm in fact so we left the valley and took quarters at the schloss hotel on the hill above the castle   heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorgea gorge the shape of a shepherds crook if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight for a mile and a half then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears this gorgealong whose bottom pours the swift neckaris confined between or cloven through a couple of long steep ridges a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands with heidelberg nestling between them from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view  now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more he will see the schloss hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckara precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears the building seems very airily situated it has the appearance of being on a shelf halfway up the wooded mountainside and as it is remote and isolated and very white it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its back  this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation this feature may be described as a series of glassenclosed parlors clinging to the outside of the house one against each and every bedchamber and drawingroom they are like long narrow highceiled birdcages hung against the building my room was a corner room and had two of these things a north one and a west one   from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge from the west one he looks down it this last affords the most extensive view and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined too out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage a rifleshot removed rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle 2 see appendix b with empty window arches ivymailed battlements moldering towersthe lear of inanimate naturedeserted discrowned beaten by the storms but royal still and beautiful it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castles base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow   behind the castle swells a great domeshaped hill forestclad and beyond that a nobler and loftier one the castle looks down upon the compact brownroofed town and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river now the view broadens through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain which stretches away softly and richly tinted grows gradually and dreamily indistinct and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon  i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives  the first night we were there we went to bed and to sleep early but i awoke at the end of two or three hours and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows i took it to be rain but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar tumbling over her dikes and dams far below in the gorge i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight away down on the level under the black mass of the castle the town lay stretched along the river its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights there were rows of lights on the bridges these flung lances of light upon the water in the black shadows of the arches and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of gasjets which seemed to cover acres of ground it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there i did not know before that a halfmile of sextuple railwaytracks could be made such an adornment   one thinks heidelberg by daywith its surroundingsis the last possibility of the beautiful but when he sees heidelberg by night a fallen milky way with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border he requires time to consider upon the verdict  one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country but german legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm they have peopled all that region with gnomes and dwarfs and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures at the time i am writing of i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities  one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk and kobolds and enchanted folk and the rest of the pleasant legendary stuff and so by stimulating my fancy i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion it was a pine wood with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that ones footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool the treetrunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars and stood close together they were bare of branches to a point about twentyfive feet aboveground and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through the world was bright with sunshine outside but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own breathings  when i had stood ten minutes thinking and imagining and getting my spirit in tune with the place and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head it made me start and then i was angry because i started i looked up and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me looking down at me i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him i eyed the raven and the raven eyed me nothing was said during some seconds then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation lifted his wings stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked againa croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in raven well what do you want here i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being and reproved for it however i made no reply i would not bandy words with a raven the adversary waited a while with his shoulders still lifted his head thrust down between them and his keen bright eye fixed on me then he threw out two or three more insults which i could not understand further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church   i still made no reply now the adversary raised his head and called there was an answering croak from a little distance in the woodevidently a croak of inquiry the adversary explained with enthusiasm and the other raven dropped everything and came the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug the thing became more and more embarrassing they called in another friend this was too much i saw that they had the advantage of me and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done they craned their necks and laughed at me for a raven can laugh just like a man they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me they were nothing but ravensi knew thatwhat they thought of me could be a matter of no consequenceand yet when even a raven shouts after you what a hat oh pull down your vest and that sort of thing it hurts you and humiliates you and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments  animals talk to each other of course there can be no question about that but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them i never knew but one man who could i knew he could however because he told me so himself he was a middleaged simplehearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california among the woods and mountains a good many years and had studied the ways of his only neighbors the beasts and the birds until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made this was jim baker according to jim baker some animals have only a limited education and some use only simple words and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure whereas certain other animals have a large vocabulary a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery consequently these latter talk a great deal they like it they are so conscious of their talent and they enjoy showing off baker said that after long and careful observation he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts said he  theres more to a bluejay than any other creature he has got more moods and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures and mind you whatever a bluejay feels he can put into language and no mere commonplace language either but rattling outandout booktalkand bristling with metaphor toojust bristling and as for command of languagewhy you never see a bluejay get stuck for a word no man ever did they just boil out of him and another thing ive noticed a good deal and theres no bird or cow or anything that uses as good grammar as a bluejay you may say a cat uses good grammar well a cat doesbut you let a cat get excited once you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed nights and youll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw ignorant people think its the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating but it aint so its the sickening grammar they use now ive never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom and when they do they are as ashamed as a human they shut right down and leave   you may call a jay a bird well so he is in a measurebut hes got feathers on him and dont belong to no church perhaps but otherwise he is just as much human as you be and ill tell you for why a jays gifts and instincts and feelings and interests cover the whole ground a jay hasnt got any more principle than a congressman a jay will lie a jay will steal a jay will deceive a jay will betray and four times out of five a jay will go back on his solemnest promise the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you cant cram into no bluejays head now on top of all this theres another thing a jay can outswear any gentleman in the mines you think a cat can swear well a cat can but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reservepowers and where is your cat dont talk to mei know too much about this thing in the one little particular of scoldingjust good clean outandout scoldinga bluejay can lay over anything human or divine yes sir a jay is everything that a man is a jay can cry a jay can laugh a jay can feel shame a jay can reason and plan and discuss a jay likes gossip and scandal a jay has got a sense of humor a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you domaybe better if a jay aint human he better take in his sign thats all now im going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays     chapter iii  bakers bluejay yarn  what stumped the blue jays   when i first begun to understand jay language correctly there was a little incident happened here seven years ago the last man in this region but me moved away there stands his housebeen empty ever since a log house with a plank roofjust one big room and no more no ceilingnothing between the rafters and the floor well one sunday morning i was sitting out here in front of my cabin with my cat taking the sun and looking at the blue hills and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees and thinking of the home away yonder in the states that i hadnt heard from in thirteen years when a bluejay lit on that house with an acorn in his mouth and says hello i reckon ive struck something when he spoke the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof of course but he didnt care his mind was all on the thing he had struck it was a knothole in the roof he cocked his head to one side shut one eye and put the other one to the hole like a possum looking down a jug then he glanced up with his bright eyes gave a wink or two with his wingswhich signifies gratification you understandand says it looks like a hole its located like a holeblamed if i dont believe it is a hole  then he cocked his head down and took another look he glances up perfectly joyful this time winks his wings and his tail both and says oh no this aint no fat thing i reckon if i aint in luck why its a perfectly elegant hole so he flew down and got that acorn and fetched it up and dropped it in and was just tilting his head back with the heavenliest smile on his face when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath offn a razor and the queerest look of surprise took its place then he says why i didnt hear it fall he cocked his eye at the hole again and took a long look raised up and shook his head stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side shook his head again he studied a while then he just went into the detailswalked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass no use now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute and finally says well its too many for me thats certain must be a mighty long hole however i aint got no time to fool around here i got to tend to business i reckon its all rightchance it anyway  so he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it but he was too late he held his eye there as much as a minute then he raised up and sighed and says confound it i dont seem to understand this thing no way however ill tackle her again he fetched another acorn and done his level best to see what become of it but he couldnt he says well i never struck no such a hole as this before im of the opinion its a totally new kind of a hole then he begun to get mad he held in for a spell walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself but his feelings got the upper hand of him presently and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face i never see a bird take on so about a little thing when he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute then he says well youre a long hole and a deep hole and a mighty singular hole altogetherbut ive started in to fill you and im damned if i dont fill you if it takes a hundred years   and with that away he went you never see a bird work so since you was born he laid into his work like a nigger and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles i ever struck he never stopped to take a look anymorehe just hove em in and went for more well at last he could hardly flop his wings he was so tuckered out he comes adropping down once more sweating like an icepitcher dropped his acorn in and says now i guess ive got the bulge on you by this time so he bent down for a look if youll believe me when his head come up again he was just pale with rage he says ive shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years and if i can see a sign of one of em i wish i may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes  he just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind i see in a second that what i had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments as you may say  another jay was going by and heard him doing his devotions and stops to inquire what was up the sufferer told him the whole circumstance and says now yonders the hole and if you dont believe me go and look for yourself so this fellow went and looked and comes back and says how many did you say you put in there not any less than two tons says the sufferer the other jay went and looked again he couldnt seem to make it out so he raised a yell and three more jays come they all examined the hole they all made the sufferer tell it over again then they all discussed it and got off as many leatherheaded opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done  they called in more jays then more and more till pretty soon this whole region peared to have a blue flush about it there must have been five thousand of them and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing you never heard every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckleheaded opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him they examined the house all over too the door was standing half open and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in of course that knocked the mystery galleywest in a second there lay the acorns scattered all over the floor he flopped his wings and raised a whoop come here he says come here everybody hangd if this fool hasnt been trying to fill up a house with acorns they all came aswooping down like a blue cloud and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter and the next jay took his place and done the same  well sir they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour and guffawed over that thing like human beings it aint any use to tell me a bluejay hasnt got a sense of humor because i know better and memory too they brought jays here from all over the united states to look down that hole every summer for three years other birds too and they could all see the point except an owl that come from nova scotia to visit the yo semite and he took this thing in on his way back he said he couldnt see anything funny in it but then he was a good deal disappointed about yo semite too     chapter iv  student life  the laborious beer king   the summer semester was in full tide consequently the most frequent figure in and about heidelberg was the student most of the students were germans of course but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous they hailed from every corner of the globefor instruction is cheap in heidelberg and so is living too the angloamerican club composed of british and american students had twentyfive members and there was still much material left to draw from  ninetenths of the heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform the other tenth wore caps of various colors and belonged to social organizations called corps there were five corps each with a color of its own there were white caps blue caps and red yellow and green ones the famous duelfighting is confined to the corps boys the kneip seems to be a specialty of theirs too kneips are held now and then to celebrate great occasions like the election of a beer king for instance the solemnity is simple the five corps assemble at night and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer out of pintmugs as fast as possible and each man keeps his own countusually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties   the election is soon decided when the candidates can hold no more a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king i was told that the last beer king elected by the corpsor by his own capabilitiesemptied his mug seventyfive times no stomach could hold all that quantity at one time of coursebut there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum which those who have been much at sea will understand  one sees so many students abroad at all hours that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any workinghours some of them have some of them havent each can choose for himself whether he will work or play for german university life is a very free life it seems to have no restraints the student does not live in the college buildings but hires his own lodgings in any locality he prefers and he takes his meals when and where he pleases he goes to bed when it suits him and does not get up at all unless he wants to he is not entered at the university for any particular length of time so he is likely to change about he passes no examinations upon entering college he merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars receives a card entitling him to the privileges of the university and that is the end of it he is now ready for businessor play as he shall prefer if he elects to work he finds a large list of lectures to choose from he selects the subjects which he will study and enters his name for these studies but he can skip attendance   the result of this system is that lecturecourses upon specialties of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences while those upon more practical and everyday matters of education are delivered to very large ones i heard of one case where day after day the lecturers audience consisted of three studentsand always the same three but one day two of them remained away the lecturer began as usual  gentlemen then without a smile he corrected himself saying  sir and went on with his discourse  it is said that the vast majority of the heidelberg students are hard workers and make the most of their opportunities that they have no surplus means to spend in dissipation and no time to spare for frolicking one lecture follows right on the heels of another with very little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot the professors assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their little boxedup pulpits when the hours strike and as promptly out again when the hour finishes i entered an empty lectureroom one day just before the clock struck the place had simple unpainted pine desks and benches for about two hundred persons   about a minute before the clock struck a hundred and fifty students swarmed in rushed to their seats immediately spread open their notebooks and dipped their pens in ink when the clock began to strike a burly professor entered was received with a round of applause moved swiftly down the center aisle said gentlemen and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps and by the time he had arrived in his box and faced his audience his lecture was well under way and all the pens were going he had no notes he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hourthen the students began to remind him in certain wellunderstood ways that his time was up he seized his hat still talking proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor everybody rose respectfully and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared an instant rush for some other lectureroom followed and in a minute i was alone with the empty benches once more   yes without doubt idle students are not the rule out of eight hundred in the town i knew the faces of only about fifty but these i saw everywhere and daily they walked about the streets and the wooded hills they drove in cabs they boated on the river they sipped beer and coffee afternoons in the schloss gardens a good many of them wore colored caps of the corps they were finely and fashionably dressed their manners were quite superb and they led an easy careless comfortable life if a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted they all rose to their feet and took off their caps the members of a corps always received a fellowmember in this way too but they paid no attention to members of other corps they did not seem to see them this was not a discourtesy it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps etiquette  there seems to be no chilly distance existing between the german students and the professor but on the contrary a companionable intercourse the opposite of chilliness and reserve when the professor enters a beerhall in the evening where students are gathered together these rise up and take off their caps and invite the old gentleman to sit with them and partake he accepts and the pleasant talk and the beer flow for an hour or two and by and by the professor properly charged and comfortable gives a cordial good night while the students stand bowing and uncovered and then he moves on his happy way homeward with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold nobody finds fault or feels outraged no harm has been done   it seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so too i mean a corps dogthe common property of the organization like the corps steward or head servant then there are other dogs owned by individuals  on a summer afternoon in the castle gardens i have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds in single file each carrying a bright chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string it was a very imposing spectacle sometimes there would be as many dogs around the pavilion as students and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness these dogs had a rather dry time of it for they were tied to the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except what they could get out of pawing at the gnats or trying to sleep and not succeeding however they got a lump of sugar occasionallythey were fond of that   it seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs but everybody else had them tooold men and young ones old women and nice young ladies if there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than another it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a string it is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love it seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties   it would be a mistake to suppose that the easygoing pleasureseeking student carries an empty head just the contrary he has spent nine years in the gymnasium under a system which allowed him no freedom but vigorously compelled him to work like a slave consequently he has left the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete that the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder specialties it is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium he not only has a comprehensive education but he knows what he knowsit is not befogged with uncertainty it is burnt into him so that it will stay for instance he does not merely read and write greek but speaks it the same with the latin foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium its rules are too severe they go to the university to put a mansard roof on their whole general education but the german student already has his mansard roof so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some specialty such as a particular branch of law or diseases of the eye or special study of the ancient gothic tongues so this german attends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch and drinks his beer and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day he has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty of the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly appreciates and as it cannot last forever he makes the most of it while it does last and so lays up a good rest against the day that must see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or professional life     chapter v  at the students duelingground  dueling by wholesale   one day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students duelingplace we crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards then turned to the left entered a narrow alley followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a twostory public house we were acquainted with its outside aspect for it was visible from the hotel we went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twentyfive high it was a welllighted place there was no carpet across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables and at these tables some fifty or seventyfive students 1 see appendix c were sitting  some of them were sipping wine others were playing cards others chess other groups were chatting together and many were smoking cigarettes while they waited for the coming duels nearly all of them wore colored caps there were white caps green caps blue caps red caps and brightyellow ones so all the five corps were present in strong force in the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight narrowbladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone   he understood his business for when a sword left his hand one could shave himself with it  it was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke with students whose caps differed in color from their own this did not mean hostility but only an armed neutrality it was considered that a person could strike harder in the duel and with a more earnest interest if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his antagonist therefore comradeship between the corps was not permitted at intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official intercourse with each other but nothing further for example when the regular duelingday of one of the corps approaches its president calls for volunteers from among the membership to offer battle three or more respondbut there must not be less than three the president lays their names before the other presidents with the request that they furnish antagonists for these challengers from among their corps this is promptly done it chanced that the present occasion was the battleday of the red cap corps they were the challengers and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them the students fight duels in the room which i have described two days in every week during seven and a half or eight months in every year this custom had continued in germany two hundred and fifty years  to return to my narrative a student in a white cap met us and introduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps and while we stood conversing two strangelooking figures were led in from another room they were students panoplied for the duel they were bareheaded their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through from chin to ankle they were padded thoroughly against injury their arms were bandaged and rebandaged layer upon layer until they looked like solid black logs these weird apparitions had been handsome youths clad in fashionable attire fifteen minutes before but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in nightmares they strode along with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies they did not hold them out themselves but fellowstudents walked beside them and gave the needed support  there was a rush for the vacant end of the room now and we followed and got good places the combatants were placed face to face each with several members of his own corps about him to assist two seconds well padded and with swords in their hands took their stations a student belonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good position to umpire the combat another student stood by with a watch and a memorandumbook to keep record of the time and the number and nature of the wounds a grayhaired surgeon was present with his lint his bandages and his instruments   after a moments pause the duelists saluted the umpire respectfully then one after another the several officials stepped forward gracefully removed their caps and saluted him also and returned to their places everything was ready now students stood crowded together in the foreground and others stood behind them on chairs and tables every face was turned toward the center of attraction  the combatants were watching each other with alert eyes a perfect stillness a breathless interest reigned i felt that i was going to see some wary work but not so the instant the word was given the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that i could not quite tell whether i saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully stirring and they were struck with such terrific force that i could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault presently in the midst of the swordflashes i saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victims head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away  the seconds cried halt and knocked up the combatants swords with their own the duelists sat down a student official stepped forward examined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or twice the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the woundand revealed a crimson gash two or three inches long and proceeded to bind an oval piece of leather and a bunch of lint over it the tallykeeper stepped up and tallied one for the opposition in his book   then the duelists took position again a small stream of blood was flowing down the side of the injured mans head and over his shoulder and down his body to the floor but he did not seem to mind this the word was given and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before once more the blows rained and rattled and flashed every few moments the quickeyed seconds would notice that a sword was bentthen they called halt struck up the contending weapons and an assisting student straightened the bent one  the wonderful turmoil went onpresently a bright spark sprung from a blade and that blade broken in several pieces sent one of its fragments flying to the ceiling a new sword was provided and the fight proceeded the exercise was tremendous of course and in time the fighters began to show great fatigue they were allowed to rest a moment every little while they got other rests by wounding each other for then they could sit down while the doctor applied the lint and bandages the law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if the men can hold out and as the pauses do not count this duel was protracted to twenty or thirty minutes i judged at last it was decided that the men were too much wearied to do battle longer they were led away drenched with crimson from head to foot that was a good fight but it could not count partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen minutes of actual fighting and partly because neither man was disabled by his wound it was a drawn battle and corps law requires that drawn battles shall be refought as soon as the adversaries are well of their hurts  during the conflict i had talked a little now and then with a young gentleman of the white cap corps and he had mentioned that he was to fight nextand had also pointed out his challenger a young gentleman who was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and restfully observing the duel then in progress  my acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of giving me a kind of personal interest in it i naturally wished he might win and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would not because although he was a notable swordsman the challenger was held to be his superior  the duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked the previous one i stood close by but could not tell which blows told and which did not they fell and vanished so like flashes of light they all seemed to tell the swords always bent over the opponents heads from the forehead back over the crown and seemed to touch all the way but it was not soa protecting blade invisible to me was always interposed between at the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve or fifteen blows and warded off twelve or fifteen and no harm done then a sword became disabled and a short rest followed whilst a new one was brought early in the next round the white corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it in the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head and the former had his underlip divided after that the white corps student gave many severe wounds but got none of the consequence in return at the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any addition to them might be dangerous these injuries were a fearful spectacle but are better left undescribed so against expectation my acquaintance was the victor     chapter vi  a sport that sometimes kills   the third duel was brief and bloody the surgeon stopped it when he saw that one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight longer without endangering his life  the fourth duel was a tremendous encounter but at the end of five or six minutes the surgeon interfered once more another man so severely hurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms i watched this engagement as i watched the otherswith rapt interest and strong excitement and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid open a cheek or a forehead and a conscious paling of my face when i occasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted my eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and vanquishing woundit was in his face and it carried away hisbut no matter i must not enter into details i had but a glance and then turned quickly but i would not have been looking at all if i had known what was coming no that is probably not true one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming but the interest and the excitement are so powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings and so under the fierce exhilaration of the clashing steel he would yield and look after all sometimes spectators of these duels faintand it does seem a very reasonable thing to do too  both parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the surgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an houra fact which is suggestive but this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by the assembled students it was past noon therefore they ordered their landlord downstairs to send up hot beefsteaks chickens and such things and these they ate sitting comfortable at the several tables whilst they chatted disputed and laughed the door to the surgeons room stood open meantime but the cutting sewing splicing and bandaging going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb anyones appetite i went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile but could not enjoy it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended the stir and turmoil and the music of the steel were wanting hereones nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle whilst the duels compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking  finally the doctor finished and the men who were to fight the closing battle of the day came forth a good many dinners were not completed yet but no matter they could be eaten cold after the battle therefore everybody crowded forth to see this was not a love duel but a satisfaction affair these two students had quarreled and were here to settle it they did not belong to any of the corps but they were furnished with weapons and armor and permitted to fight here by the five corps as a courtesy evidently these two young men were unfamiliar with the dueling ceremonies though they were not unfamiliar with the sword when they were placed in position they thought it was time to beginand then did begin too and with a most impetuous energy without waiting for anybody to give the word this vastly amused the spectators and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again at the word the deluge of blows began but before long the surgeon once more interferedfor the only reason which ever permits him to interfereand the days war was over it was now two in the afternoon and i had been present since half past nine in the morning the field of battle was indeed a red one by this time but some sawdust soon righted that there had been one duel before i arrived in it one of the men received many injuries while the other one escaped without a scratch  i had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction by the keen twoedged blades and yet had not seen a victim wince nor heard a moan or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting this was good fortitude indeed such endurance is to be expected in savages and prizefighters for they are born and educated to it but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise it was not merely under the excitement of the swordplay that this fortitude was shown it was shown in the surgeons room where an uninspiring quiet reigned and where there was no audience the doctors manipulations brought out neither grimaces nor moans and in the fights it was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same tremendous spirit after they were covered with streaming wounds which they had shown in the beginning  the world in general looks upon the college duels as very farcical affairs true but considering that the college duel is fought by boys that the swords are real swords and that the head and face are exposed it seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it people laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered up with armor that he cannot be hurt but it is not so his eyes and ears are protected but the rest of his face and head are bare he can not only be badly wounded but his life is in danger and he would sometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon it is not intended that his life shall be endangered fatal accidents are possible however for instance the students sword may break and the end of it fly up behind his antagonists ear and cut an artery which could not be reached if the sword remained whole this has happened sometimes and death has resulted on the spot formerly the students armpits were not protectedand at that time the swords were pointed whereas they are blunt now so an artery in the armpit was sometimes cut and death followed then in the days of sharppointed swords a spectator was an occasional victimthe end of a broken sword flew five or ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart and death ensued instantly the student duels in germany occasion two or three deaths every year now but this arises only from the carelessness of the wounded men they eat or drink imprudently or commit excesses in the way of overexertion inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that it cannot be arrested indeed there is blood and pain and danger enough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of respect  all the customs all the laws all the details pertaining to the student duel are quaint and naive the grave precise and courtly ceremony with which the thing is conducted invests it with a sort of antique charm  this dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament not the prizefight the laws are as curious as they are strict for instance the duelist may step forward from the line he is placed upon if he chooses but never back of it if he steps back of it or even leans back it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an advantage so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace it would seem natural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously and against ones will and intentyet this unconsciousness is not allowed again if under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a grimace he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows his corps are ashamed of him they call him hare foot which is the german equivalent for chickenhearted     chapter vii  how bismark fought   in addition to the corps laws there are some corps usages which have the force of laws  perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who is no longer an exemptthat is a freshmanhas remained a sophomore some little time without volunteering to fight some day the president instead of calling for volunteers will appoint this sophomore to measure swords with a student of another corps he is free to declineeverybody says sothere is no compulsion this is all truebut i have not heard of any student who did decline to decline and still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous and properly so since he knew when he joined that his main business as a member would be to fight no there is no law against decliningexcept the law of custom which is confessedly stronger than written law everywhere   the ten men whose duels i had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed as i had supposed they would but came back one after another as soon as they were free of the surgeon and mingled with the assemblage in the duelingroom the whitecap student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three and talked with us during the intermissions he could not talk very well because his opponents sword had cut his underlip in two and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches neither could he eat easily still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome luncheon while the last duel was preparing the man who was the worst hurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement a good part of his face was covered with patches and bandages and all the rest of his head was covered and concealed by them   it is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other public places in this kind of array and that this predilection often keeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public gardens of heidelberg it is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face because the scars they leave will show so well there and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible it does not look reasonable but it is roundly asserted and maintained nevertheless i am sure of one thingscars are plenty enough in germany among the young men and very grim ones they are too they crisscross the face in angry red welts and are permanent and ineffaceable   some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect and the effect is striking when several such accent the milder ones which form a city map on a mans face they suggest the burned district then we had often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts it transpired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision was reachedduels in which he either whipped or was whippedfor drawn battles do not count 1 after a student has received his ribbon he is free he can cease from fighting without reproachexcept some one insult him his president cannot appoint him to fight he can volunteer if he wants to or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so statistics show that he does not prefer to remain quiescent they show that the duel has a singular fascination about it somewhere for these free men so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge are always volunteering a corps student told me it was of record that prince bismarck fought thirtytwo of these duels in a single summer term when he was in college so he fought twentynine after his badge had given him the right to retire from the field  1 from my diarydined in a hotel a few miles up the neckar in a room whose walls were hung all over with framed portraitgroups of the five corps some were recent but many antedated photography and were pictured in lithographythe dates ranged back to forty or fifty years ago nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast in one portraitgroup representing as each of these pictures did an entire corps i took pains to count the ribbons there were twentyseven members and twentyone of them wore that significant badge  the statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars two days in every week are devoted to dueling the rule is rigid that there must be three duels on each of these days there are generally more but there cannot be fewer there were six the day i was present sometimes there are seven or eight it is insisted that eight duels a weekfour for each of the two daysis too low an average to draw a calculation from but i will reckon from that basis preferring an understatement to an overstatement of the case this requires about four hundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a yearfor in summer the college term is about three and a half months and in winter it is four months and sometimes longer of the seven hundred and fifty students in the university at the time i am writing of only eighty belonged to the five corps and it is only these corps that do the dueling occasionally other students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps in order to settle a quarrel but this does not happen every duelingday 2 consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred and fifty duels a year this average gives six fights a year to each of the eighty this large work could not be accomplished if the badgeholders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer  2 they have to borrow the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise as i understand it the public authorities all over germany allow the five corps to keep swords but do not allow them to use them this is law is rigid it is only the execution of it that is lax  of course where there is so much fighting the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil one often sees them at the tables in the castle grounds using their whips or canes to illustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about and between the duels on the day whose history i have been writing the swords were not always idle every now and then we heard a succession of the keen hissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its paces in the air and this informed us that a student was practicing necessarily this unceasing attention to the art develops an expert occasionally he becomes famous in his own university his renown spreads to other universities he is invited to goettingen to fight with a goettingen expert if he is victorious he will be invited to other colleges or those colleges will send their experts to him americans and englishmen often join one or another of the five corps a year or two ago the principal heidelberg expert was a big kentuckian he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory behind him all about germany but at last a little student in strasburg defeated him there was formerly a student in heidelberg who had picked up somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead of cleaving down from above while the trick lasted he won in sixteen successive duels in his university but by that time observers had discovered what his charm was and how to break it therefore his championship ceased  a rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different corps is strict in the duelinghouse in the parks on the street and anywhere and everywhere that the students go caps of a color group themselves together if all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one and that one had two redcap students at it and ten vacant places the yellowcaps the bluecaps the white caps and the green caps seeking seats would go by that table and not seem to see it nor seem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds the student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the duelingplace wore the white capprussian corps he introduced us to many white caps but to none of another color the corps etiquette extended even to us who were strangers and required us to group with the white corps only and speak only with the white corps while we were their guests and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors once i wished to examine some of the swords but an american student said it would not be quite polite these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue they will bring in some with white hilts presently and those you can handle freely when a sword was broken in the first duel i wanted a piece of it but its hilt was the wrong color so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season   it was brought to me after the room was cleared and i will now make a lifesize sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen to show the width of the weapon figure 1 the length of these swords is about three feet and they are quite heavy ones disposition to cheer during the course of the duels or at their close was naturally strong but corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort however brilliant a contest or a victory might be no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved a dignified gravity and repression were maintained at all times  when the dueling was finished and we were ready to go the gentlemen of the prussian corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps in the courteous german way and also shook hands their brethren of the same order took off their caps and bowed but without shaking hands the gentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated white capsthey fell apart apparently unconsciously and left us an unobstructed pathway but did not seem to see us or know we were there if we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps the white caps without meaning any offense would have observed the etiquette of their order and ignored our presence  how strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life i had not been home a full halfhour after witnessing those playful shamduels when circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real onea duel with no effeminate limitation in the matter of results but a battle to the death an account of it in the next chapter will show the reader that duels between boys for fun and duels between men in earnest are very different affairs      a tramp abroad part 2  by mark twain  samuel l clemens  first published in 1880  illustrations taken from an 1880 first edition

by certain smart people it is in reality one of the most dangerous institutions of our day since it is always fought in the open air the combatants are nearly sure to catch cold m paul de cassagnac the most inveterate of the french duelists had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a confirmed invalid and the best physician in paris has expressed the opinion that if he goes on dueling for fifteen or twenty years moreunless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where damps and draughts cannot intrudehe will eventually endanger his life this ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn in maintaining that the french duel is the most healthgiving of recreations because of the openair exercise it affords and it ought also to moderate that foolish talk about french duelists and socialisthated monarchs being the only people who are immoral  but it is time to get at my subject as soon as i heard of the late fiery outbreak between m gambetta and m fourtou in the french assembly i knew that trouble must follow i knew it because a long personal friendship with m gambetta revealed to me the desperate and implacable nature of the man vast as are his physical proportions i knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest frontiers of his person  i did not wait for him to call on me but went at once to him as i had expected i found the brave fellow steeped in a profound french calm i say french calm because french calmness and english calmness have points of difference   he was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture now and then staving chance fragments of it across the room with his foot grinding a constant grist of curses through his set teeth and halting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the pile which he had been building of it on the table  he threw his arms around my neck bent me over his stomach to his breast kissed me on both cheeks hugged me four or five times and then placed me in his own armchair as soon as i had got well again we began business at once  i said i supposed he would wish me to act as his second and he said of course i said i must be allowed to act under a french name so that i might be shielded from obloquy in my country in case of fatal results he winced here probably at the suggestion that dueling was not regarded with respect in america however he agreed to my requirement this accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports m gambettas second was apparently a frenchman   first we drew up my principals will i insisted upon this and stuck to my point i said i had never heard of a man in his right mind going out to fight a duel without first making his will he said he had never heard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind when he had finished the will he wished to proceed to a choice of his last words he wanted to know how the following words as a dying exclamation struck me  i die for my god for my country for freedom of speech for progress and the universal brotherhood of man  i objected that this would require too lingering a death it was a good speech for a consumptive but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor we wrangled over a good many antemortem outbursts but i finally got him to cut his obituary down to this which he copied into his memorandumbook purposing to get it by heart  i die that france might live  i said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy but he said relevancy was a matter of no consequence in last words what you wanted was thrill  the next thing in order was the choice of weapons my principal said he was not feeling well and would leave that and the other details of the proposed meeting to me therefore i wrote the following note and carried it to m fourtous friend  sir m gambetta accepts m fourtous challenge and authorizes me to propose plessispiquet as the place of meeting tomorrow morning at daybreak as the time and axes as the weapons  i am sir with great respect  mark twain  m fourtous friend read this note and shuddered then he turned to me and said with a suggestion of severity in his tone  have you considered sir what would be the inevitable result of such a meeting as this  well for instance what would it be  bloodshed  thats about the size of it i said now if it is a fair question what was your side proposing to shed  i had him there he saw he had made a blunder so he hastened to explain it away he said he had spoken jestingly then he added that he and his principal would enjoy axes and indeed prefer them but such weapons were barred by the french code and so i must change my proposal  i walked the floor turning the thing over in my mind and finally it occurred to me that gatlingguns at fifteen paces would be a likely way to get a verdict on the field of honor so i framed this idea into a proposition  but it was not accepted the code was in the way again i proposed rifles then doublebarreled shotguns then colts navy revolvers these being all rejected i reflected awhile and sarcastically suggested brickbats at threequarters of a mile i always hate to fool away a humorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor and it filled me with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last proposition to his principal  he came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea of brickbats at threequarters of a mile but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them then i said  well i am at the end of my string now perhaps you would be good enough to suggest a weapon perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time  his countenance brightened and he said with alacrity  oh without doubt monsieur   so he fell to hunting in his pocketspocket after pocket and he had plenty of themmuttering all the while now what could i have done with them  at last he was successful he fished out of his vest pocket a couple of little things which i carried to the light and ascertained to be pistols they were singlebarreled and silvermounted and very dainty and pretty i was not able to speak for emotion i silently hung one of them on my watchchain and returned the other my companion in crime now unrolled a postagestamp containing several cartridges and gave me one of them i asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were to be allowed but one shot apiece he replied that the french code permitted no more i then begged him to go and suggest a distance for my mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been put upon it he named sixtyfive yards i nearly lost my patience i said  sixtyfive yards with these instruments squirtguns would be deadlier at fifty consider my friend you and i are banded together to destroy life not make it eternal  but with all my persuasions all my arguments i was only able to get him to reduce the distance to thirtyfive yards and even this concession he made with reluctance and said with a sigh i wash my hands of this slaughter on your head be it  there was nothing for me but to go home to my old lionheart and tell my humiliating story when i entered m gambetta was laying his last lock of hair upon the altar he sprang toward me exclaiming  you have made the fatal arrangementsi see it in your eye  i have  his face paled a trifle and he leaned upon the table for support he breathed thick and heavily for a moment or two so tumultuous were his feelings then he hoarsely whispered  the weapon the weapon quick what is the weapon  this and i displayed that silvermounted thing he cast but one glance at it then swooned ponderously to the floor   when he came to he said mournfully  the unnatural calm to which i have subjected myself has told upon my nerves but away with weakness i will confront my fate like a man and a frenchman  he rose to his feet and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has never been approached by man and has seldom been surpassed by statues then he said in his deep bass tones  behold i am calm i am ready reveal to me the distance  thirtyfive yards    i could not lift him up of course but i rolled him over and poured water down his back he presently came to and said  thirtyfive yardswithout a rest but why ask since murder was that mans intention why should he palter with small details but mark you one thing in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of france meets death  after a long silence he asked  was nothing said about that mans family standing up with him as an offset to my bulk but no matter i would not stoop to make such a suggestion if he is not noble enough to suggest it himself he is welcome to this advantage which no honorable man would take  he now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection which lasted some minutes after which he broke silence with  the hourwhat is the hour fixed for the collision  dawn tomorrow  he seemed greatly surprised and immediately said  insanity i never heard of such a thing nobody is abroad at such an hour  that is the reason i named it do you mean to say you want an audience  it is no time to bandy words i am astonished that m fourtou should ever have agreed to so strange an innovation go at once and require a later hour  i ran downstairs threw open the front door and almost plunged into the arms of m fourtous second he said  i have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the hour chosen and begs you will consent to change it to half past nine  any courtesy sir which it is in our power to extend is at the service of your excellent principal we agree to the proposed change of time  i beg you to accept the thanks of my client then he turned to a person behind him and said you hear m noir the hour is altered to half past nine whereupon m noir bowed expressed his thanks and went away my accomplice continued  if agreeable to you your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the field in the same carriage as is customary  it is entirely agreeable to me and i am obliged to you for mentioning the surgeons for i am afraid i should not have thought of them how many shall i want i supposed two or three will be enough  two is the customary number for each party i refer to chief surgeons but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients it will be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting surgeons from among the highest in the profession these will come in their own private carriages have you engaged a hearse   bless my stupidity i never thought of it i will attend to it right away i must seem very ignorant to you but you must try to overlook that because i have never had any experience of such a swell duel as this before i have had a good deal to do with duels on the pacific coast but i see now that they were crude affairs a hearsesho we used to leave the elected lying around loose and let anybody cord them up and cart them off that wanted to have you anything further to suggest  nothing except that the head undertakers shall ride together as is usual the subordinates and mutes will go on foot as is also usual i will see you at eight oclock in the morning and we will then arrange the order of the procession i have the honor to bid you a good day  i returned to my client who said very well at what hour is the engagement to begin  half past nine  very good indeed have you sent the fact to the newspapers  sir if after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment deem me capable of so base a treachery  tut tut what words are these my dear friend have i wounded you ah forgive me i am overloading you with labor therefore go on with the other details and drop this one from your list the bloodyminded fourtou will be sure to attend to it or i myselfyes to make certain i will drop a note to my journalistic friend m noir  oh come to think of it you may save yourself the trouble that other second has informed m noir  hm i might have known it it is just like that fourtou who always wants to make a display   at half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of plessispiquet in the following order first came our carriagenobody in it but m gambetta and myself then a carriage containing m fourtou and his second then a carriage containing two poetorators who did not believe in god and these had ms funeral orations projecting from their breast pockets then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their cases of instruments then eight private carriages containing consulting surgeons then a hack containing a coroner then the two hearses then a carriage containing the head undertakers then a train of assistants and mutes on foot and after these came plodding through the fog a long procession of camp followers police and citizens generally it was a noble turnout and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner weather  there was no conversation i spoke several times to my principal but i judge he was not aware of it for he always referred to his notebook and muttered absently i die that france might live  arrived on the field my fellowsecond and i paced off the thirtyfive yards and then drew lots for choice of position this latter was but an ornamental ceremony for all the choices were alike in such weather these preliminaries being ended i went to my principal and asked him if he was ready he spread himself out to his full width and said in a stern voice ready let the batteries be charged  the loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted witnesses we considered it best to perform this delicate service with the assistance of a lantern on account of the state of the weather we now placed our men  at this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves together on the right and left of the field they therefore begged a delay while they should put these poor people in a place of safety  the request was granted  the police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind the duelists we were once more ready the weather growing still more opaque it was agreed between myself and the other second that before giving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable the combatants to ascertain each others whereabouts  i now returned to my principal and was distressed to observe that he had lost a good deal of his spirit i tried my best to hearten him i said indeed sir things are not as bad as they seem considering the character of the weapons the limited number of shots allowed the generous distance the impenetrable solidity of the fog and the added fact that one of the combatants is oneeyed and the other crosseyed and nearsighted it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be fatal there are chances that both of you may survive therefore cheer up do not be downhearted  this speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately stretched forth his hand and said i am myself again give me the weapon  i laid it all lonely and forlorn in the center of the vast solitude of his palm he gazed at it and shuddered and still mournfully contemplating it he murmured in a broken voice  alas it is not death i dread but mutilation  i heartened him once more and with such success that he presently said let the tragedy begin stand at my back do not desert me in this solemn hour my friend  i gave him my promise i now assisted him to point his pistol toward the spot where i judged his adversary to be standing and cautioned him to listen well and further guide himself by my fellowseconds whoop then i propped myself against m gambettas back and raised a rousing whoopee this was answered from out the far distances of the fog and i immediately shouted  onetwothreefire  two little sounds like spit spit broke upon my ear and in the same instant i was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh bruised as i was i was still able to catch a faint accent from above to this effect   i die for for  perdition take it what is it i die for  oh yesfrance i die that france may live  the surgeons swarmed around with their probes in their hands and applied their microscopes to the whole area of m gambettas person with the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound then a scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and inspiriting  the two gladiators fell upon each others neck with floods of proud and happy tears that other second embraced me the surgeons the orators the undertakers the police everybody embraced everybody congratulated everybody cried and the whole atmosphere was filled with praise and with joy unspeakable  it seems to me then that i would rather be a hero of a french duel than a crowned and sceptered monarch   when the commotion had somewhat subsided the body of surgeons held a consultation and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper care and nursing there was reason to believe that i would survive my injuries my internal hurts were deemed the most serious since it was apparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung and that many of my organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where they belonged that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform their functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities they then set my left arm in two places pulled my right hip into its socket again and reelevated my nose i was an object of great interest and even admiration and many sincere and warmhearted persons had themselves introduced to me and said they were proud to know the only man who had been hurt in a french duel in forty years  i was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession and thus with gratifying eclat i was marched into paris the most conspicuous figure in that great spectacle and deposited at the hospital   the cross of the legion of honor has been conferred upon me however few escape that distinction  such is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the age  i have no complaints to make against any one i acted for myself and i can stand the consequences  without boasting i think i may say i am not afraid to stand before a modern french duelist but as long as i keep in my right mind i will never consent to stand behind one again     chapter ix  what the beautiful maiden said   one day we took the train and went down to mannheim to see king lear played in german it was a mistake we sat in our seats three whole hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning and even that was reversed to suit german ideas for the thunder came first and the lightning followed after  the behavior of the audience was perfect there were no rustlings or whisperings or other little disturbances each act was listened to in silence and the applauding was done after the curtain was down the doors opened at half past four the play began promptly at half past five and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their seats and quiet reigned a german gentleman in the train had said that a shakespearian play was an appreciated treat in germany and that we should find the house filled it was true all the six tiers were filled and remained so to the endwhich suggested that it is not only balcony people who like shakespeare in germany but those of the pit and gallery too  another time we went to mannheim and attended a shivareeotherwise an operathe one called lohengrin the banging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond belief the racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time that i had my teeth fixed   there were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the four hours to the end and i stayed but the recollection of that long dragging relentless season of suffering is indestructible to have to endure it in silence and sitting still made it all the harder i was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers of the two sexes and this compelled repression yet at times the pain was so exquisite that i could hardly keep the tears back   at those times as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the singers and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher and wilder and wilder and fiercer and fiercer i could have cried if i had been alone those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being gradually skinned but they would have marveled at it here and made remarks about it no doubt whereas there was nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being skinned   there was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act and i could have gone out and rested during that time but i could not trust myself to do it for i felt that i should desert to stay out there was another wait of half an hour toward nine oclock but i had gone through so much by that time that i had no spirit left and so had no desire but to be let alone   i do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me for indeed they were not whether it was that they naturally liked that noise or whether it was that they had learned to like it by getting used to it i did not at the time know but they did like itthis was plain enough while it was going on they sat and looked as rapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs and whenever the curtain fell they rose to their feet in one solid mighty multitude and the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs and hurricanes of applause swept the place this was not comprehensible to me of course there were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning this showed that the people liked it  it was a curious sort of a play in the manner of costumes and scenery it was fine and showy enough but there was not much action that is to say there was not much really done it was only talked about and always violently it was what one might call a narrative play everybody had a narrative and a grievance and none were reasonable about it but all in an offensive and ungovernable state there was little of that sort of customary thing where the tenor and the soprano stand down by the footlights warbling with blended voices and keep holding out their arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both hands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a pressureno it was every rioter for himself and no blending each sang his indictive narrative in turn accompanied by the whole orchestra of sixty instruments and when this had continued for some time and one was hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise a great chorus composed entirely of maniacs would suddenly break forth and then during two minutes and sometimes three i lived over again all that i suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down   we only had one brief little season of heaven and heavens sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction of the other place this was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around in the third act and sang the wedding chorus to my untutored ear that was musicalmost divine music while my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds it seemed to me that i could almost resuffer the torments which had gone before in order to be so healed again there is where the deep ingenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed it deals so largely in pain that its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts a pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere else i suppose just as an honest man in politics shines more than he would elsewhere  i have since found out that there is nothing the germans like so much as an opera they like it not in a mild and moderate way but with their whole hearts this is a legitimate result of habit and education our nation will like the opera too by and by no doubt one in fifty of those who attend our operas likes it already perhaps but i think a good many of the other fortynine go in order to learn to like it and the rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it the latter usually hum the airs while they are being sung so that their neighbors may perceive that they have been to operas before the funerals of these do not occur often enough   a gentle oldmaidish person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat right in front of us that night at the mannheim opera these people talked between the acts and i understood them though i understood nothing that was uttered on the distant stage at first they were guarded in their talk but after they had heard my agent and me conversing in english they dropped their reserve and i picked up many of their little confidences no i mean many of her little confidencesmeaning the elder partyfor the young girl only listened and gave assenting nods but never said a word how pretty she was and how sweet she was i wished she would speak but evidently she was absorbed in her own thoughts her own younggirl dreams and found a dearer pleasure in silence but she was not dreaming sleepy dreamsno she was awake alive alert she could not sit still a moment she was an enchanting study her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung to her round young figure like a fishs skin and it was rippled over with the gracefulest little fringy films of lace she had deep tender eyes with long curved lashes and she had peachy cheeks and a dimpled chin and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth and she was so dovelike so pure and so gracious so sweet and so bewitching for long hours i did mightily wish she would speak and at last she did the red lips parted and out leaps her thoughtand with such a guileless and pretty enthusiasm too auntie i just know ive got five hundred fleas on me  that was probably over the average yes it must have been very much over the average the average at that time in the grand duchy of baden was fortyfive to a young person when alone according to the official estimate of the home secretary for that year the average for older people was shifty and indeterminable for whenever a wholesome young girl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their average and raised her own she became a sort of contributionbox   this dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there unconsciously taking up a collection many a skinny old being in our neighborhood was the happier and the restfuler for her coming  in that large audience that night there were eight very conspicuous people these were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on what a blessed thing it would be if a lady could make herself conspicuous in our theaters by wearing her hat   it is not usual in europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets hats overcoats canes or umbrellas into the auditorium but in mannheim this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely made up of people from a distance and among these were always a few timid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to get their things when the play was over they would miss their train but the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk and took the chances preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good manners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a stretch of three or four hours     chapter x  how wagner operas bang along   three or four hours that is a long time to sit in one place whether one be conspicuous or not yet some of wagners operas bang along for six whole hours on a stretch but the people sit there and enjoy it all and wish it would last longer a german lady in munich told me that a person could not like wagners music at first but must go through the deliberate process of learning to like itthen he would have his sure reward for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and never be able to get enough of it she said that six hours of wagner was by no means too much she said that this composer had made a complete revolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one and she said that wagners operas differed from all others in one notable respect and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here and there but were all music from the first strain to the last this surprised me i said i had attended one of his insurrections and found hardly any music in it except the wedding chorus she said lohengrin was noisier than wagners other operas but that if i would keep on going to see it i would find by and by that it was all music and therefore would then enjoy it i could have said but would you advise a person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit of his stomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to enjoy it but i reserved that remark  this lady was full of the praises of the headtenor who had performed in a wagner opera the night before and went on to enlarge upon his old and prodigious fame and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the princely houses of germany here was another surprise i had attended that very opera in the person of my agent and had made close and accurate observations so i said  why madam my experience warrants me in stating that that tenors voice is not a voice at all but only a shriekthe shriek of a hyena   that is very true she said he cannot sing now it is already many years that he has lost his voice but in other times he sang yes divinely so whenever he comes now you shall see yes that the theater will not hold the people jawohl bei gott his voice is wunderschoen in that past time  i said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the germans which was worth emulating i said that over the water we were not quite so generous that with us when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper had lost his legs these parties ceased to draw i said i had been to the opera in hanover once and in mannheim once and in munich through my authorized agent once and this large experience had nearly persuaded me that the germans preferred singers who couldnt sing this was not such a very extravagant speech either for that burly mannheim tenors praises had been the talk of all heidelberg for a week before his performance took placeyet his voice was like the distressing noise which a nail makes when you screech it across a windowpane i said so to heidelberg friends the next day and they said in the calmest and simplest way that that was very true but that in earlier times his voice had been wonderfully fine and the tenor in hanover was just another example of this sort the englishspeaking german gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that tenor he said  ach gott a great man you shall see him he is so celebrate in all germanyand he has a pension yes from the government he not obliged to sing now only twice every year but if he not sing twice each year they take him his pension away  very well we went when the renowned old tenor appeared i got a nudge and an excited whisper  now you see him  but the celebrate was an astonishing disappointment to me if he had been behind a screen i should have supposed they were performing a surgical operation on him i looked at my friendto my great surprise he seemed intoxicated with pleasure his eyes were dancing with eager delight when the curtain at last fell he burst into the stormiest applause and kept it upas did the whole houseuntil the afflictive tenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow while the glowing enthusiast was swabbing the perspiration from his face i said  i dont mean the least harm but really now do you think he can sing  him no gott im himmel aber how he has been able to sing twentyfive years ago then pensively ach no now he not sing any more he only cry when he think he sing now he not sing at all no he only make like a cat which is unwell   where and how did we get the idea that the germans are a stolid phlegmatic race in truth they are widely removed from that they are warmhearted emotional impulsive enthusiastic their tears come at the mildest touch and it is not hard to move them to laughter they are the very children of impulse we are cold and selfcontained compared to the germans they hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing and where we use one loving petting expression they pour out a score their language is full of endearing diminutives nothing that they love escapes the application of a petting diminutiveneither the house nor the dog nor the horse nor the grandmother nor any other creature animate or inanimate  in the theaters at hanover hamburg and mannheim they had a wise custom the moment the curtain went up the light in the body of the house went down the audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight which greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage it saved gas too and people were not sweated to death  when i saw king lear played nobody was allowed to see a scene shifted if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the way and expose a temple beyond one did not see that forest split itself in the middle and go shrieking away with the accompanying disenchanting spectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulseno the curtain was always dropped for an instantone heard not the least movement behind itbut when it went up the next instant the forest was gone even when the stage was being entirely reset one heard no noise during the whole time that king lear was playing the curtain was never down two minutes at any one time the orchestra played until the curtain was ready to go up for the first time then they departed for the evening where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is no occasion for music i had never seen this twominute business between acts but once before and that was when the shaughraun was played at wallacks  i was at a concert in munich one night the people were streaming in the clockhand pointed to seven the music struck up and instantly all movement in the body of the house ceasednobody was standing or walking up the aisles or fumbling with a seat the stream of incomers had suddenly dried up at its source i listened undisturbed to a piece of music that was fifteen minutes longalways expecting some tardy ticketholders to come crowding past my knees and being continuously and pleasantly disappointedbut when the last note was struck here came the stream again you see they had made those late comers wait in the comfortable waitingparlor from the time the music had begun until it was ended   it was the first time i had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the privilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters some of these were pretty fine birds but no matter they had to tarry outside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of liveried footmen and waitingmaids who supported the two walls with their backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and mistresses on their arms  we had no footmen to hold our things and it was not permissible to take them into the concertroom but there were some men and women to take charge of them for us they gave us checks for them and charged a fixed price payable in advancefive cents  in germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet been heard in america perhapsi mean the closing strain of a fine solo or duet we always smash into it with an earthquake of applause the result is that we rob ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat we get the whiskey but we dont get the sugar in the bottom of the glass  our way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be better than the mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended i do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion before a cold still audience i should think he would feel foolish it is a pain to me to this day to remember how that old german lear raged and wept and howled around the stage with never a response from that hushed house never a single outburst till the act was ended to me there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead silences that always followed this old persons tremendous outpourings of his feelings i could not help putting myself in his placei thought i knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences because i remembered a case which came under my observation once and whichbut i will tell the incident  one evening on board a mississippi steamboat a boy of ten years lay asleep in a bertha long slimlegged boy he was encased in quite a short shirt it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a steamboat and so he was troubled and scared and had gone to bed with his head filled with impending snaggings and explosions and conflagrations and sudden death about ten oclock some twenty ladies were sitting around about the ladies saloon quietly reading sewing embroidering and so on and among them sat a sweet benignant old dame with round spectacles on her nose and her busy knittingneedles in her hands now all of a sudden into the midst of this peaceful scene burst that slimshanked boy in the brief shirt wildeyed erecthaired and shouting fire fire jump and run the boats afire and there aint a minute to lose all those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled nobody stirred the old lady pulled her spectacles down looked over them and said gently  but you mustnt catch cold child run and put on your breastpin and then come and tell us all about it  it was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devils gushing vehemence he was expecting to be a sort of herothe creator of a wild panicand here everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile and an old woman made fun of his bugbear i turned and crept awayfor i was that boyand never even cared to discover whether i had dreamed the fire or actually seen it   i am told that in a german concert or opera they hardly ever encore a song that though they may be dying to hear it again their good breeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition  kings may encore that is quite another matter it delights everybody to see that the king is pleased and as to the actor encored his pride and gratification are simply boundless still there are circumstances in which even a royal encore  but it is better to illustrate the king of bavaria is a poet and has a poets eccentricitieswith the advantage over all other poets of being able to gratify them no matter what form they may take he is fond of opera but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience therefore it has sometimes occurred in munich that when an opera has been concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery a command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again presently the king would arrive solitary and alone and the players would begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with only that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience once he took an odd freak into his head high up and out of sight over the prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of interlacing waterpipes so pierced that in case of fire innumerable little threadlike streams of water can be caused to descend and in case of need this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood american managers might want to make a note of that the king was sole audience the opera proceeded it was a piece with a storm in it the mimic thunder began to mutter the mimic wind began to wail and sough and the mimic rain to patter the kings interest rose higher and higher it developed into enthusiasm he cried out  it is very very good indeed but i will have real rain turn on the water  the manager pleaded for a reversal of the command said it would ruin the costly scenery and the splendid costumes but the king cried  no matter no matter i will have real rain turn on the water  so the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances to the mimic flowerbeds and gravel walks of the stage the richly dressed actresses and actors tripped about singing bravely and pretending not to mind it the king was delightedhis enthusiasm grew higher he cried out  bravo bravo more thunder more lightning turn on more rain   the thunder boomed the lightning glared the stormwinds raged the deluge poured down the mimic royalty on the stage with their soaked satins clinging to their bodies slopped about ankledeep in water warbling their sweetest and best the fiddlers under the eaves of the stage sawed away for dear life with the cold overflow spouting down the backs of their necks and the dry and happy king sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding  more yet cried the king more yetlet loose all the thunder turn on all the water i will hang the man that raises an umbrella  when this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been produced in any theater was at last over the kings approbation was measureless he cried  magnificent magnificent encore do it again  but the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore and said the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented in the mere fact that the encore was desired by his majesty without fatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity  during the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose parts required changes of dress the others were a soaked bedraggled and uncomfortable lot but in the last degree picturesque the stage scenery was ruined trapdoors were so swollen that they wouldnt work for a week afterward the fine costumes were spoiled and no end of minor damages were done by that remarkable storm  it was a royal ideathat stormand royally carried out but observe the moderation of the king he did not insist upon his encore if he had been a gladsome unreflecting american operaaudience he probably would have had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those people     chapter xi  i paint a turner   the summer days passed pleasantly in heidelberg we had a skilled trainer and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the right condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours we were well satisfied with the progress which we had made in the german language 1 see appendix d for information concerning this fearful tongue and more than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art we had had the best instructors in drawing and painting in germanyhaemmerling vogel mueller dietz and schumann haemmerling taught us landscapepainting vogel taught us figuredrawing mueller taught us to do stilllife and dietz and schumann gave us a finishing course in two specialtiesbattlepieces and shipwrecks whatever i am in art i owe to these men i have something of the manner of each and all of them but they all said that i had also a manner of my own and that it was conspicuous they said there was a marked individuality about my styleinsomuch that if i ever painted the commonest type of a dog i should be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which would keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist secretly i wanted to believe all these kind sayings but i could not i was afraid that my masters partiality for me and pride in me biased their judgment so i resolved to make a test privately and unknown to any one i painted my great picture heidelberg castle illuminatedmy first really important work in oilsand had it hung up in the midst of a wilderness of oilpictures in the art exhibition with no name attached to it to my great gratification it was instantly recognized as mine all the town flocked to see it and people even came from neighboring localities to visit it it made more stir than any other work in the exhibition but the most gratifying thing of all was that chance strangers passing through who had not heard of my picture were not only drawn to it as by a lodestone the moment they entered the gallery but always took it for a turner   apparently nobody had ever done that there were ruined castles on the overhanging cliffs and crags all the way these were said to have their legends like those on the rhine and what was better still they had never been in print there was nothing in the books about that lovely region it had been neglected by the tourist it was virgin soil for the literary pioneer  meantime the knapsacks the rough walkingsuits and the stout walkingshoes which we had ordered were finished and brought to us a mr x and a young mr z had agreed to go with us we went around one evening and bade goodby to our friends and afterward had a little farewell banquet at the hotel we got to bed early for we wanted to make an early start so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning  we were out of bed at break of day feeling fresh and vigorous and took a hearty breakfast then plunged down through the leafy arcades of the castle grounds toward the town what a glorious summer morning it was and how the flowers did pour out their fragrance and how the birds did sing it was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains   we were all dressed alike broad slouch hats to keep the sun off gray knapsacks blue army shirts blue overalls leathern gaiters buttoned tight from knee down to ankle highquarter coarse shoes snugly laced each man had an operaglass a canteen and a guidebook case slung over his shoulder and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a sunumbrella in the other around our hats were wound many folds of soft white muslin with the ends hanging and flapping down our backsan idea brought from the orient and used by tourists all over europe harris carried the little watchlike machine called a pedometer whose office is to keep count of a mans steps and tell how far he has walked everybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty pleasant march to you   when we got downtown i found that we could go by rail to within five miles of heilbronn the train was just starting so we jumped aboard and went tearing away in splendid spirits it was agreed all around that we had done wisely because it would be just as enjoyable to walk down the neckar as up it and it could not be needful to walk both ways there were some nice german people in our compartment i got to talking some pretty private matters presently and harris became nervous so he nudged me and said  speak in germanthese germans may understand english  i did so it was well i did for it turned out that there was not a german in that party who did not understand english perfectly it is curious how widespread our language is in germany after a while some of those folks got out and a german gentleman and his two young daughters got in i spoke in german of one of the latter several times but without result finally she said  ich verstehe nur deutch und englisheor words to that effect that is i dont understand any language but german and english  and sure enough not only she but her father and sister spoke english so after that we had all the talk we wanted and we wanted a good deal for they were agreeable people they were greatly interested in our customs especially the alpenstocks for they had not seen any before they said that the neckar road was perfectly level so we must be going to switzerland or some other rugged country and asked us if we did not find the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather but we said no  we reached wimpfeni think it was wimpfenin about three hours and got out not the least tired found a good hotel and ordered beer and dinnerthen took a stroll through the venerable old village it was very picturesque and tumbledown and dirty and interesting it had queer houses five hundred years old in it and a military tower 115 feet high which had stood there more than ten centuries i made a little sketch of it i kept a copy but gave the original to the burgomaster   i think the original was better than the copy because it had more windows in it and the grass stood up better and had a brisker look there was none around the tower though i composed the grass myself from studies i made in a field by heidelberg in haemmerlings time the man on top looking at the view is apparently too large but i found he could not be made smaller conveniently i wanted him there and i wanted him visible so i thought out a way to manage it i composed the picture from two points of view the spectator is to observe the man from bout where that flag is and he must observe the tower itself from the ground this harmonizes the seeming discrepancy figure 2  near an old cathedral under a shed were three crosses of stonemoldy and damaged things bearing lifesize stone figures the two thieves were dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the sixteenth century while the saviour was nude with the exception of a cloth around the loins  we had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel and overlooking the neckar then after a smoke we went to bed we had a refreshing nap then got up about three in the afternoon and put on our panoply as we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town we overtook a peasants cart partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages and similar vegetable rubbish and drawn by a small cow and a smaller donkey yoked together it was a pretty slow concern but it got us into heilbronn before darkfive miles or possibly it was seven   we stopped at the very same inn which the famous old robberknight and rough fighter goetz von berlichingen abode in after he got out of captivity in the square tower of heilbronn between three hundred and fifty and four hundred years ago harris and i occupied the same room which he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the walls yet the furniture was quaint old carved stuff full four hundred years old and some of the smells were over a thousand there was a hook in the wall which the landlord said the terrific old goetz used to hang his iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed this room was very largeit might be called immenseand it was on the first floor which means it was in the second story for in europe the houses are so high that they do not count the first story else they would get tired climbing before they got to the top the wallpaper was a fiery red with huge gold figures in it well smirched by time and it covered all the doors these doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the paper so unbrokenly that when they were closed one had to go feeling and searching along the wall to find them there was a stove in the cornerone of those tall square stately white porcelain things that looks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to be enjoying your travels the windows looked out on a little alley and over that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of some tenementhouses there were the customary two beds in the room one in one end the other in the other about an oldfashioned brassmounted singlebarreled pistolshot apart they were fully as narrow as the usual german bed too and had the german beds ineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you forgot yourself and went to sleep  a round table as large as king arthurs stood in the center of the room while the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we all went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal buildings     chapter xii  what the wives saved   the rathhaus or municipal building is of the quaintest and most picturesque middleage architecture it has a massive portico and steps before it heavily balustraded and adorned with lifesized rusty iron knights in complete armor the clockface on the front of the building is very large and of curious pattern ordinarily a gilded angel strikes the hour on a big bell with a hammer as the striking ceases a lifesized figure of time raises its hourglass and turns it two golden rams advance and butt each other a gilded cock lifts its wings but the main features are two great angels who stand on each side of the dial with long horns at their lips it was said that they blew melodious blasts on these horns every hourbut they did not do it for us we were told later that they blew only at night when the town was still  within the rathhaus were a number of huge wild boars heads preserved and mounted on brackets along the wall they bore inscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it was done one room in the building was devoted to the preservation of ancient archives there they showed us no end of aged documents some were signed by popes some by tilly and other great generals and one was a letter written and subscribed by goetz von berlichingen in heilbronn in 1519 just after his release from the square tower   this fine old robberknight was a devoutly and sincerely religious man hospitable charitable to the poor fearless in fight active enterprising and possessed of a large and generous nature he had in him a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries and being able to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly trounced the authors of them he was prompt to take up any poor devils quarrel and risk his neck to right him the common folk held him dear and his memory is still green in ballad and tradition he used to go on the highway and rob rich wayfarers and other times he would swoop down from his high castle on the hills of the neckar and capture passing cargoes of merchandise in his memoirs he piously thanks the giver of all good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such cargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have relieved him he was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle in an assault upon a stronghold in bavaria when he was only twentythree years old his right hand was shot away but he was so interested in the fight that he did not observe it for a while he said that the iron hand which was made for him afterward and which he wore for more than half a century was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been i was glad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old german robin hood though i was not able to read it he was a better artist with his sword than with his pen  we went down by the river and saw the square tower it was a very venerable structure very strong and very ornamental there was no opening near the ground they had to use a ladder to get into it no doubt  we visited the principal church alsoa curious old structure with a towerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images the inner walls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old heilbronn worthies of two or three centuries ago and also bearing rudely painted effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer costumes of those days the head of the family sat in the foreground and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons facing him sat his wife and beyond her extended a low row of diminishing daughters the family was usually large but the perspective bad  then we hired the hack and the horse which goetz von berlichingen used to use and drove several miles into the country to visit the place called weibertreuwifes fidelity i suppose it means it was a feudal castle of the middle ages when we reached its neighborhood we found it was beautifully situated but on top of a mound or hill round and tolerably steep and about two hundred feet high therefore as the sun was blazing hot we did not climb up there but took the place on trust and observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a fence and rested the place has no interest except that which is lent it by its legend which is a very pretty oneto this effect  the legend  in the middle ages a couple of young dukes brothers took opposite sides in one of the wars the one fighting for the emperor the other against him one of them owned the castle and village on top of the mound which i have been speaking of and in his absence his brother came with his knights and soldiers and began a siege it was a long and tedious business for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense but at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work more fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy they by and by surrendered and begged for charitable terms but the beleaguering prince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he said he would spare none but the women and childrenall men should be put to the sword without exception and all their goods destroyed then the women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their husbands  no said the prince not a man of them shall escape alive you yourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless banishment but that you may not starve i grant you this one grace that each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most valuable property as she is able to carry  very well presently the gates swung open and out filed those women carrying their husbands on their shoulders the besiegers furious at the trick rushed forward to slaughter the men but the duke stepped between and said  no put up your swordsa princes word is inviolable  when we got back to the hotel king arthurs round table was ready for us in its white drapery and the head waiter and his first assistant in swallowtails and white cravats brought in the soup and the hot plates at once  mr x had ordered the dinner and when the wine came on he picked up a bottle glanced at the label and then turned to the grave the melancholy the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of wine he had asked for the head waiter picked up the bottle cast his undertakereye on it and said  it is true i beg pardon then he turned on his subordinate and calmly said bring another label   at the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it aside it had been newly put on its paste was still wet when the new label came he put it on our french wine being now turned into german wine according to desire the head waiter went blandly about his other duties as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy thing to him  mr x said he had not known before that there were people honest enough to do this miracle in public but he was aware that thousands upon thousands of labels were imported into america from europe every year to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and inexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might require  we took a turn around the town after dinner and found it fully as interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime the streets were narrow and roughly paved and there was not a sidewalk or a streetlamp anywhere the dwellings were centuries old and vast enough for hotels they widened all the way up the stories projected further and further forward and aside as they ascended and the long rows of lighted windows filled with little bits of panes curtained with figured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers made a pretty effect   the moon was bright and the light and shadow very strong and nothing could be more picturesque than those curving streets with their rows of huge high gables leaning far over toward each other in a friendly gossiping way and the crowds below drifting through the alternating blots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight nearly everybody was abroad chatting singing romping or massed in lazy comfortable attitudes in the doorways  in one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a thick rusty chain which sagged from post to post in a succession of low swings the pavement here was made of heavy blocks of stone in the glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on those chains and having a noisy good time they were not the first ones who have done that even their greatgreatgrandfathers had not been the first to do it when they were children the strokes of the bare feet had worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags it had taken many generations of swinging children to accomplish that   everywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity and evidence of it but i do not know that anything else gave us so vivid a sense of the old age of heilbronn as those footworn grooves in the pavingstones     chapter xiii  my long crawl in the dark   when we got back to the hotel i wound and set the pedometer and put it in my pocket for i was to carry it next day and keep record of the miles we made the work which we had given the instrument to do during the day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly  we were in bed by ten for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp homeward with the dawn i hung fire but harris went to sleep at once i hate a man who goes to sleep at once there is a sort of indefinable something about it which is not exactly an insult and yet is an insolence and one which is hard to bear too i lay there fretting over this injury and trying to go to sleep but the harder i tried the wider awake i grew i got to feeling very lonely in the dark with no company but an undigested dinner my mind got a start by and by and began to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been thought of but it never went further than the beginning it was touch and go it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed at the end of an hour my head was in a perfect whirl and i was dead tired fagged out  the fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head against the nervous excitement while imagining myself wide awake i would really doze into momentary unconsciousness and come suddenly out of it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apartthe delusion of the instant being that i was tumbling backward over a precipice after i had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus found out that one half of my brain had been asleep eight or nine times without the wideawake hardworking other half suspecting it the periodical unconsciousnesses began to extend their spell gradually over more of my brainterritory and at last i sank into a drowse which grew deeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a solid blessed dreamless stupor whenwhat was that  my dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a receptive attitude now out of an immense a limitless distance came a something which grew and grew and approached and presently was recognizable as a soundit had rather seemed to be a feeling before this sound was a mile away nowperhaps it was the murmur of a storm and now it was nearernot a quarter of a mile away was it the muffled rasping and grinding of distant machinery no it came still nearer was it the measured tramp of a marching troop but it came nearer still and still nearerand at last it was right in the room it was merely a mouse gnawing the woodwork so i had held my breath all that time for such a trifle   well what was done could not be helped i would go to sleep at once and make up the lost time that was a thoughtless thought without intending ithardly knowing iti fell to listening intently to that sound and even unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouses nutmeggrater presently i was deriving exquisite suffering from this employment yet maybe i could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to his work but he did not do that he stopped every now and then and i suffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than i did while he was gnawing along at first i was mentally offering a reward of fivesixseventendollars for that mouse but toward the last i was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means i closereefed my earsthat is to say i bent the flaps of them down and furled them into five or six folds and pressed them against the hearingorificebut it did no good the faculty was so sharpened by nervous excitement that it was become a microphone and could hear through the overlays without trouble  my anger grew to a frenzy i finally did what all persons before me have done clear back to adamresolved to throw something i reached down and got my walkingshoes then sat up in bed and listened in order to exactly locate the noise but i couldnt do it it was as unlocatable as a crickets noise and where one thinks that that is is always the very place where it isnt so i presently hurled a shoe at random and with a vicious vigor it struck the wall over harriss head and fell down on him i had not imagined i could throw so far it woke harris and i was glad of it until i found he was not angry then i was sorry he soon went to sleep again which pleased me but straightway the mouse began again which roused my temper once more i did not want to wake harris a second time but the gnawing continued until i was compelled to throw the other shoe   this time i broke a mirrorthere were two in the roomi got the largest one of course harris woke again but did not complain and i was sorrier than ever i resolved that i would suffer all possible torture before i would disturb him a third time  the mouse eventually retired and by and by i was sinking to sleep when a clock began to strike i counted till it was done and was about to drowse again when another clock began i counted then the two great rathhaus clock angels began to send forth soft rich melodious blasts from their long trumpets i had never heard anything that was so lovely or weird or mysteriousbut when they got to blowing the quarterhours they seemed to me to be overdoing the thing every time i dropped off for the moment a new noise woke me each time i woke i missed my coverlet and had to reach down to the floor and get it again  at last all sleepiness forsook me i recognized the fact that i was hopelessly and permanently wide awake wide awake and feverish and thirsty when i had lain tossing there as long as i could endure it it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain and smoke and reflect there until the remnant of the night was gone  i believed i could dress in the dark without waking harris i had banished my shoes after the mouse but my slippers would do for a summer night so i rose softly and gradually got on everythingdown to one sock i couldnt seem to get on the track of that sock any way i could fix it but i had to have it so i went down on my hands and knees with one slipper on and the other in my hand and began to paw gently around and rake the floor but with no success i enlarged my circle and went on pawing and raking with every pressure of my knee how the floor creaked and every time i chanced to rake against any article it seemed to give out thirtyfive or thirtysix times more noise than it would have done in the daytime in those cases i always stopped and held my breath till i was sure harris had not awakenedthen i crept along again i moved on and on but i could not find the sock i could not seem to find anything but furniture i could not remember that there was much furniture in the room when i went to bed but the place was alive with it now especially chairschairs everywherehad a couple of families moved in in the mean time and i never could seem to glance on one of those chairs but always struck it full and square with my head my temper rose by steady and sure degrees and as i pawed on and on i fell to making vicious comments under my breath   finally with a venomous access of irritation i said i would leave without the sock so i rose up and made straight for the dooras i supposedand suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken mirror it startled the breath out of me for an instant it also showed me that i was lost and had no sort of idea where i was when i realized this i was so angry that i had to sit down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of opinion if there had been only one mirror it might possibly have helped to locate me but there were two and two were as bad as a thousand besides these were on opposite sides of the room i could see the dim blur of the windows but in my turnedaround condition they were exactly where they ought not to be and so they only confused me instead of helping me  i started to get up and knocked down an umbrella it made a noise like a pistolshot when it struck that hard slick carpetless floor i grated my teeth and held my breathharris did not stir i set the umbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall but as soon as i took my hand away its heel slipped from under it and down it came again with another bang i shrunk together and listened a moment in silent furyno harm done everything quiet with the most painstaking care and nicety i stood the umbrella up once more took my hand away and down it came again  i have been strictly reared but if it had not been so dark and solemn and awful there in that lonely vast room i do believe i should have said something then which could not be put into a sundayschool book without injuring the sale of it if my reasoning powers had not been already sapped dry by my harassments i would have known better than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy german floors in the dark it cant be done in the daytime without four failures to one success i had one comfort thoughharris was yet still and silenthe had not stirred  the umbrella could not locate methere were four standing around the room and all alike i thought i would feel along the wall and find the door in that way i rose up and began this operation but raked down a picture it was not a large one but it made noise enough for a panorama harris gave out no sound but i felt that if i experimented any further with the pictures i should be sure to wake him better give up trying to get out yes i would find king arthurs round table once morei had already found it several timesand use it for a base of departure on an exploring tour for my bed if i could find my bed i could then find my water pitcher i would quench my raging thirst and turn in so i started on my hands and knees because i could go faster that way and with more confidence too and not knock down things by and by i found the tablewith my headrubbed the bruise a little then rose up and started with hands abroad and fingers spread to balance myself i found a chair then a wall then another chair then a sofa then an alpenstock then another sofa this confounded me for i had thought there was only one sofa i hunted up the table again and took a fresh start found some more chairs  it occurred to me now as it ought to have done before that as the table was round it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from so i moved off once more and at random among the wilderness of chairs and sofaswandering off into unfamiliar regions and presently knocked a candlestick and knocked off a lamp grabbed at the lamp and knocked off a water pitcher with a rattling crash and thought to myself ive found you at lasti judged i was close upon you harris shouted murder and thieves and finished with im absolutely drowned  the crash had roused the house mr x pranced in in his long nightgarment with a candle young z after him with another candle a procession swept in at another door with candles and lanternslandlord and two german guests in their nightgowns and a chambermaid in hers  i looked around i was at harriss bed a sabbathdays journey from my own there was only one sofa it was against the wall there was only one chair where a body could get at iti had been revolving around it like a planet and colliding with it like a comet half the night   i explained how i had been employing myself and why then the landlords party left and the rest of us set about our preparations for breakfast for the dawn was ready to break i glanced furtively at my pedometer and found i had made 47 miles but i did not care for i had come out for a pedestrian tour anyway     chapter xiv  rafting down the neckar   when the landlord learned that i and my agents were artists our party rose perceptibly in his esteem we rose still higher when he learned that we were making a pedestrian tour of europe  he told us all about the heidelberg road and which were the best places to avoid and which the best ones to tarry at he charged me less than cost for the things i broke in the night he put up a fine luncheon for us and added to it a quantity of great lightgreen plums the pleasantest fruit in germany he was so anxious to do us honor that he would not allow us to walk out of heilbronn but called up goetz von berlichingens horse and cab and made us ride  i made a sketch of the turnout it is not a work it is only what artists call a studya thing to make a finished picture from this sketch has several blemishes in it for instance the wagon is not traveling as fast as the horse is this is wrong again the person trying to get out of the way is too small he is out of perspective as we say the two upper lines are not the horses back they are the reigns there seems to be a wheel missingthis would be corrected in a finished work of course this thing flying out behind is not a flag it is a curtain that other thing up there is the sun but i didnt get enough distance on it i do not remember now what that thing is that is in front of the man who is running but i think it is a haystack or a woman this study was exhibited in the paris salon of 1879 but did not take any medal they do not give medals for studies   we discharged the carriage at the bridge the river was full of logslong slender barkless pine logsand we leaned on the rails of the bridge and watched the men put them together into rafts these rafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and extreme narrowness of the neckar they were from fifty to one hundred yards long and they gradually tapered from a ninelog breadth at their sterns to a threelog breadth at their bowends the main part of the steering is done at the bow with a pole the threelog breadth there furnishes room for only the steersman for these little logs are not larger around than an average young ladys waist the connections of the several sections of the raft are slack and pliant so that the raft may be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the river  the neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog across it if he has one when it is also sharply curved in such places the raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns the river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bedwhich is as much as thirty and sometimes forty yards widebut is split into three equal bodies of water by stone dikes which throw the main volume depth and current into the central one in low water these neat narrowedged dikes project four or five inches above the surface like the comb of a submerged roof but in high water they are overflowed a hatful of rain makes high water in the neckar and a basketful produces an overflow  there are dikes abreast the schloss hotel and the current is violently swift at that point i used to sit for hours in my glass cage watching the long narrow rafts slip along through the central channel grazing the rightbank dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the stone bridge below i watched them in this way and lost all this time hoping to see one of them hit the bridgepier and wreck itself sometime or other but was always disappointed one was smashed there one morning but i had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe so i lost it  while i was looking down upon the rafts that morning in heilbronn the daredevil spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me and i said to my comrades  i am going to heidelberg on a raft will you venture with me  their faces paled a little but they assented with as good a grace as they could harris wanted to cable his motherthought it his duty to do that as he was all she had in this worldso while he attended to this i went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain with a hearty ahoy shipmate which put us upon pleasant terms at once and we entered upon business i said we were on a pedestrian tour to heidelberg and would like to take passage with him i said this partly through young z who spoke german very well and partly through mr x who spoke it peculiarly i can understand german as well as the maniac that invented it but i talk it best through an interpreter  the captain hitched up his trousers then shifted his quid thoughtfully presently he said just what i was expecting he would saythat he had no license to carry passengers and therefore was afraid the law would be after him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened so i chartered the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities on myself   with a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove the cable short then got the anchor home and our bark moved off with a stately stride and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour  our party were grouped amidships at first the talk was a little gloomy and ran mainly upon the shortness of life the uncertainty of it the perils which beset it and the need and wisdom of being always prepared for the worst this shaded off into lowvoiced references to the dangers of the deep and kindred matters but as the gray east began to redden and the mysterious solemnity and silence of the dawn to give place to the joysongs of the birds the talk took a cheerier tone and our spirits began to rise steadily  germany in the summer is the perfection of the beautiful but nobody has understood and realized and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of this soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the neckar on a raft the motion of a raft is the needful motion it is gentle and gliding and smooth and noiseless it calms down all feverish activities it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience under its restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that harass the mind vanish away and existence becomes a dream a charm a deep and tranquil ecstasy how it contrasts with hot and perspiring pedestrianism and dusty and deafening railroad rush and tedious jolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads  we went slipping silently along between the green and fragrant banks with a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew and grew all the time sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind sometimes we had noble hills on one hand clothed densely with foliage to their tops and on the other hand open levels blazing with poppies or clothed in the rich blue of the cornflower sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests and sometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass fresh and green and bright a tireless charm to the eye and the birdsthey were everywhere they swept back and forth across the river constantly and their jubilant music was never stilled  it was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new morning and gradually patiently lovingly clothe it on with splendor after splendor and glory after glory till the miracle was complete how different is this marvel observed from a raft from what it is when one observes it through the dingy windows of a railwaystation in some wretched village while he munches a petrified sandwich and waits for the train      a tramp abroad part 3  by

at work in the dewy fields by this time the people often stepped aboard the raft as we glided along the grassy shores and gossiped with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or so then stepped ashore again refreshed by the ride  only the men did this the women were too busy the women do all kinds of work on the continent they dig they hoe they reap they sow they bear monstrous burdens on their backs they shove similar ones long distances on wheelbarrows they drag the cart when there is no dog or lean cow to drag itand when there is they assist the dog or cow age is no matterthe older the woman the stronger she is apparently on the farm a womans duties are not definedshe does a little of everything but in the towns it is different there she only does certain things the men do the rest for instance a hotel chambermaid has nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms bring towels and candles and fetch several tons of water up several flights of stairs a hundred pounds at a time in prodigious metal pitchers she does not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day and she can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and closets when she is tired and needs a rest  as the morning advanced and the weather grew hot we took off our outside clothing and sat in a row along the edge of the raft and enjoyed the scenery with our sunumbrellas over our heads and our legs dangling in the water   every now and then we plunged in and had a swim every projecting grassy cape had its joyous group of naked children the boys to themselves and the girls to themselves the latter usually in care of some motherly dame who sat in the shade of a tree with her knitting the little boys swam out to us sometimes but the little maids stood kneedeep in the water and stopped their splashing and frolicking to inspect the raft with their innocent eyes as it drifted by once we turned a corner suddenly and surprised a slender girl of twelve years or upward just stepping into the water she had not time to run but she did what answered just as well she promptly drew a lithe young willow bough athwart her white body with one hand and then contemplated us with a simple and untroubled interest thus she stood while we glided by she was a pretty creature and she and her willow bough made a very pretty picture and one which could not offend the modesty of the most fastidious spectator her white skin had a low bank of fresh green willows for background and effective contrastfor she stood against themand above and out of them projected the eager faces and white shoulders of two smaller girls   toward noon we heard the inspiriting cry  sail ho  where away shouted the captain  three points off the weather bow  we ran forward to see the vessel it proved to be a steamboatfor they had begun to run a steamer up the neckar for the first time in may she was a tug and one of a very peculiar build and aspect i had often watched her from the hotel and wondered how she propelled herself for apparently she had no propeller or paddles she came churning along now making a deal of noise of one kind or another and aggravating it every now and then by blowing a hoarse whistle she had nine keelboats hitched on behind and following after her in a long slender rank we met her in a narrow place between dikes and there was hardly room for us both in the cramped passage as she went grinding and groaning by we perceived the secret of her moving impulse she did not drive herself up the river with paddles or propeller she pulled herself by hauling on a great chain this chain is laid in the bed of the river and is only fastened at the two ends it is seventy miles long it comes in over the boats bow passes around a drum and is payed out astern she pulls on that chain and so drags herself up the river or down it she has neither bow or stern strictly speaking for she has a longbladed rudder on each end and she never turns around she uses both rudders all the time and they are powerful enough to enable her to turn to the right or the left and steer around curves in spite of the strong resistance of the chain i would not have believed that that impossible thing could be done but i saw it done and therefore i know that there is one impossible thing which can be done what miracle will man attempt next  we met many big keelboats on their way up using sails mule power and profanitya tedious and laborious business a wire rope led from the foretopmast to the file of mules on the towpath a hundred yards ahead and by dint of much banging and swearing and urging the detachment of drivers managed to get a speed of two or three miles an hour out of the mules against the stiff current the neckar has always been used as a canal and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals but now that this steamboat is able with a small crew and a bushel or so of coal to take nine keelboats farther up the river in one hour than thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two it is believed that the oldfashioned towing industry is on its deathbed a second steamboat began work in the neckar three months after the first one was put in service figure 4  at noon we stepped ashore and bought some bottled beer and got some chickens cooked while the raft waited then we immediately put to sea again and had our dinner while the beer was cold and the chickens hot there is no pleasanter place for such a meal than a raft that is gliding down the winding neckar past green meadows and wooded hills and slumbering villages and craggy heights graced with crumbling towers and battlements   in one place we saw a nicely dressed german gentleman without any spectacles before i could come to anchor he had got underway it was a great pity i so wanted to make a sketch of him the captain comforted me for my loss however by saying that the man was without any doubt a fraud who had spectacles but kept them in his pocket in order to make himself conspicuous  below hassmersheim we passed hornberg goetz von berlichingens old castle it stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface of the river it has high vineclad walls enclosing trees and a peaked tower about seventyfive feet high the steep hillside from the castle clear down to the waters edge is terraced and clothed thick with grape vines this is like farming a mansard roof all the steeps along that part of the river which furnish the proper exposure are given up to the grape that region is a great producer of rhine wines the germans are exceedingly fond of rhine wines they are put up in tall slender bottles and are considered a pleasant beverage one tells them from vinegar by the label  the hornberg hill is to be tunneled and the new railway will pass under the castle the cave of the specter two miles below hornberg castle is a cave in a low cliff which the captain of the raft said had once been occupied by a beautiful heiress of hornbergthe lady gertrudein the old times it was seven hundred years ago she had a number of rich and noble lovers and one poor and obscure one sir wendel lobenfeld with the native chuckleheadedness of the heroine of romance she preferred the poor and obscure lover   with the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance the von berlichingen of that day shut his daughter up in his donjon keep or his oubliette or his culverin or some such place and resolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from among her rich and noble lovers the latter visited her and persecuted her with their supplications but without effect for her heart was true to her poor despised crusader who was fighting in the holy land finally she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the rich lovers no longer so one stormy night she escaped and went down the river and hid herself in the cave on the other side her father ransacked the country for her but found not a trace of her as the days went by and still no tidings of her came his conscience began to torture him and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet living and would return he would oppose her no longer she might marry whom she would the months dragged on all hope forsook the old man he ceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures he devoted himself to pious works and longed for the deliverance of death  now just at midnight every night the lost heiress stood in the mouth of her cave arrayed in white robes and sang a little love ballad which her crusader had made for her she judged that if he came home alive the superstitious peasants would tell him about the ghost that sang in the cave and that as soon as they described the ballad he would know that none but he and she knew that song therefore he would suspect that she was alive and would come and find her as time went on the people of the region became sorely distressed about the specter of the haunted cave it was said that ill luck of one kind or another always overtook any one who had the misfortune to hear that song eventually every calamity that happened thereabouts was laid at the door of that music consequently no boatmen would consent to pass the cave at night the peasants shunned the place even in the daytime   but the faithful girl sang on night after night month after month and patiently waited her reward must come at last five years dragged by and still every night at midnight the plaintive tones floated out over the silent land while the distant boatmen and peasants thrust their fingers into their ears and shuddered out a prayer  and now came the crusader home bronzed and battlescarred but bringing a great and splendid fame to lay at the feet of his bride the old lord of hornberg received him as his son and wanted him to stay by him and be the comfort and blessing of his age but the tale of that young girls devotion to him and its pathetic consequences made a changed man of the knight he could not enjoy his wellearned rest he said his heart was broken he would give the remnant of his life to high deeds in the cause of humanity and so find a worthy death and a blessed reunion with the brave true heart whose love had more honored him than all his victories in war  when the people heard this resolve of his they came and told him there was a pitiless dragon in human disguise in the haunted cave a dread creature which no knight had yet been bold enough to face and begged him to rid the land of its desolating presence he said he would do it they told him about the song and when he asked what song it was they said the memory of it was gone for nobody had been hardy enough to listen to it for the past four years and more  toward midnight the crusader came floating down the river in a boat with his trusty crossbow in his hands he drifted silently through the dim reflections of the crags and trees with his intent eyes fixed upon the low cliff which he was approaching as he drew nearer he discerned the black mouth of the cave nowis that a white figure yes the plaintive song begins to well forth and float away over meadow and riverthe crossbow is slowly raised to position a steady aim is taken the bolt flies straight to the markthe figure sinks down still singing the knight takes the wool out of his ears and recognizes the old balladtoo late ah if he had only not put the wool in his ears   the crusader went away to the wars again and presently fell in battle fighting for the cross tradition says that during several centuries the spirit of the unfortunate girl sang nightly from the cave at midnight but the music carried no curse with it and although many listened for the mysterious sounds few were favored since only those could hear them who had never failed in a trust it is believed that the singing still continues but it is known that nobody has heard it during the present century     chapter xvi  an ancient legend of the rhine the lorelei   the last legend reminds one of the loreleia legend of the rhine there is a song called the lorelei  germany is rich in folksongs and the words and airs of several of them are peculiarly beautifulbut the lorelei is the peoples favorite i could not endure it at first but by and by it began to take hold of me and now there is no tune which i like so well  it is not possible that it is much known in america else i should have heard it there the fact that i never heard it there is evidence that there are others in my country who have fared likewise therefore for the sake of these i mean to print the words and music in this chapter and i will refresh the readers memory by printing the legend of the lorelei too i have it by me in the legends of the rhine done into english by the wildly gifted garnham bachelor of arts i print the legend partly to refresh my own memory too for i have never read it before the legend lore two syllables was a water nymph who used to sit on a high rock called the ley or lei pronounced like our word lie in the rhine and lure boatmen to destruction in a furious rapid which marred the channel at that spot she so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her wonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze up at her and so they presently drifted among the broken reefs and were lost  in those old old times the count bruno lived in a great castle near there with his son the count hermann a youth of twenty hermann had heard a great deal about the beautiful lore and had finally fallen very deeply in love with her without having seen her so he used to wander to the neighborhood of the lei evenings with his zither and express his longing in low singing as garnham says on one of these occasions suddenly there hovered around the top of the rock a brightness of unequaled clearness and color which in increasingly smaller circles thickened was the enchanting figure of the beautiful lore   an unintentional cry of joy escaped the youth he let his zither fall and with extended arms he called out the name of the enigmatical being who seemed to stoop lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly manner indeed if his ear did not deceive him she called his name with unutterable sweet whispers proper to love beside himself with delight the youth lost his senses and sank senseless to the earth  after that he was a changed person he went dreaming about thinking only of his fairy and caring for naught else in the world the old count saw with affliction this changement in his son whose cause he could not divine and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels but to no purpose then the old count used authority he commanded the youth to betake himself to the camp obedience was promised garnham says  it was on the evening before his departure as he wished still once to visit the lei and offer to the nymph of the rhine his sighs the tones of his zither and his songs he went in his boat this time accompanied by a faithful squire down the stream the moon shed her silvery light over the whole country the steep bank mountains appeared in the most fantastical shapes and the high oaks on either side bowed their branches on hermanns passing as soon as he approached the lei and was aware of the surfwaves his attendant was seized with an inexpressible anxiety and he begged permission to land but the knight swept the strings of his guitar and sang       once i saw thee in dark night      in supernatural beauty bright      of lightrays was the figure wove      to share its light lockedhair strove        thy garment color wavedove      by thy hand the sign of love      thy eyes sweet enchantment      raying to me oh enchantment        o wert thou but my sweetheart      how willingly thy love to part      with delight i should be bound      to thy rocky house in deep ground  that hermann should have gone to that place at all was not wise that he should have gone with such a song as that in his mouth was a most serious mistake the lorelei did not call his name in unutterable sweet whispers this time no that song naturally worked an instant and thorough changement in her and not only that but it stirred the bowels of the whole afflicted region around about therefor  scarcely had these tones sounded everywhere there began tumult and sound as if voices above and below the water on the lei rose flames the fairy stood above at that time and beckoned with her right hand clearly and urgently to the infatuated knight while with a staff in her left hand she called the waves to her service they began to mount heavenward the boat was upset mocking every exertion the waves rose to the gunwale and splitting on the hard stones the boat broke into pieces the youth sank into the depths but the squire was thrown on shore by a powerful wave   the bitterest things have been said about the lorelei during many centuries but surely her conduct upon this occasion entitles her to our respect one feels drawn tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her many crimes and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed her career  the fairy was never more seen but her enchanting tones have often been heard in the beautiful refreshing still nights of spring when the moon pours her silver light over the country the listening shipper hears from the rushing of the waves the echoing clang of a wonderfully charming voice which sings a song from the crystal castle and with sorrow and fear he thinks on the young count hermann seduced by the nymph  here is the music and the german words by heinrich heine this song has been a favorite in germany for forty years and will remain a favorite always maybe figure 5  i have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language and add no translation when i am the reader and the author considers me able to do the translating myself he pays me quite a nice complimentbut if he would do the translating for me i would try to get along without the compliment  if i were at home no doubt i could get a translation of this poem but i am abroad and cant therefore i will make a translation myself it may not be a good one for poetry is out of my line but it will serve my purposewhich is to give the ungerman young girl a jingle of words to hang the tune on until she can get hold of a good version made by some one who is a poet and knows how to convey a poetical thought from one language to another       the lorelei        i cannot divine what it meaneth      this haunting nameless pain      a tale of the bygone ages      keeps brooding through my brain        the faint air cools in the glooming      and peaceful flows the rhine      the thirsty summits are drinking      the sunsets flooding wine        the loveliest maiden is sitting      highthroned in yon blue air      her golden jewels are shining      she combs her golden hair        she combs with a comb that is golden      and sings a weird refrain      that steeps in a deadly enchantment      the listners ravished brain        the doomed in his drifting shallop      is tranced with the sad sweet tone      he sees not the yawning breakers      he sees but the maid alone        the pitiless billows engulf him      so perish sailor and bark      and this with her baleful singing      is the loreleis gruesome work  i have a translation by garnham bachelor of arts in the legends of the rhine but it would not answer the purpose i mentioned above because the measure is too nobly irregular it dont fit the tune snugly enough in places it hangs over at the ends too far and in other places one runs out of words before he gets to the end of a bar still garnhams translation has high merits and i am not dreaming of leaving it out of my book i believe this poet is wholly unknown in america and england i take peculiar pleasure in bringing him forward because i consider that i discovered him       the lorelei       translated by l w garnham ba       i do not know what it signifies      that i am so sorrowful      a fable of old times so terrifies      leaves my heart so thoughtful        the air is cool and it darkens      and calmly flows the rhine      the summit of the mountain hearkens      in evening sunshine line        the most beautiful maiden entrances      above wonderfully there      her beautiful golden attire glances      she combs her golden hair        with golden comb so lustrous      and thereby a song sings      it has a tone so wondrous      that powerful melody rings        the shipper in the little ship      it effects with woe sad might      he does not see the rocky slip      he only regards dreaded height        i believe the turbulent waves      swallow the last shipper and boat      she with her singing craves      all to visit hermagic moat  no translation could be closer he has got in all the facts and in their regular order too there is not a statistic wanting it is as succinct as an invoice that is what a translation ought to be it should exactly reflect the thought of the original you cant sing above wonderfully there because it simply wont go to the tune without damaging the singer but it is a most clingingly exact translation of dort oben wunderbarfits it like a blister mr garnhams reproduction has other meritsa hundred of thembut it is not necessary to point them out they will be detected  no one with a specialty can hope to have a monopoly of it even garnham has a rival mr x had a small pamphlet with him which he had bought while on a visit to munich it was entitled a catalogue of pictures in the old pinacotek and was written in a peculiar kind of english here are a few extracts  it is not permitted to make use of the work in

on     chapter xvii  why germans wear spectacles   a mile or two above eberbach we saw a peculiar ruin projecting above the foliage which clothed the peak of a high and very steep hill this ruin consisted of merely a couple of crumbling masses of masonry which bore a rude resemblance to human faces they leaned forward and touched foreheads and had the look of being absorbed in conversation this ruin had nothing very imposing or picturesque about it and there was no great deal of it yet it was called the spectacular ruin  legend of the spectacular ruin the captain of the raft who was as full of history as he could stick said that in the middle ages a most prodigious firebreathing dragon used to live in that region and made more trouble than a taxcollector he was as long as a railwaytrain and had the customary impenetrable green scales all over him his breath bred pestilence and conflagration and his appetite bred famine he ate men and cattle impartially and was exceedingly unpopular the german emperor of that day made the usual offer he would grant to the destroyer of the dragon any one solitary thing he might ask for for he had a surplusage of daughters and it was customary for dragonkillers to take a daughter for pay  so the most renowned knights came from the four corners of the earth and retired down the dragons throat one after the other a panic arose and spread heroes grew cautious the procession ceased the dragon became more destructive than ever the people lost all hope of succor and fled to the mountains for refuge  at last sir wissenschaft a poor and obscure knight out of a far country arrived to do battle with the monster a pitiable object he was with his armor hanging in rags about him and his strangeshaped knapsack strapped upon his back everybody turned up their noses at him and some openly jeered him but he was calm he simply inquired if the emperors offer was still in force the emperor said it wasbut charitably advised him to go and hunt hares and not endanger so precious a life as his in an attempt which had brought death to so many of the worlds most illustrious heroes   but this tramp only askedwere any of these heroes men of science this raised a laugh of course for science was despised in those days but the tramp was not in the least ruffled he said he might be a little in advance of his age but no matterscience would come to be honored some time or other he said he would march against the dragon in the morning out of compassion then a decent spear was offered him but he declined and said spears were useless to men of science they allowed him to sup in the servants hall and gave him a bed in the stables  when he started forth in the morning thousands were gathered to see the emperor said  do not be rash take a spear and leave off your knapsack  but the tramp said  it is not a knapsack and moved straight on  the dragon was waiting and ready he was breathing forth vast volumes of sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame the ragged knight stole warily to a good position then he unslung his cylindrical knapsackwhich was simply the common fireextinguisher known to modern timesand the first chance he got he turned on his hose and shot the dragon square in the center of his cavernous mouth out went the fires in an instant and the dragon curled up and died   this man had brought brains to his aid he had reared dragons from the egg in his laboratory he had watched over them like a mother and patiently studied them and experimented upon them while they grew thus he had found out that fire was the life principle of a dragon put out the dragons fires and it could make steam no longer and must die he could not put out a fire with a spear therefore he invented the extinguisher the dragon being dead the emperor fell on the heros neck and said  deliverer name your request at the same time beckoning out behind with his heel for a detachment of his daughters to form and advance but the tramp gave them no observance he simply said  my request is that upon me be conferred the monopoly of the manufacture and sale of spectacles in germany  the emperor sprang aside and exclaimed  this transcends all the impudence i ever heard a modest demand by my halidome why didnt you ask for the imperial revenues at once and be done with it  but the monarch had given his word and he kept it to everybodys surprise the unselfish monopolist immediately reduced the price of spectacles to such a degree that a great and crushing burden was removed from the nation the emperor to commemorate this generous act and to testify his appreciation of it issued a decree commanding everybody to buy this benefactors spectacles and wear them whether they needed them or not  so originated the widespread custom of wearing spectacles in germany and as a custom once established in these old lands is imperishable this one remains universal in the empire to this day such is the legend of the monopolists once stately and sumptuous castle now called the spectacular ruin  on the right bank two or three miles below the spectacular ruin we passed by a noble pile of castellated buildings overlooking the water from the crest of a lofty elevation a stretch of two hundred yards of the high front wall was heavily draped with ivy and out of the mass of buildings within rose three picturesque old towers the place was in fine order and was inhabited by a family of princely rank this castle had its legend too but i should not feel justified in repeating it because i doubted the truth of some of its minor details  along in this region a multitude of italian laborers were blasting away the frontage of the hills to make room for the new railway they were fifty or a hundred feet above the river as we turned a sharp corner they began to wave signals and shout warnings to us to look out for the explosions it was all very well to warn us but what could we do you cant back a raft upstream you cant hurry it downstream you cant scatter out to one side when you havent any room to speak of you wont take to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to be blasting there too your resources are limited you see there is simply nothing for it but to watch and pray  for some hours we had been making three and a half or four miles an hour and we were still making that we had been dancing right along until those men began to shout then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me that i had never seen a raft go so slowly when the first blast went off we raised our sunumbrellas and waited for the result no harm done none of the stones fell in the water another blast followed and another and another some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern of us   we ran that whole battery of nine blasts in a row and it was certainly one of the most exciting and uncomfortable weeks i ever spent either aship or ashore of course we frequently manned the poles and shoved earnestly for a second or so but every time one of those spurts of dust and debris shot aloft every man dropped his pole and looked up to get the bearings of his share of it it was very busy times along there for a while it appeared certain that we must perish but even that was not the bitterest thought no the abjectly unheroic nature of the deaththat was the stingthat and the bizarre wording of the resulting obituary shot with a rock on a raft there would be no poetry written about it none could be written about it example  not by wars shock or wars shaftshot with a rock on a raft  no poet who valued his reputation would touch such a theme as that i should be distinguished as the only distinguished dead who went down to the grave unsonneted in 1878  but we escaped and i have never regretted it the last blast was a peculiarly strong one and after the small rubbish was done raining around us and we were just going to shake hands over our deliverance a later and larger stone came down amongst our little group of pedestrians and wrecked an umbrella it did no other harm but we took to the water just the same  it seems that the heavy work in the quarries and the new railway gradings is done mainly by italians that was a revelation we have the notion in our country that italians never do heavy work at all but confine themselves to the lighter arts like organgrinding operatic singing and assassination we have blundered that is plain  all along the river near every village we saw little stationhouses for the future railway they were finished and waiting for the rails and business they were as trim and snug and pretty as they could be they were always of brick or stone they were of graceful shape they had vines and flowers about them already and around them the grass was bright and green and showed that it was carefully looked after they were a decoration to the beautiful landscape not an offense wherever one saw a pile of gravel or a pile of broken stone it was always heaped as trimly and exactly as a new grave or a stack of cannonballs nothing about those stations or along the railroad or the wagonroad was allowed to look shabby or be unornamental the keeping a country in such beautiful order as germany exhibits has a wise practical side to it too for it keeps thousands of people in work and bread who would otherwise be idle and mischievous  as the night shut down the captain wanted to tie up but i thought maybe we might make hirschhorn so we went on presently the sky became overcast and the captain came aft looking uneasy he cast his eye aloft then shook his head and said it was coming on to blow my party wanted to land at oncetherefore i wanted to go on the captain said we ought to shorten sail anyway out of common prudence consequently the larboard watch was ordered to lay in his pole it grew quite dark now and the wind began to rise it wailed through the swaying branches of the trees and swept our decks in fitful gusts things were taking on an ugly look the captain shouted to the steersman on the forward log  hows she landing  the answer came faint and hoarse from far forward  noreastandbynoreastbyeast halfeast sir  let her go off a point  ayeaye sir  what water have you got  shoal sir two foot large on the stabboard two and a half scant on the labboard  let her go off another point  ayeaye sir  forward men all of you lively now stand by to crowd her round the weather corner  ayeaye sir   then followed a wild running and trampling and hoarse shouting but the forms of the men were lost in the darkness and the sounds were distorted and confused by the roaring of the wind through the shinglebundles by this time the sea was running inches high and threatening every moment to engulf the frail bark now came the mate hurrying aft and said close to the captains ear in a low agitated voice  prepare for the worst sirwe have sprung a leak  heavens where  right aft the second row of logs  nothing but a miracle can save us dont let the men know or there will be a panic and mutiny lay her in shore and stand by to jump with the sternline the moment she touches gentlemen i must look to you to second my endeavors in this hour of peril you have hatsgo forward and bail for your lives  down swept another mighty blast of wind clothed in spray and thick darkness at such a moment as this came from away forward that most appalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea  man overboard  the captain shouted  hard aport never mind the man let him climb aboard or wade ashore  another cry came down the wind  breakers ahead  where away  not a logs length off her port forefoot  we had groped our slippery way forward and were now bailing with the frenzy of despair when we heard the mates terrified cry from far aft  stop that dashed bailing or we shall be aground  but this was immediately followed by the glad shout  land aboard the starboard transom  saved cried the captain jump ashore and take a turn around a tree and pass the bight aboard  the next moment we were all on shore weeping and embracing for joy while the rain poured down in torrents the captain said he had been a mariner for forty years on the neckar and in that time had seen storms to make a mans cheek blanch and his pulses stop but he had never never seen a storm that even approached this one how familiar that sounded for i have been at sea a good deal and have heard that remark from captains with a frequency accordingly   we framed in our minds the usual resolution of thanks and admiration and gratitude and took the first opportunity to vote it and put it in writing and present it to the captain with the customary speech we tramped through the darkness and the drenching summer rain full three miles and reached the naturalist tavern in the village of hirschhorn just an hour before midnight almost exhausted from hardship fatigue and terror i can never forget that night  the landlord was rich and therefore could afford to be crusty and disobliging he did not at all like being turned out of his warm bed to open his house for us but no matter his household got up and cooked a quick supper for us and we brewed a hot punch for ourselves to keep off consumption after supper and punch we had an hours soothing smoke while we fought the naval battle over again and voted the resolutions then we retired to exceedingly neat and pretty chambers upstairs that had clean comfortable beds in them with heirloom pillowcases most elaborately and tastefully embroidered by hand  such rooms and beds and embroidered linen are as frequent in german village inns as they are rare in ours our villages are superior to german villages in more merits excellences conveniences and privileges than i can enumerate but the hotels do not belong in the list  the naturalist tavern was not a meaningless name for all the halls and all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled with all sorts of birds and animals glasseyed ably stuffed and set up in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes the moment we were abed the rain cleared away and the moon came out i dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great white stuffed owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who thought he had met me before but could not make out for certain   but young z did not get off so easily he said that as he was sinking deliciously to sleep the moon lifted away the shadows and developed a huge cat on a bracket dead and stuffed but crouching with every muscle tense for a spring and with its glittering glass eyes aimed straight at him it made z uncomfortable he tried closing his own eyes but that did not answer for a natural instinct kept making him open them again to see if the cat was still getting ready to launch at himwhich she always was he tried turning his back but that was a failure he knew the sinister eyes were on him still so at last he had to get up after an hour or two of worry and experiment and set the cat out in the hall so he won that time     chapter xviii  the kindly courtesy of germans   in the morning we took breakfast in the garden under the trees in the delightful german summer fashion the air was filled with the fragrance of flowers and wild animals the living portion of the menagerie of the naturalist tavern was all about us there were great cages populous with fluttering and chattering foreign birds and other great cages and greater wire pens populous with quadrupeds both native and foreign there were some free creatures too and quite sociable ones they were white rabbits went loping about the place and occasionally came and sniffed at our shoes and shins a fawn with a red ribbon on its neck walked up and examined us fearlessly rare breeds of chickens and doves begged for crumbs and a poor old tailless raven hopped about with a humble shamefaced mein which said please do not notice my exposurethink how you would feel in my circumstances and be charitable if he was observed too much he would retire behind something and stay there until he judged the partys interest had found another object i never have seen another dumb creature that was so morbidly sensitive bayard taylor who could interpret the dim reasonings of animals and understood their moral natures better than most men would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget his troubles for a while but we have not his kindly art and so had to leave the raven to his griefs   after breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of hirschhorn and the ruined church near it there were some curious old basreliefs leaning against the inner walls of the churchsculptured lords of hirschhorn in complete armor and ladies of hirschhorn in the picturesque court costumes of the middle ages these things are suffering damage and passing to decay for the last hirschhorn has been dead two hundred years and there is nobody now who cares to preserve the family relics in the chancel was a twisted stone column and the captain told us a legend about it of course for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself but i do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the hero wrenched this column into its present screwshape with his hands just one single wrench all the rest of the legend was doubtful  but hirschhorn is best seen from a distance down the river then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop and the old battlemented stone wall stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye  we descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village it was a quarter well stocked with deformed leering unkempt and uncombed idiots who held out hands or caps and begged piteously the people of the quarter were not all idiots of course but all that begged seemed to be and were said to be  i was thinking of going by skiff to the next town necharsteinach so i ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire i suppose i must have spoken high germancourt germani intended it for that anywayso he did not understand me i turned and twisted my question around and about trying to strike that mans average but failed he could not make out what i wanted now mr x arrived faced this same man looked him in the eye and emptied this sentence on him in the most glib and confident way can man boat get here  the mariner promptly understood and promptly answered i can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence because by mere accident all the words in it except get have the same sound and the same meaning in german that they have in english but how he managed to understand mr xs next remark puzzled me i will insert it presently x turned away a moment and i asked the mariner if he could not find a board and so construct an additional seat i spoke in the purest german but i might as well have spoken in the purest choctaw for all the good it did the man tried his best to understand me he tried and kept on trying harder and harder until i saw it was really of no use and said  there dont strain yourselfit is of no consequence  then x turned to him and crisply said  machen sie a flat board  i wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling   we changed our mind about taking a boat so we did not have to go i have given mr xs two remarks just as he made them four of the five words in the first one were english and that they were also german was only accidental not intentional three out of the five words in the second remark were english and english only and the two german ones did not mean anything in particular in such a connection  x always spoke english to germans but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down according to german construction and sprinkle in a german word without any essential meaning to it here and there by way of flavor yet he always made himself understood he could make those dialectspeaking raftsmen understand him sometimes when even young z had failed with them and young z was a pretty good german scholar for one thing x always spoke with such confidenceperhaps that helped and possibly the raftsmens dialect was what is called plattdeutsch and so they found his english more familiar to their ears than another mans german quite indifferent students of german can read fritz reuters charming plattdeutch tales with some little facility because many of the words are english i suppose this is the tongue which our saxon ancestors carried to england with them by and by i will inquire of some other philologist  however in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all but only a crack between the logsa crack that belonged there and was not dangerous but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence and presently got to sea without accident as we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in germany and elsewhere  as i write now many months later i perceive that each of us by observing and noting and inquiring diligently and day by day had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation but this is not surprising it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country for example i had the idea once in heidelberg to find out all about those five studentcorps i started with the white cap corps i began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen and here is what i found out  1 it is called the prussian corps because none but prussians are admitted to it  2 it is called the prussian corps for no particular reason it has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some german state  3 it is not named the prussian corps at all but only the white cap corps  4 any student can belong to it who is a german by birth  5 any student can belong to it who is european by birth  6 any europeanborn student can belong to it except he be a frenchman  7 any student can belong to it no matter where he was born  8 no student can belong to it who is not of noble blood  9 no student can belong to it who cannot show three full generations of noble descent  10 nobility is not a necessary qualification  11 no moneyless student can belong to it  12 money qualification is nonsensesuch a thing has never been thought of  i got some of this information from students themselvesstudents who did not belong to the corps  i finally went to headquartersto the white capswhere i would have gone in the first place if i had been acquainted but even at headquarters i found difficulties i perceived that there were things about the white cap corps which one member knew and another one didnt it was natural for very few members of any organization know all that can be known about it i doubt there is a man or a woman in heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the white cap corps which a stranger might ask yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time  there is one german custom which is universalthe bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it this bow startles a stranger out of his selfpossession the first time it occurs and he is likely to fall over a chair or something in his embarrassment but it pleases him nevertheless one soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow ones self is a difficult matter for a diffident man one thinks if i rise to go and tender my bow and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation and not return it how shall i feel in case i survive to feel anything therefore he is afraid to venture he sits out the dinner and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing a table dhôte dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses therefore i used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears it took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless but i did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent i made harris get up and bow and leave invariably his bow was returned then i got up and bowed myself and retired   thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me but not for harris three courses of a table dhôte dinner were enough for me but harris preferred thirteen  even after i had acquired full confidence and no longer needed the agents help i sometimes encountered difficulties once at badenbaden i nearly lost a train because i could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were germans since i had not heard them speak they might be american they might be english it was not safe to venture a bow but just as i had got that far with my thought one of them began a german remark to my great relief and gratitude and before she got out her third word our bows had been delivered and graciously returned and we were off  there is a friendly something about the german character which is very winning when harris and i were making a pedestrian tour through the black forest we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us they were pedestrians too our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them all parties were hungry so there was no talking by and by the usual bows were exchanged and we separated  as we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at allerheiligen next morning these young people entered and took places near us without observing us but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled not ceremoniously but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers then they spoke of the weather and the roads we also spoke of the weather and the roads next they said they had had an enjoyable walk notwithstanding the weather we said that that had been our case too then they said they had walked thirty english miles the day before and asked how many we had walked i could not lie so i told harris to do it harris told them we had made thirty english miles too that was true we had made them though we had had a little assistance here and there  after breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well they went and got their maps and things and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a new york detective could have followed it and when we started they spoke out a hearty goodby and wished us a pleasant journey perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land i dont know i only know it was lovely to be treated so  very well i took an american young lady to one of the fine balls in badenbaden one night and at the entrancedoor upstairs we were halted by an officialsomething about miss joness dress was not according to rule i dont remember what it was now something was wantingher back hair or a shawl or a fan or a shovel or something the official was ever so polite and ever so sorry but the rule was strict and he could not let us in it was very embarrassing for many eyes were on us but now a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom inquired into the trouble and said she could fix it in a moment she took miss jones to the robingroom and soon brought her back in regulation trim and then we entered the ballroom with this benefactress unchallenged   being safe now i began to puzzle through my sincere but ungrammatical thanks when there was a sudden mutual recognition the benefactress and i had met at allerheiligen two weeks had not altered her good face and plainly her heart was in the right place yet but there was such a difference between these clothes and the clothes i had seen her in before when she was walking thirty miles a day in the black forest that it was quite natural that i had failed to recognize her sooner i had on my other suit too but my german would betray me to a person who had heard it once anyway she brought her brother and sister and they made our way smooth for that evening  wellmonths afterward i was driving through the streets of munich in a cab with a german lady one day when she said  there that is prince ludwig and his wife walking along there  everybody was bowing to themcabmen little children and everybody elseand they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody when a young lady met them and made a deep courtesy  that is probably one of the ladies of the court said my german friend  i said  she is an honor to it then i know her i dont know her name but i know her i have known her at allerheiligen and badenbaden she ought to be an empress but she may be only a duchess it is the way things go in this way  if one asks a german a civil question he will be quite sure to get a civil answer if you stop a german in the street and ask him to direct you to a certain place he shows no sign of feeling offended if the place be difficult to find ten to one the man will drop his own matters and go with you and show you  in london too many a time strangers have walked several blocks with me to show me my way  there is something very real about this sort of politeness quite often in germany shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article i wanted have sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where it could be had     chapter xix  the deadly jest of dilsberg   however i wander from the raft we made the port of necharsteinach in good season and went to the hotel and ordered a trout dinner the same to be ready against our return from a twohour pedestrian excursion to the village and castle of dilsberg a mile distant on the other side of the river i do not mean that we proposed to be two hours making two milesno we meant to employ most of the time in inspecting dilsberg  for dilsberg is a quaint place it is most quaintly and picturesquely situated too imagine the beautiful river before you then a few rods of brilliant green sward on its opposite shore then a sudden hillno preparatory gently rising slopes but a sort of instantaneous hilla hill two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet high as round as a bowl with the same taper upward that an inverted bowl has and with about the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a bowl of good honest deptha hill which is thickly clothed with green bushesa comely shapely hill rising abruptly out of the dead level of the surrounding green plains visible from a great distance down the bends of the river and with just exactly room on the top of its head for its steepled and turreted and roofclustered cap of architecture which same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round hoop of the ancient village wall  there is no house outside the wall on the whole hill or any vestige of a former house all the houses are inside the wall but there isnt room for another one it is really a finished town and has been finished a very long time there is no space between the wall and the first circle of buildings no the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first circle of buildings and the roofs jut a little over the wall and thus furnish it with eaves the general level of the massed roofs is gracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined castle and the tall spires of a couple of churches so from a distance dilsberg has rather more the look of a kings crown than a cap that lofty green eminence and its quaint coronet form quite a striking picture you may be sure in the flush of the evening sun   we crossed over in a boat and began the ascent by a narrow steep path which plunged us at once into the leafy deeps of the bushes but they were not cool deeps by any means for the suns rays were weltering hot and there was little or no breeze to temper them as we panted up the sharp ascent we met brown bareheaded and barefooted boys and girls occasionally and sometimes men they came upon us without warning they gave us good day flashed out of sight in the bushes and were gone as suddenly and mysteriously as they had come they were bound for the other side of the river to work this path had been traveled by many generations of these people they have always gone down to the valley to earn their bread but they have always climbed their hill again to eat it and to sleep in their snug town   it is said that the dilsbergers do not emigrate much they find that living up there above the world in their peaceful nest is pleasanter than living down in the troublous world the seven hundred inhabitants are all bloodkin to each other too they have always been bloodkin to each other for fifteen hundred years they are simply one large family and they like the home folks better than they like strangers hence they persistently stay at home it has been said that for ages dilsberg has been merely a thriving and diligent idiotfactory i saw no idiots there but the captain said because of late years the government has taken to lugging them off to asylums and otherwheres and government wants to cripple the factory too and is trying to get these dilsbergers to marry out of the family but they dont like to  the captain probably imagined all this as modern science denies that the intermarrying of relatives deteriorates the stock  arrived within the wall we found the usual village sights and life we moved along a narrow crooked lane which had been paved in the middle ages a strapping ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff in a little bit of a goodbox of a barn and she swung her flail with a willif it was a flail i was not farmer enough to know what she was at a frowsy barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stickdriving them along the lane and keeping them out of the dwellings a cooper was at work in a shop which i know he did not make so large a thing as a hogshead in for there was not room in the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out over the threshold picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane unmindful of the sun   except the sleeping old man everybody was at work but the place was very still and peaceful nevertheless so still that the distant cackle of the successful hen smote upon the ear but little dulled by intervening sounds that commonest of village sights was lacking herethe public pump with its great stone tank or trough of limpid water and its group of gossiping pitcherbearers for there is no well or fountain or spring on this tall hill cisterns of rainwater are used  our alpenstocks and muslin tails compelled attention and as we moved through the village we gathered a considerable procession of little boys and girls and so went in some state to the castle it proved to be an extensive pile of crumbling walls arches and towers massive properly grouped for picturesque effect weedy grassgrown and satisfactory the children acted as guides they walked us along the top of the highest walls then took us up into a high tower and showed us a wide and beautiful landscape made up of wavy distances of woody hills and a nearer prospect of undulating expanses of green lowlands on the one hand and castlegraced crags and ridges on the other with the shining curves of the neckar flowing between but the principal show the chief pride of the children was the ancient and empty well in the grassgrown court of the castle its massive stone curb stands up three or four feet aboveground and is whole and uninjured the children said that in the middle ages this well was four hundred feet deep and furnished all the village with an abundant supply of water in war and peace they said that in the old day its bottom was below the level of the neckar hence the watersupply was inexhaustible  but there were some who believed it had never been a well at all and was never deeper than it is noweighty feet that at that depth a subterranean passage branched from it and descended gradually to a remote place in the valley where it opened into somebodys cellar or other hidden recess and that the secret of this locality is now lost those who hold this belief say that herein lies the explanation that dilsberg besieged by tilly and many a soldier before him was never taken after the longest and closest sieges the besiegers were astonished to perceive that the besieged were as fat and hearty as ever and were well furnished with munitions of wartherefore it must be that the dilsbergers had been bringing these things in through the subterranean passage all the time  the children said that there was in truth a subterranean outlet down there and they would prove it so they set a great truss of straw on fire and threw it down the well while we leaned on the curb and watched the glowing mass descend it struck bottom and gradually burned out no smoke came up the children clapped their hands and said  you see nothing makes so much smoke as burning strawnow where did the smoke go to if there is no subterranean outlet   so it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed but the finest thing within the ruins limits was a noble linden which the children said was four hundred years old and no doubt it was it had a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage the limbs near the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel  that tree had witnessed the assaults of men in mailhow remote such a time seems and how ungraspable is the fact that real men ever did fight in real armorand it had seen the time when these broken arches and crumbling battlements were a trim and strong and stately fortress fluttering its gay banners in the sun and peopled with vigorous humanityhow impossibly long ago that seemsand here it stands yet and possibly may still be standing here sunning itself and dreaming its historical dreams when today shall have been joined to the days called ancient  well we sat down under the tree to smoke and the captain delivered himself of his legend the legend of dilsberg castle it was to this effect in the old times there was once a great company assembled at the castle and festivity ran high of course there was a haunted chamber in the castle and one day the talk fell upon that it was said that whoever slept in it would not wake again for fifty years now when a young knight named conrad von geisberg heard this he said that if the castle were his he would destroy that chamber so that no foolish person might have the chance to bring so dreadful a misfortune upon himself and afflict such as loved him with the memory of it straightway the company privately laid their heads together to contrive some way to get this superstitious young man to sleep in that chamber  and they succeededin this way they persuaded his betrothed a lovely mischievous young creature niece of the lord of the castle to help them in their plot she presently took him aside and had speech with him she used all her persuasions but could not shake him he said his belief was firm that if he should sleep there he would wake no more for fifty years and it made him shudder to think of it catharina began to weep this was a better argument conrad could not hold out against it he yielded and said she should have her wish if she would only smile and be happy again she flung her arms about his neck and the kisses she gave him showed that her thankfulness and her pleasure were very real then she flew to tell the company her success and the applause she received made her glad and proud she had undertaken her mission since all alone she had accomplished what the multitude had failed in  at midnight that night after the usual feasting conrad was taken to the haunted chamber and left there he fell asleep by and by  when he awoke again and looked about him his heart stood still with horror the whole aspect of the chamber was changed the walls were moldy and hung with ancient cobwebs the curtains and beddings were rotten the furniture was rickety and ready to fall to pieces he sprang out of bed but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the floor  this is the weakness of age he said  he rose and sought his clothing it was clothing no longer the colors were gone the garments gave way in many places while he was putting them on he fled shuddering into the corridor and along it to the great hall here he was met by a middleaged stranger of a kind countenance who stopped and gazed at him with surprise conrad said  good sir will you send hither the lord ulrich  the stranger looked puzzled a moment then said  the lord ulrich  yesif you will be so good   the stranger calledwilhelm a young servingman came and the stranger said to him  is there a lord ulrich among the guests  i know none of the name so please your honor  conrad said hesitatingly  i did not mean a guest but the lord of the castle sir  the stranger and the servant exchanged wondering glances then the former said  i am the lord of the castle  since when sir  since the death of my father the good lord ulrich more than forty years ago  conrad sank upon a bench and covered his face with his hands while he rocked his body to and fro and moaned the stranger said in a low voice to the servant  i fear me this poor old creature is mad call some one  in a moment several people came and grouped themselves about talking in whispers conrad looked up and scanned the faces about him wistfully  then he shook his head and said in a grieved voice  no there is none among ye that i know i am old and alone in the world they are dead and gone these many years that cared for me but sure some of these aged ones i see about me can tell me some little word or two concerning them  several bent and tottering men and women came nearer and answered his questions about each former friend as he mentioned the names this one they said had been dead ten years that one twenty another thirty each succeeding blow struck heavier and heavier at last the sufferer said  there is one more but i have not the courage too my lost catharina  one of the old dames said  ah i knew her well poor soul a misfortune overtook her lover and she died of sorrow nearly fifty years ago she lieth under the linden tree without the court  conrad bowed his head and said  ah why did i ever wake and so she died of grief for me poor child so young so sweet so good she never wittingly did a hurtful thing in all the little summer of her life her loving debt shall be repaidfor i will die of grief for her  his head drooped upon his breast in the moment there was a wild burst of joyous laughter a pair of round young arms were flung about conrads neck and a sweet voice cried  there conrad mine thy kind words kill methe farce shall go no further look up and laugh with ustwas all a jest  and he did look up and gazed in a dazed wondermentfor the disguises were stripped away and the aged men and women were bright and young and gay again catharinas happy tongue ran on  twas a marvelous jest and bravely carried out they gave you a heavy sleepingdraught before you went to bed and in the night they bore you to a ruined chamber where all had fallen to decay and placed these rags of clothing by you and when your sleep was spent and you came forth two strangers well instructed in their parts were here to meet you and all we your friends in our disguises were close at hand to see and hear you may be sure ah twas a gallant jest come now and make thee ready for the pleasures of the day how real was thy misery for the moment thou poor lad look up and have thy laugh now  he looked up searched the merry faces about him in a dreamy way then sighed and said   i am aweary good strangers i pray you lead me to her grave  all the smile vanished away every cheek blanched catharina sunk to the ground in a swoon  all day the people went about the castle with troubled faces and communed together in undertones a painful hush pervaded the place which had lately been so full of cheery life each in his turn tried to arouse conrad out of his hallucination and bring him to himself but all the answer any got was a meek bewildered stare and then the words  good stranger i have no friends all are at rest these many years ye speak me fair ye mean me well but i know ye not i am alone and forlorn in the worldprithee lead me to her grave  during two years conrad spent his days from the early morning till the night under the linden tree mourning over the imaginary grave of his catharina catharina was the only company of the harmless madman he was very friendly toward her because as he said in some ways she reminded him of his catharina whom he had lost fifty years ago he often said  she was so gay so happyheartedbut you never smile and always when you think i am not looking you cry  when conrad died they buried him under the linden according to his directions so that he might rest near his poor catharina then catharina sat under the linden alone every day and all day long a great many years speaking to no one and never smiling and at last her long repentance was rewarded with death and she was buried by conrads side  harris pleased the captain by saying it was good legend and pleased him further by adding  now that i have seen this mighty tree vigorous with its four hundred years i feel a desire to believe the legend for its sake so i will humor the desire and consider that the tree really watches over those poor hearts and feels a sort of human tenderness for them  we returned to necharsteinach plunged our hot heads into the trough at the town pump and then went to the hotel and ate our trout dinner in leisurely comfort in the garden with the beautiful neckar flowing at our feet the quaint dilsberg looming beyond and the graceful towers and battlements of a couple of medieval castles called the swallows nest 1 and the brothers assisting the rugged scenery of a bend of the river down to our right we got to sea in season to make the eightmile run to heidelberg before the night shut down we sailed by the hotel in the mellow glow of sunset and came slashing down with the mad current into the narrow passage between the dikes i believed i could shoot the bridge myself and i went to the forward triplet of logs and relieved the pilot of his pole and his responsibility     1 the seeker after information is referred to appendix e   for our captains legend of the swallows nest and   the brothers   we went tearing along in a most exhilarating way and i performed the delicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt but perceiving presently that i really was going to shoot the bridge itself instead of the archway under it i judiciously stepped ashore the next moment i had my longcoveted desire i saw a raft wrecked it hit the pier in the center and went all to smash and scatteration like a box of matches struck by lightning   i was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight the others were attitudinizing for the benefit of the long rank of young ladies who were promenading on the bank and so they lost it but i helped to fish them out of the river down below the bridge and then described it to them as well as i could  they were not interested though they said they were wet and felt ridiculous and did not care anything for descriptions of scenery the young ladies and other people crowded around and showed a great deal of sympathy but that did not help matters for my friends said they did not want sympathy they wanted a back alley and solitude     chapter xx  my precious priceless tearjug   next morning brought good newsour trunks had arrived from hamburg at last let this be a warning to the reader the germans are very conscientious and this trait makes them very particular therefore if you tell a german you want a thing done immediately he takes you at your word he thinks you mean what you say so he does that thing immediatelyaccording to his idea of immediatelywhich is about a week that is it is a week if it refers to the building of a garment or it is an hour and a half if it refers to the cooking of a trout very well if you tell a german to send your trunk to you by slow freight he takes you at your word he sends it by slow freight and you cannot imagine how long you will go on enlarging your admiration of the expressiveness of that phrase in the german tongue before you get that trunk the hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful when i got it ready for shipment in hamburg it was baldheaded when it reached heidelberg however it was still sound that was a comfort it was not battered in the least the baggagemen seemed to be conscientiously careful in germany of the baggage entrusted to their hands there was nothing now in the way of our departure therefore we set about our preparations  naturally my chief solicitude was about my collection of ceramics of course i could not take it with me that would be inconvenient and dangerous besides i took advice but the best brickabrackers were divided as to the wisest course to pursue some said pack the collection and warehouse it others said try to get it into the grand ducal museum at mannheim for safe keeping so i divided the collection and followed the advice of both parties i set aside for the museum those articles which were the most frail and precious  among these was my etruscan tearjug i have made a little sketch of it here that thing creeping up the side is not a bug it is a hole i bought this tearjug of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and fifty dollars it is very rare the man said the etruscans used to keep tears or something in these things and that it was very hard to get hold of a broken one now   i also set aside my henri ii plate see sketch from my pencil it is in the main correct though i think i have foreshortened one end of it a little too much perhaps this is very fine and rare the shape is exceedingly beautiful and unusual it has wonderful decorations on it but i am not able to reproduce them it cost more than the tearjug as the dealer said there was not another plate just like it in the world he said there was much false henri ii ware around but that the genuineness of this piece was unquestionable   he showed me its pedigree or its history if you please it was a document which traced this plates movements all the way down from its birthshowed who bought it from whom and what he paid for itfrom the first buyer down to me whereby i saw that it had gone steadily up from thirtyfive cents to seven hundred dollars he said that the whole ceramic world would be informed that it was now in my possession and would make a note of it with the price paid figure 8  there were masters in those days but alasit is not so now of course the main preciousness of this piece lies in its color it is that old sensuous pervading ramifying interpolating transboreal blue which is the despair of modern art the little sketch which i have made of this gem cannot and does not do it justice since i have been obliged to leave out the color but ive got the expression though   however i must not be frittering away the readers time with these details i did not intend to go into any detail at all at first but it is the failing of the true ceramiker or the true devotee in any department of brickabrackery that once he gets his tongue or his pen started on his darling theme he cannot well stop until he drops from exhaustion he has no more sense of the flight of time than has any other lover when talking of his sweetheart the very marks on the bottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a gibbering ecstasy and i could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about whether the stopple of a departed buon retiro scentbottle was genuine or spurious   many people say that for a male person bricabrac hunting is about as robust a business as making dollclothes or decorating japanese pots with decalcomania butterflies would be and these people fling mud at the elegant englishman byng who wrote a book called the bricabrac hunter and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose to call his despicable trifles and for gushing over these trifles and for exhibiting his deep infantile delight in what they call his tuppenny collection of beggarly trivialities and for beginning his book with a picture of himself seated in a sappy selfcomplacent attitude in the midst of his poor little ridiculous bricabrac junk shop  it is easy to say these things it is easy to revile us easy to despise us therefore let these people rail on they cannot feel as byng and i feelit is their loss not ours for my part i am content to be a brickabracker and a ceramikermore i am proud to be so named i am proud to know that i lose my reason as immediately in the presence of a rare jug with an illustrious mark on the bottom of it as if i had just emptied that jug very well i packed and stored a part of my collection and the rest of it i placed in the care of the grand ducal museum in mannheim by permission my old blue china cat remains there yet i presented it to that excellent institution   i had but one misfortune with my things an egg which i had kept back from breakfast that morning was broken in packing it was a great pity i had shown it to the best connoisseurs in heidelberg and they all said it was an antique we spent a day or two in farewell visits and then left for badenbaden we had a pleasant trip to it for the rhine valley is always lovely the only trouble was that the trip was too short if i remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours therefore i judge that the distance was very little if any over fifty miles we quitted the train at oos and walked the entire remaining distance to badenbaden with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon the weather being exhaustingly warm we came into town on foot  one of the first persons we encountered as we walked up the street was the rev mr  an old friend from americaa lucky encounter indeed for his is a most gentle refined and sensitive nature and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment we knew he had been in europe some time but were not at all expecting to run across him both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms and rev mr  said  i have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you and an empty one ready and thirsting to receive what you have got we will sit up till midnight and have a good satisfying interchange for i leave here early in the morning we agreed to that of course  i had been vaguely conscious for a while of a person who was walking in the street abreast of us i had glanced furtively at him once or twice and noticed that he was a fine large vigorous young fellow with an open independent countenance faintly shaded with a pale and even almost imperceptible crop of early down and that he was clothed from head to heel in cool and enviable snowwhite linen i thought i had also noticed that his head had a sort of listening tilt to it now about this time the rev mr  said  the sidewalk is hardly wide enough for three so i will walk behind but keep the talk going keep the talk going theres no time to lose and you may be sure i will do my share he ranged himself behind us and straightway that stately snowwhite young fellow closed up to the sidewalk alongside him fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with his broad palm and sung out with a hearty cheeriness  americans for twoandahalf and the money up hey  the reverend winced but said mildly  yeswe are americans  lord love you you can just bet thats what i am every time put it there   he held out his sahara of his palm and the reverend laid his diminutive hand in it and got so cordial a shake that we heard his glove burst under it  say didnt i put you up right  oh yes  sho i spotted you for my kind the minute i heard your clack you been over here long  about four months have you been over long  long well i should say so going on two years by geeminy say are you homesick  no i cant say that i am are you  oh hell yes this with immense enthusiasm  the reverend shrunk a little in his clothes and we were aware rather by instinct than otherwise that he was throwing out signals of distress to us but we did not interfere or try to succor him for we were quite happy  the young fellow hooked his arm into the reverends now with the confiding and grateful air of a waif who has been longing for a friend and a sympathetic ear and a chance to lisp once more the sweet accents of the mothertongueand then he limbered up the muscles of his mouth and turned himself looseand with such a relish some of his words were not sundayschool words so i am obliged to put blanks where they occur  yes indeedy if i aint an american there aint any americans thats all and when i heard you fellows gassing away in the good old american language im  if it wasnt all i could do to keep from hugging you my tongues all warped with trying to curl it around these  forsaken windgalled ninejointed german words here now i tell you its awful good to lay it over a christian word once more and kind of let the old taste soak it im from western new york my name is cholley adams im a student you know been here going on two years im learning to be a horsedoctor i like that part of it you know but these people they wont learn a fellow in his own language they make him learn in german so before i could tackle the horsedoctoring i had to tackle this miserable language  first off i thought it would certainly give me the botts but i dont mind now ive got it where the hairs short i think and dontchuknow they made me learn latin too now between you and me i wouldnt give a for all the latin that was ever jabbered and the first thing i calculate to do when i get through is to just sit down and forget it twont take me long and i dont mind the time anyway and i tell you what the difference between schoolteaching over yonder and schoolteaching over heresho we dont know anything about it here youve got to peg and peg and peg and there just aint any letupand what you learn here youve got to know dontchuknow or else youll have one of these  spavined spectacles ringboned knockkneed old professors in your hair ive been here long enough and im getting blessed tired of it mind i tell you the old man wrote me that he was coming over in june and said hed take me home in august whether i was done with my education or not but durn him he didnt come never said why just sent me a hamper of sundayschool books and told me to be good and hold on a while i dont take to sundayschool books dontchuknowi dont hanker after them when i can get piebut i read them anyway because whatever the old man tells me to do thats the thing that im agoing to do or tear something you know i buckled in and read all those books because he wanted me to but that kind of thing dont excite me i like something hearty but im awful homesick im homesick from earsocket to crupper and from crupper to hockjoint but it aint any use ive got to stay here till the old man drops the rag and give the wordyes sir right here in this  country ive got to linger till the old man says comeand you bet your bottom dollar johnny it aint just as easy as it is for a cat to have twins  at the end of this profane and cordial explosion he fetched a prodigious whoosh to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat and then he straightway dived into his narrative again for johnnys benefit beginning well it aint any use talking some of those old american words do have a kind of a bully swing to them a man can express himself with ema man can get at what he wants to say dontchuknow   when we reached our hotel and it seemed that he was about to lose the reverend he showed so much sorrow and begged so hard and so earnestly that the reverends heart was not hard enough to hold out against the pleadingsso he went away with the parenthonoring student like a right christian and took supper with him in his lodgings and sat in the surfbeat of his slang and profanity till near midnight and then left himleft him pretty well talked out but grateful clear down to his frogs as he expressed it the reverend said it had transpired during the interview that cholley adamss father was an extensive dealer in horses in western new york this accounted for cholleys choice of a profession the reverend brought away a pretty high opinion of cholley as a manly young fellow with stuff in him for a useful citizen he considered him rather a rough gem but a gem nevertheless     chapter xxi  insolent shopkeepers and gabbling americans   badenbaden sits in the lap of the hills and the natural and artificial beauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly the level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is laid out in handsome pleasure grounds shaded by noble trees and adorned at intervals with lofty and sparkling fountainjets thrice a day a fine band makes music in the public promenade before the conversation house and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with fashionably dressed people of both sexes who march back and forth past the great musicstand and look very much bored though they make a show of feeling otherwise it seems like a rather aimless and stupid existence a good many of these people are there for a real purpose however they are racked with rheumatism and they are there to stew it out in the hot baths these invalids looked melancholy enough limping about on their canes and crutches and apparently brooding over all sorts of cheerless things people say that germany with her damp stone houses is the home of rheumatism if that is so providence must have foreseen that it would be so and therefore filled the land with the healing baths perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with medicinal springs as germany some of these baths are good for one ailment some for another and again peculiar ailments are conquered by combining the individual virtues of several different baths for instance for some forms of disease the patient drinks the native hot water of badenbaden with a spoonful of salt from the carlsbad springs dissolved in it that is not a dose to be forgotten right away  they dont sell this hot water no you go into the great trinkhalle and stand around first on one foot and then on the other while two or three young girls sit pottering at some sort of ladylike sewingwork in your neighborhood and cant seem to see you polite as threedollar clerks in government offices   by and by one of these rises painfully and stretchesstretches fists and body heavenward till she raises her heels from the floor at the same time refreshing herself with a yawn of such comprehensiveness that the bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to see how she is constructed insidethen she slowly closes her cavern brings down her fists and her heels comes languidly forward contemplates you contemptuously draws you a glass of hot water and sets it down where you can get it by reaching for it you take it and say  how muchand she returns you with elaborate indifference a beggars answer  nach beliebe what you please  this thing of using the common beggars trick and the common beggars shibboleth to put you on your liberality when you were expecting a simple straightforward commercial transaction adds a little to your prospering sense of irritation you ignore her reply and ask again  how much  and she calmly indifferently repeats  nach beliebe  you are getting angry but you are trying not to show it you resolve to keep on asking your question till she changes her answer or at least her annoyingly indifferent manner therefore if your case be like mine you two fools stand there and without perceptible emotion of any kind or any emphasis on any syllable you look blandly into each others eyes and hold the following idiotic conversation  how much  nach beliebe  how much  nach beliebe  how much  nach beliebe  how much  nach beliebe  how much  nach beliebe  how much  nach beliebe  i do not know what another person would have done but at this point i gave up that castiron indifference that tranquil contemptuousness conquered me and i struck my colors now i knew she was used to receiving about a penny from manly people who care nothing about the opinions of scullerymaids and about tuppence from moral cowards but i laid a silver twentyfive cent piece within her reach and tried to shrivel her up with this sarcastic speech  if it isnt enough will you stoop sufficiently from your official dignity to say so  she did not shrivel without deigning to look at me at all she languidly lifted the coin and bit itto see if it was good then she turned her back and placidly waddled to her former roost again tossing the money into an open till as she went along she was victor to the last you see   i have enlarged upon the ways of this girl because they are typical her manners are the manners of a goodly number of the badenbaden shopkeepers the shopkeeper there swindles you if he can and insults you whether he succeeds in swindling you or not the keepers of baths also take great and patient pains to insult you the frowsy woman who sat at the desk in the lobby of the great friederichsbad and sold bath tickets not only insulted me twice every day with rigid fidelity to her great trust but she took trouble enough to cheat me out of a shilling one day to have fairly entitled her to ten badenbadens splendid gamblers are gone only her microscopic knaves remain   an english gentleman who had been living there several years said  if you could disguise your nationality you would not find any insolence here these shopkeepers detest the english and despise the americans they are rude to both more especially to ladies of your nationality and mine if these go shopping without a gentleman or a manservant they are tolerably sure to be subjected to petty insolencesinsolences of manner and tone rather than word though words that are hard to bear are not always wanting i know of an instance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an american lady with the remark snappishly uttered we dont take french money here and i know of a case where an english lady said to one of these shopkeepers dont you think you ask too much for this article and he replied with the question do you think you are obliged to buy it however these people are not impolite to russians or germans and as to rank they worship that for they have long been used to generals and nobles if you wish to see what abysses servility can descend present yourself before a badenbaden shopkeeper in the character of a russian prince  it is an inane town filled with sham and petty fraud and snobbery but the baths are good i spoke with many people and they were all agreed in that i had the twinges of rheumatism unceasingly during three years but the last one departed after a fortnights bathing there and i have never had one since i fully believe i left my rheumatism in badenbaden badenbaden is welcome to it it was little but it was all i had to give i would have preferred to leave something that was catching but it was not in my power  there are several hot springs there and during two thousand years they have poured forth a neverdiminishing abundance of the healing water this water is conducted in pipe to the numerous bathhouses and is reduced to an endurable temperature by the addition of cold water the new friederichsbad is a very large and beautiful building and in it one may have any sort of bath that has ever been invented and with all the additions of herbs and drugs that his ailment may need or that the physician of the establishment may consider a useful thing to put into the water you go there enter the great door get a bow graduated to your style and clothes from the gorgeous portier and a bath ticket and an insult from the frowsy woman for a quarter she strikes a bell and a servingman conducts you down a long hall and shuts you into a commodious room which has a washstand a mirror a bootjack and a sofa in it and there you undress at your leisure   the room is divided by a great curtain you draw this curtain aside and find a large white marble bathtub with its rim sunk to the level of the floor and with three white marble steps leading down to it this tub is full of water which is as clear as crystal and is tempered to 28 degrees reaumur about 95 degrees fahrenheit sunk into the floor by the tub is a covered copper box which contains some warm towels and a sheet you look fully as white as an angel when you are stretched out in that limpid bath you remain in it ten minutes the first time and afterward increase the duration from day to day till you reach twentyfive or thirty minutes there you stop the appointments of the place are so luxurious the benefit so marked the price so moderate and the insults so sure that you very soon find yourself adoring the friederichsbad and infesting it  we had a plain simple unpretending good hotel in badenbadenthe hôtel de franceand alongside my room i had a giggling cackling chattering family who always went to bed just two hours after me and always got up two hours ahead of me but this is common in german hotels the people generally go to bed long after eleven and get up long before eight the partitions convey sound like a drumhead and everybody knows it but no matter a german family who are all kindness and consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate their noises for your benefit at night they will sing laugh and talk loudly and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way if you knock on your wall appealingly they will quiet down and discuss the matter softly among themselves for a momentthen like the mice they fall to persecuting you again and as vigorously as before they keep cruelly late and early hours for such noisy folk  of course when one begins to find fault with foreign peoples ways he is very likely to get a reminder to look nearer home before he gets far with it i open my notebook to see if i can find some more information of a valuable nature about badenbaden and the first thing i fall upon is this  badenbaden no date lot of vociferous americans at breakfast this morning talking at everybody while pretending to talk among themselves on their first travels manifestly showing off the usual signsairy easygoing references to grand distances and foreign places well goodby old fellowif i dont run across you in italy you hunt me up in london before you sail  the next item which i find in my notebook is this one  the fact that a band of 6000 indians are now murdering our frontiersmen at their impudent leisure and that we are only able to send 1200 soldiers against them is utilized here to discourage emigration to america the common people think the indians are in new jersey   this is a new and peculiar argument against keeping our army down to a ridiculous figure in the matter of numbers it is rather a striking one too i have not distorted the truth in saying that the facts in the above item about the army and the indians are made use of to discourage emigration to america that the common people should be rather foggy in their geography and foggy as to the location of the indians is a matter for amusement maybe but not of surprise  there is an interesting old cemetery in badenbaden and we spent several pleasant hours in wandering through it and spelling out the inscriptions on the aged tombstones apparently after a man has laid there a century or two and has had a good many people buried on top of him it is considered that his tombstone is not needed by him any longer i judge so from the fact that hundreds of old gravestones have been removed from the graves and placed against the inner walls of the cemetery what artists they had in the old times they chiseled angels and cherubs and devils and skeletons on the tombstones in the most lavish and generous wayas to supplybut curiously grotesque and outlandish as to form it is not always easy to tell which of the figures belong among the blest and which of them among the opposite party but there was an inscription in french on one of those old stones which was quaint and pretty and was plainly not the work of any other than a poet it was to this effect  here reposes in god caroline de clery a religieuse of st denis aged 83 yearsand blind the light was restored to her in baden the 5th of january 1839  we made several excursions on foot to the neighboring villages over winding and beautiful roads and through enchanting woodland scenery the woods and roads were similar to those at heidelberg but not so bewitching i suppose that roads and woods which are up to the heidelberg mark are rare in the world  once we wandered clear away to la favorita palace which is several miles from badenbaden the grounds about the palace were fine the palace was a curiosity it was built by a margravine in 1725 and remains as she left it at her death we wandered through a great many of its rooms and they all had striking peculiarities of decoration for instance the walls of one room were pretty completely covered with small pictures of the margravine in all conceivable varieties of fanciful costumes some of them male  the walls of another room were covered with grotesquely and elaborately figured handwrought tapestry the musty ancient beds remained in the chambers and their quilts and curtains and canopies were decorated with curious handwork and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical and mythological scenes in glaring colors there was enough crazy and rotten rubbish in the building to make a true brickabracker green with envy a painting in the dininghall verged upon the indelicatebut then the margravine was herself a trifle indelicate  it is in every way a wildly and picturesquely decorated house and brimful of interest as a reflection of the character and tastes of that rude bygone time  in the grounds a few rods from the palace stands the margravines chapel just as she left ita coarse wooden structure wholly barren of ornament it is said that the margravine would give herself up to debauchery and exceedingly fast living for several months at a time and then retire to this miserable wooden den and spend a few months in repenting and getting ready for another good time she was a devoted catholic and was perhaps quite a model sort of a christian as christians went then in high life  tradition says she spent the last two years of her life in the strange den i have been speaking of after having indulged herself in one final triumphant and satisfying spree she shut herself up there without company and without even a servant and so abjured and forsook the world in her little bit of a kitchen she did her own cooking she wore a hair shirt next the skin and castigated herself with whipsthese aids to grace are exhibited there yet she prayed and told her beads in another little room before a waxen virgin niched in a little box against the wall she bedded herself like a slave  in another small room is an unpainted wooden table and behind it sit halflifesize waxen figures of the holy family made by the very worst artist that ever lived perhaps and clothed in gaudy flimsy drapery 1 the margravine used to bring her meals to this table and dine with the holy family what an idea that was what a grisly spectacle it must have been imagine it those rigid shockheaded figures with corpsy complexions and fish glass eyes occupying one side of the table in the constrained attitudes and dead fixedness that distinguish all men that are born of wax and this wrinkled smoldering old fireeater occupying the other side mumbling her prayers and munching her sausages in the ghostly stillness and shadowy indistinctness of a winter twilight it makes one feel crawly even to think of it    1 the savior was represented as a lad of about fifteen   years of age this figure had lost one eye   in this sordid place and clothed bedded and fed like a pauper this strange princess lived and worshiped during two years and in it she died two or three hundred years ago this would have made the poor den holy ground and the church would have set up a miraclefactory there and made plenty of money out of it the den could be moved into some portions of france and made a good property even now      a

time one cannot describe those noble woods nor the feeling with which they inspire him a feature of the feeling however is a deep sense of contentment another feature of it is a buoyant boyish gladness and a third and very conspicuous feature of it is ones sense of the remoteness of the workday world and his entire emancipation from it and its affairs  those woods stretch unbroken over a vast region and everywhere they are such dense woods and so still and so piney and fragrant the stems of the trees are trim and straight and in many places all the ground is hidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color with not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface and not a fallen leaf or twig to mar its immaculate tidiness a rich cathedral gloom pervades the pillared aisles so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk here and a bough yonder are strongly accented and when they strike the moss they fairly seem to burn but the weirdest effect and the most enchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon sun no single ray is able to pierce its way in then but the diffused light takes color from moss and foliage and pervades the place like a faint greentinted mist the theatrical fire of fairyland the suggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at all times is intensified by this unearthly glow  we found the black forest farmhouses and villages all that the black forest stories have pictured them the first genuine specimen which we came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the common council of the parish or district he was an important personage in the land and so was his wife also of course   his daughter was the catch of the region and she may be already entering into immortality as the heroine of one of auerbachs novels for all i know we shall see for if he puts her in i shall recognize her by her black forest clothes and her burned complexion her plump figure her fat hands her dull expression her gentle spirit her generous feet her bonnetless head and the plaited tails of hempcolored hair hanging down her back   the house was big enough for a hotel it was a hundred feet long and fifty wide and ten feet high from ground to eaves but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet or maybe even more this roof was of ancient mudcolored straw thatch a foot thick and was covered all over except in a few trifling spots with a thriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation mainly moss the mossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new masses of yellow straw the eaves projected far down like sheltering hospitable wings across the gable that fronted the road and about ten feet above the ground ran a narrow porch with a wooden railing a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon the porch above were two or three other little windows one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof before the groundfloor door was a huge pile of manure the door of the secondstory room on the side of the house was open and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow was this probably the drawingroom all of the front half of the house from the ground up seemed to be occupied by the people the cows and the chickens and all the rear half by draughtanimals and hay but the chief feature all around this house was the big heaps of manure  we became very familiar with the fertilizer in the forest we fell unconsciously into the habit of judging of a mans station in life by this outward and eloquent sign sometimes we said here is a poor devil this is manifest when we saw a stately accumulation we said here is a banker when we encountered a countryseat surrounded by an alpine pomp of manure we said doubtless a duke lives here  the importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the black forest stories manure is evidently the blackforesters main treasurehis coin his jewel his pride his old master his ceramics his bricabrac his darling his title to public consideration envy veneration and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his will the true black forest novel if it is ever written will be skeletoned somewhat in this way  skeleton for a black forest novel  rich old farmer named huss   has inherited great wealth of manure and

paul hoch led off to jail the bonanza king of the black forest lives to a good old age blessed with the love of his wife and of his twentyseven children and the still sweeter envy of everybody around  we took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the plow inn in a very pretty village ottenhoefen and then went into the public room to rest and smoke there we found nine or ten black forest grandees assembled around a table they were the common council of the parish they had gathered there at eight oclock that morning to elect a new member and they had now been drinking beer four hours at the new members expense   they were men of fifty or sixty years of age with grave goodnatured faces and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the black forest stories broad roundtopped black felt hats with the brims curled up all round long red waistcoats with large metal buttons black alpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders there were no speeches there was but little talk there were no frivolities the council filled themselves gradually steadily but surely with beer and conducted themselves with sedate decorum as became men of position men of influence men of manure  we had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley along the grassy bank of a rushing stream of clear water past farmhouses watermills and no end of wayside crucifixes and saints and virgins these crucifixes etc are set up in memory of departed friends by survivors and are almost as frequent as telegraphpoles are in other lands  we followed the carriageroad and had our usual luck we traveled under a beating sun and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we could get to them in all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike a piece of road at its time for being shady we had a particularly hot time of it on that particular afternoon and with no comfort but what we could get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep mountainsides above our heads were even worse off than we were by and by it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat any longer so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool twilight of the forest to hunt for what the guidebook called the old road  we found an old road and it proved eventually to be the right one though we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the wrong one if it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying therefore we did not hurry but sat down frequently on the soft moss and enjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes there had been distractions in the carriageroadschoolchildren peasants wagons troops of pedestrianizing students from all over germanybut we had the old road to ourselves  now and then while we rested we watched the laborious ant at his work i found nothing new in himcertainly nothing to change my opinion of him it seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a strangely overrated bird during many summers now i have watched him when i ought to have been in better business and i have not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one i refer to the ordinary ant of course i have had no experience of those wonderful swiss and african ones which vote keep drilled armies hold slaves and dispute about religion those particular ants may be all that the naturalist paints them but i am persuaded that the average ant is a sham i admit his industry of course he is the hardestworking creature in the worldwhen anybody is lookingbut his leatherheadedness is the point i make against him he goes out foraging he makes a capture and then what does he do go home nohe goes anywhere but home he doesnt know where home is his home may be only three feet awayno matter he cant find it he makes his capture as i have said it is generally something which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else it is usually seven times bigger than it ought to be he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force and starts not toward home but in the opposite direction not calmly and wisely but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength he fetches up against a pebble and instead of going around it he climbs over it backward dragging his booty after him tumbles down on the other side jumps up in a passion kicks the dust off his clothes moistens his hands grabs his property viciously yanks it this way then that shoves it ahead of him a moment turns tail and lugs it after him another moment gets madder and madder then presently hoists it into the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction comes to a weed it never occurs to him to go around it no he must climb it and he does climb it dragging his worthless property to the topwhich is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from heidelberg to paris by way of strasburg steeple when he gets up there he finds that that is not the place takes a cursory glance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down and starts off once moreas usual in a new direction at the end of half an hour he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his burden down meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards around and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across now he wipes the sweat from his brow strokes his limbs and then marches aimlessly off in as violently a hurry as ever he does not remember to have ever seen it before he looks around to see which is not the way home grabs his bundle and starts he goes through the same adventures he had before finally stops to rest and a friend comes along evidently the friend remarks that a last years grasshopper leg is a very noble acquisition and inquires where he got it   evidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it but thinks he got it around here somewhere evidently the friend contracts to help him freight it home then with a judgment peculiarly antic pun not intended they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions presently they take a rest and confer together they decide that something is wrong they cant make out what then they go at it again just as before same result mutual recriminations follow evidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist they lock themselves together and chew each others jaws for a while then they roll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs they make up and go to work again in the same old insane way but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage tug as he may the other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it instead of giving up he hangs on and gets his shins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way by and by when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old ground once more it is finally dumped at about the spot where it originally lay the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after all and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he cant find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want to own it  there in the black forest on the mountainside i saw an ant go through with such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times his own weight the spider was not quite dead but too far gone to resist he had a round body the size of a pea the little antobserving that i was noticingturned him on his back sunk his fangs into his throat lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him stumbling over little pebbles stepping on the spiders legs and tripping himself up dragging him backward shoving him bodily ahead dragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them climbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their summitsand finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be confiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him i measured the ground which this ass traversed and arrived at the conclusion that what he had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some such job as thisrelatively speakingfor a man to wit to strap two eighthundredpound horses together carry them eighteen hundred feet mainly over not around boulders averaging six feet high and in the course of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice like niagara and three steeples each a hundred and twenty feet high and then put the horses down in an exposed place without anybody to watch them and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for vanitys sake   science has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything for winter use this will knock him out of literature to some extent he does not work except when people are looking and only then when the observer has a green naturalistic look and seems to be taking notes this amounts to deception and will injure him for the sundayschools he has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isnt this amounts to ignorance and will impair the worlds respect for him he cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again this amounts to idiocy and once the damaging fact is established thoughtful people will cease to look up to him the sentimental will cease to fondle him his vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect since he never gets home with anything he starts with this disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him any more it is strange beyond comprehension that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out  the ant is strong but we saw another strong thing where we had not suspected the presence of much muscular power before a toadstoolthat vegetable which springs to full growth in a single nighthad torn loose and lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk into the air and supported it there like a column supporting a shed ten thousand toadstools with the right purchase could lift a man i suppose but what good would it do  all our afternoons progress had been uphill about five or half past we reached the summit and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun and their gladefurrowed sides dimmed with purple shade the gorge under our feetcalled allerheiligenafforded room in the grassy level at its head for a cozy and delightful human nest shut away from the world and its botherations and consequently the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven hundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a land as priests have today  a big hotel crowds the ruins a little now and drives a brisk trade with summer tourists we descended into the gorge and had a supper which would have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled the germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to their own devices this is an argument of some value in support of the theory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the coast of scotland a schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one of those islands a few years ago and the gentle savages rendered the captain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as they wanted next day he asked them how they liked them they shook their heads and said  baked they were tough and even boiled they warnt things for a hungry man to hanker after  we went down the glen after supper it is beautifula mixture of sylvan loveliness and craggy wildness a limpid torrent goes whistling down the glen and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between lofty precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls after one passes the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which is very pleasingthey rise in a sevenstepped stairway of foamy and glittering cascades and make a picture which is as charming as it is unusual     chapter xxiii  nicodemus dodge and the skeleton   we were satisfied that we could walk to oppenau in one day now that we were in practice so we set out the next morning after breakfast determined to do it it was all the way downhill and we had the loveliest summer weather for it so we set the pedometer and then stretched away on an easy regular stride down through the cloven forest drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing draughts and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but walk to oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again  now the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking or in the scenery but in the talking the walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by and to keep the blood and the brain stirred up and active the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk it is no matter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense the case is the same the bulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the gladsome jaw and the flapping of the sympathetic ear  and what motley variety of subjects a couple of people will casually rake over in the course of a days tramp there being no constraint a change of subject is always in order and so a body is not likely to keep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome we discussed everything we knew during the first fifteen or twenty minutes that morning and then branched out into the glad free boundless realm of the things we were not certain about  harris said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly habit of doubling up his haves he could never get rid of it while he lived that is to say if a man gets the habit of saying i should have liked to have known more about it instead of saying simply and sensibly i should have liked to know more about it that mans disease is incurable harris said that his sort of lapse is to be found in every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in english and in almost all of our books he said he had observed it in kirkhams grammar and in macaulay harris believed that milkteeth are commoner in mens mouths than those doubledup haves  i do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the present session when i should have been very glad to have accepted the proposal of my noble friend and to have exchanged parts in some of our evenings of workfrom a speech of the english chancellor of the exchequer august 1879  that changed the subject to dentistry i said i believed the average man dreaded toothpulling more than amputation and that he would yell quicker under the former operation than he would under the latter the philosopher harris said that the average man would not yell in either case if he had an audience then he continued  when our brigade first went into camp on the potomac we used to be brought up standing occasionally by an earsplitting howl of anguish that meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent but the surgeons soon changed that they instituted openair dentistry there never was a howl afterwardthat is from the man who was having the tooth pulled at the daily dental hour there would always be about five hundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that dental chair waiting to see the performanceand help and the moment the surgeon took a grip on the candidates tooth and began to lift every one of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and begin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had it was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous unanimous caterwaul burst out   with so big and so derisive an audience as that a sufferer wouldnt emit a sound though you pulled his head off the surgeons said that pretty often a patient was compelled to laugh in the midst of his pangs but that they had never caught one crying out after the openair exhibition was instituted  dental surgeons suggested doctors doctors suggested death death suggested skeletonsand so by a logical process the conversation melted out of one of these subjects and into the next until the topic of skeletons raised up nicodemus dodge out of the deep grave in my memory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twentyfive years when i was a boy in a printingoffice in missouri a loosejointed longlegged towheaded jeansclad countrified cub of about sixteen lounged in one day and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat whose broken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bugeaten cabbage leaf stared indifferently around then leaned his hip against the editors table crossed his mighty brogans aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth laid him low and said with composure  whars the boss  i am the boss said the editor following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its clockface with his eye  dont want anybody fur to learn the business taint likely  well i dont know would you like to learn it   paps so po he

maybe youll do nicodemus well give you a trial anyway  all right  when would you like to begin  now  so within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us and with his coat off and hard at it  beyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street was a deserted garden pathless and thickly grown with the bloomy and villainous jimpson weed and its common friend the stately sunflower in the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little frame house with but one room one window and no ceilingit had been a smokehouse a generation before nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber  the village smarties recognized a treasure in nicodemus right awaya butt to play jokes on it was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding george jones had the glory of perpetrating the first joke on him he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and winked to the crowd to come the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of nicodemuss eyebrows and eyelashes he simply said  i consider them kind of seegyars dangersomeand seemed to suspect nothing the next evening nicodemus waylaid george and poured a bucket of icewater over him  one day while nicodemus was in swimming tom mcelroy tied his clothes nicodemus made a bonfire of toms by way of retaliation  a third joke was played upon nicodemus a day or two laterhe walked up the middle aisle of the village church sunday night with a staring handbill pinned between his shoulders the joker spent the remainder of the night after church in the cellar of a deserted house and nicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward breakfasttime to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made some rough treatment would be the consequence the cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud   but i wander from the point it was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection before a very long time had elapsed the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from old shelby experimenters grew scarce and chary now the young doctor came to the rescue there was delight and applause when he proposed to scare nicodemus to death and explained how he was going to do it he had a noble new skeletonthe skeleton of the late and only local celebrity jimmy finn the village drunkarda grisly piece of property which he had bought of jimmy finn himself at auction for fifty dollars under great competition when jimmy lay very sick in the tanyard a fortnight before his death the fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton the doctor would put jimmy finns skeleton in nicodemuss bed  this was doneabout half past ten in the evening about nicodemuss usual bedtimemidnightthe village jokers came creeping stealthily through the jimpson weeds and sunflowers toward the lonely frame den they reached the window and peeped in there sat the longlegged pauper on his bed in a very short shirt and nothing more he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth and wheezing the music of camptown races out of a paperoverlaid comb which he was pressing against his mouth by him lay a new jewsharp a new top and solid indiarubber ball a handful of painted marbles five pounds of store candy and a wellgnawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of sheetmusic he had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result   just as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into the subject of fossils harris and i heard a shout and glanced up the steep hillside we saw men and women standing away up there looking frightened and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down the steep slope toward us we got out of the way and when the object landed in the road it proved to be a boy he had tripped and fallen and there was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might come  when one starts to roll down a place like that there is no stopping till the bottom is reached think of people farming on a slant which is so steep that the best you can say of itif you want to be fastidiously accurateis that it is a little steeper than a ladder and not quite so steep as a mansard roof but that is what they do some of the little farms on the hillside opposite heidelberg were stood up edgeways the boy was wonderfully jolted up and his head was bleeding from cuts which it had got from small stones on the way   harris and i gathered him up and set him on a stone and by that time the men and women had scampered down and brought his cap  men women and children flocked out from neighboring cottages and joined the crowd the pale boy was petted and stared at and commiserated and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his bruises in and such another clatter of tongues all who had seen the catastrophe were describing it at once and each trying to talk louder than his neighbor and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way up the hill called attention tripped fell rolled down among us and thus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done  harris and i were included in all the descriptions how we were coming along how hans gross shouted how we looked up startled how we saw peter coming like a cannonshot how judiciously we got out of the way and let him come and with what presence of mind we picked him up and brushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over we were as much heroes as anybody else except peter and were so recognized we were taken with peter and the populace to peters mothers cottage and there we ate bread and cheese and drank milk and beer with everybody and had a most sociable good time and when we left we had a handshake all around and were receiving and shouting back leb wohls until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly new friends forever  we accomplished our undertaking at half past eight in the evening we stepped into oppenau just eleven hours and a half out of allerheiligenone hundred and fortysix miles this is the distance by pedometer the guidebook and the imperial ordinance maps make it only ten and a quartera surprising blunder for these two authorities are usually singularly accurate in the matter of distances     chapter xxiv  i protect the empress of germany   that was a thoroughly satisfactory walkand the only one we were ever to have which was all the way downhill we took the train next morning and returned to badenbaden through fearful fogs of dust every seat was crowded too for it was sunday and consequently everybody was taking a pleasure excursion hot the sky was an ovenand a sound one too with no cracks in it to let in any air an odd time for a pleasure excursion certainly  sunday is the great day on the continentthe free day the happy day one can break the sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin  we do not work on sunday because the commandment forbids it the germans do not work on sunday because the commandment forbids it we rest on sunday because the commandment requires it the germans rest on sunday because the commandment requires it but in the definition of the word rest lies all the difference with us its sunday meaning is stay in the house and keep still with the germans its sunday and weekday meanings seem to be the samerest the tired part and never mind the other parts of the frame rest the tired part and use the means best calculated to rest that particular part thus if ones duties have kept him in the house all the week it will rest him to be out on sunday if his duties have required him to read weighty and serious matter all the week it will rest him to read light matter on sunday if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the week it will rest him to go to the theater sunday night and put in two or three hours laughing at a comedy if he is tired with digging ditches or felling trees all the week it will rest him to lie quiet in the house on sunday if the hand the arm the brain the tongue or any other member is fatigued with inanition it is not to be rested by addeding a days inanition but if a member is fatigued with exertion inanition is the right rest for it such is the way in which the germans seem to define the word rest that is to say they rest a member by recreating recuperating restoring its forces but our definition is less broad we all rest alike on sundayby secluding ourselves and keeping still whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or not the germans make the actors the preachers etc work on sunday we encourage the preachers the editors the printers etc to work on sunday and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us but i do not know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for the printer to work at his trade on sunday it must be equally wrong for the preacher to work at his since the commandment has made no exception in his favor we buy monday mornings paper and read it and thus encourage sunday printing but i shall never do it again   the germans remember the sabbathday to keep it holy by abstaining from work as commanded we keep it holy by abstaining from work as commanded and by also abstaining from play which is not commanded perhaps we constructively break the command to rest because the resting we do is in most cases only a name and not a fact  these reasonings have sufficed in a measure to mend the rent in my conscience which i made by traveling to badenbaden that sunday we arrived in time to furbish up and get to the english church before services began we arrived in considerable style too for the landlord had ordered the first carriage that could be found since there was no time to lose and our coachman was so splendidly liveried that we were probably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes why else were we honored with a pew all to ourselves away up among the very elect at the left of the chancel that was my first thought in the pew directly in front of us sat an elderly lady plainly and cheaply dressed at her side sat a young lady with a very sweet face and she also was quite simply dressed but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it would do anybodys heart good to worship in  i thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly lady was embarrassed at finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap apparel i began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her she tried to seem very busy with her prayerbook and her responses and unconscious that she was out of place but i said to myself she is not succeedingthere is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which betrays increasing embarrassment presently the saviors name was mentioned and in her flurry she lost her head completely and rose and courtesied instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did the sympathetic blood surged to my temples and i turned and gave those fine birds what i intended to be a beseeching look but my feelings got the better of me and changed it into a look which said if any of you pets of fortune laugh at this poor soul you will deserve to be flayed for it things went from bad to worse and i shortly found myself mentally taking the unfriended lady under my protection my mind was wholly upon her i forgot all about the sermon her embarrassment took stronger and stronger hold upon her she got to snapping the lid of her smellingbottleit made a loud sharp sound but in her trouble she snapped and snapped away unconscious of what she was doing the last extremity was reached when the collectionplate began its rounds the moderate people threw in pennies the nobles and the rich contributed silver but she laid a twentymark gold piece upon the bookrest before her with a sounding slap i said to myself she has parted with all her little hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying peopleit is a sorrowful spectacle i did not venture to look around this time but as the service closed i said to myself let them laugh it is their opportunity but at the door of this church they shall see her step into our fine carriage with us and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home   then she roseand all the congregation stood while she walked down the aisle she was the empress of germany  noshe had not been so much embarrassed as i had supposed my imagination had got started on the wrong scent and that is always hopeless one is sure then to go straight on misinterpreting everything clear through to the end the young lady with her imperial majesty was a maid of honorand i had been taking her for one of her boarders all the time  this is the only time i have ever had an empress under my personal protection and considering my inexperience i wonder i got through with it so well i should have been a little embarrassed myself if i had known earlier what sort of a contract i had on my hands  we found that the empress had been in badenbaden several days it is said that she never attends any but the english form of church service  i lay abed and read and rested from my journeys fatigues the remainder of that sunday but i sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon service for i never allow anything to interfere with my habit of attending church twice every sunday  there was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band play the fremersberg this piece tells one of the old legends of the region how a great noble of the middle ages got lost in the mountains and wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm until at last the faint tones of a monastery bell calling the monks to a midnight service caught his ear and he followed the direction the sounds came from and was saved a beautiful air ran through the music without ceasing sometimes loud and strong sometimes so soft that it could hardly be distinguishedbut it was always there it swung grandly along through the shrill whistling of the stormwind the rattling patter of the rain and the boom and crash of the thunder it wound soft and low through the lesser sounds the distant ones such as the throbbing of the convent bell the melodious winding of the hunters horn the distressed bayings of his dogs and the solemn chanting of the monks it rose again with a jubilant ring and mingled itself with the country songs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to cheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper the instruments imitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness more than one man started to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets of mimic rain came driving by it was hardly possible to keep from putting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and shriek and it was not possible to refrain from starting when those sudden and charmingly real thundercrashes were let loose   i suppose the fremersberg is a very lowgrade music i know indeed that it must be lowgrade music because it delighted me warmed me moved me stirred me uplifted me enraptured me that i was full of cry all the time and mad with enthusiasm my soul had never had such a scouring out since i was born the solemn and majestic chanting of the monks was not done by instruments but by mens voices and it rose and fell and rose again in that rich confusion of warring sounds and pulsing bells and the stately swing of that everpresent enchanting air and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of lowgrade music could be so divinely beautiful the great crowd which the fremersberg had called out was another evidence that it was lowgrade music for only the few are educated up to a point where highgrade music gives pleasure i have never heard enough classic music to be able to enjoy it i dislike the opera because i want to love it and cant  i suppose there are two kinds of musicone kind which one feels just as an oyster might and another sort which requires a higher faculty a faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching yet if base music gives certain of us wings why should we want any other but we do we want it because the higher and better like it we want it without giving it the necessary time and trouble so we climb into that upper tier that dresscircle by a lie we pretend we like it i know several of that sort of peopleand i propose to be one of them myself when i get home with my fine european education  and then there is painting what a red rag is to a bull turners slave ship was to me before i studied art mr ruskin is educated in art up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage last year when i was ignorant his cultivation enables himand me nowto see water in that glaring yellow mud and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame and crimson sunset glories it reconciles himand me nowto the floating of iron cablechains and other unfloatable things it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top of the mudi mean the water the most of the picture is a manifest impossibilitythat is to say a lie and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie but it enabled mr ruskin to do it and it has enabled me to do it and i am thankful for it a boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the slave ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows and said it reminded him of a tortoiseshell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes in my then uneducated state that went home to my noncultivation and i thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye mr ruskin would have said this person is an ass that is what i would say now  months after this was written i happened into the national gallery in london and soon became so fascinated with the turner pictures that i could hardly get away from the place i went there often afterward meaning to see the rest of the gallery but the turner spell was too strong it could not be shaken off however the turners which attracted me most did not remind me of the slave ship  however our business in badenbaden this time was to join our courier i had thought it best to hire one as we should be in italy by and by and we did not know the language neither did he we found him at the hotel ready to take charge of us i asked him if he was all fixed he said he was that was very true he had a trunk two small satchels and an umbrella i was to pay him fiftyfive dollars a month and railway fares on the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same it is on a man couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging this seems a great saving to the touristat first it does not occur to the tourist that somebody pays that mans board and lodging it occurs to him by and by however in one of his lucid moments     chapter xxv  hunted by the little chamois   next morning we left in the train for switzerland and reached lucerne about ten oclock at night the first discovery i made was that the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated within a day or two i made another discovery this was that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat that it is not a horned animal that it is not shy that it does not avoid human society and that there is no peril in hunting it   the chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed you do not have to go after it it comes after you it arrives in vast herds and skips and scampers all over your body inside your clothes thus it is not shy but extremely sociable it is not afraid of man on the contrary it will attack him its bite is not dangerous but neither is it pleasant its activity has not been overstated if you try to put your finger on it it will skip a thousand times its own length at one jump and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights a great deal of romantic nonsense has been written about the swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it and fearlessly indeed everybody hunts it the hunting is going on all the time day and night in bed and out of it it is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun very few people do that there is not one man in a million who can hit it with a gun it is much easier to catch it than it is to shoot it and only the experienced chamoishunter can do either another common piece of exaggeration is that about the scarcity of the chamois it is the reverse of scarce droves of one hundred million chamois are not unusual in the swiss hotels indeed they are so numerous as to be a great pest the romancers always dress up the chamoishunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all   the article of commerce called chamoisskin is another fraud nobody could skin a chamois it is too small the creature is a humbug in every way and everything which has been written about it is sentimental exaggeration it was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out for he had been one of my pet illusions all my life it had been my dream to see him in his native wilds some day and engage in the adventurous sport of chasing him from cliff to cliff it is no pleasure to me to expose him now and destroy the readers delight in him and respect for him but still it must be done for when an honest writer discovers an imposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from its place of honor no matter who suffers by it any other course would render him unworthy of the public confidence  lucerne is a charming place it begins at the waters edge with a fringe of hotels and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three sharp hills in a crowded disorderly but picturesque way offering to the eye a heapedup confusion of red roofs quaint gables dormer windows toothpick steeples with here and there a bit of ancient embattled wall bending itself over the ridges wormfashion and here and there an old square tower of heavy masonry and also here and there a town clock with only one handa hand which stretches across the dial and has no joint in it such a clock helps out the picture but you cannot tell the time of day by it between the curving line of hotels and the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade trees the lakefront is walled with masonry like a pier and has a railing to keep people from walking overboard all day long the vehicles dash along the avenue and nurses children and tourists sit in the shade of the trees or lean on the railing and watch the schools of fishes darting about in the clear water or gaze out over the lake at the stately border of snowhooded mountain peaks little pleasure steamers black with people are coming and going all the time and everywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful rowboats or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind the front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies where one may take his private luncheon in calm cool comfort and look down upon this busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the work connected with it  most of the people both male and female are in walking costume and carry alpenstocks evidently it is not considered safe to go about in switzerland even in town without an alpenstock if the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets it and stands it up in the corner when his touring in switzerland is finished he does not throw that broomstick away but lugs it home with him to the far corners of the earth although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could you see the alpenstock is his trophy his name is burned upon it and if he has climbed a hill or jumped a brook or traversed a brickyard with it he has the names of those places burned upon it too   thus it is his regimental flag so to speak and bears the record of his achievements it is worth three francs when he buys it but a bonanza could not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it there are artisans all about switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things upon the alpenstock of the tourist and observe a man is respected in switzerland according to his alpenstock i found i could get no attention there while i carried an unbranded one however branding is not expected so i soon remedied that the effect upon the next detachment of tourists was very marked i felt repaid for my trouble  half of the summer horde in switzerland is made up of english people the other half is made up of many nationalities the germans leading and the americans coming next the americans were not as numerous as i had expected they would be  the seventhirty table dhôte at the great schweitzerhof furnished a mighty array and variety of nationalities but it offered a better opportunity to observe costumes than people for the multitude sat at immensely long tables and therefore the faces were mainly seen in perspective but the breakfasts were served at small round tables and then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire we used to try to guess out the nationalities and generally succeeded tolerably well sometimes we tried to guess peoples names but that was a failure that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of practice we presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult particulars one morning i said  there is an american party  harris said  yesbut name the state  i named one state harris named another we agreed upon one thing howeverthat the young girl with the party was very beautiful and very tastefully dressed but we disagreed as to her age i said she was eighteen harris said she was twenty the dispute between us waxed warm and i finally said with a pretense of being in earnest  well there is one way to settle the matteri will go and ask her   harris said sarcastically certainly that is the thing to do all you need to do is to use the common formula over here go and say im an american of course she will be glad to see you  then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to speak to her  i said i was only talkingi didnt intend to approach her but i see that you do not know what an intrepid person i am i am not afraid of any woman that walks i will go and speak to this young girl  the thing i had in my mind was not difficult i meant to address her in the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me and when she should reply that the name i mentioned was not the name she bore i meant to beg pardon again most respectfully and retire there would be no harm done i walked to her table bowed to the gentleman then turned to her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed  i knew i wasnt mistakeni told john it was you john said it probably wasnt but i knew i was right i said you would recognize me presently and come over and im glad you did for i shouldnt have felt much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me sit down sit downhow odd it isyou are the last person i was ever expecting to see again   this was a stupefying surprise it took my wits clear away for an instant however we shook hands cordially all around and i sat down but truly this was the tightest place i ever was in i seemed to vaguely remember the girls face now but i had no idea where i had seen it before or what name belonged with it i immediately tried to get up a diversion about swiss scenery to keep her from launching into topics that might betray that i did not know her but it was of no use she went right along upon matters which interested her more  oh dear what a night that was when the sea washed the forward boats awaydo you remember it  oh dont i said ibut i didnt i wished the sea had washed the rudder and the smokestack and the captain awaythen i could have located this questioner  and dont you remember how frightened poor mary was and how she cried  indeed i do said i dear me how it all comes back  i fervently wished it would come backbut my memory was a blank the wise way would have been to frankly own up but i could not bring myself to do that after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her so i went on deeper and deeper into the mire hoping for a chance clue but never getting one the unrecognizable continued with vivacity  do you know george married mary after all  why no did he  indeed he did he said he did not believe she was half as much to blame as her father was and i thought he was right didnt you  of course he was it was a perfectly plain case i always said so  why no you didntat least that summer  oh no not that summer no you are perfectly right about that it was the following winter that i said it  well as it turned out mary was not in the least to blame it was all her fathers faultat least his and old darleys  it was necessary to say somethingso i said  i always regarded darley as a troublesome old thing  so he was but then they always had a great affection for him although he had so many eccentricities you remember that when the weather was the least cold he would try to come into the house  i was rather afraid to proceed evidently darley was not a manhe must be some other kind of animalpossibly a dog maybe an elephant however tails are common to all animals so i ventured to say  and what a tail he had  one he had a thousand  this was bewildering i did not quite know what to say so i only said  yes he was rather well fixed in the matter of tails  for a negro and a crazy one at that i should say he was said she  it was getting pretty sultry for me i said to myself is it possible she is going to stop there and wait for me to speak if she does the conversation is blocked a negro with a thousand tails is a topic which a person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or less preparation as to diving rashly into such a vast subject  but here to my gratitude she interrupted my thoughts by saying  yes when it came to tales of his crazy woes there was simply no end to them if anybody would listen his own quarters were comfortable enough but when the weather was cold the family were sure to have his companynothing could keep him out of the house but they always bore it kindly because he had saved toms life years before you remember tom  oh perfectly fine fellow he was too  yes he was and what a pretty little thing his child was  you may well say that i never saw a prettier child  i used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it  so did i  you named it what was that name i cant call it to mind  it appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin here i would have given something to know what the childs was however i had the good luck to think of a name that would fit either sexso i brought it out  i named it frances  from a relative i suppose but you named the one that died tooone that i never saw what did you call that one  i was out of neutral names but as the child was dead and she had never seen it i thought i might risk a name for it and trust to luck therefore i said  i called that one thomas henry  she said musingly  that is very singular  very singular  i sat still and let the cold sweat run down i was in a good deal of trouble but i believed i could worry through if she wouldnt ask me to name any more children i wondered where the lightning was going to strike next she was still ruminating over that last childs title but presently she said  i have always been sorry you were away at the timei would have had you name my child  your child are you married  i have been married thirteen years  christened you mean  no married the youth by your side is my son  it seems incredibleeven impossible i do not mean any harm by it but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteenthat is to say will you tell me how old you are  i was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about that was my birthday  that did not help matters much as i did not know the date of the storm i tried to think of some noncommittal thing to say to keep up my end of the talk and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences as little noticeable as possible but i seemed to be about out of noncommittal things i was about to say you havent changed a bit since thenbut that was risky i thought of saying you have improved ever so much since thenbut that wouldnt answer of course i was about to try a shy at the weather for a saving change when the girl slipped in ahead of me and said  how i have enjoyed this talk over those happy old timeshavent you  i never have spent such a halfhour in all my life before said i with emotion and i could have added with a near approach to truth and i would rather be scalped than spend another one like it i was holily grateful to be through with the ordeal and was about to make my goodbys and get out when the girl said  but there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me  why what is that  that dead childs name what did you say it was  here was another balmy place to be in i had forgotten the childs name i hadnt imagined it would be needed again however i had to pretend to know anyway so i said  joseph william  the youth at my side corrected me and said  no thomas henry  i thanked himin wordsand said with trepidation  o yesi was thinking of another child that i namedi have named a great many and i get them confusedthis one was named henry thompson  thomas henry calmly interposed the boy  i thanked him againstrictly in wordsand stammered out  thomas henryyes thomas henry was the poor childs name i named him for thomaserthomas carlyle the great author you knowand henryererhenry the eighth the parents were very grateful to have a child named thomas henry  that makes it more singular than ever murmured my beautiful friend  does it why  because when the parents speak of that child now they always call it susan amelia  that spiked my gun i could not say anything i was entirely out of verbal obliquities to go further would be to lie and that i would not do so i simply sat still and sufferedsat mutely and resignedly there and sizzledfor i was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said  i have enjoyed this talk over old times but you have not i saw very soon that you were only pretending to know me and so as i had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning i made up my mind to punish you and i have succeeded pretty well i was glad to see that you knew george and tom and darley for i had never heard of them before and therefore could not be sure that you had and i was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children too one can get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly mary and the storm and the sweeping away of the forward boats were factsall the rest was fiction mary was my sister her full name was mary  now do you remember me  yes i said i do remember you now and you are as hardheaded as you were thirteen years ago in that ship else you wouldnt have punished me so you havent changed your nature nor your person in any way at all you look as young as you did then you are just as beautiful as you were then and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine boy thereif that speech moves you any lets fly the flag of truce with the understanding that i am conquered and confess it  all of which was agreed to and accomplished on the spot when i went back to harris i said  now you see what a person with talent and address can do  excuse me i see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can do the idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers that way and talking for half an hour why i never heard of a man in his right mind doing such a thing before what did you say to them   i never said any harm i merely asked the girl what her name was  i dont doubt it upon my word i dont i think you were capable of it it was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition of yourself but you know i couldnt really believe you would do such an inexcusable thing what will those people think of us but how did you say iti mean the manner of it i hope you were not abrupt  no i was careful about that i said my friend and i would like to know what your name is if you dont mind  no that was not abrupt there is a polish about it that does you infinite credit and i am glad you put me in that was a delicate attention which i appreciate at its full value what did she do  she didnt do anything in particular she told me her name  simply told you her name do you mean to say she did not show any surprise  well now i come to think she did show something maybe it was surprise i hadnt thought of thati took it for gratification  oh undoubtedly you were right it must have been gratification it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that then what did you do  i offered my hand and the party gave me a shake  i saw it i did not believe my own eyes at the time did the gentleman say anything about cutting your throat  no they all seemed glad to see me as far as i could judge  and do you know i believe they were i think they said to themselves doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeperlet us amuse ourselves with him there is no other way of accounting for their facile docility you sat down did they ask you to sit down  no they did not ask me but i suppose they did not think of it  you have an unerring instinct what else did you do what did you talk about  well i asked the girl how old she was  undoubtedly your delicacy is beyond praise go on go ondont mind my apparent miseryi always look so when i am steeped in a profound and reverent joy go onshe told you her age  yes she told me her age and all about her mother and her grandmother and her other relations and all about herself  did she volunteer these statistics  no not exactly that i asked the questions and she answered them  this is divine go onit is not possible that you forgot to inquire into her politics  no i thought of that she is a democrat her husband is a republican and both of them are baptists  her husband is that child married  she is not a child she is married and that is her husband who is there with her  has she any children  yesseven and a half  that is impossible  no she has them she told me herself  well but seven and a half how do you make out the half where does the half come in  there is a child which she had by another husbandnot this one but another oneso it is a stepchild and they do not count in full measure  another husband has she another husband  yes four this one is number four  i dont believe a word of it it is impossible upon its face is that boy there her brother  no that is her son he is her youngest he is not as old as he looked he is only eleven and a half  these things are all manifestly impossible this is a wretched business it is a plain case they simply took your measure and concluded to fill you up they seem to have succeeded i am glad i am not in the mess they may at least be charitable enough to think there aint a pair of us are they going to stay here long  no they leave before noon  there is one man who is deeply grateful for that how did you find out you asked i suppose  no along at first i inquired into their plans in a general way and they said they were going to be here a week and make trips round about but toward the end of the interview when i said you and i would tour around with them with pleasure and offered to bring you over and introduce you they hesitated a little and asked if you were from the same establishment that i was i said you were and then they said they had changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and visit a sick relative in siberia  ah me you struck the summit you struck the loftiest altitude of stupidity that human effort has ever reached you shall have a monument of jackasses skulls as high as the strasburg spire if you die before i do they wanted to know i was from the same establishment that you hailed from did they what did they mean by establishment  i dont know it never occurred to me to ask  well i know they meant an asyluman idiot asylum do you understand so they do think theres a pair of us after all now what do you think of yourself  well i dont know i didnt know i was doing any harm i didnt mean to do any harm they were very nice people and they seemed to like me  harris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroomto break some furniture he said he was a singularly irascible man any little thing would disturb his temper  i had been well scorched by the young woman but no matter i took it out on harris one should always get even in some way else the sore place will go on hurting     chapter xxvi  the nest of the cuckooclock   the hofkirche is celebrated for its organ concerts all summer long the tourists flock to that church about six oclock in the evening and pay their franc and listen to the noise they dont stay to hear all of it but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor meeting late comers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way this tramping back and forth is kept up nearly all the time and is accented by the continuous slamming of the door and the coughing and barking and sneezing of the crowd meantime the big organ is booming and crashing and thundering away doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and best organ in europe and that a tight little box of a church is the most favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in it is true there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally but the tramptramp of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of them so to speak then right away the organist would let go another avalanche  the commerce of lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir sort the shops are packed with alpine crystals photographs of scenery and wooden and ivory carvings i will not conceal the fact that miniature figures of the lion of lucerne are to be had in them millions of them but they are libels upon him every one of them there is a subtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the copyist cannot get even the sun fails to get it both the photographer and the carver give you a dying lion and that is all the shape is right the attitude is right the proportions are right but that indescribable something which makes the lion of lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world is wanting  the lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low clifffor he is carved from the living rock of the cliff his size is colossal his attitude is noble his head is bowed the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of france vines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind and a clear stream trickles from above and empties into a pond at the base and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored among the waterlilies   around about are green trees and grass the place is a sheltered reposeful woodland nook remote from noise and stir and confusionand all this is fitting for lions do die in such places and not on granite pedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings the lion of lucerne would be impressive anywhere but nowhere so impressive as where he is  martyrdom is the luckiest fate that can befall some people louis xvi did not die in his bed consequently history is very gentle with him she is charitable toward his failings and she finds in him high virtues which are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in kings she makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit the heart of a female saint and a wrong head none of these qualities are kingly but the last taken together they make a character which would have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had the ill luck to miss martyrdom with the best intentions to do the right thing he always managed to do the wrong one moreover nothing could get the female saint out of him he knew well enough that in national emergencies he must not consider how he ought to act as a man but how he ought to act as a king so he honestly tried to sink the man and be the kingbut it was a failure he only succeeded in being the female saint he was not instant in season but out of season he could not be persuaded to do a thing while it could do any goodhe was iron he was adamant in his stubbornness thenbut as soon as the thing had reached a point where it would be positively harmful to do it do it he would and nothing could stop him he did not do it because it would be harmful but because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good which it would have done if applied earlier his comprehension was always a train or two behindhand if a national toe required amputating he could not see that it needed anything more than poulticing when others saw that the mortification had reached the knee he first perceived that the toe needed cutting offso he cut it off and he severed the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached the thigh he was good and honest and well meaning in the matter of chasing national diseases but he never could overtake one as a private man he would have been lovable but viewed as a king he was strictly contemptible  his was a most unroyal career but the most pitiable spectacle in it was his sentimental treachery to his swiss guard on that memorable 10th of august when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause and forbade them to shed the sacred french blood purporting to be flowing in the veins of the redcapped mob of miscreants that was raging around the palace he meant to be kingly but he was only the female saint once more some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit of saint louis had descended upon him it must have found pretty cramped quarters if napoleon the first had stood in the shoes of louis xvi that day instead of being merely a casual and unknown lookeron there would be no lion of lucerne now but there would be a wellstocked communist graveyard in paris which would answer just as well to remember the 10th of august by  martyrdom made a saint of mary queen of scots three hundred years ago and she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet martyrdom made a saint of the trivial and foolish marie antoinette and her biographers still keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day while unconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only calamitous instinct which her husband lacked she suppliedthe instinct to root out and get rid of an honest able and loyal official wherever she found him the hideous but beneficent french revolution would have been deferred or would have fallen short of completeness or even might not have happened at all if marie antoinette had made the unwise mistake of not being born the world owes a great deal to the french revolution and consequently to its two chief promoters louis the poor in spirit and his queen  we did not buy any wooden images of the lion nor any ivory or ebony or marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones or even any photographic slanders of him the truth is these copies were so common so universal in the shops and everywhere that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually becomes to the harassed ear in lucerne too the wood carvings of other sorts which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home soon began to fatigue us we grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around clockfaces and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks or lying upon them in family groups or peering alertly up from behind them the first day i would have bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if i had the moneyand i did buy threebut on the third day the disease had run its course i had convalesced and was in the market once moretrying to sell however i had no luck which was just as well for the things will be pretty enough no doubt when i get them home  for years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock now here i was at last right in the creatures home so wherever i went that distressing hoohoo hoohoo hoohoo was always in my ears for a nervous man this was a fine state of things some sounds are hatefuler than others but no sound is quite so inane and silly and aggravating as the hoohoo of a cuckoo clock i think i bought one and am carrying it home to a certain person for i have always said that if the opportunity ever happened i would do that man an ill turn   what i meant was that i would break one of his legs or something of that sort but in lucerne i instantly saw that i could impair his mind that would be more lasting and more satisfactory every way so i bought the cuckoo clock and if i ever get home with it he is my meat as they say in the mines i thought of another candidatea bookreviewer whom i could name if i wanted tobut after thinking it over i didnt buy him a clock i couldnt injure his mind  we visited the two long covered wooden bridges which span the green and brilliant reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out of the lake these rambling swaybacked tunnels are very attractive things with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting water they contain two or three hundred queer old pictures by old swiss mastersold boss signpainters who flourished before the decadence of art  the lake is alive with fishes plainly visible to the eye for the water is very clear the parapets in front of the hotels were usually fringed with fishers of all ages one day i thought i would stop and see a fish caught the result brought back to my mind very forcibly a circumstance which i had not thought of before for twelve years this one  the man who put up at gadsbys  when my odd friend riley and i were newspaper correspondents in washington in the winter of 67 we were coming down pennsylvania avenue one night near midnight in a driving storm of snow when the flash of a streetlamp fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in the opposite direction this is lucky you are mr riley aint you  riley was the most selfpossessed and solemnly deliberate person in the republic he stopped looked his man over from head to foot and finally said  i am mr riley did you happen to be looking for me  thats just what i was doing said the man joyously and its the biggest luck in the world that ive found you my name is lykins im one of the teachers of the high schoolsan francisco as soon as i heard the san francisco postmastership was vacant i made up my mind to get itand here i am  yes said riley slowly as you have remarked  mr lykins  here you are and have you got it  well not exactly got it but the next thing to it ive brought a petition signed by the superintendent of public instruction and all the teachers and by more than two hundred other people now i want you if youll be so good to go around with me to the pacific delegation for i want to rush this thing through and get along home  if the matter is so pressing you will prefer that we visit the delegation tonight said riley in a voice which had nothing mocking in itto an unaccustomed ear  oh tonight by all means i havent got any time to fool around i want their promise before i go to bedi aint the talking kind im the doing kind  yes  youve come to the right place for that when did you arrive  just an hour ago  when are you intending to leave  for new york tomorrow eveningfor san francisco next morning  just so what are you going to do tomorrow  do why ive got to go to the president with the petition and the delegation and get the appointment havent i  yes  very true  that is correct and then what  executive session of the senate at 2 pmgot to get the appointment confirmedi reckon youll grant that  yes  yes said riley meditatively you are right again then you take the train for new york in the evening and the steamer for san francisco next morning  thats itthats the way i map it out  riley considered a while and then said  you couldnt stay  a day  well say two days longer  bless your soul no its not my style i aint a man to go fooling aroundim a man that does things i tell you  the storm was raging the thick snow blowing in gusts riley stood silent apparently deep in a reverie during a minute or more then he looked up and said  have you ever heard about that man who put up at gadsbys once  but i see you havent  he backed mr lykins against an iron fence buttonholed him fastened him with his eye like the ancient mariner and proceeded to unfold his narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched comfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a wintry midnight tempest   i will tell you about that man it was in jacksons time gadsbys was the principal hotel then well this man arrived from tennessee about nine oclock one morning with a black coachman and a splendid fourhorse carriage and an elegant dog which he was evidently fond of and proud of he drove up before gadsbys and the clerk and the landlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him but he said never mind and jumped out and told the coachman to wait   said he hadnt time to take anything to eat he only had a little claim against the government to collect would run across the way to the treasury and fetch the money and then get right along back to tennessee for he was in considerable of a hurry  well about eleven oclock that night he came back and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses upsaid he would collect the claim in the morning this was in january you understandjanuary 1834the 3d of januarywednesday   well on the 5th of february he sold the fine carriage and bought a cheap secondhand onesaid it would answer just as well to take the money home in and he didnt care for style  on the 11th of august he sold a pair of the fine horsessaid hed often thought a pair was better than four to go over the rough mountain roads with where a body had to be careful about his drivingand there wasnt so much of his claim but he could lug the money home with a pair easy enough   on the 13th of december he sold another horsesaid two warnt necessary to drag that old light vehicle within fact one could snatch it along faster than was absolutely necessary now that it was good solid winter weather and the roads in splendid condition   on the 17th of february 1835 he sold the old carriage and bought a cheap secondhand buggysaid a buggy was just the trick to skim along mushy slushy early spring roads with and he had always wanted to try a buggy on those mountain roads anyway   on the 1st august he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old sulkysaid he just wanted to see those green tennesseans stare and gawk when they saw him come aripping along in a sulkydidnt believe theyd ever heard of a sulky in their lives   well on the 29th of august he sold his colored coachmansaid he didnt need a coachman for a sulkywouldnt be room enough for two in it anywayand besides it wasnt every day that providence sent a man a fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a thirdrate negro as thatbeen wanting to get rid of the creature for years but didnt like to throw him away   eighteen months laterthat is to say on the 15th of february 1837he sold the sulky and bought a saddlesaid horsebackriding was what the doctor had always recommended him to take and dogd if he wanted to risk his neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in the dead of winter not if he knew himself   on the 9th of april he sold the saddlesaid he wasnt going to risk his life with any perishable saddlegirth that ever was made over a rainy miry april road while he could ride bareback and know and feel he was safealways had despised to ride on a saddle anyway   on the 24th of april he sold his horsesaid im just fiftyseven today hale and heartyit would be a pretty howdydo for me to be wasting such a trip as that and such weather as this on a horse when there aint anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through the fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains to a man that is a manand i can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle anyway when its collected so tomorrow ill be up bright and early make my little old collection and mosey off to tennessee on my own hind legs with a rousing goodby to gadsbys   on the 22d of june he sold his dogsaid dern a dog anyway where youre just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the summer woods and hillsperfect nuisancechases the squirrels barks at everything goes acapering and splattering around in the fordsman cant get any chance to reflect and enjoy natureand id a blamed sight ruther carry the claim myself its a mighty sight safer a dogs mighty uncertain in a financial wayalways noticed itwell goodby boyslast callim off for tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart early in the morning   there was a pause and a silenceexcept the noise of the wind and the pelting snow mr lykins said impatiently  well  riley said  wellthat was thirty years ago  very well very wellwhat of it  im great friends with that old patriarch he comes every evening to tell me goodby i saw him an hour agohes off for tennessee early tomorrow morningas usual said he calculated to get his claim through and be off before nightowls like me have turned out of bed the tears were in his eyes he was so glad he was going to see his old tennessee and his friends once more  another silent pause the stranger broke it  is that all  that is all  well for the time of night and the kind of night it seems to me the story was full long enough but whats it all for  oh nothing in particular  well wheres the point of it  oh there isnt any particular point to it only if you are not in too much of a hurry to rush off to san francisco with that postoffice appointment mr lykins id advise you to put up at gadsbys for a spell and take it easy goodby god bless you  so saying riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished schoolteacher standing there a musing and motionless snow image shining in the broad glow of the streetlamp  he never got that postoffice  to go back to lucerne and its fishers i concluded after about nine hours waiting that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees something hook one of those wellfed and experienced fishes will find it wisdom to put up at gadsbys and take it easy it is likely that a fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years but no matter the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long just the same and seems to enjoy it one may see the fisherloafers just as thick and contented and happy and patient all along the seine at paris but tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times is a thing they dont fish for at allthe recent dog and the translated cat     chapter xxvii  i spare an awful bore   close by the lion of lucerne is what they call the glacier gardenand it is the only one in the world it is on high ground four or five years ago some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came upon this interesting relic of a longdeparted age scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon the soil was removed and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey this track was perforated by huge potshaped holes in the bedrock formed by the furious washingaround in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers these huge round boulders still remain in the holes they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the longcontinued chafing which they gave each other in those old days   it took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that vigorous way the neighboring country had a very different shape at that timethe valleys have risen up and become hills since and the hills have become valleys the boulders discovered in the pots had traveled a great distance for there is no rock like them nearer than the distant rhone glacier  for some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake lucerne and at the piledup masses of snowmountains that border it all aroundan enticing spectacle this last for there is a strange and fascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snowpeak with the sun blazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching itbut finally we concluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat and a dash on foot at the rigi very well we had a delightful trip to fluelen on a breezy sunny day everybody sat on the upper deck on benches under an awning everybody talked laughed and exclaimed at the wonderful scenery in truth a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of pleasuring   the mountains were a neverceasing marvel sometimes they rose straight up out of the lake and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way not snowclad mountains these yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the clouds and veil their foreheads in them they were not barren and repulsive but clothed in green and restful and pleasant to the eye and they were so almost straightupanddown sometimes that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface yet there are paths and the swiss people go up and down them every day   sometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of the huge shiphouses in dockyardsthen high aloft toward the sky it took a little stronger inclination like that of a mansard roofand perched on this dizzy mansard ones eye detected little things like martin boxes and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of peasantsan airy place for a home truly and suppose a peasant should walk in his sleep or his child should fall out of the front yardthe friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those cloudheights before they found the remains and yet those faraway homes looked ever so seductive they were so remote from the troubled world they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreamssurely no one who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner level  we swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake among these colossal green walls enjoying new delights always as the stately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself behind us and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting suddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating jungfrau or some kindred giant looming head and shoulders above a tumbled waste of lesser alps  once while i was hungrily taking in one of these surprises and doing my best to get all i possibly could of it while it should last i was interrupted by a young and carefree voice  youre an american i thinksom i  he was about eighteen or possibly nineteen slender and of medium height open frank happy face a restless but independent eye a snub nose which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky newborn mustache below it until it should be introduced a loosely hung jaw calculated to work easily in the sockets he wore a lowcrowned narrowbrimmed straw hat with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front nobby shorttailed coat pantaloons vest all trim and neat and up with the fashion redstriped stockings very lowquarter patentleather shoes tied with black ribbon blue ribbon around his neck wideopen collar tiny diamond studs wrinkleless kids projecting cuffs fastened with large oxidized silver sleevebuttons bearing the device of a dogs faceenglish pug he carried a slim cane surmounted with an english pugs head with red glass eyes under his arm he carried a german grammarottos his hair was short straight and smooth and presently when he turned his head a moment i saw that it was nicely parted behind he took a cigarette out of a dainty box stuck it into a meerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case and reached for my cigar while he was lighting i said  yesi am an american   i knew iti can always tell them what ship did you come over in  holsatia  we came in the bataviacunard you know what kind of passage did you have  tolerably rough  so did we captain said hed hardly ever seen it rougher where are you from  new england  som i im from new bloomfield anybody with you  yesa friend  our whole familys along its awful slow going

uninjured tooi had the murderous impulse to harpoon him in the back with my alpenstock but as i raised the weapon the disposition left me i found i hadnt the heart to kill him he was such a joyous innocent goodnatured numbskull  half an hour later i was sitting on a bench inspecting with strong interest a noble monolith which we were skimming bya monolith not shaped by man but by natures free great handa massy pyramidal rock eighty feet high devised by nature ten million years ago against the day when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument the time came at last and now this grand remembrancer bears schillers name in huge letters upon its face curiously enough this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way it is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys and painted all over it in blue letters bigger than those in schillers name these words try sozodont buy sun stove polish helmbolds buchu try benzaline for the blood he was captured and it turned out that he was an american upon his trial the judge said to him  you are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult nature and through her natures god if by so doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket but here the case is different because you are a foreigner and ignorant i will make your sentence light if you were a native i would deal strenuously with you hear and obey you will immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the schiller monument you pay a fine of ten thousand francs you will suffer two years imprisonment at hard labor you will then be horsewhipped tarred and feathered deprived of your ears ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton and banished forever the severest penalties are omitted in your casenot as a grace to you but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you birth   the steamers benches were ranged back to back across the deck my back hair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of ladies presently they were addressed by some one and i overheard this conversation  you are americans i think som i  yeswe are americans  i knew iti can always tell them what ship did you come over in  city of chester  oh yesinman line we came in the bataviacunard you know what kind of a passage did you have  pretty fair  that was luck we had

i believe that is all bonjouri am very glad to have made your acquaintance ladies guten tag     chapter xxviii  the jodel and its native wilds   the rigikulm is an imposing alpine mass six thousand feet high which stands by itself and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes green valleys and snowy mountainsa compact and magnificent picture three hundred miles in circumference the ascent is made by rail or horseback or on foot as one may prefer i and my agent panoplied ourselves in walkingcostume one bright morning and started down the lake on the steamboat we got ashore at the village of waeggis threequarters of an hour distant from lucerne this village is at the foot of the mountain  we were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mulepath and then the talk began to flow as usual it was twelve oclock noon and a breezy cloudless day the ascent was gradual and the glimpses from under the curtaining boughs of blue water and tiny sailboats and beetling cliffs were as charming as glimpses of dreamland all the circumstances were perfectand the anticipations too for we should soon be enjoying for the first time that wonderful spectacle an alpine sunrisethe object of our journey there was apparently no real need for hurry for the guidebook made the walkingdistance from waeggis to the summit only three hours and a quarter i say apparently because the guidebook had already fooled us onceabout the distance from allerheiligen to oppenauand for aught i knew it might be getting ready to fool us again we were only certain as to the altitudeswe calculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the bottom to the top the summit is six thousand feet above the sea but only fortyfive hundred feet above the lake when we had walked half an hour we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking so we cleared for action that is to say we got a boy whom we met to carry our alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us that left us free for business i suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch out on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy was used to for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him by the job or by the year we told him he could move along if he was in a hurry he said he wasnt in such a very particular hurry but he wanted to get to the top while he was young   we told him to clear out then and leave the things at the uppermost hotel and say we should be along presently he said he would secure us a hotel if he could but if they were all full he would ask them to build another one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we arrived still gently chaffing us he pushed ahead up the trail and soon disappeared by six oclock we were pretty high up in the air and the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and interest we halted awhile at a little public house where we had bread and cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk out on the porch with the big panorama all before usand then moved on again   ten minutes afterward we met a hot redfaced man plunging down the mountain making mighty strides swinging his alpenstock ahead of him and taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these big strides he stopped fanned himself with his hat swabbed the perspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief panted a moment or two and asked how far to waeggis i said three hours he looked surprised and said  why it seems as if i could toss a biscuit into the lake from here its so close by is that an inn there  i said it was  well said he i cant stand another three hours ive had enough today ill take a bed there  i asked  are we nearly to the top  nearly to the top why bless your soul you havent really started yet  i said we would put up at the inn too so we turned back and ordered a hot supper and had quite a jolly evening of it with this englishman  the german landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds and when i and my agent turned in it was with the resolution to be up early and make the utmost of our first alpine sunrise but of course we were dead tired and slept like policemen so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the window it was already too late because it was half past eleven it was a sharp disappointment however we ordered breakfast and told the landlady to call the englishman but she said he was already up and off at daybreakand swearing like mad about something or other we could not find out what the matter was he had asked the landlady the altitude of her place above the level of the lake and she told him fourteen hundred and ninetyfive feet that was all that was said then he lost his temper he said that between fools and guidebooks a man could acquire ignorance enough in twentyfour hours in a country like this to last him a year harris believed our boy had been loading him up with misinformation and this was probably the case for his epithet described that boy to a dot  we got under way about the turn of noon and pulled out for the summit again with a fresh and vigorous step when we had gone about two hundred yards and stopped to rest i glanced to the left while i was lighting my pipe and in the distance detected a long worm of black smoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain of course that was the locomotive we propped ourselves on our elbows at once to gaze for we had never seen a mountain railway yet presently we could make out the train it seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a sharp slant like the roof of a housebut there it was and it was doing that very miracle  in the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where the little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold them down to the earth when the great storms rage the country was wild and rocky about here but there were plenty of trees plenty of moss and grass  away off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages and now for the first time we could observe the real difference between their proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they slept when one is in one of those villages it seems spacious and its houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that overhangs thembut from our altitude what a change the mountains were bigger and grander than ever as they stood there thinking their solemn thoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds but the villages at their feetwhen the painstaking eye could trace them up and find themwere so reduced almost invisible and lay so flat against the ground that the exactest simile i can devise is to compare them to antdeposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a cathedral the steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices were diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys the sailboats and rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups of lilies and ride to court on the backs of bumblebees   presently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious lul  l  l l l llullullaheeooo pealing joyously from a near but invisible source and recognized that we were hearing for the first time the famous alpine jodel in its own native wilds and we recognized also that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and falsetto which at home we call tyrolese warbling   the jodeling pronounced yodlingemphasis on the o continued and was very pleasant and inspiriting to hear now the jodeler appeareda shepherd boy of sixteenand in our gladness and gratitude we gave him a franc to jodel some more so he jodeled and we listened we moved on presently and he generously jodeled us out of sight after about fifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling and gave him half a franc to keep it up he also jodeled us out of sight after that we found a jodeler every ten minutes we gave the first one eight cents the second one six cents the third one four the fourth one a penny contributed nothing to nos 5 6 and 7 and during the remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers at a franc apiece not to jodel any more there is somewhat too much of the jodeling in the alps  about the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the felsenthor formed by two enormous upright rocks with a third lying across the top there was a very attractive little hotel close by but our energies were not conquered yet so we went on   three hours afterward we came to the railwaytrack it was planted straight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a house and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed to travel up it or down it either  during the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors with icecold water from clear streams the only really satisfying water we had tasted since we left home for at the hotels on the continent they merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in and that only modifies its hotness doesnt make it cold water can only be made cold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or a closed icepitcher europeans say icewater impairs digestion how do they knowthey never drink any  at ten minutes past six we reached the kaltbad station where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery we were pretty well fagged out now but as we did not wish to miss the alpine sunrise we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed it was unspeakably comfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool damp sheets and how we did sleepfor there is no opiate like alpine pedestrianism   in the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant and ran and stripped aside the windowcurtains but we suffered a bitter disappointment again it was already half past three in the afternoon  we dressed sullenly and in ill spirits each accusing the other of oversleeping harris said if we had brought the courier along as we ought to have done we should not have missed these sunrises i said he knew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the courier and i added that we were having trouble enough to take care of ourselves on this climb without having to take care of a courier besides  during breakfast our spirits came up a little since we found by this guidebook that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise but is roused betimes by a man who goes through the halls with a great alpine horn blowing blasts that would raise the dead and there was another consoling thing the guidebook said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much but seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an indian this was good this would be romantic two hundred and fifty people grouped on the windy summit with their hair flying and their red blankets flapping in the solemn presence of the coming sun would be a striking and memorable spectacle so it was good luck not ill luck that we had missed those other sunrises  we were informed by the guidebook that we were now 3228 feet above the level of the laketherefore full twothirds of our journey had been accomplished we got away at a quarter past four pm a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided one track went straight up the steep hill the other one turned square off to the right with a very slight grade we took the latter and followed it more than a mile turned a rocky corner and came in sight of a handsome new hotel if we had gone on we should have arrived at the summit but harris preferred to ask a lot of questionsas usual of a man who didnt know anythingand he told us to go back and follow the other route we did so we could ill afford this loss of time  we climbed and climbed and we kept on climbing we reached about forty summits but there was always another one just ahead it came on to rain and it rained in dead earnest we were soaked through and it was bitter cold next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely and we took to the railwayties to keep from getting lost sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the lefthand side of the track but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy we gasped and jumped for the ties again   the night shut down dark and drizzly and cold about eight in the evening the fog lifted and showed us a wellworn path which led up a very steep rise to the left we took it and as soon as we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility the fog shut down on us once more  we were in a bleak unsheltered place now and had to trudge right along in order to keep warm though we rather expected to go over a precipice sooner or later about nine oclock we made an important discoverythat we were not in any path we groped around a while on our hands and knees but we could not find it so we sat down in the mud and the wet scant grass to wait  we were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant was smothered in the fog again it was really the hotel we were after monstrously magnified by the fog but we took it for the face of a precipice and decided not to try to claw up it  we sat there an hour with chattering teeth and quivering bodies and quarreled over all sorts of trifles but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railwaytrack we sat with our backs to the precipice because what little wind there was came from that quarter at some time or other the fog thinned a little we did not know when for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show but at last harris happened to look around and there stood a huge dim spectral hotel where the precipice had been one could faintly discern the windows and chimneys and a dull blur of lights our first emotion was deep unutterable gratitude our next was a foolish rage born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible threequarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold puddles quarreling   yes it was the rigikulm hotelthe one that occupies the extreme summit and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen glinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder in lucerne the crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the surly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times but by mollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility we finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for us  we got into some dry clothing and while our supper was preparing we loafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawingrooms one of which had a stove in it this stove was in a corner and densely walled around with people we could not get near the fire so we moved at large in the artic spaces among a multitude of people who sat silent smileless forlorn and shiveringthinking what fools they were to come perhaps there were some americans and some germans but one could see that the great majority were english  we lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd to see what was going on it was a mementomagazine the tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of papercutters marked souvenir of the rigi with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things similarly marked i was going to buy a papercutter but i believed i could remember the cold comfort of the rigikulm without it so i smothered the impulse  supper warmed us and we went immediately to bedbut first as mr baedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which they may find in his guidebooks i dropped him a line to inform him he missed it by just about three days i had previously informed him of his mistake about the distance from allerheiligen to oppenau and had also informed the ordnance depart of the german government of the same error in the imperial maps i will add here that i never got any answer to those letters or any thanks from either of those sources and what is still more discourteous these corrections have not been made either in the maps or the guidebooks but i will write again when i get time for my letters may have miscarried  we curled up in the clammy beds and went to sleep without rocking we were so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till the blooming blasts of the alpine horn aroused us   it may well be imagined that we did not lose any time we snatched on a few odds and ends of clothing cocooned ourselves in the proper red blankets and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind bareheaded we saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the summit a hundred yards away and made for it we rushed up the stairs to the top of this scaffolding and stood there above the vast outlying world with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the fierce breeze   fifteen minutes too late at last said harris in a vexed voice the sun is clear above the horizon  no matter i said it is a most magnificent spectacle and we will see it do the rest of its rising anyway  in a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us and dead to everything else the great cloudbarred disk of the sun stood just above a limitless expanse of tossing whitecapsso to speaka billowy chaos of massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow and flooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors while through rifts in a black cloudbank above the sun radiating lances of diamond dust shot to the zenith the cloven valleys of the lower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their crags and ribs and ragged forests and turned all the forbidding region into a soft and rich and sensuous paradise  we could not speak we could hardly breathe we could only gaze in drunken ecstasy and drink in it presently harris exclaimed  whynation its going down  perfectly true we had missed the morning hornblow and slept all day this was stupefying  harris said  look here the sun isnt the spectacleits usstacked up here on top of this gallows in these idiotic blankets and two hundred and fifty welldressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not caring a straw whether the sun rises or sets as long as theyve got such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their memorandumbooks they seem to be laughing their ribs loose and theres one girl there that appears to be going all to pieces i never saw such a man as you before i think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass  what have i done i answered with heat  what have you done youve got up at half past seven oclock in the evening to see the sun rise thats what youve done  and have you done any better id like to know ive always used to get up with the lark till i came under the petrifying influence of your turgid intellect  you used to get up with the larkoh no doubtyoull get up with the hangman one of these days but you ought to be ashamed to be jawing here like this in a red blanket on a fortyfoot scaffold on top of the alps and no end of people down here to boot this isnt any place for an exhibition of temper  and so the customary quarrel went on when the sun was fairly down we slipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming and went to bed again we had encountered the hornblower on the way and he had tried to collect compensation not only for announcing the sunset which we did see but for the sunrise which we had totally missed but we said no we only took our solar rations on the european planpay for what you get he promised to make us hear his horn in the morning if we were alive      a tramp abroad part 5  by mark twain  samuel l clemens  first published in 1880  illustrations taken from an 1880

chapter xxix  looking west for sunrise   he kept his word we heard his horn and instantly got up it was dark and cold and wretched as i fumbled around for the matches knocking things down with my quaking hands i wished the sun would rise in the middle of the day when it was warm and bright and cheerful and one wasnt sleepy we proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly candles but we could hardly button anything our hands shook so i thought of how many happy people there were in europe asia and america and everywhere who were sleeping peacefully in their beds and did not have to get up and see the rigi sunrisepeople who did not appreciate their advantage as like as not but would get up in the morning wanting more boons of providence while thinking these thoughts i yawned in a rather ample way and my upper teeth got hitched on a nail over the door and while i was mounting a chair to free myself harris drew the windowcurtain and said  oh this is luck we shant have to go out at allyonder are the mountains in full view   that was glad news indeed it made us cheerful right away one could see the grand alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament and one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night fully clothed and wrapped in blankets and huddled ourselves up by the window with lighted pipes and fell into chat while we waited in exceeding comfort to see how an alpine sunrise was going to look by candlelight by and by a delicate spiritual sort of effulgence spread itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy wastesbut there the effort seemed to stop i said presently  there is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere it doesnt seem to go what do you reckon is the matter with it  i dont know it appears to hang fire somewhere i never saw a sunrise act like that before can it be that the hotel is playing anything on us  of course not the hotel merely has a property interest in the sun it has nothing to do with the management of it it is a precarious kind of property too a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this tavern now what can be the matter with this sunrise  harris jumped up and said  ive got it i know whats the matter with it weve been looking at the place where the sun set last night  it is perfectly true why couldnt you have thought of that sooner now weve lost another one and all through your blundering it was exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the west  it was exactly like me to find out the mistake too you never would have found it out i find out all the mistakes  you make them all too else your most valuable faculty would be wasted on you but dont stop to quarrel nowmaybe we are not too late yet  but we were the sun was well up when we got to the exhibitionground   on our way up we met the crowd returningmen and women dressed in all sorts of queer costumes and exhibiting all degrees of cold and wretchedness in their gaits and countenances a dozen still remained on the ground when we reached there huddled together about the scaffold with their backs to the bitter wind they had their red guidebooks open at the diagram of the view and were painfully picking out the several mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their memories it was one of the saddest sights i ever saw  two sides of this place were guarded by railings to keep people from being blown over the precipices the view looking sheer down into the broad valley eastward from this great elevationalmost a perpendicular milewas very quaint and curious counties towns hilly ribs and ridges wide stretches of green meadow great forest tracts winding streams a dozen blue lakes a block of busy steamboatswe saw all this little world in unique circumstantiality of detailsaw it just as the birds see itand all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving the numerous toy villages with tiny spires projecting out of them were just as the children might have left them when done with play the day before the forest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss one or two big lakes were dwarfed to ponds the smaller ones to puddlesthough they did not look like puddles but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged in slight depressions conformable to their shapes among the mossbeds and the smooth levels of dainty green farmland the microscopic steamboats glided along as in a city reservoir taking a mighty time to cover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart and the isthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and lie with both elbows in the water yet we knew invisible wagons were toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one this beautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those relief maps which reproduce nature precisely with the heights and depressions and other details graduated to a reduced scale and with the rocks trees lakes etc colored after nature   i believed we could walk down to waeggis or vitznau in a day but i knew we could go down by rail in about an hour so i chose the latter method i wanted to see what it was like anyway the train came along about the middle of the afternoon and an odd thing it was the locomotiveboiler stood on end and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply backward there were two passengercars roofed but wide open all around these cars were not tilted back but the seats were this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline  there are three railwaytracks the central one is cogged the lantern wheel of the engine grips its way along these cogs and pulls the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip about the same speedthree miles an houris maintained both ways whether going up or down the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train it pushes in the one case braces back in the other the passenger rides backward going up and faces forward going down  we got front seats and while the train moved along about fifty yards on level ground i was not the least frightened but now it started abruptly downstairs and i caught my breath and i like my neighbors unconsciously held back all i could and threw my weight to the rear but of course that did no particular good i had slidden down the balusters when i was a boy and thought nothing of it but to slide down the balusters in a railwaytrain is a thing to make ones flesh creep sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground and this gave us a few full breaths in comfort but straightway we would turn a corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us and the comfort was at an end one expected to see the locomotive pause or slack up a little and approach this plunge cautiously but it did nothing of the kind it went calmly on and went it reached the jumpingoff place it made a sudden bow and went gliding smoothly downstairs untroubled by the circumstances  it was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices after this grisly fashion and look straight down upon that faroff valley which i was describing a while ago  there was no level ground at the kaltbad station the railbed was as steep as a roof i was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed but it was very simple the train came sliding down and when it reached the right spot it just stoppedthat was all there was to itstopped on the steep incline and when the exchange of passengers and baggage had been made it moved off and went sliding down again the train can be stopped anywhere at a moments notice  there was one curious effect which i need not take the trouble to describebecause i can scissor a description of it out of the railway companys advertising pamphlet and save my ink   on the whole tour particularly at the descent we undergo an optical illusion which often seems to be incredible all the shrubs fir trees stables houses etc seem to be bent in a slanting direction as by an immense pressure of air they are all standing awry so much awry that the chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down it is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line those who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a declivity of twenty to twentyfive degrees their seats being adapted to this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs they mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of the normal plain and therefore all the objects outside which really are in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to twentyfive degrees declivity in regard to the mountain  by the time one reaches kaltbad he has acquired confidence in the railway and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding back thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity and gazes out upon the magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment there is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze it is like inspecting the world on the wing howeverto be exactthere is one place where the serenity lapses for a while this is while one is crossing the schnurrtobel bridge a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame down through the dizzy air over a gorge like a vagrant spiderstrand  one has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is creeping down this bridge and he repents of them too though he sees when he gets to vitznau that he need not have done it the bridge was perfectly safe  so ends the eventual trip which we made to the rigikulm to see an alpine sunrise     chapter xxx  harris climbs mountains for me   an hours sail brought us to lucerne again i judged it best to go to bed and rest several days for i knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of europe on foot must take care of himself  thinking over my plans as mapped out i perceived that they did not take in the furka pass the rhone glacier the finsteraarhorn the wetterhorn etc i immediately examined the guidebook to see if these were important and found they were in fact a pedestrian tour of europe could not be complete without them of course that decided me at once to see them for i never allow myself to do things by halves or in a slurring slipshod way  i called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a careful examination of these noted places on foot and bring me back a written report of the result for insertion in my book i instructed him to go to hospenthal as quickly as possible and make his grand start from there to extend his foot expedition as far as the giesbach fall and return to me from thence by diligence or mule i told him to take the courier with him  he objected to the courier and with some show of reason since he was about to venture upon new and untried ground but i thought he might as well learn how to take care of the courier now as later therefore i enforced my point i said that the trouble delay and inconvenience of traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a couriers presence commands and i must insist that as much style be thrown into my journeys as possible  so the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed a week later they returned pretty well used up and my agent handed me the following official report  of a visit to the furka region  by h harris agent about seven oclock in the morning with perfectly fine weather we started from hospenthal and arrived at the maison on the furka in a little under quatre hours the want of variety in the scenery from hospenthal made the kahkahponeeka wearisome but let none be discouraged no one can fail to be completely recompensee for his fatigue when he sees for the first time the monarch of the oberland the tremendous finsteraarhorn a moment before all was dullness but a pas further has placed us on the summit of the furka and exactly in front of us at a hopow of only fifteen miles this magnificent mountain lifts its snowwreathed precipices into the deep blue sky the inferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the oberland is visible from this bongabong nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of the central peak   with the addition of some others who were also bound for the grimsel we formed a large xhvloj as we descended the steg which winds round the shoulder of a mountain toward the rhone glacier we soon left the path and took to the ice and after wandering amongst the crevices un peu to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns and hear the rushing of waters through their subglacial channels we struck out a course toward lautre cÔte and crossed the glacier successfully a little above the cave from which the infant rhone takes its first bound from under the grand precipice of ice half a mile below this we began to climb the flowery side of the meienwand one of our party started before the rest but the hitze was so great that we found ihm quite exhausted and lying at full length in the shade of a large gestein we sat down with him for a time for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very steep bolwoggoly and then we set out again together and arrived at last near the dead mans lake at the foot of the sidelhorn this lonely spot once used for an extempore buryingplace after a sanguinary battue between the french and austrians is the perfection of desolation there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man except the line of weatherbeaten whitened posts set up to indicate the direction of the pass in the owdawakk of winter near this point the footpath joins the wider track which connects the grimsel with the head of the rhone schnawp this has been carefully constructed and leads with a tortuous course among and over les pierres down to the bank of the gloomy little swoshswosh which almost washes against the walls of the grimsel hospice we arrived a little before four oclock at the end of our days journey hot enough to justify the step taking by most of the partie of plunging into the crystal water of the snowfed lake   the next afternoon we started for a walk up the unteraar glacier with the intention of at all events getting as far as the hütte which is used as a sleepingplace by most of those who cross the strahleck pass to grindelwald we got over the tedious collection of stones and dÉbris which covers the pied of the gletcher and had walked nearly three hours from the grimsel when just as we were thinking of crossing over to the right to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut the clouds which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance suddenly dropped and a huge mass of them driving toward us from the finsteraarhorn poured down a deluge of haboolong and hail fortunately we were not far from a very large glaciertable it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for gowkarak a stream of puckittypukk had furrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base and we were obliged to stand with one fuss on each side of this and endeavor to keep ourselves chaud by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal so as to get a higher place for standing on as the wasser rose rapidly in its trench a very cold bzzzzzzzzeee accompanied the storm and made our position far from pleasant and presently came a flash of blitzen apparently in the middle of our little party with an instantaneous clap of yokky sounding like a large gun fired close to our ears the effect was startling but in a few seconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us this was followed by many more bursts none of welche however was so dangerously near and after waiting a long demihour in our icy prison we sallied out to talk through a haboolong which though not so heavy as before was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the hospice  the grimsel is certainement a wonderful place situated at the bottom of a sort of huge crater the sides of which are utterly savage gebirge composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine arbre and afford only scanty food for a herd of gmwkwllolp it looks as if it must be completely begraben in the winter snows enormous avalanches fall against it every spring sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet and in spite of walls four feet thick and furnished with outside shutters the two men who stay here when the voyageurs are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations  next morning the hogglebumgullup still continued bad but we made up our minds to go on and make the best of it half an hour after we started the regen thickened unpleasantly and we attempted to get shelter under a projecting rock but being far to nass already to make standing at all agrÉable we pushed on for the handeck consoling ourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river aar at our side we should at all events see the celebrated wasserfall in grande perfection nor were we nappersocket in our expectation the water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most magnificent frenzy while the trees which cling to its rocky sides swayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down with it even the stream which falls into the main cascade at right angles and toutefois forms a beautiful feature in the scene was now swollen into a raging torrent and the violence of this meeting of the waters about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood was fearfully grand while we were looking at it glÜecklicheweise a gleam of sunshine came out and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by the spray and hung in midair suspended over the awful gorge  on going into the chalet above the fall we were informed that a bruecke had broken down near guttanen and that it would be impossible to proceed for some time accordingly we were kept in our drenched condition for ein stunde when some voyageurs arrived from meiringen and told us that there had been a trifling accident aber that we could now cross on arriving at the spot i was much inclined to suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us slowwk and drink the more at the handeck inn for only a few planks had been carried away and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules the gap was certainly not larger than a mmbglx might cross with a very slight leap near guttanen the haboolong happily ceased and we had time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at reichenback wo we enjoyed a good dinÉ at the hotel des alps   next morning we walked to rosenlaui the beau idÉal of swiss scenery where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier this was more beautiful than words can describe for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern as blue as the sky above and rippled like a frozen ocean a few steps cut in the whoopjamboreehoo enabled us to walk completely under this and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation the glacier was all around divided by numberless fissures of the same exquisite color and the finest wooderdbeeren were growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice the inn stands in a charmant spot close to the cÔtÉ de la riviÈre which lower down forms the reichenbach fall and embosomed in the richest of pine woods while the fine form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple in the afternoon we walked over the great scheideck to grindelwald stopping to pay a visit to the upper glacier by the way but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup and arrived at the hotel in a solche a state that the landlords wardrobe was in great request  the clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst for a lovely day succeeded which we determined to devote to an ascent of the faulhorn we left grindelwald just as a thunderstorm was dying away and we hoped to find guten wetter up above but the rain which had nearly ceased began again and we were struck by the rapidly increasing froid as we ascended twothirds of the way up were completed when the rain was exchanged for gnillic with which the boden was thickly covered and before we arrived at the top the gnillic and mist became so thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty poopoo distance and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and thickly covered ground shivering with cold we turned into bed with a double allowance of clothes and slept comfortably while the wind howled autour de la maison when i awoke the wall and the window looked equally dark but in another hour i found i could just see the form of the latter so i jumped out of bed and forced it open though with great difficulty from the frost and the quantities of gnillic heaped up against it  a row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof and anything more wintry than the whole anblick could not well be imagined but the sudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling that i felt no inclination to move toward bed again the snow which had collected upon la fÊntre had increased the finsterniss oder der dunkelheit so that when i looked out i was surprised to find that the daylight was considerable and that the balragoomah would evidently rise before long only the brightest of les etoiles were still shining the sky was cloudless overhead though small curling mists lay thousands of feet below us in the valleys wreathed around the feet of the mountains and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits we were soon dressed and out of the house watching the gradual approach of dawn thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the oberland giants which broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before kabaugwakko songwashee kum wetterhorn snawpo cried some one as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn and in a few moments the double crest of the schreckhorn followed its example peak after peak seemed warmed with life the jungfrau blushed even more beautifully than her neighbors and soon from the wetterhorn in the east to the wildstrubel in the west a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars truly worthy of the gods   the wlgw was very severe our sleepingplace could hardly be distingueÉ from the snow around it which had fallen to a depth of a flirk during the past evening and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble en bas to the giesbach falls where we soon found a warm climate at noon the day before grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than 100 degrees fahr in the sun and in the evening judging from the icicles formed and the state of the windows there must have been at least twelve dingblatter of frost thus giving a change of 80 degrees during a few hours  i said  you have done well harris this report is concise compact well expressed the language is crisp the descriptions are vivid and not needlessly elaborated your report goes straight to the point attends strictly to business and doesnt fool around it is in many ways an excellent document but it has a faultit is too learned it is much too learned what is dingblatter  dingblatter is a fiji word meaning degrees  you knew the english of it then  oh yes  what is gnillic  that is the eskimo term for snow  so you knew the english for that too  why certainly  what does mmbglx stand for  that is zulu for pedestrian  while the form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple what is bopple  picture its choctaw  what is schnawp  valley that is choctaw also  what is bolwoggoly  that is chinese for hill  kahkahponeeka  ascent choctaw  but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup what does hogglebumgullup mean  that is chinese for weather  is hogglebumgullup better than the english word is it any more descriptive  no it means just the same  and dingblatter and gnillic and bopple and schnawpare they better than the english words  no they mean just what the english ones do  then why do you use them why have you used all this chinese and choctaw and zulu rubbish  because i didnt know any french but two or three words and i didnt know any latin or greek at all  that is nothing why should you want to use foreign words anyhow  they adorn my page they all do it  who is all  everybody everybody that writes elegantly anybody has a right to that wants to  i think you are mistaken i then proceeded in the following scathing manner when really learned men write books for other learned men to read they are justified in using as many learned words as they pleasetheir audience will understand them but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign expressions it is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying get the translations made yourself if you want them this book is not written for the ignorant classes there are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their english writings unconsciously and so they omit to translate as much as half the time that is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the mans readers what is the excuse for this the writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in english very well then he writes his best things for the tenth man and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book however the excuse he offers is at least an excuse but there is another set of men who are like you they know a word here and there of a foreign language or a few beggarly little threeword phrases filched from the back of the dictionary and these are continually peppering into their literature with a pretense of knowing that languagewhat excuse can they offer the foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler languageenglish yet they think they adorn their page when they say strasse for street and bahnhof for railwaystation and so onflaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the readers face and imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve i will let your learning remain in your report you have as much right i suppose to adorn your page with zulu and chinese and choctaw rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from half a dozen learned tongues whose ab abs they dont even know  when the musing spider steps upon the redhot shovel he first exhibits a wild surprise then he shrivels up similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting agent i can be dreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me     chapter xxxi  alpscaling by carriage   we now prepared for a considerable walkfrom lucerne to interlaken over the bruenig pass but at the last moment the weather was so good that i changed my mind and hired a fourhorse carriage it was a huge vehicle roomy as easy in its motion as a palanquin and exceedingly comfortable  we got away pretty early in the morning after a hot breakfast and went bowling over a hard smooth road through the summer loveliness of switzerland with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow and sometimes in place of the precipices the grassy land stretched away in an apparently endless upward slant and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets the peculiarly captivating cottage of switzerland  the ordinary chalet turns a broad honest gable end to the road and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting caressing way projecting its sheltering eaves far outward the quaint windows are filled with little panes and garnished with white muslin curtains and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers across the front of the house and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch are elaborate carvingswreaths fruits arabesques verses from scripture names dates etc the building is wholly of wood reddish brown in tint a very pleasing color it generally has vines climbing over it set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque and is a decidedly graceful addition to the landscape  one does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him until he presently comes upon a new housea house which is aping the town fashions of germany and france a prim hideous straightupanddown thing plastered all over on the outside to look like stone and altogether so stiff and formal and ugly and forbidding and so out of tune with the gracious landscape and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic a corpse at a wedding a puritan in paradise   in the course of the morning we passed the spot where pontius pilate is said to have thrown himself into the lake the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind eventually he hid himself away on the heights of mount pilatus and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years but rest and peace were still denied him so he finally put an end to his misery by drowning himself  presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born this was the childrens friend santa claus or st nicholas there are some unaccountable reputations in the world this saints is an instance he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own he had ten of them and when fifty years old he left them and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises from the nursery doubtless   judging by pilate and st nicholas there exists no rule for the construction of hermits they seem made out of all kinds of material but pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive whereas st nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys christmas eve forever and conferring kindness on other peoples children to make up for deserting his own his bones are kept in a church in a village sachseln which we visited and are naturally held in great reverence his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness during his hermit life according to legend he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month but all the rest of the month he fasted   a constant marvel with us as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey was not that avalanches occur but that they are not occurring all the time one does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily a landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago on the route from arth to brunnen which was a formidable thing a mass of conglomerate two miles long a thousand feet broad and a hundred feet thick broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below burying four villages and five hundred people as in a grave   we had such a beautiful day and such endless pictures of limpid lakes and green hills and valleys and majestic mountains and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world so we tried to drink all the milk and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale but we had to retire from this contract for it was too heavy  at short distancesand they were entirely too shortall along the road were groups of neat and comely children with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road holding out their baskets and milk bottles and ran beside the carriage barefoot and bareheaded and importuned us to buy they seldom desisted early but continued to run and insistbeside the wagon while they could and behind it until they lost breath then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their tradingpost again after several hours of this without any intermission it becomes almost annoying i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit however there were plenty of these loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage indeed from lucerne to interlaken we had the spectacle among other scenery of an unbroken procession of fruitpeddlers and tourists carriages  our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the downgrade of the bruenig by and by after we should pass the summit all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon meiringen and the rushing bluegray river aar and the broad level green valley and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor and still up and up at the superb oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights robed in powdery spray ruffled with foam and girdled with rainbowsto look upon these things they say was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting therefore as i say we talked mainly of these coming wonders if we were conscious of any impatience it was to get there in favorable season if we felt any anxiety it was that the day might remain perfect and enable us to see those marvels at their best  as we approached the kaiserstuhl a part of the harness gave way  we were in distress for a moment but only a moment it was the foreandaft gear that was brokenthe thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon in america this would have been a heavy leathern strap but all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little fingerclothesline is what it is cabs use it private carriages freightcarts and wagons all sorts of vehicles have it in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fiftyfour halfbarrels of beer i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used itnot new rope but rope that had been in use since abrahams time and i had felt nervous sometimes behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill but i had long been accustomed to it now and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place our driver got a fresh piece of clothesline out of his locker and repaired the break in two minutes  so much for one european fashion every country has its own ways it may interest the reader to know how they put horses to on the continent the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring and hauls it aft and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse opposite to the first one after crossing them and bringing the loose end back and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing i spoke of before and puts another thing over each horses head with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on uphill and brings the ends of these things aft over his back after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill and then takes the slack of the thing which i mentioned a while ago and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with i never have buckled up a horse myself but i do not think we do it that way   we had four very handsome horses and the driver was very proud of his turnout he would bowl along on a reasonable trot on the highway but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless whipcrackings that sounded like volleys of musketry he tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake showering his volleys as he went and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children ducks cats and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction and as this living wave washed aside along the walls its elements being safe forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next curve and was lost to sight  he was a great man to those villagers with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank then he mounted his lofty box swung his explosive whip and away he went again like a storm i had not seen anything like this before since i was a boy and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting   when we reached the base of the kaiserstuhl we took two more horses we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours for the ascent was not very gradual but when we passed the backbone and approached the station the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter he could not have six horses all the time so he made the most of his chance while he had it  up to this point we had been in the heart of the william tell region the hero is not forgotten by any means or held in doubtful veneration his wooden image with his bow drawn above the doors of taverns was a frequent feature of the scenery  about noon we arrived at the foot of the bruenig pass and made a twohour stop at the village hotel another of those clean pretty and thoroughly wellkept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote countrytowns there was a lake here in the lap of the great mountains the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens and from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling cataract   carriage after carriage laden with tourists and trunks arrived and the quiet hotel was soon populous we were early at the table dhôte and saw the people all come in there were twentyfive perhaps they were of various nationalities but we were the only americans next to me sat an english bride and next to her sat her new husband whom she called neddy though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name they had a pretty little lovers quarrel over what wine they should have neddy was for obeying the guidebook and taking the wine of the country but the bride said  what that nahsty stuff  it isnt nahsty pet its quite good  it is nahsty  no it isnt nahsty  its oful nahsty neddy and i shahnt drink it  then the question was what she must have she said he knew very well that she never drank anything but champagne  she added  you know very well papa always has champagne on his table and ive always been used to it  neddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense and this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with laughterand this pleased him so much that he repeated his jest a couple of times and added new and killing varieties to it when the bride finally recovered she gave neddy a lovebox on the arm with her fan and said with arch severity  well you would have menothing else would doso youll have to make the best of a bad bargain do order the champagne im oful dry   so with a mock groan which made her laugh again neddy ordered the champagne  the fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of her soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne had a marked and subduing effect on harris he believed she belonged to the royal family but i had my doubts  we heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the table and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our satisfaction but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and a young girl who sat opposite us and with a gentleman of about thirtyfive who sat three seats beyond harris we did not hear any of these speak but finally the lastnamed gentleman left while we were not noticing but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table he stopped there a moment and made his toilet with a pocket comb so he was a german or else he had lived in german hotels long enough to catch the fashion when the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave they bowed respectfully to us so they were germans too this national custom is worth six of the other one for export   after dinner we talked with several englishmen and they inflamed our desire to a hotter degree than ever to see the sights of meiringen from the heights of the bruenig pass they said the view was marvelous and that one who had seen it once could never forget it they also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock in such a way that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew   i got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need and then to make everything complete i asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there in case of necessity they threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with refreshmentpeddlers we were impatient to get away now and the rest of our twohour stop rather dragged but finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent indeed it was a wonderful road it was smooth and compact and clean and the side next the precipices was guarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high placed at short distances apart the road could not have been better built if napoleon the first had built it he seems to have been the introducer of the sort of roads which europe now uses all literature which describes life as it existed in england france and germany up to the close of the last century is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages wallowing through these three countries in mud and slush halfwheel deep but after napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he generally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow dryshod  we went on climbing higher and higher and curving hither and thither in the shade of noble woods and with a rich variety and profusion of wild flowers all about us and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones below us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep and other glimpses of far lower altitudes where distance diminished the chalets to toys and obliterated the sheep altogether and every now and then some ermined monarch of the alps swung magnificently into view for a moment then drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again  it was an intoxicating trip altogether the exceeding sense of satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment the having something especial to look forward to and muse about like the approaching grandeurs of meiringen sharpened the zest smoking was never so good before solid comfort was never solider we lay back against the thick cushions silent meditative steeped in felicity         i rubbed my eyes opened them and started i had been dreaming i was at sea and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me it took me a couple seconds to come to as you may say then i took in the situation the horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town the driver was taking beer harris was snoring at my side the courier with folded arms and bowed head was sleeping on the box two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage with their hands crossed behind gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun several small girls held nightcapped babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of sluggish interest in us   we had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery i did not need anybody to tell me that if i had been a girl i could have cursed for vexation as it was i woke up the agent and gave him a piece of my mind instead of being humiliated he only upbraided me for being so wanting in vigilance he said he had expected to improve his mind by coming to europe but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with me and never see anything for i was manifestly endowed with the very genius of ill luck he even tried to get up some emotion about that poor courier who never got a chance to see anything on account of my heedlessness but when i thought i had borne about enough of this kind of talk i threatened to make harris tramp back to the summit and make a report on that scenery and this suggestion spiked his battery  we drove sullenly through brienz dead to the seductions of its bewildering array of swiss carvings and the clamorous hoohooing of its cuckoo clocks and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we rattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the pretty town of interlaken it was just about sunset and we had made the trip from lucerne in ten hours     chapter xxxii  the jungfrau the bride and the piano   we located ourselves at the jungfrau hotel one of those huge establishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every attractive spot on the continent there was a great gathering at dinner and as usual one heard all sorts of languages  the table dhôte was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the swiss peasants this consists of a simple gros de laine trimmed with ashes of roses with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris cut bias on the offside with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of pâte de foie gras backstitched to the mise en scene in the form of a jeu desprit it gives to the wearer a singularly piquant and alluring aspect  one of these waitresses a woman of forty had sidewhiskers reaching halfway down her jaws they were two fingers broad dark in color pretty thick and the hairs were an inch long one sees many women on the continent with quite conspicuous mustaches but this was the only woman i saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers  after dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the front porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel to enjoy the cool air but as the twilight deepened toward darkness they gathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most constrained of all places the great blank drawingroom which is the chief feature of all continental summer hotels there they grouped themselves about in couples and threes and mumbled in bated voices and looked timid and homeless and forlorn  there was a small piano in this room a clattery wheezy asthmatic thing certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that the world has seen in turn five or six dejected and homesick ladies approached it doubtingly gave it a single inquiring thump and retired with the lockjaw but the boss of that instrument was to come nevertheless and from my own countryfrom arkansaw  she was a brandnew bride innocent girlish happy in herself and her grave and worshiping stripling of a husband she was about eighteen just out of school free from affectations unconscious of that passionless multitude around her and the very first time she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny her stripling brought an armful of aged sheetmusic from their roomfor this bride went heeled as you might sayand bent himself lovingly over and got ready to turn the pages   the bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard to the other just to get her bearings as it were and you could see the congregation set their teeth with the agony of it then without any more preliminaries she turned on all the horrors of the battle of prague that venerable shivaree and waded chindeep in the blood of the slain she made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in every five but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct the audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while but when the cannonade waxed hotter and fiercer and the discord average rose to four in five the procession began to move a few stragglers held their ground ten minutes longer but when the girl began to wring the true inwardness out of the cries of the wounded they struck their colors and retired in a kind of panic   there never was a completer victory i was the only noncombatant left on the field i would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow but indeed i had no desires in that direction none of us like mediocrity but we all reverence perfection this girls music was perfection in its way it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by a mere human being  i moved up close and never lost a strain when she got through i asked her to play it again she did it with a pleased alacrity and a heightened enthusiasm she made it all discords this time she got an amount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on human suffering she was on the warpath all the evening all the time crowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against the windows to look and marvel but the bravest never ventured in the bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow when her appetite was finally gorged and the tourists swarmed in again   what a change has come over switzerland and in fact all europe during this century seventy or eighty years ago napoleon was the only man in europe who could really be called a traveler he was the only man who had devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it he was the only man who had traveled extensively but now everybody goes everywhere and switzerland and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer but i digress  in the morning when we looked out of our windows we saw a wonderful sight across the valley and apparently quite neighborly and close at hand the giant form of the jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear sky beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands it reminded me somehow of one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside ones ship at sea sometimes with its crest and shoulders snowy white and the rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam  i took out my sketchbook and made a little picture of the jungfrau merely to get the shape  i do not regard this as one of my finished works in fact i do not rank it among my works at all it is only a study it is hardly more than what one might call a sketch other artists have done me the grace to admire it but i am severe in my judgments of my own pictures and this one does not move me   it was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which so overtops the jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two but it was not of course it is only two or three thousand feet high and of course has no snow upon it in summer whereas the jungfrau is not much shorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge of snow on her side which seems nearly down to the valley level is really about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit of that wooded rampart it is the distance that makes the deception the wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us but the jungfrau is four or five times that distance away   walking down the street of shops in the forenoon i was attracted by a large picture carved frame and all from a single block of chocolatecolored wood there are people who know everything some of these had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices on english and americans many people had told us it was expensive to buy things through a courier whereas i had supposed it was just the reverse when i saw this picture i conjectured that it was worth more than the friend i proposed to buy it for would like to pay but still it was worth while to inquire so i told the courier to step in and ask the price as if he wanted it for himself i told him not to speak in english and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier then i moved on a few yards and waited  the courier came presently and reported the price i said to myself it is a hundred francs too much and so dismissed the matter from my mind but in the afternoon i was passing that place with harris and the picture attracted me again we stepped in to see how much higher broken german would raise the price the shopwoman named a figure just a hundred francs lower than the courier had named this was a pleasant surprise i said i would take it after i had given directions as to where it was to be shipped the shopwoman said appealingly  if you please do not let your courier know you bought it  this was an unexpected remark i said  what makes you think i have a courier  ah that is very simple he told me himself  he was very thoughtful but tell mewhy did you charge him more than you are charging me  that is very simple also i do not have to pay you a percentage  oh i begin to see you would have had to pay the courier a percentage  undoubtedly the courier always has his percentage in this case it would have been a hundred francs  then the tradesman does not pay a part of itthe purchaser pays all of it  there are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a price which is twice or thrice the value of the article then the two divide and both get a percentage  i see but it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying even then  oh to be sure it goes without saying  but i have bought this picture myself therefore why shouldnt the courier know it  the woman exclaimed in distress  ah indeed it would take all my little profit he would come and demand his hundred francs and i should have to pay  he has not done the buying you could refuse  i could not dare to refuse he would never bring travelers here again more than that he would denounce me to the other couriers they would divert custom from me and my business would be injured  i went away in a thoughtful frame of mind i began to see why a courier could afford to work for fiftyfive dollars a month and his fares a month or two later i was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging and why my hotel bills were always larger when i had him with me than when i left him behind somewhere for a few days  another thing was also explained now apparently in one town i had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when i drew some money i had sat in the readingroom till the transaction was finished then a clerk had brought the money to me in person and had been exceedingly polite even going so far as to precede me to the door and holding it open for me and bow me out as if i had been a distinguished personage it was a new experience exchange had been in my favor ever since i had been in europe but just that one time i got simply the face of my draft and no extra francs whereas i had expected to get quite a number of them this was the first time i had ever used the courier at the bank i had suspected something then and as long as he remained with me afterward i managed bank matters by myself  still if i felt that i could afford the tax i would never travel without a courier for a good courier is a convenience whose value cannot be estimated in dollars and cents without him travel is a bitter harassment a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances a ceaseless and pitiless punishmenti mean to an irascible man who has no business capacity and is confused by details   without a courier travel hasnt a ray of pleasure in it anywhere but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight he is always at hand never has to be sent for if your bell is not answered promptlyand it seldom isyou have only to open the door and speak the courier will hear and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection you tell him what day you will start and whither you are goingleave all the rest to him you need not inquire about trains or fares or car changes or hotels or anything else at the proper time he will put you in a cab or an omnibus and drive you to the train or the boat he has packed your luggage and transferred it he has paid all the bills other people have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places and lose their tempers but you can take your time the courier has secured your seats for you and you can occupy them at your leisure  at the station the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the weighers attention to their trunks they dispute hotly with these tyrants who are cool and indifferent they get their baggage billets at last and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket and now with their tempers gone to the dogs they must stand penned up and packed together laden with wraps and satchels and shawlstraps with the weary wife and babies in the waitingroom till the doors are thrown openand then all hands make a grand final rush to the train find it full and have to stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on they are in a condition to kill somebody by this time meantime you have been sitting in your car smoking and observing all this misery in the extremest comfort   on the journey the guard is polite and watchfulwont allow anybody to get into your compartmenttells them you are just recovering from the smallpox and do not like to be disturbed for the courier has made everything right with the guard at waystations the courier comes to your compartment to see if you want a glass of water or a newspaper or anything at eatingstations he sends luncheon out to you while the other people scramble and worry in the diningrooms if anything breaks about the car you are in and a stationmaster proposes to pack you and your agent into a compartment with strangers the courier reveals to him confidentially that you are a french duke born deaf and dumb and the official comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car to be added to the train for you  at customhouses the multitude file tediously through hot and irritated and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and make a mess of everything but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rainstorm at ten at nightyou generally do the multitude spend half an hour verifying their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moments loss of time and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or three days in advance everything is ready you can go at once to bed some of those other people will have to drift around to two or three hotels in the rain before they find accommodations  i have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good courier but i think i have set down a sufficiency of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise economist my courier was the worst one in europe yet he was a good deal better than none at all it could not pay him to be a better one than he was because i could not afford to buy things through him he was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service yes to travel with a courier is bliss to travel without one is the reverse  i have had dealings with some very bad couriers but i have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection he was a young polander named joseph n verey he spoke eight languages and seemed to be equally at home in all of them he was shrewd prompt posted and punctual he was fertile in resources and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties he not only knew how to do everything in his line but he knew the best ways and the quickest he was handy with children and invalids all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier his address is care of messrs gay  son strand london he was formerly a conductor of gays tourist parties excellent couriers are somewhat rare if the reader is about to travel he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this one     chapter xxxiii  we climb farby buggy   the beautiful giesbach fall is near interlaken on the other side of the lake of brienz and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous theatrical fires whose name i cannot call just at this moment this was said to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss i was strongly tempted but i could not go there with propriety because one goes in a boat the task which i had set myself was to walk over europe on foot not skim over it in a boat i had made a tacit contract with myself it was my duty to abide by it i was willing to make boat trips for pleasure but i could not conscientiously make them in the way of business  it cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight but i lived down the desire and gained in my selfrespect through the triumph i had a finer and a grander sight however where i was this was the mighty dome of the jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly silvered by the starlight there was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn and awful presence one seemed to meet the immutable the indestructible the eternal face to face and to feel the trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast one had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit not an inert mass of rocks and icea spirit which had looked down through the slow drift of the ages upon a million vanished races of men and judged them and would judge a million moreand still be there watching unchanged and unchangeable after all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant desolation  while i was feeling these things i was groping without knowing it toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the alps and in no other mountainsthat strange deep nameless influence which once felt cannot be forgottenonce felt leaves always behind it a restless longing to feel it againa longing which is like homesickness a grieving haunting yearning which will plead implore and persecute till it has its will i met dozens of people imaginative and unimaginative cultivated and uncultivated who had come from far countries and roamed through the swiss alps year after yearthey could not explain why they had come first they said out of idle curiosity because everybody talked about it they had come since because they could not help it and they should keep on coming while they lived for the same reason they had tried to break their chains and stay away but it was futile now they had no desire to break them others came nearer formulating what they felt they said they could find perfect rest and peace nowhere else when they were troubled all frets and worries and chafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the alps the great spirit of the mountain breathed his own peace upon their hurt minds and sore hearts and healed them they could not think base thoughts or do mean and sordid things here before the visible throne of god  down the road a piece was a kursaalwhatever that may beand we joined the human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford it was the usual openair concert in an ornamental garden with wines beer milk whey grapes etcthe whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to certain invalids whom physicians cannot repair and who only continue to exist by the grace of whey or grapes one of these departed spirits told me in a sad and lifeless way that there is no way for him to live but by whey and dearly dearly loved whey he didnt know whey he did but he did after making this pun he diedthat is the whey it served him   some other remains preserved from decomposition by the grape system told me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed highly medicinal in their nature and that they were counted out and administered by the grapedoctors as methodically as if they were pills the new patient if very feeble began with one grape before breakfast took three during breakfast a couple between meals five at luncheon three in the afternoon seven at dinner four for supper and part of a grape just before going to bed by way of a general regulator the quantity was gradually and regularly increased according to the needs and capacities of the patient until by and by you would find him disposing of his one grape per second all the day long and his regular barrel per day  he said that men cured in this way and enabled to discard the grape system never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were dictating to a slow amanuensis because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape he said these were tedious people to talk with he said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back between every two words and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey he said it was an impressive thing to observe two men who had been cured by the two processes engaged in conversationsaid their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines one finds out a great many wonderful things by traveling if he stumbles upon the right person  i did not remain long at the kursaal the music was good enough but it seemed rather tame after the cyclone of that arkansaw expert besides my adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprisenothing less than a trip from interlaken by the gemmi and visp clear to zermatt on foot so it was necessary to plan the details and get ready for an early start the courier this was not the one i have just been speaking of thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell us how to find our way and so it turned out he showed us the whole thing on a reliefmap and we could see our route with all its elevations and depressions its villages and its rivers as clearly as if we were sailing over it in a balloon a reliefmap is a great thing the portier also wrote down each days journey and the nightly hotel on a piece of paper and made our course so plain that we should never be able to get lost without highpriced outside help  i put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to lausanne and then we went to bed after laying out the walkingcostumes and putting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning  however when we came down to breakfast at 8 am it looked so much like rain that i hired a twohorse topbuggy for the first third of the journey for two or three hours we jogged along the level road which skirts the beautiful lake of thun with a dim and dreamlike picture of watery expanses and spectral alpine forms always before us veiled in a mellowing mist then a steady downpour set in and hid everything but the nearest objects we kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas and away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy but the driver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed to like it we had the road to ourselves and i never had a pleasanter excursion  the weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the kienthal and presently a vast black cloudbank in front of us dissolved away and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of the blumis alp it was a sort of breathtaking surprise for we had not supposed there was anything behind that lowhung blanket of sable cloud but level valley what we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of sky away aloft there were really patches of the blumiss snowy crest caught through shredded rents in the drifting pall of vapor  we dined in the inn at frutigen and our driver ought to have dined there too but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk both so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter and succeeded a german gentleman and his two younglady daughters had been taking their nooning at the inn and when they left just ahead of us it was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours and as happy and goodnatured too which was saying a good deal these rascals overflowed with attentions and information for their guests and with brotherly love for each other they tied their reins and took off their coats and hats so that they might be able to give unencumbered attention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its illustration   the road was smooth it led up and over and down a continual succession of hills but it was narrow the horses were used to it and could not well get out of it anyhow so why shouldnt the drivers entertain themselves and us the noses of our horses projected sociably into the rear of the forward carriage and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend and his friend stood up and talked back to him with his rear to the scenery when the top was reached and we went flying down the other side there was no change in the program i carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver on his knees on his high seat resting his elbows on its back and beaming down on his passengers with happy eye and flying hair and jolly red face and offering his card to the old german gentleman while he praised his hack and horses and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to destruction or an undeserved safety  toward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets a cozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook among giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like islands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them from the lower world down from vague and vaporous heights little ruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling and found their way to the verge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls whence they plunged a shaft of silver shivered to atoms in middescent and turned to an air puff of luminous dust here and there in grooved depressions among the snowy desolations of the upper altitudes one glimpsed the extremity of a glacier with its seagreen and honeycombed battlements of ice   up the valley under a dizzy precipice nestled the village of kandersteg our haltingplace for the night we were soon there and housed in the hotel but the waning day had such an inviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of icewater up to its far source in a sort of little grasscarpeted parlor walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice this was the snuggest little croquetground imaginable it was perfectly level and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide the walls around it were so gigantic and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled by contrast to what i have likened it toa cozy and carpeted parlor it was so high above the kandersteg valley that there was nothing between it and the snowypeaks i had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before the snowpeaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs hitherto but now we were hobanobif one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august as these  we could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers but two or three of these instead of flowing over the precipices sank down into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the midface of the walls   the green nook which i have been describing is called the gasternthal the glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices here the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward kandersteg lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws there was no lack of cascades along this route the path by the side of the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp when he heard a cowbell and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a christian side by side and such places were not always to be had at an instants notice the cows wear churchbells and that is a good idea in the cows for where that torrent is you couldnt hear an ordinary cowbell any further than you could hear the ticking of a watch  i needed exercise so i employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift and i sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent it was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle when i had had enough exercise i made the agent take some by running a race with one of those logs i made a trifle by betting on the log   after dinner we had a walk up and down the kandersteg valley in the soft gloaming with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm for contrast and text for talk there were no sounds but the dulled complaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant bell the spirit of the place was a sense of deep pervading peace one might dream his life tranquilly away there and not miss it or mind it when it was gone  the summer departed with the sun and winter came with the stars it grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it but we kept warm and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for gemmi three hours beforeso our little plan of helping that german family principally the old man over the pass was a blocked generosity     chapter xxxiv  the worlds highest pig farm   we hired the only guide left to lead us on our way he was over seventy but he could have given me ninetenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to he shouldered our satchels overcoats and alpenstocks and we set out up the steep path it was hot work the old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats to him to carry too and we did it one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that he should have had them if he had been a hundred and fifty  when we began that ascent we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us it was on our right across the narrow head of the valley but when we got up abreast it on its own level mountains were towering high above on every hand and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little gasternthal which we had visited the evening before still it seemed a long way up in the air in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks it had an unfenced grassplot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiardtable and this grassplot slanted so sharply downward and was so brief and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice that it was a shuddery thing to think of a persons venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard there would be nothing for him to seize nothing could keep him from rolling five revolutions would bring him to the edge and over he would go   what a frightful distance he would fallfor there are very few birds that fly as high as his startingpoint he would strike and bounce two or three times on his way down but this would be no advantage to him i would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard i would rather in fact for the distance down would be about the same and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce i could not see how the peasants got up to that chaletthe region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon  as we strolled on climbing up higher and higher we were continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before so by and by while standing before a group of these giants we looked around for the chalet again there it was away down below us apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley it was as far below us now as it had been above us when we were beginning the ascent  after a while the path led us along a railed precipice and we looked overfar beneath us was the snug parlor again the little gasternthal with its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls we could have dropped a stone into it we had been finding the top of the world all alongand always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead when we looked down into the gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last but it was not so there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet we were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees we were still in a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the manytinted luster of innumerable wild flowers  we found indeed more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else we gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were unacquainted with so we had sumptuous bouquets but one of the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain and determining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with for instance it was the end of august at the level of the sea in the kandersteg valley at the base of the pass we found flowers which would not be due at the sealevel for two or three weeks higher up we entered october and gathered fringed gentians i made no notes and have forgotten the details but the construction of the floral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted   in the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower called the alpine rose but we did not find any examples of the ugly swiss favorite called edelweiss its name seems to indicate that it is a noble flower and that it is white it may be noble enough but it is not attractive and it is not white the fuzzy blossom is the color of bad cigar ashes and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush it has a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes but that is probably on account of its looks it apparently has no monopoly of those upper altitudes however for they are sometimes intruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers everybody in the alps wears a sprig of edelweiss in his hat it is the natives pet and also the tourists  all the morning as we loafed along having a good time other pedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager these wore loose kneebreeches long yarn stockings and hobnailed highlaced walkingshoes they were gentlemen who would go home to england or germany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guidebook every day but i doubted if they ever had much real fun outside of the mere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights for they were almost always alone and even the finest scenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy it with  all the morning an endless double procession of mulemounted tourists filed past us along the narrow paththe one procession going the other coming we had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the kindly german custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat and we resolutely clung to it that morning although it kept us bareheaded most of the time and was not always responded to still we found an interest in the thing because we naturally liked to know who were english and americans among the passersby all continental natives responded of course so did some of the english and americans but as a general thing these two races gave no sign whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need and we always got a reply in the same language the english and american folk are not less kindly than other races they are only more reserved and that comes of habit and education in one dreary rocky waste away above the line of vegetation we met a procession of twentyfive mounted young men all from america we got answering bows enough from these of course for they were of an age to learn to do in rome as rome does without much effort  at one extremity of this patch of desolation overhung by bare and forbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties consequently this place could be really reckoned as property it had a money value and was doubtless taxed i think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world it would be hard to set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm of space that man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world for if there is any definite end to the world he has certainly found it   from here forward we moved through a stormswept and smileless desolation all about us rose gigantic masses crags and ramparts of bare and dreary rock with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree or flower anywhere or glimpse of any creature that had life the frost and the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs with a deathless energy destroying them piecemeal so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground soiled and aged banks of snow lay close about our path the ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete as if doré had furnished the workingplans for it but every now and then through the stern gateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome sheathed with glittering ice and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was groveling and plebeian and this spectacle always chained ones interest and admiration at once and made him forget there was anything ugly in the world  i have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places but i forgot in the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all where the racked and splintered debris was thickest where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path where the winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and dreariest and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope i found a solitary wee forgetmenot flourishing away not a droop about it anywhere but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and gallantest air in the world the only happy spirit the only smiling thing in all that grisly desert she seemed to say cheer upas long as we are here let us make the best of it i judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place so i plucked her up and sent her to america to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made all by her small self to make a whole vast despondent alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable and hold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once   we stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the schwarenbach it sits in a lonely spot among the peaks where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the cloudrack and is rained on and snowed on and pelted and persecuted by the storms nearly every day of its life it was the only habitation in the whole gemmi pass  close at hand now was a chance for a bloodcurdling alpine adventure close at hand was the snowy mass of the great altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent i was fired with the idea and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides ropes etc and undertake it i instructed harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations meantime i went diligently to work to read up and find out what this muchtalkedof mountainclimbing was like and how one should go about itfor in these matters i was ignorant i opened mr hinchliffs summer months among the alps published 1857 and selected his account of his ascent of monte rosa  it began  it is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening before a grand expedition  i saw that i was too calm so i walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement but the books next remark that the adventurer must get up at two in the morningcame as near as anything to flatting it all out again however i reinforced it and read on about how mr hinchliff dressed by candlelight and was soon down among the guides who were bustling about in the passage packing provisions and making every preparation for the start and how he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that   the whole sky was blazing with stars larger and brighter than they appear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth they seemed actually suspended from the dark vault of heaven and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the snowfields around the foot of the matterhorn which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high penetrating to the heart of the great bear and crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars not a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night except the distant roar of streams which rush from the high plateau of the st theodule glacier and fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the gorner glacier  he took his hot toast and coffee and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed away from the riffel hotel and began the steep climb at half past five he happened to turn around and beheld the glorious spectacle of the matterhorn just touched by the rosyfingered morning and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and rock around it then the breithorn and the dent blanche caught the radiant glow but the intervening mass of monte rosa made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope to see the sun himself yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth of the day  he gazed at the lofty crown of monte rosa and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches and the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that summit but the adventurers moved steadily on nevertheless  they toiled up and up and still up they passed the grand plateau then toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain clinging like flies to its rugged face and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of falling they turned aside to skirt this wall and gradually ascended until their way was barred by a maze of gigantic snow crevicesso they turned aside again and began a long climb of sufficient steepness to make a zigzag course necessary   fatigue compelled them to halt frequently for a moment or two at one of these halts somebody called out look at mont blanc and we were at once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the alps and his attendant satellites right over the top of the breithorn itself at least 14000 feet high  these people moved in single file and were all tied to a strong rope at regular distances apart so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley thousands of feet below by and by they came to an icecoated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp angle and had a precipice on one side of it they had to climb this so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes the toes of the man behind him occupied it   slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent and i dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after the feet for while on the left the incline of ice was so steep that it would be impossible for any man to save himself in case of a slip unless the others could hold him up on the right we might drop a pebble from the hand over precipices of unknown extent down upon the tremendous glacier below  great caution therefore was absolutely necessary and in this exposed situation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of aspirants to monte rosaa severe and bitterly cold wind from the north the fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds penetrating the interstices of our clothes and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of peters ax were whisked into the air and then dashed over the precipice we had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion and now and then in the more violent gusts of wind were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard  having surmounted this perilous steep they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss then they climbed to the base of another ridgea more difficult and dangerous one still  the whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow and the fall on each side desperately steep but the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge almost like a knife these places though not more than three or four short paces in length looked uncommonly awkward but like the sword leading true believers to the gates of paradise they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition these were in one or two places so narrow that in stepping over them with toes well turned out for greater security one end of the foot projected over the awful precipice on the right while the other was on the beginning of the ice slope on the left which was scarcely less steep than the rocks on these occasions peter would take my hand and each of us stretching as far as we could he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces or rather more from me whence a spring would probably bring him to the rock on the other side then turning around he called to me to come and taking a couple of steps carefully i was met at the third by his outstretched hand ready to clasp mine and in a moment stood by his side the others followed in much the same fashion once my right foot slipped on the side toward the precipice but i threw out my left arm in a moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as i fell and supported me considerably at the same instant i cast my eyes down the side on which i had slipped and contrived to plant my right foot on a piece of rock as large as a cricketball which chanced to protrude through the ice on the very edge of the precipice being thus anchored fore and aft as it were i believe i could easily have recovered myself even if i had been alone though it must be confessed the situation would have been an awful one as it was however a jerk from peter settled the matter very soon and i was on my legs all right in an instant the rope is an immense help in places of this kind   now they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice and powdered with snowthe utmost summit the last bit of solidity between them and the hollow vault of heaven they set to work with their hatchets and were soon creeping insectlike up its surface with their heels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness thickened up a little with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy procession far below presently one mans toehold broke and he fell there he dangled in midair at the end of the rope like a spider till his friends above hauled him into place again  a little bit later the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very summit in a driving wind and looked out upon the vast green expanses of italy and a shoreless ocean of billowy alps  when i had read thus far harris broke into the room in a noble excitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured and asked if i was ready i said i believed i wouldnt ascend the altels this time i said alpclimbing was a different thing from what i had supposed it was and so i judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it but i told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to zermatt because i meant to use them there i said i could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me and was sure that the fell fascination of alpclimbing would soon be upon me i said he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with fright  this made harris happy and filled him with ambitious anticipations he went at once to tell the guides to follow us to zermatt and bring all their paraphernalia with them     chapter xxxv  swindling the coroner   a great and priceless thing is a new interest how it takes possession of a man how it clings to him how it rides him i strode onward from the schwarenbach hostelry a changed man a reorganized personality i walked into a new world i saw with new eyes i had been looking aloft at the giant showpeaks only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude and their unspeakable grace of form i looked up at them now as also things to be conquered and climbed my sense of their grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired i had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones i followed the steep lines up inch by inch with my eye and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet when i saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds i tried to imagine i saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer thread  we skirted the lonely little lake called the daubensee and presently passed close by a glacier on the righta thing like a great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth i had never been so near a glacier before  here we came upon a new board shanty and found some men engaged in building a stone house so the schwarenbach was soon to have a rival we bought a bottle or so of beer here at any rate they called it beer but i knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry and i perceived by the taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink   we were surrounded by a hideous desolation we stepped forward to a sort of jumpingoff place and were confronted by a startling contrast we seemed to look down into fairyland two or three thousand feet below us was a bright green level with a pretty town in its midst and a silvery stream winding among the meadows the charming spot was walled in on all sides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines and over the pines out of the softened distances rose the snowy domes and peaks of the monte rosa region how exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down there was the distance was not great enough to obliterate details it only made them little and mellow and dainty like landscapes and towns seen through the wrong end of a spyglass  right under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley with a green slanting benchshaped top and grouped about upon this greenbaize bench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like oversized worms the bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood but that was a deceptionit was a long way down to it   we began our descent now by the most remarkable road i have ever seen it wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipicea narrow way with always the solid rock wall at one elbow and perpendicular nothingness at the other we met an everlasting procession of guides porters mules litters and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule i always took the inside when i heard or saw the mule coming and flattened myself against the wall i preferred the inside of course but i should have had to take it anyhow because the mule prefers the outside a mules preferenceon a precipiceis a thing to be respected well his choice is always the outside his life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest against his bodytherefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other when he goes into the passenger business he absurdly clings to his old habit and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passengers heart is in the highlands so to speak more than once i saw a mules hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss and i noticed that upon these occasions the rider whether male or female looked tolerably unwell  there was one place where an eighteeninch breadth of light masonry had been added to the verge of the path and as there was a very sharp turn here a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time as a protection this panel was old and gray and feeble and the light masonry had been loosened by recent rains a young american girl came along on a mule and in making the turn the mules hind foot caved all the loose masonry and one of the fenceposts overboard the mule gave a violent lurch inboard to save himself and succeeded in the effort but that girl turned as white as the snows of mont blanc for a moment   the path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice there was a fourfoot breadth of solid rock under the traveler and fourfoot breadth of solid rock just above his head like the roof of a narrow porch he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless and bottomless wall of rock before him across a gorge or crack a biscuits toss in widthbut he could not see the bottom of his own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge i did not do this because i did not wish to soil my clothes  every few hundred yards at particularly bad places one came across a panel or so of plank fencing but they were always old and weak and they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash promises to hold up people who might need support there was one of these panels which had only its upper board left a pedestrianizing english youth came tearing down the path was seized with an impulse to look over the precipice and without an instants thought he threw his weight upon that crazy board it bent outward a foot i never made a gasp before that came so near suffocating me the english youths face simply showed a lively surprise but nothing more he went swinging along valleyward again as if he did not know he had just swindled a coroner by the closest kind of a shave  the alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between the middles of two long poles and sometimes it is a chair with a back to it and a support for the feet it is carried by relays of strong porters the motion is easier than that of any other conveyance we met a few men and a great many ladies in litters it seemed to me that most of the ladies looked pale and nauseated their general aspect gave me the idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering as a rule they looked at their laps and left the scenery to take care of itself   but the most frightened creature i saw was a led horse that overtook us poor fellow he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the kandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place before every few steps he would stop short glance wildly out from the dizzy height and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy he was a handsome fellow and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror but it was pitiful to see him suffer so   this dreadful path has had its tragedy baedeker with his customary over terseness begins and ends the tale thus  the descent on horseback should be avoided in 1861 a comtesse dherlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on the spot  we looked over the precipice there and saw the monument which commemorates the event it stands in the bottom of the gorge in a place which has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent and the storms our old guide never spoke but when spoken to and then limited himself to a syllable or two but when we asked him about this tragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter he said the countess was very pretty and very younghardly out of her girlhood in fact she was newly married and was on her bridal tour the young husband was riding a little in advance one guide was leading the husbands horse another was leading the brides  the old man continued  the guide that was leading the husbands horse happened to glance back and there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the precipice and her face began to bend downward a little and she put up her two hands slowly and met itsoand put them flat against her eyessoand then she sank out of the saddle with a sharp shriek and one caught only the flash of a dress and it was all over   then after a pause  ah yes that guide saw these thingsyes he saw them all he saw them all just as i have told you  after another pause  ah yes he saw them all my god that was me i was that guide  this had been the one event of the old mans life so one may be sure he had forgotten no detail connected with it we listened to all he had to say about what was done and what happened and what was said after the sorrowful occurrence and a painful story it was  when we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last spiral of the corkscrew harriss hat blew over the last remaining bit of precipicea small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet highand sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and fragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices we went leisurely down there expecting to find it without any trouble but we had made a mistake as to that we hunted during a couple of hoursnot because the old straw hat was valuable but out of curiosity to find out how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where there was nothing left for it to hide behind when one is reading in bed and lays his paperknife down he cannot find it again if it is smaller than a saber that hat was as stubborn as any paperknife could have been and we finally had to give it up but we found a fragment that had once belonged to an operaglass and by digging around and turning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the cylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete operaglass we afterward had the thing reconstructed and the owner can have his adventurous lostproperty by submitting proofs and paying costs of rehabilitation we had hopes of finding the owner there distributed around amongst the rocks for it would have made an elegant paragraph but we were disappointed still we were far from being disheartened for there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched we were satisfied he was there somewhere so we resolved to wait over a day at leuk and come back and get him  then we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what we would do with him when we got him harris was for contributing him to the british museum but i was for mailing him to his widow that is the difference between harris and me harris is all for display i am all for the simple right even though i lose money by it harris argued in favor of his proposition against mine i argued in favor of mine and against his the discussion warmed into a dispute the dispute warmed into a quarrel i finally said very decidedly  my mind is made up he goes to the widow  harris answered sharply  and my mind is made up he goes to the museum  i said calmly  the museum may whistle when it gets him  harris retorted  the widow may save herself the trouble of whistling for i will see that she never gets him  after some angry bandying of epithets i said  it seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these remains i dont quite see what youve got to say about them  i ive got all to say about them theyd never have been thought of if i hadnt found their operaglass the corpse belongs to me and ill do as i please with him  i was leader of the expedition and all discoveries achieved by it naturally belonged to me i was entitled to these remains and could have enforced my right but rather than have bad blood about the matter i said we would toss up for them i threw heads and won but it was a barren victory for although we spent all the next day searching we never found a bone i cannot imagine what could ever have become of that fellow  the town in the valley is called leuk or leukerbad we pointed our course toward it down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed gentians and other flowers and presently entered the narrow alleys of the outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid fertilizer they ought to either pave that village or organize a ferry  harriss body was simply a chamoispasture his person was populous with the little hungry pests his skin when he stripped was splotched like a scarletfever patients so when we were about to enter one of the leukerbad inns and he noticed its sign chamois hotel he refused to stop there he said the chamois was plentiful enough without hunting up hotels where they made a specialty of it i was indifferent for the chamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me but to calm harris we went to the hôtel des alpes  at the table dhôte we had this for an incident a very grave manin fact his gravity amounted to solemnity and almost to austeritysat opposite us and he was tight but doing his best to appear sober he took up a corked bottle of wine tilted it over his glass awhile then set it out of the way with a contented look and went on with his dinner  presently he put his glass to his mouth and of course found it empty he looked puzzled and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his right shook his head as much as to say no she couldnt have done it he tilted the corked bottle over his glass again meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him he ate a few mouthfuls raised his glass to his lips and of course it was still empty he bent an injured and accusing sideglance upon that unconscious old lady which was a study to see she went on eating and gave no sign he took up his glass and his bottle with a wise private nod of his head and set them gravely on the lefthand side of his platepoured himself another imaginary drinkwent to work with his knife and fork once morepresently lifted his glass with good confidence and found it empty as usual  this was almost a petrifying surprise he straightened himself up in his chair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows first one and then the other at last he softly pushed his plate away set his glass directly in front of him held on to it with his left hand and proceeded to pour with his right this time he observed that nothing came he turned the bottle clear upside down still nothing issued from it a plaintive look came into his face and he said as if to himself  ic theyve got it all then he set the bottle down resignedly and took the rest of his dinner dry   it was at that table dhôte too that i had under inspection the largest lady i have ever seen in private life she was over seven feet high and magnificently proportioned what had first called my attention to her was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot and hearing from up toward the ceiling a deep pardon msieu but you encroach  that was when we were coming through the hall and the place was dim and i could see her only vaguely the thing which called my attention to her the second time was that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls and this great lady came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view she had a handsome face and she was very finely formedperfectly formed i should say but she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace ladies near her looked like children and the men about her looked mean they looked like failures and they looked as if they felt so too she sat with her back to us i never saw such a back in my life i would have so liked to see the moon rise over it the whole congregation waited under one pretext or another till she finished her dinner and went out they wanted to see her at full altitude and they found it worth tarrying for she filled ones idea of what an empress ought to be when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place   we were not at leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight she had suffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths five weeks of soakingfive uninterrupted hours of it every dayhad accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right proportions   those baths remove fat and also skindiseases the patients remain in the great tanks for hours at a time a dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together and amuse themselves with rompings and various games they have floating desks and tables and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is breastdeep the tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses theres a poorbox and he will have to contribute there are several of these big bathinghouses and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it the water is running water and changes all the time else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success since while he was ridding himself of the ringworm he might catch the itch   the next morning we wandered back up the green valley leisurely with the curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising into the clouds before us i had never seen a clean bare precipice stretching up five thousand feet above me before and i never shall expect to see another one they exist perhaps but not in places where one can easily get close to them this pile of stone is peculiar from its base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers all its lines and all its details vaguely suggest human architecture there are rudimentary bowwindows cornices chimneys demarcations of stories etc one could sit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of this grand structure bit by bit and day after day and never weary his interest the termination toward the town observed in profile is the perfection of shape it comes down out of the clouds in a succession of rounded colossal terracelike projectionsa stairway for the gods at its head spring several lofty stormscarred towers one after another with faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral banners if there were a king whose realms included the whole world here would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch he would only need to hollow it out and put in the electric light he could give audience to a nation at a time under its roof  our search for those remains having failed we inspected with a glass the dim and distant track of an oldtime avalanche that once swept down from some pinegrown summits behind the town and swept away the houses and buried the people then we struck down the road that leads toward the rhone to see the famous ladders these perilous things are built against the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet high the peasants of both sexes were climbing up and down them with heavy loads on their backs i ordered harris to make the ascent so i could put the thrill and horror of it in my book and he accomplished the feat successfully through a subagent for three francs which i paid it makes me shudder yet when i think of what i felt when i was clinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy at times the world swam around me and i could hardly keep from letting go so dizzying was the appalling danger many a person would have given up and descended but i stuck to my task and would not yield until i had accomplished it i felt a just pride in my exploit but i would not have repeated it for the wealth of the world i shall break my neck yet with some such foolhardy performance for warnings never seem to have any lasting effect on me when the people of the hotel found that i had been climbing those crazy ladders it made me an object of considerable attention  next morning early we drove to the rhone valley and took the train for visp there we shouldered our knapsacks and things and set out on foot in a tremendous rain up the winding gorge toward zermatt hour after hour we slopped along by the roaring torrent and under noble lesser alps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and had little atomy swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their mistdimmed heights  the rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom and we continued to enjoy both at the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane highest and thundered loudest and lashed the big boulders fiercest the canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden bridge that exists in the world while we were walking over it along with a party of horsemen i noticed that even the larger raindrops made it shake i called harriss attention to it and he noticed it too it seemed to me that if i owned an elephant that was a keepsake and i thought a good deal of him i would think twice before i would ride him over that bridge  we climbed up to the village of st nicholas about half past four in the afternoon waded ankledeep through the fertilizerjuice and stopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church we stripped and went to bed and sent our clothes down to be baked and the horde of soaked tourists did the same that chaos of clothing got mixed in the kitchen and there were consequences   i did not get back the same drawers i sent down when our things came up at sixfifteen i got a pair on a new plan they were merely a pair of white rufflecuffed absurdities hitched together at the top with a narrow band and they did not come quite down to my knees they were pretty enough but they made me feel like two people and disconnected at that the man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that to rough it in the swiss mountains the shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers and hadnt any sleeves to itat least it hadnt anything more than what mr darwin would call rudimentary sleeves these had edging around them but the bosom was ridiculously plain the knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan and was really a sensible thing it opened behind and had pockets in it to put your shoulderblades in but they did not seem to fit mine and so i found it a sort of uncomfortable garment they gave my bobtail coat to somebody else and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe i had to tie my collar on because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt which i described a while ago  when i was dressed for dinner at sixthirty i was too loose in some places and too tight in others and altogether i felt slovenly and illconditioned however the people at the table dhôte were no better off than i was they had everybodys clothes but their own on a long stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it following me in but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers though i described them as well as i was able i gave them to the chambermaid that night when i went to bed and she probably found the owner for my own things were on a chair outside my door in the morning  there was a lovable english clergyman who did not get to the table dhôte at all his breeches had turned up missing and without any equivalent he said he was not more particular than other people but he had noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost sure to excite remark      a tramp abroad part 6  by mark twain  samuel l clemens  first

nicholas the churchbell began to ring at fourthirty in the morning and from the length of time it continued to ring i judged that it takes the swiss sinner a good while to get the invitation through his head most churchbells in the world are of poor quality and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and produces much sin but the st nicholas bell is a good deal the worst one that has been contrived yet and is peculiarly maddening in its operation still it may have its right and its excuse to exist for the community is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock perhaps but there cannot be any excuse for our churchbells at home for there is no family in america without a clock and consequently there is no fair pretext for the usual sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from our steeples there is much more profanity in america on sunday than in all in the other six days of the week put together and it is of a more bitter and malignant character than the weekday profanity too it is produced by the crackedpot clangor of the cheap churchbells   we build our churches almost without regard to cost we rear an edifice which is an adornment to the town and we gild it and fresco it and mortgage it and do everything we can think of to perfect it and then spoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears it giving some the headache others st vituss dance and the rest the blind staggers  an american village at ten oclock on a summer sunday is the quietest and peacefulest and holiest thing in nature but it is a pretty different thing half an hour later mr poes poem of the bells stands incomplete to this day but it is well enough that it is so for the public reciter or reader who goes around trying to imitate the sounds of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself up a stump when he got to the churchbellas joseph addison would say the church is always trying to get other people to reform it might not be a bad idea to reform itself a little by way of example it is still clinging to one or two things which were useful once but which are not useful now neither are they ornamental one is the bellringing to remind a clockcaked town that it is churchtime and another is the reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of notices which everybody who is interested has already read in the newspaper the clergyman even reads the hymn througha relic of an ancient time when hymnbooks are scarce and costly but everybody has a hymnbook now and so the public reading is no longer necessary it is not merely unnecessary it is generally painful for the average clergyman could not fire into his congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself unless the weapon scattered shamefully i am not meaning to be flippant and irreverent i am only meaning to be truthful the average clergyman in all countries and of all denominations is a very bad reader one would think he would at least learn how to read the lords prayer by and by but it is not so he races through it as if he thought the quicker he got it in the sooner it would be answered a person who does not appreciate the exceeding value of pauses and does not know how to measure their duration judiciously cannot render the grand simplicity and dignity of a composition like that effectively  we took a tolerably early breakfast and tramped off toward zermatt through the reeking lanes of the village glad to get away from that bell by and by we had a fine spectacle on our right it was the walllike butt end of a huge glacier which looked down on us from an alpine height which was well up in the blue sky it was an astonishing amount of ice to be compacted together in one mass we ciphered upon it and decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base of the wall of solid ice to the top of itharris believed it was really twice that we judged that if st pauls st peters the great pyramid the strasburg cathedral and the capitol in washington were clustered against that wall a man sitting on its upper edge could not hang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three or four hundred feeta thing which of course no man could do  to me that mighty glacier was very beautiful i did not imagine that anybody could find fault with it but i was mistaken harris had been snarling for several days he was a rabid protestant and he was always saying  in the protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and squalor as you do in this catholic one you never see the lanes and alleys flowing with foulness you never see such wretched little sties of houses you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for a dome and as for a churchbell why you never hear a churchbell at all  all this morning he had been finding fault straight along first it was with the mud he said it aint muddy in a protestant canton when it rains then it was with the dogs they dont have those lopeared dogs in a protestant canton then it was with the roads they dont leave the roads to make themselves in a protestant canton the people make themand they make a road that is a road too next it was the goats you never see a goat shedding tears in a protestant cantona goat there is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature next it was the chamois you never see a protestant chamois act like one of thesethey take a bite or two and go but these fellows camp with you and stay then it was the guideboards in a protestant canton you couldnt get lost if you wanted to but you never see a guideboard in a catholic canton next you never see any flowerboxes in the windows herenever anything but now and then a cata torpid one but you take a protestant canton windows perfectly lovely with flowersand as for cats theres just acres of them these folks in this canton leave a road to make itself and then fine you three francs if you trot over itas if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road next about the goiter they talk about goiteri havent seen a goiter in this whole canton that i couldnt put in a hat  he had growled at everything but i judged it would puzzle him to find anything the matter with this majestic glacier i intimated as much but he was ready and said with surly discontent you ought to see them in the protestant cantons  this irritated me but i concealed the feeling and asked  what is the matter with this one  matter why it aint in any kind of condition they never take any care of a glacier here the moraine has been spilling gravel around it and got it all dirty  why man they cant help that  they youre right that is they wont they could if they wanted to you never see a speck of dirt on a protestant glacier look at the rhone glacier it is fifteen miles long and seven hundred feet thick if this was a protestant glacier you wouldnt see it looking like this i can tell you  that is nonsense what would they do with it  they would whitewash it they always do  i did not believe a word of this but rather than have trouble i let it go for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot i even doubted if the rhone glacier was in a protestant canton but i did not know so i could not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me down at once with manufactured evidence  about nine miles from st nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging torrent of the visp and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which was pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall forty feet high and into the river three children were approaching one of them a little girl about eight years old was running when pretty close to us she stumbled and fell and her feet shot under the rail of the fence and for a moment projected over the stream it gave us a sharp shock for we thought she was gone sure for the ground slanted steeply and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility but she managed to scramble up and ran by us laughing  we went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge if she had finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of the water and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among the halfcovered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two minutes we had come exceedingly near witnessing her death   and now harriss contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly manifested he has no spirit of selfdenial he began straight off and continued for an hour to express his gratitude that the child was not destroyed i never saw such a man that was the kind of person he was just so he was gratified he never cared anything about anybody else i had noticed that trait in him over and over again often of course it was mere heedlessness mere want of reflection doubtless this may have been the case in most instances but it was not the less hard to bar on that accountand after all its bottom its groundwork was selfishness there is no avoiding that conclusion in the instance under consideration i did think the indecency of running on in that way might occur to him but no the child was saved and he was glad that was sufficienthe cared not a straw for my feelings or my loss of such a literary plum snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was ready to drop into it his selfishness was sufficient to place his own gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for me his friend apparently he did not once reflect upon the valuable details which would have fallen like a windfall to me fishing the child outwitnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would have made among the peasantsthen a swiss funeralthen the roadside monument to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it and we should have gone into baedeker and been immortal i was silent i was too much hurt to complain if he could act so and be so heedless and so frivolous at such a time and actually seem to glory in it after all i had done for him i would have cut my hand off before i would let him see that i was wounded   we were approaching zermatt consequently we were approaching the renowned matterhorn a month before this mountain had been only a name to us but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening double row of pictures of it done in oil water chromo wood steel copper crayon and photography and so it had at length become a shape to usand a very distinct decided and familiar one too we were expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run across it we were not deceived the monarch was far away when we first saw him but there was no such thing as mistaking him he has the rare peculiarity of standing by himself he is peculiarly steep too and is also most oddly shaped he towers into the sky like a colossal wedge with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left the broad base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacierpaved alpine platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sealevel as the wedge itself is some five thousand feet high it follows that its apex is about fifteen thousand feet above sealevel so the whole bulk of this stately piece of rock this skycleaving monolith is above the line of eternal snow yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of being built of solid snow from their waists up the matterhorn stands black and naked and forbidding the year round or merely powdered or streaked with white in places for its sides are so steep that the snow cannot stay there its strange form its august isolation and its majestic unkinship with its own kind make itso to speakthe napoleon of the mountain world grand gloomy and peculiar is a phrase which fits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain  think of a monument a mile high standing on a pedestal two miles high this is what the matterhorn isa monument its office henceforth for all time will be to keep watch and ward over the secret restingplace of the young lord douglas who in 1865 was precipitated from the summit over a precipice four thousand feet high and never seen again no man ever had such a monument as this before the most imposing of the worlds other monuments are but atoms compared to it and they will perish and their places will pass from memory but this will remain  the accident which cost lord douglas his life see chapter xii also cost the lives of three other men these three fell fourfifths of a mile and their bodies were afterward found lying side by side upon a glacier whence they were borne to zermatt and buried in the churchyard  the remains of lord douglas have never been found the secret of his sepulture like that of moses must remain a mystery always  a walk from st nicholas to zermatt is a wonderful experience nature is built on a stupendous plan in that region one marches continually between walls that are piled into the skies with their upper heights broken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold against the background of blue and here and there one sees a big glacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice or a graceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities there is nothing tame or cheap or trivialit is all magnificent that short valley is a picturegallery of a notable kind for it contains no mediocrities from end to end the creator has hung it with his masterpieces   we made zermatt at three in the afternoon nine hours out from st nicholas distance by guidebook twelve miles by pedometer seventytwo we were in the heart and home of the mountainclimbers now as all visible things testified the snowpeaks did not hold themselves aloof in aristocratic reserve they nestled close around in a friendly sociable way guides with the ropes and axes and other implements of their fearful calling slung about their persons roosted in a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel and waited for customers sunburnt climbers in mountaineering costume and followed by their guides and porters arrived from time to time from breakneck expeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the high alps male and female tourists on mules filed by in a continuous procession hotelwardbound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every time they were described at the english or american fireside and at last outgrow the possible itself  we were not dreaming this was not a makebelieve home of the alpclimber created by our heated imaginations no for here was mr girdlestone himself the famous englishman who hunts his way to the most formidable alpine summits without a guide i was not equal to imagining a girdlestone it was all i could do to even realize him while looking straight at him at short range i would rather face whole hyde parks of artillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the peaks and precipices of the mountains there is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous alp but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it i have not jumped to this conclusion i have traveled to it per graveltrain so to speak i have thought the thing all out and am quite sure i am right a born climbers appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy when it comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him he may have other business on hand but it must wait mr girdlestone had had his usual summer holiday in the alps and had spent it in his usual way hunting for unique chances to break his neck his vacation was over and his luggage packed for england but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the tremendous weisshorn once more for he had heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it his baggage was unpacked at once and now he and a friend laden with knapsacks iceaxes coils of rope and canteens of milk were just setting out they would spend the night high up among the snows somewhere and get up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise i had a strong desire to go with them but forced it downa feat which mr girdlestone with all his fortitude could not do  even ladies catch the climbing mania and are unable to throw it off a famous climber of that sex had attempted the weisshorn a few days before our arrival and she and her guides had lost their way in a snowstorm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to wander around a good while before they could find a way down when this lady reached the bottom she had been on her feet twentythree hours  our guides hired on the gemmi were already at zermatt when we reached there so there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an adventure whenever we should choose the time and the object i resolved to devote my first evening in zermatt to studying up the subject of alpine climbing by way of preparation  i read several books and here are some of the things i found out ones shoes must be strong and heavy and have pointed hobnails in them the alpenstock must be of the best wood for if it should break loss of life might be the result one should carry an ax to cut steps in the ice with on the great heights there must be a ladder for there are steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrumentor this utensilbut could not be surmounted without it such an obstruction has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route when a ladder would have saved him all trouble one must have from one hundred and fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope to be used in lowering the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to be traversed in any other way one must have a steel hook on another ropea very useful thing for when one is ascending and comes to a low bluff which is yet too high for the ladder he swings this rope aloft like a lasso the hook catches at the top of the bluff and then the tourist climbs the rope hand over handbeing always particular to try and forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till he arrives in some part of switzerland where they are not expecting him another important thingthere must be a rope to tie the whole party together with so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless chasm in a glacier the others may brace back on the rope and save him one must have a silk veil to protect his face from snow sleet hail and gale and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy snowblindness finally there must be some porters to carry provisions wine and scientific instruments and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in   i closed my readings with a fearful adventure which mr whymper once had on the matterhorn when he was prowling around alone five thousand feet above the town of breil he was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of iceglazed snow joined it this declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high overlooking a glacier his foot slipped and he fell  he says  my knapsack brought my head down first and i pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below they caught something and tumbled me off the edge head over heels into the gully the baton was dashed from my hands and i whirled downward in a series of bounds each longer than the last now over ice now into rocks striking my head four or five times each time with increased force the last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet from one side of the gully to the other and i struck the rocks luckily with the whole of my left side they caught my clothes for a moment and i fell back on to the snow with motion arrested my head fortunately came the right side up and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice baton hat and veil skimmed by and disappeared and the crash of the rockswhich i had startedas they fell on to the glacier told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction as it was i fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below   the situation was sufficiently serious the rocks could not be let go for a moment and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts the most serious ones were in the head and i vainly tried to close them with one hand while holding on with the other it was useless the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation at last in a moment of inspiration i kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head the idea was a happy one and the flow of blood diminished then scrambling up i got not a moment too soon to a place of safety and fainted away the sun was setting when consciousness returned and it was pitchdark before the great staircase was descended but by a combination of luck and care the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to breil was accomplished without a slip or once missing the way  his wounds kept him abed some days then he got up and climbed that mountain again that is the way with a true alpclimber the more fun he has the more he wants     chapter xxxvii  our imposing column starts upward   after i had finished my readings i was no longer myself i was tranced uplifted intoxicated by the almost incredible perils and adventures i had been following my authors through and the triumphs i had been sharing with them i sat silent some time then turned to harris and said  my mind is made up  something in my tone struck him and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there his face paled perceptibly he hesitated a moment then said  speak  i answered with perfect calmness  i will ascend the riffelberg  if i had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly if i had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose but i turned a deaf ear to all he said when he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination he ceased to urge and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs i sat in marble resolution with my eyes fixed upon vacancy for in spirit i was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears at last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones  your harris will never desert you we will die together  i cheered the noble fellow with praises and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure he wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning as he supposed the custom was but i explained that nobody was looking at that hour and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first nights restingplace on the mountain side i said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 pm on the morrow meantime he could notify the guides and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make  i went to bed but not to sleep no man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these alpine exploits i tossed feverishly all night long and was glad enough when i heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner i rose jaded and rusty and went to the noon meal where i found myself the center of interest and curiosity for the news was already abroad it is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion but it is very pleasant nevertheless  as usual at zermatt when a great ascent is about to be undertaken everybody native and foreign laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start the expedition consisted of 198 persons including the mules or 205 including the cows as follows      chiefs of service     subordinates       myself      1  veterinary surgeon      mr harris  1  butler  17  guides     12  waiters  4  surgeons     1  footman  1  geologist    1

coarse washers and ironers  44  mules       1  fine ditto  44  muleteers   7  cows                  2  milkers  total 154 men 51 animals grand total 205         rations etc          apparatus   16  cases hams      25  spring mattresses  2  barrels flour     2  hair ditto  22  barrels whiskey     bedding for same  1  barrel sugar      2  mosquitonets  1  keg lemons       29  tents  2000 cigars            scientific instruments  1  barrel pies      97  iceaxes  1  ton of pemmican   5  cases dynamite  143  pair crutches   7  cans nitroglycerin  2  barrels arnica   22  40foot ladders  1  bale of lint      2  miles of rope  27  kegs paregoric 154  umbrellas  it was full four oclock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready at that hour it began to move in point of numbers and spectacular effect it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from zermatt   i commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file twelve feet apart and lash them all together on a strong rope he objected that the first two miles was a dead level with plenty of room and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places but i would not listen to that my reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough i was not going to add one to the list the guide then obeyed my order  when the procession stood at ease roped together and ready to move i never saw a finer sight it was 3122 feet longover half a mile every man and me was on foot and had on his green veil and his blue goggles and his white rag around his hat and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other and his iceax in his belt and carried his alpenstock in his left hand his umbrella closed in his right and his crutches slung at his back the burdens of the packmules and the horns of the cows were decked with the edelweiss and the alpine rose  i and my agent were the only persons mounted we were in the post of danger in the extreme rear and tied securely to five guides apiece our armorbearers carried our iceaxes alpenstocks and other implements for us we were mounted upon very small donkeys as a measure of safety in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up and let the donkey walk from under still i cannot recommend this sort of animalat least for excursions of mere pleasurebecause his ears interrupt the view i and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes but concluded to leave them behind out of respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition we decided to make the ascent in evening dress   we watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us about half past five oclock we arrived at a bridge which spans the visp and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe the caravan crossed without accident the way now led by a gentle ascent carpeted with fresh green grass to the church at winkelmatten without stopping to examine this edifice i executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the findelenbach after first testing its strength here i deployed to the right again and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity these meadows offered an excellent campingplace we pitched our tents supped established a proper grade recorded the events of the day and then went to bed  we rose at two in the morning and dressed by candlelight it was a dismal and chilly business a few stars were shining but the general heavens were overcast and the great shaft of the matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds the chief guide advised a delay he said he feared it was going to rain we waited until nine oclock and then got away in tolerably clear weather   our course led up some terrific steeps densely wooded with larches and cedars and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which were obstructed by loose stones to add to the danger and inconvenience we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by  our troubles thickened about the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation after consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intactthat is to say they believed they were lost i asked if they did not know it no they said they couldnt absolutely know whether they were lost or not because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before they had a strong instinct that they were lost but they had no proofsexcept that they did not know where they were they had met no tourists for some time and they considered that a suspicious sign  plainly we were in an ugly fix the guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty so we all went together for better security we moved slow and cautiously for the forest was very dense we did not move up the mountain but around it hoping to strike across the old trail toward nightfall when we were about tired out we came up against a rock as big as a cottage this barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men and a panic of fear and despair ensued they moaned and wept and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition some even muttered threats against me  clearly it was no time to show weakness so i made a speech in which i said that other alpclimbers had been in as perilous a position as this and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped i promised to stand by them i promised to rescue them i closed by saying we had plenty of provisions to maintain us for quite a siegeand did they suppose zermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously disappear during any considerable time right above their noses and make no inquiries no zermatt would send out searchingexpeditions and we should be saved  this speech had a great effect the men pitched the tents with some little show of cheerfulness and we were snugly under cover when the night shut down i now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one article which is not mentioned in any book of alpine adventure but this i refer to the paregoric but for that beneficent drug would have not one of those men slept a moment during that fearful night but for that gentle persuader they must have tossed unsoothed the night through for the whiskey was for me yes they would have risen in the morning unfitted for their heavy task as it was everybody slept but my agent and meonly we and the barkeepers i would not permit myself to sleep at such a time i considered myself responsible for all those lives i meant to be on hand and ready in case of avalanches up there but i did not know it then  we watched the weather all through that awful night and kept an eye on the barometer to be prepared for the least change there was not the slightest change recorded by the instrument during the whole time words cannot describe the comfort that that friendly hopeful steadfast thing was to me in that season of trouble it was a defective barometer and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer but i did not know that until afterward if i should be in such a situation again i should not wish for any barometer but that one   all hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast and as soon as it was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock for some time we tried the hookrope and other means of scaling it but without successthat is without perfect success the hook caught once and harris started up it hand over hand but the hold broke and if there had not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time harris would certainly have been crippled as it was it was the chaplain he took to his crutches and i ordered the hookrope to be laid aside it was too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around   we were puzzled for a while then somebody thought of the ladders one of these was leaned against the rock and the men went up it tied together in couples another ladder was sent up for use in descending at the end of half an hour everybody was over and that rock was conquered we gave our first grand shout of triumph but the joy was shortlived for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals over  this was a serious difficulty in fact it was an impossibility the courage of the men began to waver immediately once more we were threatened with a panic but when the danger was most imminent we were saved in a mysterious way a mule which had attracted attention from the beginning by its disposition to experiment tried to eat a fivepound can of nitroglycerin this happened right alongside the rock the explosion threw us all to the ground and covered us with dirt and debris it frightened us extremely too for the crash it made was deafening and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble however we were grateful for the rock was gone its place was occupied by a new cellar about thirty feet across by fifteen feet deep the explosion was heard as far as zermatt and an hour and a half afterward many citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured by descending portions of mule meat frozen solid this shows better than any estimate in figures how high the experimenter went   we had nothing to do now but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way with a cheer the men went at their work i attended to the engineering myself i appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with iceaxes and trim them for piers to support the bridge this was a slow business for iceaxes are not good to cut wood with i caused my piers to be firmly set up in ranks in the cellar and upon them i laid six of my fortyfoot ladders side by side and laid six more on top of them upon this bridge i caused a bed of boughs to be spread and on top of the boughs a bed of earth six inches deep i stretched ropes upon either side to serve as railings and then my bridge was complete a train of elephants could have crossed it in safety and comfort by nightfall the caravan was on the other side and the ladders were taken up  next morning we went on in good spirits for a while though our way was slow and difficult by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the ground and the thickness of the forest but at last a dull despondency crept into the mens faces and it was apparent that not only they but even the guides were now convinced that we were lost the fact that we still met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant another thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost but very badly lost for there must surely be searchingparties on the road before this time yet we had seen no sign of them  demoralization was spreading something must be done and done quickly too fortunately i am not unfertile in expedients i contrived one now which commended itself to all for it promised well i took threequarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the waist of a guide and told him to go find the road while the caravan waited i instructed him to guide himself back by the rope in case of failure in case of success he was to give the rope a series of violent jerks whereupon the expedition would go to him at once he departed and in two minutes had disappeared among the trees i payed out the rope myself while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes the rope crept away quite slowly at times at other times with some briskness twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal and a shout was just ready to break from the mens lips when they perceived it was a false alarm but at last when over half a mile of rope had slidden away it stopped gliding and stood absolutely stillone minutetwo minutesthreewhile we held our breath and watched  was the guide resting was he scanning the country from some high point was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer stophad he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety  this thought gave us a shock i was in the very first act of detailing an expedition to succor him when the cord was assailed with a series of such frantic jerks that i could hardly keep hold of it the huzza that went up then was good to hear saved saved was the word that rang out all down the long rank of the caravan   we rose up and started at once we found the route to be good enough for a while but it began to grow difficult by and by and this feature steadily increased when we judged we had gone half a mile we momently expected to see the guide but no he was not visible anywhere neither was he waiting for the rope was still moving consequently he was doing the same this argued that he had not found the road yet but was marching to it with some peasant there was nothing for us to do but plod alongand this we did at the end of three hours we were still plodding this was not only mysterious but exasperating and very fatiguing too for we had tried hard along at first to catch up with the guide but had only fagged ourselves in vain for although he was traveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan over such ground  at three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustionand still the rope was slowly gliding out the murmurs against the guide had been growing steadily and at last they were become loud and savage a mutiny ensued the men refused to proceed they declared that we had been traveling over and over the same ground all day in a kind of circle they demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree so as to halt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him this was not an unreasonable requirement so i gave the order  as soon as the rope was tied the expedition moved forward with that alacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires but after a tiresome march of almost half a mile we came to a hill covered thick with a crumbly rubbish of stones and so steep that no man of us all was now in a condition to climb it every attempt failed and ended in crippling somebody within twenty minutes i had five men on crutches   whenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope it yielded and let him tumble backward the frequency of this result suggested an idea to me i ordered the caravan to bout face and form in marching order i then made the towrope fast to the rear mule and gave the command  mark timeby the right flankforwardmarch   the procession began to move to the impressive strains of a battlechant and i said to myself now if the rope dont break i judge this will fetch that guide into the camp i watched the rope gliding down the hill and presently when i was all fixed for triumph i was confronted by a bitter disappointment there was no guide tied to the rope it was only a very indignant old black ram the fury of the baffled expedition exceeded all bounds they even wanted to wreak their unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute but i stood between them and their prey menaced by a bristling wall of iceaxes and alpenstocks and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder and it was directly over my corpse even as i spoke i saw that my doom was sealed except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from their fell purpose i see the sickening wall of weapons now i see that advancing host as i saw it then i see the hate in those cruel eyes i remember how i drooped my head upon my breast i feel again the sudden earthquake shock in my rear administered by the very ram i was sacrificing myself to save i hear once more the typhoon of laughter that burst from the assaulting column as i clove it from van to rear like a sepoy shot from a rodman gun   i was saved yes i was saved and by the merciful instinct of ingratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous beast the grace which eloquence had failed to work in those mens hearts had been wrought by a laugh the ram was set free and my life was spared  we lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had placed a halfmile between himself and us to avert suspicion he had judged it best that the line should continue to move so he caught that ram and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to it we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon overcome by fatigue and distress when he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging around trying to rid itself of the rope and this was the signal which we had risen up with glad shouts to obey we had followed this ram round and round in a circle all daya thing which was proven by the discovery that we had watered the expedition seven times at one and same spring in seven hours as expert a woodman as i am i had somehow failed to notice this until my attention was called to it by a hog this hog was always wallowing there and as he was the only hog we saw his frequent repetition together with his unvarying similarity to himself finally caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog and this led me to the deduction that this must be the same spring alsowhich indeed it was  i made a note of this curious thing as showing in a striking manner the relative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog it is now a wellestablished fact that glaciers move i consider that my observations go to show with equal conclusiveness that a hog in a spring does not move i shall be glad to receive the opinions of other observers upon this point  to return for an explanatory moment to that guide and then i shall be done with him after leaving the ram tied to the rope he had wandered at large a while and then happened to run across a cow judging that a cow would naturally know more than a guide he took her by the tail and the result justified his judgment she nibbled her leisurely way downhill till it was near milkingtime then she struck for home and towed him into zermatt     chapter xxxviii  i conquer the gorner grat   we went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us the men were greatly fatigued their conviction that we were lost was forgotten in the cheer of a good supper and before the reaction had a chance to set in i loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed  next morning i was considering in my mind our desperate situation and trying to think of a remedy when harris came to me with a baedeker map which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in switzerlandyes every part of it was in switzerland so we were not lost after all this was an immense relief it lifted the weight of two such mountains from my breast i immediately had the news disseminated and the map was exhibited the effect was wonderful as soon as the men saw with their own eyes that they knew where they were and that it was only the summit that was lost and not themselves they cheered up instantly and said with one accord let the summit take care of itself  our distresses being at an end i now determined to rest the men in camp and give the scientific department of the expedition a chance first i made a barometric observation to get our altitude but i could not perceive that there was any result i knew by my scientific reading that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled to make them accurate i did not know which it was so i boiled them both there was still no result so i examined these instruments and discovered that they possessed radical blemishes the barometer had no hand but the brass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tinfoil i might have boiled those things to rags and never found out anything  i hunted up another barometer it was new and perfect i boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making the result was unexpected the instrument was not affecting at all but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook who was a most conscientious person changed its name in the bill of fare the dish was so greatly liked by all that i ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day   it was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured but i did not care for that i had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it could not tell how high a mountain was therefore i had no real use for it changes in the weather i could take care of without it i did not wish to know when the weather was going to be good what i wanted to know was when it was going to be bad and this i could find out from harriss corns harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the government observatory in heidelberg and one could depend upon them with confidence so i transferred the new barometer to the cooking department to be used for the official mess it was found that even a pretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer so i allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess  i next boiled the thermometer and got a most excellent result the mercury went up to about 200 degrees fahrenheit in the opinion of the other scientists of the expedition this seemed to indicate that we had attained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above sealevel science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand feet above sealevel there was no snow where we were consequently it was proven that the eternal snowline ceases somewhere above the tenthousandfoot level and does not begin any more this was an interesting fact and one which had not been observed by any observer before it was as valuable as interesting too since it would open up the deserted summits of the highest alps to population and agriculture it was a proud thing to be where we were yet it caused us a pang to reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two hundred thousand feet higher  the success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with my photographic apparatus i got it out and boiled one of my cameras but the thing was a failure it made the wood swell up and burst and i could not see that the lenses were any better than they were before  i now concluded to boil a guide it might improve him it could not impair his usefulness but i was not allowed to proceed guides have no feeling for science and this one would not consent to be made uncomfortable in its interest  in the midst of my scientific work one of those needless accidents happened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless a porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the latinist this was not a serious matter to me for a latinists duties are as well performed on crutches as otherwisebut the fact remained that if the latinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that load that would have been quite another matter for when it comes down to a question of value there is a palpable difference between a latinist and a mule i could not depend on having a latinist in the right place every time so to make things safe i ordered that in the future the chamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other weapon than the forefinger  my nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another shakeupone which utterly unmanned me for a moment a rumor swept suddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a precipice  however it turned out that it was only a chaplain i had laid in an extra force of chaplains purposely to be prepared for emergencies like this but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather shorthanded in the matter of barkeepers  on the following morning we moved on well refreshed and in good spirits i remember this day with peculiar pleasure because it saw our road restored to us yes we found our road again and in quite an extraordinary way we had plodded along some two hours and a half when we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high i did not need to be instructed by a mule this time i was already beginning to know more than any mule in the expedition i at once put in a blast of dynamite and lifted that rock out of the way but to my surprise and mortification i found that there had been a chalet on top of it  i picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity and subordinates of my corps collected the rest none of these poor people were injured happily but they were much annoyed i explained to the head chaleteer just how the thing happened and that i was only searching for the road and would certainly have given him timely notice if i had known he was up there i said i had meant no harm and hoped i had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in the air i said many other judicious things and finally when i offered to rebuild his chalet and pay for the breakages and throw in the cellar he was mollified and satisfied he hadnt any cellar at all before he would not have as good a view now as formerly but what he had lost in view he had gained in cellar by exact measurement he said there wasnt another hole like that in the mountainsand he would have been right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin  i put a hundred and sixteen men at work and they rebuilt the chalet from its own debris in fifteen minutes it was a good deal more picturesque than it was before too the man said we were now on the feilstutz above the schwegmattinformation which i was glad to get since it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had not been accustomed to for a day or so we also learned that we were standing at the foot of the riffelberg proper and that the initial chapter of our work was completed   we had a fine view from here of the energetic visp as it makes its first plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice worn through the footwall of the great gorner glacier and we could also see the furggenbach which is the outlet of the furggen glacier  the muleroad to the summit of the riffelberg passed right in front of the chalet a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed because a procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time  pretty much may not be elegant english but it is high time it was there is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it meansmt  the chaleteers business consisted in furnishing refreshments to tourists my blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes by breaking all the bottles on the place but i gave the man a lot of whiskey to sell for alpine champagne and a lot of vinegar which would answer for rhine wine consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever  leaving the expedition outside to rest i quartered myself in the chalet with harris proposing to correct my journals and scientific observations before continuing the ascent i had hardly begun my work when a tall slender vigorous american youth of about twentythree who was on his way down the mountain entered and came toward me with that breezy selfcomplacency which is the adolescents idea of the wellbred ease of the man of the world his hair was short and parted accurately in the middle and he had all the look of an american person who would be likely to begin his signature with an initial and spell his middle name out he introduced himself smiling a smirky smile borrowed from the courtiers of the stage extended a fairskinned talon and while he gripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the hips as the stage courtier does and said in the airiest and most condescending and patronizing wayi quite remember his exact language  very glad to make your acquaintance m sure very glad indeed assure you ive read all your little efforts and greatly admired them and when i heard you were here i   i indicated a chair and he sat down this grandee was the grandson of an american of considerable note in his day and not wholly forgotten yeta man who came so near being a great man that he was quite generally accounted one while he lived   i slowly paced the floor pondering scientific problems and heard this conversation  grandson first visit to europe  harris mine yes  gs with a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may be tasted in their freshness but once ah i know what it is to you a first visitah the romance of it i wish i could feel it again  h yes i find it exceeds all my dreams it is enchantment i go  gs with a dainty gesture of the hand signifying spare me your callow enthusiasms good friend yes i know i know you go to cathedrals and exclaim and you drag through leaguelong picturegalleries and exclaim and you stand here and there and yonder upon historic ground and continue to exclaim and you are permeated with your first crude conceptions of art and are proud and happy ah yes proud and happythat expresses it yesyes enjoy itit is rightit is an innocent revel  h and you dont you do these things now  gs i oh that is very good my dear sir when you are as old a traveler as i am you will not ask such a question as that i visit the regulation gallery moon around the regulation cathedral do the worn round of the regulation sights yetexcuse me  h well what do you do then  gs do i flitand flitfor i am ever on the wingbut i avoid the herd today i am in paris tomorrow in berlin anon in rome but you would look for me in vain in the galleries of the louvre or the common resorts of the gazers in those other capitals if you would find me you must look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think of going one day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure peasants cabin another day you will find me in some forgotten castle worshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked and which the unexperienced would despise again you will find me as guest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to get a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant  h you are a guest in such places  gs and a welcoming one  h it is surprising how does it come  gs my grandfathers name is a passport to all the courts in europe i have only to utter that name and every door is open to me i flit from court to court at my own free will and pleasure and am always welcome i am as much at home in the palaces of europe as you are among your relatives i know every titled person in europe i think i have my pockets full of invitations all the time i am under promise to go to italy where i am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses in the land in berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the imperial palace it is the same wherever i go  h it must be very pleasant but it must make boston seem a little slow when you are at home  gs yes of course it does but i dont go home much theres no life therelittle to feed a mans higher nature bostons very narrow you know she doesnt know it and you couldnt convince her of itso i say nothing when im there wheres the use yes boston is very narrow but she has such a good opinion of herself that she cant see it a man who has traveled as much as i have and seen as much of the world sees it plain enough but he cant cure it you know so the best is to leave it and seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture i run across there once a year perhaps when i have nothing important on hand but im very soon back again i spend my time in europe  h i see you map out your plans and   gs no excuse me i dont map out any plans i simply follow the inclination of the day i am limited by no ties no requirements i am not bound in any way i am too old a traveler to hamper myself with deliberate purposes i am simply a traveleran inveterate travelera man of the world in a wordi can call myself by no other name i do not say i am going here or i am going therei say nothing at all i only act for instance next week you may find me the guest of a grandee of spain or you may find me off for venice or flitting toward dresden i shall probably go to egypt presently friends will say to friends he is at the nile cataractsand at that very moment they will be surprised to learn that im away off yonder in india somewhere i am a constant surprise to people they are always saying yes he was in jerusalem when we heard of him last but goodness knows where he is now  presently the grandson rose to leavediscovered he had an appointment with some emperor perhaps he did his graces over again gripped me with one talon at armslength pressed his hat against his stomach with the other bent his body in the middle three times murmuring  pleasure m sure great pleasure m sure wish you much success  then he removed his gracious presence it is a great and solemn thing to have a grandfather  i have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way for what little indignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but compassion one cannot keep up a grudge against a vacuum i have tried to repeat this lads very words if i have failed anywhere i have at least not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said he and the innocent chatterbox whom i met on the swiss lake are the most unique and interesting specimens of young america i came across during my foreign tramping i have made honest portraits of them not caricatures   the grandson of twentythree referred to himself five or six times as an old traveler and as many as three times with a serene complacency which was maddening as a man of the world there was something very delicious about his leaving boston to her narrowness unreproved and uninstructed  i formed the caravan in marching order presently and after riding down the line to see that it was properly roped together gave the command to proceed in a little while the road carried us to open grassy land we were above the troublesome forest now and had an uninterrupted view straight before us of our summitthe summit of the riffelberg  we followed the muleroad a zigzag course now to the right now to the left but always up and always crowded and incommoded by going and coming files of reckless tourists who were never in a single instance tied together i was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution for in many places the road was not two yards wide and often the lower side of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep i had to encourage the men constantly to keep them from giving way to their unmanly fears  we might have made the summit before night but for a delay caused by the loss of an umbrella i was allowing the umbrella to remain lost but the men murmured and with reason for in this exposed region we stood in peculiar need of protection against avalanches so i went into camp and detached a strong party to go after the missing article  the difficulties of the next morning were severe but our courage was high for our goal was near at noon we conquered the last impedimentwe stood at last upon the summit and without the loss of a single man except the mule that ate the glycerin our great achievement was achievedthe possibility of the impossible was demonstrated and harris and i walked proudly into the great diningroom of the riffelberg hotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner  yes i had made the grand ascent but it was a mistake to do it in evening dress the plug hats were battered the swallowtails were fluttering rags mud added no grace the general effect was unpleasant and even disreputable   there were about seventyfive tourists at the hotelmainly ladies and little childrenand they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for all our privations and sufferings the ascent had been made and the names and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it to all future tourists  i boiled a thermometer and took an altitude with a most curious result the summit was not as high as the point on the mountainside where i had taken the first altitude suspecting that i had made an important discovery i prepared to verify it there happened to be a still higher summit called the gorner grat above the hotel and notwithstanding the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height and that the ascent is difficult and dangerous i resolved to venture up there and boil a thermometer so i sent a strong party with some borrowed hoes in charge of two chiefs of service to dig a stairway in the soil all the way up and this i ascended roped to the guides this breezy height was the summit properso i accomplished even more than i had originally purposed to do this foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone monument   i boiled my thermometer and sure enough this spot which purported to be two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel turned out to be nine thousand feet lower thus the fact was clearly demonstrated that above a certain point the higher a point seems to be the lower it actually is our ascent itself was a great achievement but this contribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter  cavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the higher and higher you go and hence the apparent anomaly i answer that i do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does but upon what a boiled thermometer says you cant go behind the thermometer  i had a magnificent view of monte rosa and apparently all the rest of the alpine world from that high place all the circling horizon was piled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests one might have imagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of brobdingnagians   notei had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse of the matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds i leveled my photographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant and should have got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered it was my purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book but was obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the professional artist because i found i could not do landscape well  but lonely conspicuous and superb rose that wonderful upright wedge the matterhorn its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow and the upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a veil a little later the matterhorn took to himself the semblance of a volcano he was stripped naked to his apexaround this circled vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away slantwise toward the sun a twentymile stretch of rolling and tumbling vapor and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater later again one of the mountains sides was clean and clear and another side densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which feathered off and flew around the shafts sharp edge like the smoke around the corners of a burning building the matterhorn is always experimenting and always gets up fine effects too in the sunset when all the lower world is palled in gloom it points toward heaven out of the pervading blackness like a finger of fire in the sunrisewell they say it is very fine in the sunrise  authorities agree that there is no such tremendous layout of snowy alpine magnitude grandeur and sublimity to be seen from any other accessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the riffelberg therefore let the tourist rope himself up and go there for i have shown that with nerve caution and judgment the thing can be done  i wish to add one remark herein parentheses so to speaksuggested by the word snowy which i have just used we have all seen hills and mountains and levels with snow on them and so we think we know all the aspects and effects produced by snow but indeed we do not until we have seen the alps possibly mass and distance add somethingat any rate something is added among other noticeable things there is a dazzling intense whiteness about the distant alpine snow when the sun is on it which one recognizes as peculiar and not familiar to the eye the snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to itpainters usually give it a bluish castbut there is no perceptible tint to the distant alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest as to the unimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on itwell it simply is unimaginable     chapter xxxix  we travel by glacier   a guidebook is a queer thing the reader has just seen what a man who undertakes the great ascent from zermatt to the riffelberg hotel must experience yet baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this matter     1 distance3 hours    2 the road cannot be mistaken    3 guide unnecessary    4 distance from riffelberg hotel to the gorner grat one hour and a half    5 ascent simple and easy guide unnecessary    6 elevation of zermatt above sealevel 5315 feet    7 elevation of riffelberg hotel above sealevel 8429 feet    8 elevation of the gorner grat above sealevel 10289 feet  i have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the following demonstrated facts     1 distance from zermatt to riffelberg hotel 7 days    2 the road can be mistaken if i am the first that did it i want the credit       of it too    3 guides are necessary for none but a native can read those fingerboards    4 the estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sealevel       is pretty correctfor baedeker he only misses it about a hundred and       eighty or ninety thousand feet  i found my arnica invaluable my men were suffering excruciatingly from the friction of sitting down so much during two or three days not one of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about yet so effective was the arnica that on the fourth all were able to sit up i consider that more than to anything else i owe the success of our great undertaking to arnica and paregoric  my men are being restored to health and strength my main perplexity now was how to get them down the mountain again i was not willing to expose the brave fellows to the perils fatigues and hardships of that fearful route again if it could be helped first i thought of balloons but of course i had to give that idea up for balloons were not procurable i thought of several other expedients but upon consideration discarded them for cause but at last i hit it i was aware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact for i had read it in baedeker so i resolved to take passage for zermatt on the great gorner glacier  very good the next thing was how to get down the glacier comfortablyfor the muleroad to it was long and winding and wearisome i set my mind at work and soon thought out a plan one looks straight down upon the vast frozen river called the gorner glacier from the gorner grat a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high we had one hundred and fiftyfour umbrellasand what is an umbrella but a parachute  i mentioned this noble idea to harris with enthusiasm and was about to order the expedition to form on the gorner grat with their umbrellas and prepare for flight by platoons each platoon in command of a guide when harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty he asked me if this method of descending the alps had ever been tried before i said no i had not heard of an instance then in his opinion it was a matter of considerable gravity in his opinion it would not be well to send the whole command over the cliff at once a better way would be to send down a single individual first and see how he fared  i saw the wisdom in this idea instantly i said as much and thanked my agent cordially and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing right away and wave his hat when he got down if he struck in a soft place and then i would ship the rest right along  harris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence and said so in a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it but at the same time he said he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor that it might cause jealousy in the command for there were plenty who would not hesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment whereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it at all nor even in his secret heart desired it  i said these words did him extreme credit but that he must not throw away the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend an alp per parachute simply to save the feelings of some envious underlings no i said he must accept the appointmentit was no longer an invitation it was a command  he thanked me with effusion and said that putting the thing in this form removed every objection he retired and soon returned with his umbrella his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy just then the head guide passed along harriss expression changed to one of infinite tenderness and he said  that man did me a cruel injury four days ago and i said in my heart he should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil i resign in his favor appoint him  i threw my arms around the generous fellow and said  harris you are the noblest soul that lives you shall not regret this sublime act neither shall the world fail to know of it you shall have opportunity far transcending this one too if i liveremember that  i called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot but the thing aroused no enthusiasm in him he did not take to the idea at all  he said  tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the gorner grat excuse me there are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that   upon a discussion of the subject with him it appeared that he considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous i was not convinced yet i was not willing to try the experiment in any risky waythat is in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency of the expedition i was about at my wits end when it occurred to me to try it on the latinist  he was called in but he declined on the plea of inexperience diffidence in public lack of curiosity and i didnt know what all another man declined on account of a cold in the head thought he ought to avoid exposure another could not jump wellnever could jump welldid not believe he could jump so far without long and patient practice another was afraid it was going to rain and his umbrella had a hole in it everybody had an excuse the result was what the reader has by this time guessed the most magnificent idea that was ever conceived had to be abandoned from sheer lack of a person with enterprise enough to carry it out yes i actually had to give that thing upwhile doubtless i should live to see somebody use it and take all the credit from me  well i had to go overlandthere was no other way i marched the expedition down the steep and tedious mulepath and took up as good a position as i could upon the middle of the glacierbecause baedeker said the middle part travels the fastest as a measure of economy however i put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts to go as slow freight  i waited and waited but the glacier did not move night was coming on the darkness began to gatherstill we did not budge it occurred to me then that there might be a timetable in baedeker it would be well to find out the hours of starting i called for the bookit could not be found bradshaw would certainly contain a timetable but no bradshaw could be found  very well i must make the best of the situation so i pitched the tents picketed the animals milked the cows had supper paregoricked the men established the watch and went to bedwith orders to call me as soon as we came in sight of zermatt  i awoke about half past ten next morning and looked around we hadnt budged a peg at first i could not understand it then it occurred to me that the old thing must be aground so i cut down some trees and rigged a spar on the starboard and another on the port side and fooled away upward of three hours trying to spar her off but it was no use she was half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long and there was no telling just whereabouts she was aground the men began to show uneasiness too and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces saying she had sprung a leak   nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another panic i ordered them to show me the place they led me to a spot where a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water it did look like a pretty bad leak but i kept that to myself i made a pump and set the men to work to pump out the glacier we made a success of it i perceived then that it was not a leak at all this boulder had descended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the glacier and the sun had warmed it up every day and consequently it had melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice until at last it reposed as we had found it in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest water  presently baedeker was found again and i hunted eagerly for the timetable there was none the book simply said the glacier was moving all the time this was satisfactory so i shut up the book and chose a good position to view the scenery as we passed along i stood there some time enjoying the trip but at last it occurred to me that we did not seem to be gaining any on the scenery i said to myself this confounded old things aground again sureand opened baedeker to see if i could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions i soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter it said the gorner glacier travels at an average rate of a little less than an inch a day i have seldom felt so outraged i have seldom had my confidence so wantonly betrayed i made a small calculation one inch a day say thirty feet a year estimated distance to zermatt three and oneeighteenth miles time required to go by glacier a little over five hundred years i said to myself i can walk it quickerand before i will patronize such a fraud as this i will do it  when i revealed to harris the fact that the passenger part of this glacierthe central partthe lightningexpress part so to speakwas not due in zermatt till the summer of 2378 and that the baggage coming along the slow edge would not arrive until some generations later he burst out with  that is european management all over an inch a daythink of that five hundred years to go a trifle over three miles but i am not a bit surprised its a catholic glacier you can tell by the look of it and the management  i said no i believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a catholic canton  well then its a government glacier said harris its all the same over here the government runs everythingso everythings slow slow and illmanaged but with us everythings done by private enterpriseand then there aint much lolling around you can depend on it i wish tom scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab onceyoud see it take a different gait from this  i said i was sure he would increase the speed if there was trade enough to justify it  hed make trade said harris thats the difference between governments and individuals governments dont care individuals do tom scott would take all the trade in two years gorner stock would go to two hundred and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers under the hammer for taxes after a reflective pause harris added a little less than an inch a day a little less than an inch mind you well im losing my reverence for glaciers  i was feeling much the same way myself i have traveled by canalboat oxwagon raft and by the ephesus and smyrna railway but when it comes down to good solid honest slow motion i bet my money on the glacier as a means of passenger transportation i consider the glacier a failure but as a vehicle of slow freight i think she fills the bill in the matter of putting the fine shades on that line of business i judge she could teach the germans something  i ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to zermatt at this moment a most interesting find was made a dark object bedded in the glacial ice was cut out with the iceaxes and it proved to be a piece of the undressed skin of some animala hair trunk perhaps but a close inspection disabled the hairtrunk theory and further discussion and examination exploded it entirelythat is in the opinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it this one clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of originators of scientific theories and afterward won many of the first scientists of the age to his view by a very able pamphlet which he wrote entitled evidences going to show that the hair trunk in a wild state belonged to the early glacial period and roamed the wastes of chaos in the company with the cavebear primeval man and the other ooelitics of the old silurian family   each of our scientists had a theory of his own and put forward an animal of his own as a candidate for the skin i sided with the geologist of the expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had once helped to cover a siberian elephant in some old forgotten agebut we divided there the geologist believing that this discovery proved that siberia had formerly been located where switzerland is now whereas i held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval swiss was not the dull savage he is represented to have been but was a being of high intellectual development who liked to go to the menagerie  we arrived that evening after many hardships and adventures in some fields close to the great icearch where the mad visp boils and surges out from under the foot of the great gorner glacier and here we camped our perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed we marched into zermatt the next day and were received with the most lavish honors and applause a document signed and sealed by the authorities was given to me which established and endorsed the fact that i had made the ascent of the riffelberg this i wear around my neck and it will be buried with me when i am no more     chapter xl  piteous relics at chamonix   i am not so ignorant about glacial movement now as i was when i took passage on the gorner glacier i have read up since i am aware that these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed while the gorner glacier makes less than an inch a day the unteraar glacier makes as much as eight and still other glaciers are said to go twelve sixteen and even twenty inches a day one writer says that the slowest glacier travels twentyfive feet a year and the fastest four hundred  what is a glacier it is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains but that gives no notion of its vastness for it is sometimes six hundred feet thick and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep no our rivers are six feet twenty feet and sometimes fifty feet deep we are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an iceriver six hundred feet deep  the glaciers surface is not smooth and level but has deep swales and swelling elevations and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose turbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent motion the glaciers surface is not a flawless mass but is a river with cracks or crevices some narrow some gaping wide many a man the victim of a slip or a misstep has plunged down one of these and met his death men have been fished out of them alive but it was when they did not go to a great depth the cold of the great depths would quickly stupefy a man whether he was hurt or unhurt these cracks do not go straight down one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down them consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought for in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance whereas their case in most instances had really been hopeless from the beginning  in 1864 a party of tourists was descending mont blanc and while picking their way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region roped together as was proper a young porter disengaged himself from the line and started across an icebridge which spanned a crevice it broke under him with a crash and he disappeared the others could not see how deep he had gone so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him a brave young guide named michel payot volunteered  two ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a third one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him he was lowered into the crevice he descended deeper and deeper between the clear blue walls of solid ice he approached a bend in the crack and disappeared under it down and still down he went into this profound grave when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under another bend in the crack and thence descended eighty feet lower as between perpendicular precipices arrived at this stage of one hundred and sixty feet below the surface of the glacier he peered through the twilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and stretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps for its course was lost in darkness what a place that was to be inespecially if that leather belt should break the compression of the belt threatened to suffocate the intrepid fellow he called to his friends to draw him up but could not make them hear they still lowered him deeper and deeper then he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could his friends understood and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death  then they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet but it found no bottom it came up covered with congelationsevidence enough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken bones a swift death from cold was sure anyway  a glacier is a stupendous everprogressing resistless plow it pushes ahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together and they stretch across the gorge right in front of it like a long grave or a long sharp roof this is called a moraine it also shoves out a moraine along each side of its course   imposing as the modern glaciers are they are not so huge as were some that once existed for instance mr whymper says  at some very remote period the valley of aosta was occupied by a vast glacier which flowed down its entire length from mont blanc to the plain of piedmont remained stationary or nearly so at its mouth for many centuries and deposited there enormous masses of debris the length of this glacier exceeded eighty miles and it drained a basin twentyfive to thirtyfive miles across bounded by the highest mountains in the alps   the great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers and then as now shattered by sun and frost poured down their showers of rocks and stones in witness of which there are the immense piles of angular fragments that constitute the moraines of ivrea  the moraines around ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions that which was on the left bank of the glacier is about thirteen miles long and in some places rises to a height of two thousand one hundred and thirty feet above the floor of the valley the terminal moraines those which are pushed in front of the glaciers cover something like twenty square miles of country at the mouth of the valley of aosta the thickness of the glacier must have been at least two thousand feet and its width at that part five miles and a quarter   it is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that if one could cleave off the butt end of such a glacieran oblong block two or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand feet thickhe could completely hide the city of new york under it and trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a shinglenail would stick up into the bottom of a saratoga trunk  the boulders from mont blanc upon the plain below ivrea assure us that the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length of time their present distance from the cliffs from which they were derived is about 420000 feet and if we assume that they traveled at the rate of 400 feet per annum their journey must have occupied them no less than 1055 years in all probability they did not travel so fast   glaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snailpace a marvelous spectacle is presented then mr whymper refers to a case which occurred in iceland in 1721  it seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain kotlugja large bodies of water formed underneath or within the glaciers either on account of the interior heat of the earth or from other causes and at length acquired irresistible power tore the glaciers from their mooring on the land and swept them over every obstacle into the sea prodigious masses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over land in the space of a few hours and their bulk was so enormous that they covered the sea for seven miles from the shore and remained aground in six hundred feet of water the denudation of the land was upon a grand scale all superficial accumulations were swept away and the bedrock was exposed it was described in graphic language how all irregularities and depressions were obliterated and a smooth surface of several miles area laid bare and that this area had the appearance of having been planed by a plane  the account translated from the icelandic says that the mountainlike ruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye could reach no open water was discoverable even from the highest peaks a monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch of land too by this strange irruption  one can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it is mentioned that from hofdabrekka farm which lies high up on a fjeld one could not see hjorleifshofdi opposite which is a fell six hundred and forty feet in height but in order to do so had to clamber up a mountain slope east of hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high  these things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who keeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by and by the alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of conceit out of a man and reduce his selfimportance to zero if he will only remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough to give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work  the alpine glaciers movethat is granted now by everybody but there was a time when people scoffed at the idea they said you might as well expect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues of ice to do it but proof after proof was furnished and the finally the world had to believe  the wise men not only said the glacier moved but they timed its movement they ciphered out a glaciers gait and then said confidently that it would travel just so far in so many years there is record of a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in these reckonings  in 1820 the ascent of mont blanc was attempted by a russian and two englishmen with seven guides they had reached a prodigious altitude and were approaching the summit when an avalanche swept several of the party down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them all guides into one of the crevices of a glacier the life of one of the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his backit bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came the alpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way three men were lostpierre balmat pierre carrier and auguste tairraz they had been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice  dr forbes the english geologist had made frequent visits to the mont blanc region and had given much attention to the disputed question of the movement of glaciers during one of these visits he completed his estimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed up the three guides and uttered the prediction that the glacier would deliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirtyfive years from the time of the accident or possibly forty  a dull slow journeya movement imperceptible to any eyebut it was proceeding nevertheless and without cessation it was a journey which a rolling stone would make in a few secondsthe lofty point of departure was visible from the village below in the valley  the prediction cut curiously close to the truth fortyone years after the catastrophe the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier  i find an interesting account of the matter in the histoire du mont blanc by stephen darve i will condense this account as follows  on the 12th of august 1861 at the hour of the close of mass a guide arrived out of breath at the mairie of chamonix and bearing on his shoulders a very lugubrious burden it was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the glacier des bossons he conjectured that these were remains of the victims of the catastrophe of 1820 and a minute inquest immediately instituted by the local authorities soon demonstrated the correctness of his supposition the contents of the sack were spread upon a long table and officially inventoried as follows  portions of three human skulls several tufts of black and blonde hair a human jaw furnished with fine white teeth a forearm and hand all the fingers of the latter intact the flesh was white and fresh and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the articulations  the ringfinger had suffered a slight abrasion and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after fortyone years a left foot the flesh white and fresh  along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats hats hobnailed shoes and other clothing a wing of a pigeon with black feathers a fragment of an alpenstock a tin lantern and lastly a boiled leg of mutton the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant odor the guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier an hours exposure to the sun had already begun the work of decomposition upon it  persons were called for to identify these poor pathetic relics and a touching scene ensued two men were still living who had witnessed the grim catastrophe of nearly half a century beforemarie couttet saved by his baton and julien davouassoux saved by the barometer these aged men entered and approached the table davouassoux more than eighty years old contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant eye for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age but couttets faculties were still perfect at seventytwo and he exhibited strong emotion he said  pierre balmat was fair he wore a straw hat this bit of skull with the tuft of blond hair was his this is his hat pierre carrier was very dark this skull was his and this felt hat this is balmats hand i remember it so well and the old man bent down and kissed it reverently then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp crying out i could never have dared to believe that before quitting this world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of those brave comrades the hand of my good friend balmat   there is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that whitehaired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend who had been dead forty years when these hands had met last they were alike in the softness and freshness of youth now one was brown and wrinkled and horny with age while the other was still as young and fair and blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single moment leaving no mark of their passage time had gone on in the one case it had stood still in the other a man who has not seen a friend for a generation keeps him in mind always as he saw him last and is somehow surprised and is also shocked to see the aging change the years have wrought when he sees him again marie couttets experience in finding his friends hand unaltered from the image of it which he had carried in his memory for forty years is an experience which stands alone in the history of man perhaps  couttet identified other relics  this hat belonged to auguste tairraz he carried the cage of pigeons which we proposed to set free upon the summit here is the wing of one of those pigeons and here is the fragment of my broken baton it was by grace of that baton that my life was saved who could have told me that i should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of wood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate companions  no portions of the body of tairraz other than a piece of the skull had been found a diligent search was made but without result however another search was instituted a year later and this had better success many fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were discovered also part of a lantern and a green veil with bloodstains on it but the interesting feature was this  one of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from a crevice in the icewall with the hand outstretched as if offering greeting the nails of this white hand were still rosy and the pose of the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the longlost light of day  the hand and arm were alone there was no trunk after being removed from the ice the fleshtints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took on the alabaster hue of death this was the third right hand found therefore all three of the lost men were accounted for beyond cavil or question  dr hamel was the russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent at the time of the famous disaster he left chamonix as soon as he conveniently could after the descent and as he had shown a chilly indifference about the calamity and offered neither sympathy nor assistance to the widows and orphans he carried with him the cordial execrations of the whole community four months before the first remains were found a chamonix guide named balmata relative of one of the lost menwas in london and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the british museum who said  i overheard your name are you from chamonix monsieur balmat  yes sir  havent they found the bodies of my three guides yet i am dr hamel  alas no monsieur  well youll find them sooner or later  yes it is the opinion of dr forbes and mr tyndall that the glacier will sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate victims  without a doubt without a doubt and it will be a great thing for chamonix in the matter of attracting tourists you can get up a museum with those remains that will draw  this savage idea has not improved the odor of dr hamels name in chamonix by any means but after all the man was sound on human nature his idea was conveyed to the public officials of chamonix and they gravely discussed it around the official counciltable they were only prevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition of the friends and descendants of the lost guides who insisted on giving the remains christian burial and succeeded in their purpose  a close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments to prevent embezzlement a few accessory odds and ends were sold rags and scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to about twenty dollars a yard a piece of a lantern and one or two other trifles brought nearly their weight in gold and an englishman offered a pound sterling for a single breechesbutton     chapter xli  the fearful disaster of 1865   one of the most memorable of all the alpine catastrophes was that of july 1865 on the matterhornalready slightly referred to a few pages back the details of it are scarcely known in america to the vast majority of readers they are not known at all mr whympers account is the only authentic one i will import the chief portion of it into this book partly because of its intrinsic interest and partly because it gives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of alpclimbing is this was mr whympers ninth attempt during a series of years to vanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock it succeeded the other eight were failures no man had ever accomplished the ascent before though the attempts had been numerous  mr whympers narrative we started from zermatt on the 13th of july at half past five on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning we were eight in numbercroz guide old peter taugwalder guide and his two sons lord f douglas mr hadow rev mr hudson and i to insure steady motion one tourist and one native walked together the youngest taugwalder fell to my share the winebags also fell to my lot to carry and throughout the day after each drink i replenished them secretly with water so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before this was considered a good omen and little short of miraculous  on the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height and we mounted accordingly very leisurely before twelve oclock we had found a good position for the tent at a height of eleven thousand feet we passed the remaining hours of daylightsome basking in the sunshine some sketching some collecting hudson made tea i coffee and at length we retired each one to his blanket bag  we assembled together before dawn on the 14th and started directly it was light enough to move one of the young taugwalders returned to zermatt in a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the view of the eastern face from our tent platform the whole of this great slope was now revealed rising for three thousand feet like a huge natural staircase some parts were more and others were less easy but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or to the left for the greater part of the way there was no occasion indeed for the rope and sometimes hudson led sometimes myself at sixtwenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred feet and halted for half an hour we then continued the ascent without a break until ninefiftyfive when we stopped for fifty minutes at a height of fourteen thousand feet   we had now arrived at the foot of that part which seen from the riffelberg seems perpendicular or overhanging we could no longer continue on the eastern side for a little distance we ascended by snow upon the arÊtethat is the ridgethen turned over to the right or northern side the work became difficult and required caution in some places there was little to hold the general slope of the mountain was less than forty degrees and snow had accumulated in and had filled up the interstices of the rockface leaving only occasional fragments projecting here and there these were at times covered with a thin film of ice it was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety we bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet then ascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet then doubled back to the ridge which descends toward zermatt a long stride round a rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more that last doubt vanished the matterhorn was ours nothing but two hundred feet of easy snow remained to be surmounted  the higher we rose the more intense became the excitement the slope eased off at length we could be detached and croz and i dashed away ran a neckandneck race which ended in a dead heat at 140 pm the world was at our feet and the matterhorn was conquered   the others arrived croz now took the tentpole and planted it in the highest snow yes we said there is the flagstaff but where is the flag here it is he answered pulling off his blouse and fixing it to the stick it made a poor flag and there was no wind to float it out yet it was seen all around they saw it at zermattat the riffelin the val tournanche   we remained on the summit for one hour  one crowded hour of glorious life  it passed away too quickly and we began to prepare for the descent  hudson and i consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the party we agreed that it was best for croz to go first and hadow second hudson who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot wished to be third lord douglas was placed next and old peter the strongest of the remainder after him i suggested to hudson that we should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit and hold it as we descended as an additional protection he approved the idea but it was not definitely decided that it should be done the party was being arranged in the above order while i was sketching the summit and they had finished and were waiting for me to be tied in line when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a bottle they requested me to write them down and moved off while it was being done  a few minutes afterward i tied myself to young peter ran down after the others and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the difficult part great care was being taken only one man was moving at a time when he was firmly planted the next advanced and so on they had not however attached the additional rope to rocks and nothing was said about it the suggestion was not made for my own sake and i am not sure that it ever occurred to me again for some little distance we two followed the others detached from them and should have continued so had not lord douglas asked me about 3 pm to tie on to old peter as he feared he said that taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground if a slip occurred  a few minutes later a sharpeyed lad ran into the monte rosa hotel at zermatt saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of the matterhorn onto the matterhorn glacier the boy was reproved for telling idle stories he was right nevertheless and this was what he saw  michel croz had laid aside his ax and in order to give mr hadow greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting his feet one by one into their proper positions as far as i know no one was actually descending i cannot speak with certainty because the two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening mass of rock but it is my belief from the movements of their shoulders that croz having done as i said was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself at this moment mr hadow slipped fell against him and knocked him over i heard one startled exclamation from croz then saw him and mr hadow flying downward in another moment hudson was dragged from his steps and lord douglas immediately after him all this was the work of a moment immediately we heard crozs exclamation old peter and i planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as on one man we held but the rope broke midway between taugwalder and lord francis douglas for a few seconds we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs and spreading out their hands endeavoring to save themselves they passed from our sight uninjured disappeared one by one and fell from the precipice to precipice onto the matterhorn glacier below a distance of nearly four thousand feet in height from the moment the rope broke it was impossible to help them so perished our comrades   for more than two hours afterward i thought almost every moment that the next would be my last for the taugwalders utterly unnerved were not only incapable of giving assistance but were in such a state that a slip might have been expected from them at any moment after a time we were able to do that which should have been done at first and fixed rope to firm rocks in addition to being tied together these ropes were cut from time to time and were left behind even with their assurance the men were afraid to proceed and several times old peter turned with ashy face and faltering limbs and said with terrible emphasis i cannot  about 6 pm we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward zermatt and all peril was over we frequently looked but in vain for traces of our unfortunate companions we bent over the ridge and cried to them but no sound returned convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor hearing we ceased from our useless efforts and too cast down for speech silently gathered up our things and the little effects of those who were lost and then completed the descent such is mr whympers graphic and thrilling narrative zermatt gossip darkly hints that the elder taugwalder cut the rope when the accident occurred in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the abyss but mr whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence of cutting but only of breaking he adds that if taugwalder had had the disposition to cut the rope he would not have had time to do it the accident was so sudden and unexpected  lord douglas body has never been found it probably lodged upon some inaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice lord douglas was a youth of nineteen the three other victims fell nearly four thousand feet and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by mr whymper and the other searchers the next morning their graves are beside the little church in zermatt     chapter xlii  chillon has a nice roomy dungeon   switzerland is simply a large humpy solid rock with a thin skin of grass stretched over it consequently they do not dig graves they blast them out with powder and fuse they cannot afford to have large graveyards the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable it is all required for the support of the living  the graveyard in zermatt occupies only about oneeighth of an acre the graves are sunk in the living rock and are very permanent but occupation of them is only temporary the occupant can only stay till his grave is needed by a later subject he is removed then for they do not bury one body on top of another as i understand it a family owns a grave just as it owns a house a man dies and leaves his house to his sonand at the same time this dead father succeeds to his own fathers grave he moves out of the house and into the grave and his predecessor moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel i saw a black box lying in the churchyard with skull and crossbones painted on it and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar  in that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former citizens were compactly corded up they made a pile eighteen feet long seven feet high and eight feet wide i was told that in some of the receptacles of this kind in the swiss villages the skulls were all marked and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for several generations back he could do it by these marks preserved in the family records   an english gentleman who had lived some years in this region said it was the cradle of compulsory education but he said that the english idea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance was an errorit has not that effect he said there was more seduction in the protestant than in the catholic cantons because the confessional protected the girls i wonder why it doesnt protect married women in france and spain  this gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the valais it was common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying and his brethrendoomed bachelorsheroically banded themselves together to help support the new family  we left zermatt in a wagonand in a rainstorm toofor st nicholas about ten oclock one morning again we passed between those grassclad prodigious cliffs specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high it did not seem possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spyglass and correspond with a rifle  in switzerland the farmers plow is a wide shovel which scrapes up and turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rockand there the man of the plow is a hero now here by our st nicholas road was a grave and it had a tragic story a plowman was skinning his farm one morningnot the steepest part of it but still a steep partthat is he was not skinning the front of his farm but the roof of it near the eaveswhen he absentmindedly let go of the plowhandles to moisten his hands in the usual way he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward poor fellow he never touched anything till he struck bottom fifteen hundred feet below this was on a sundaymt we throw a halo of heroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor because of the deadly dangers they are facing all the time but we are not used to looking upon farming as a heroic occupation this is because we have not lived in switzerland   from st nicholas we struck out for vispor vispachon foot the rainstorms had been at work during several days and had done a deal of damage in switzerland and savoy we came to one place where a stream had changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place sweeping everything before it two poor but precious farms by the roadside were ruined one was washed clear away and the bedrock exposed the other was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks gravel mud and rubbish the resistless might of water was well exemplified some saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground stripped clean of their bark and buried under rocky debris the road had been swept away too  in another place where the road was high up on the mountains face and its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry we frequently came across spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for mules to get over and with still more frequency we found the masonry slightly crumbled and marked by mulehoofs thus showing that there had been danger of an accident to somebody when at last we came to a badly ruptured bit of masonry with hoofprints evidencing a desperate struggle to regain the lost foothold i looked quite hopefully over the dizzy precipice but there was nobody down there  they take exceedingly good care of their rivers in switzerland and other portions of europe they wall up both banks with slanting solid stone masonryso that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the wharves at st louis and other towns on the mississippi river  it was during this walk from st nicholas in the shadow of the majestic alps that we came across some little children amusing themselves in what seemed at first a most odd and original waybut it wasnt it was in simply a natural and characteristic way they were roped together with a string they had mimic alpenstocks and iceaxes and were climbing a meek and lowly manurepile with a most bloodcurdling amount of care and caution the guide at the head of the line cut imaginary steps in a laborious and painstaking way and not a monkey budged till the step above was vacated if we had waited we should have witnessed an imaginary accident no doubt and we should have heard the intrepid band hurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the magnificent view and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation   in nevada i used to see the children play at silvermining of course the great thing was an accident in a mine and there were two star parts that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft and that of the daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up i knew one small chap who always insisted on playing both of these partsand he carried his point he would tumble into the shaft and die and then come to the surface and go back after his own remains  it is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere he is head guide in switzerland head miner in nevada head bullfighter in spain etc but i knew a preachers son seven years old who once selected a part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame and unimpressive jimmys father stopped him from driving imaginary horsecars one sundaystopped him from playing captain of an imaginary steamboat next sundaystopped him from leading an imaginary army to battle the following sundayand so on finally the little fellow said  ive tried everything and they wont any of them do what can i play  i hardly know jimmy but you must play only things that are suitable to the sabbathday  next sunday the preacher stepped softly to a backroom door to see if the children were rightly employed he peeped in a chair occupied the middle of the room and on the back of it hung jimmys cap one of his little sisters took the cap down nibbled at it then passed it to another small sister and said eat of this fruit for it is good the reverend took in the situationalas they were playing the expulsion from eden yet he found one little crumb of comfort he said to himself for once jimmy has yielded the chief rolei have been wronging him i did not believe there was so much modesty in him i should have expected him to be either adam or eve this crumb of comfort lasted but a very little while he glanced around and discovered jimmy standing in an imposing attitude in a corner with a dark and deadly frown on his face what that meant was very plainhe was impersonating the deity think of the guileless sublimity of that idea   we reached vispach at 8 pm only about seven hours out from st nicholas so we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour and it was all downhill too and very muddy at that we stayed all night at the hotel de soleil i remember it because the landlady the portier the waitress and the chambermaid were not separate persons but were all contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin and she was the prettiest young creature i saw in all that region she was the landlords daughter and i remember that the only native match to her i saw in all europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village inn in the black forest why dont more people in europe marry and keep hotel   next morning we left with a family of english friends and went by train to brevet and thence by boat across the lake to ouchy lausanne  ouchy is memorable to me not on account of its beautiful situation and lovely surroundingsalthough these would make it stick long in ones memorybut as the place where i caught the london times dropping into humor it was not aware of it though it did not do it on purpose an english friend called my attention to this lapse and cut out the reprehensible paragraph for me think of encountering a grin like this on the face of that grim journal  erratumwe are requested by reuters telegram company to correct an erroneous announcement made in their brisbane telegram of the 2d inst published in our impression of the 5th inst stating that lady kennedy had given birth to twins the eldest being a son the company explain that the message they received contained the words governor of queensland twins first son being however subsequently informed that sir arthur kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake a telegraphic repetition was at once demanded it has been received today 11th inst and shows that the words really telegraphed by reuters agent were governor queensland turns first sod alluding to the maryboroughgympic railway in course of construction the words in italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from australia and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the mistake  i had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of the prisoner of chillon whose story byron had told in such moving verse so i took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the castle of chillon to see the place where poor bonnivard endured his dreary captivity three hundred years ago i am glad i did that for it took away some of the pain i was feeling on the prisoners account his dungeon was a nice cool roomy place and i cannot see why he should have been dissatisfied with it if he had been imprisoned in a st nicholas private dwelling where the fertilizer prevails and the goat sleeps with the guest and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes in and bothers him when he wants to muse it would have been another matter altogether but he surely could not have had a very cheerless time of it in that pretty dungeon it has romantic windowslits that let in generous bars of light and it has tall noble columns carved apparently from the living rock and what is more they are written all over with thousands of names some of themlike byrons and victor hugosof the first celebrity why didnt he amuse himself reading these names then there are the couriers and touristsswarms of them every daywhat was to hinder him from having a good time with them i think bonnivards sufferings have been overrated   next we took the train and went to martigny on the way to mont blanc next morning we started about eight oclock on foot we had plenty of company in the way of wagonloads and muleloads of touristsand dust this scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long the road was uphillinterminable uphilland tolerably steep the weather was blisteringly hot and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping mule or in a crawling wagon and broil in the beating sun was an object to be pitied we could dodge among the bushes and have the relief of shade but those people could not they paid for a conveyance and to get their moneys worth they rode  we went by the way of the tête noir and after we reached high ground there was no lack of fine scenery in one place the road was tunneled through a shoulder of the mountain from there one looked down into a gorge with a rushing torrent in it and on every hand was a charming view of rocky buttresses and wooded heights there was a liberal allowance of pretty waterfalls too on the tête noir route   about half an hour before we reached the village of argentière a vast dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed itself in a strong vshaped gateway of the mountains and we recognized mont blanc the monarch of the alps with every step after that this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky and at last seemed to occupy the zenith  some of mont blancs neighborsbare lightbrown steeplelike rockswere very peculiarly shaped some were whittled to a sharp point and slightly bent at the upper end like a ladys finger one monster sugarloaf resembled a bishops hat it was too steep to hold snow on its sides but had some in the division   while we were still on very high ground and before the descent toward argentière began we looked up toward a neighboring mountaintop and saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs the faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful none of the colors were deep they were the lightest shades they were bewitching commingled we sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle the tints remained during several minutesflitting changing melting into each other paling almost away for a moment then reflushinga shifting restless unstable succession of soft opaline gleams shimmering over that air film of white cloud and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to clothe an angel with  by and by we perceived what those superdelicate colors and their continuous play and movement reminded us of it is what one sees in a soapbubble that is drifting along catching changes of tint from the objects it passes a soapbubble is the most beautiful thing and the most exquisite in nature that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was suggestive of a soapbubble split open and spread out in the sun i wonder how much it would take to buy a soapbubble if there was only one in the world one could buy a hatful of kohinoors with the same money no doubt   we made the tramp from martigny to argentière in eight hours we beat all the mules and wagons we didnt usually do that we hired a sort of open baggagewagon for the trip down the valley to chamonix and then devoted an hour to dining this gave the driver time to get drunk he had a friend with him and this friend also had had time to get drunk  when we drove off the driver said all the tourists had arrived and gone by while we were at dinner but said he impressively be not disturbed by thatremain tranquilgive yourselves no uneasinesstheir dust rises far before usrest you tranquil leave all to mei am the king of drivers behold  down came his whip and away we clattered i never had such a shaking up in my life the recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in places but we never stopped we never slowed down for anything we tore right along over rocks rubbish gullies open fieldssometimes with one or two wheels on the ground but generally with none every now and then that calm goodnatured madman would bend a majestic look over his shoulder at us and say ah you perceive it is as i have saidi am the king of drivers every time we just missed going to destruction he would say with tranquil happiness enjoy it gentlemen it is very rare it is very unusualit is given to few to ride with the king of driversand observe it is as i have said i am he   he spoke in french and punctuated with hiccoughs his friend was french too but spoke in germanusing the same system of punctuation however the friend called himself the captain of mont blanc and wanted us to make the ascent with him he said he had made more ascents than any other manforty sevenand his brother had made thirtyseven his brother was the best guide in the world except himselfbut he yes observe him wellhe was the captain of mont blancthat title belonged to none other  the king was as good as his wordhe overtook that long procession of tourists and went by it like a hurricane the result was that we got choicer rooms at the hotel in chamonix than we

friend disappointed   everybody was outofdoors everybody was in the principal street of the villagenot on the sidewalks but all over the street everybody was lounging loafing chatting waiting alert expectant interestedfor it was traintime that is to say it was diligencetimethe halfdozen big diligences would soon be arriving from geneva and the village was interested in many ways in knowing how many people were coming and what sort of folk they might be it was altogether the livestlooking street we had seen in any village on the continent  the hotel was by the side of a booming torrent whose music was loud and strong we could not see this torrent for it was dark now but one could locate it without a light there was a large enclosed yard in front of the hotel and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting to see the diligences arrive or to hire themselves to excursionists for the morrow a telescope stood in the yard with its huge barrel canted up toward the lustrous evening star the long porch of the hotel was populous with tourists who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast overshadowing bulk of mont blanc and gossiped or meditated   never did a mountain seem so close its big sides seemed at ones very elbow and its majestic dome and the lofty cluster of slender minarets that were its neighbors seemed to be almost over ones head it was night in the streets and the lamps were sparkling everywhere the broad bases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom but their summits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight and yet had a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard white glare of the kind of daylight i was used to its radiance was strong and clear but at the same time it was singularly soft and spiritual and benignant no it was not our harsh aggressive realistic daylight it seemed properer to an enchanted landor to heaven  i had seen moonlight and daylight together before but i had not seen daylight and black night elbow to elbow before at least i had not seen the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand before to make the contrast startling and at war with nature  the daylight passed away presently the moon rose up behind some of those skypiercing fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which i have spokenthey were a little to the left of the crest of mont blanc and right over our headsbut she couldnt manage to climb high enough toward heaven to get entirely above them she would show the glittering arch of her upper third occasionally and scrape it along behind the comblike row sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up like a statuette of ebony against that glittering white shield then seemed to glide out of it by its own volition and power and become a dim specter while the next pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with the black exclamationpoint of its presence the top of one pinnacle took the shapely cleancut form of a rabbits head in the inkiest silhouette while it rested against the moon the unillumined peaks and minarets hovering vague and phantomlike above us while the others were painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight made a peculiar effect  but when the moon having passed the line of pinnacles was hidden behind the stupendous white swell of mont blanc the masterpiece of the evening was flung on the canvas a rich greenish radiance sprang into the sky from behind the mountain and in this some airy shreds and ribbons of vapor floated about and being flushed with that strange tint went waving to and fro like pale green flames after a while radiating barsvast broadening fanshaped shadowsgrew up and stretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain it was a spectacle to take ones breath for the wonder of it and the sublimity  indeed those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up from behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the dull and opaque heavens was the most imposing and impressive marvel i had ever looked upon there is no simile for it for nothing is like it if a child had asked me what it was i should have said humble yourself in this presence it is the glory flowing from the hidden head of the creator one falls shorter of the truth than that sometimes in trying to explain mysteries to the little people i could have found out the cause of this awecompelling miracle by inquiring for it is not infrequent at mont blancbut i did not wish to know we have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has because we know how it is made we have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter  we took a walk down street a block or two and a place where four streets met and the principal shops were clustered found the groups of men in the roadway thicker than everfor this was the exchange of chamonix these men were in the costumes of guides and porters and were there to be hired  the office of that great personage the guideinchief of the chamonix guild of guides was near by this guild is a close corporation and is governed by strict laws there are many excursion routes some dangerous and some not some that can be made safely without a guide and some that cannot the bureau determines these things where it decides that a guide is necessary you are forbidden to go without one neither are you allowed to be a victim of extortion the law states what you are to pay the guides serve in rotation you cannot select the man who is to take your life into his hands you must take the worst in the lot if it is his turn a guides fee ranges all the way up from a halfdollar for some trifling excursion of a few rods to twenty dollars according to the distance traversed and the nature of the ground a guides fee for taking a person to the summit of mont blanc and back is twenty dollarsand he earns it the time employed is usually three days and there is enough early rising in it to make a man far more healthy and wealthy and wise than any one man has any right to be the porters fee for the same trip is ten dollars several foolsno i mean several touristsusually go together and divide up the expense and thus make it light for if only one ftourist i meanwent he would have to have several guides and porters and that would make the matter costly  we went into the chiefs office there were maps of mountains on the walls also one or two lithographs of celebrated guides and a portrait of the scientist de saussure  in glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and batons and other suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on mount blanc in a book was a record of all the ascents which have ever been made beginning with nos 1 and 2being those of jacques balmat and de saussure in 1787 and ending with no 685 which wasnt cold yet in fact no 685 was standing by the official table waiting to receive the precious official diploma which should prove to his german household and to his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to the top of mont blanc he looked very happy when he got his document in fact he spoke up and said he was happy   i tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled and whose desire all his life has been to ascend mont blanc but the guideinchief rather insolently refused to sell me one i was very much offended i said i did not propose to be discriminated against on the account of my nationality that he had just sold a diploma to this german gentleman and my money was a good as his i would see to it that he couldnt keep his shop for germans and deny his produce to americans i would have his license taken away from him at the dropping of a handkerchief if france refused to break him i would make an international matter of it and bring on a war the soil should be drenched with blood and not only that but i would set up an opposition show and sell diplomas at half price   for two cents i would have done these things too but nobody offered me two cents i tried to move that germans feelings but it could not be done he would not give me his diploma neither would he sell it to me i told him my friend was sick and could not come himself but he said he did not care a verdammtes pfennig he wanted his diploma for himselfdid i suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger indeed he wouldnt so he wouldnt i resolved then that i would do all i could to injure mont blanc  in the recordbook was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain it began with the one in 1820 when the russian dr hamels three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier and it recorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slowmoving glacier fortyone years later the latest catastrophe bore the date 1877  we stepped out and roved about the village awhile in front of the little church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide jacques balmat the first man who ever stood upon the summit of mont blanc he made that wild trip solitary and alone he accomplished the ascent a number of times afterward a stretch of nearly half a century lay between his first ascent and his last one at the ripe old age of seventytwo he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the pic du midinobody with himwhen he slipped and fell so he died in the harness  he had grown very avaricious in his old age and used to go off stealthily to hunt for nonexistent and impossible gold among those perilous peaks and precipices he was on a quest of that kind when he lost his life there was a statue to him and another to de saussure in the hall of our hotel and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs bore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied by albert smith balmat and de saussure discovered mont blancso to speakbut it was smith who made it a paying property his articles in blackwood and his lectures on mont blanc in london advertised it and made people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money  as we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red signallight glowing in the darkness of the mountainside it seemed but a trifling way upperhaps a hundred yards a climb of ten minutes it was a lucky piece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and get a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to that lantern to get a light as had been our purpose the man said that that lantern was on the grands mulets some sixtyfive hundred feet above the valley i know by our riffelberg experience that it would have taken us a good part of a week to go up there i would sooner not smoke at all than take all that trouble for a light  even in the daytime the foreshadowing effect of this mountains close proximity creates curious deceptions for instance one sees with the naked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier and a little above and beyond he sees the spot where that red light was located he thinks he could throw a stone from the one place to the other but he couldnt for the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand feet it looks impossible from below that this can be true but it is true nevertheless  while strolling around we kept the run of the moon all the time and we still kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico i had a theory that the gravitation of refraction being subsidiary to atmospheric compensation the refrangibility of the earths surface would emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges occur and possibly so evenhanded impact the odic and idyllic forces together the one upon the other as to prevent the moon from rising higher than 12200 feet above sealevel this daring theory had been received with frantic scorn by some of my fellowscientists and with an eager silence by others among the former i may mention prof hy and among the latter prof tl such is professional jealousy a scientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not start himself there is no feeling of brotherhood among these people indeed they always resent it when i call them brother to show how far their ungenerosity can carry them i will state that i offered to let prof hy publish my great theory as his own discovery i even begged him to do it i even proposed to print it myself as his theory instead of thanking me he said that if i tried to fasten that theory on him he would sue me for slander i was going to offer it to mr darwin whom i understood to be a man without prejudices but it occurred to me that perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern heraldry  but i am glad now that i was forced to father my intrepid theory myself for on the night of which i am writing it was triumphantly justified and established mont blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet high he hid the moon utterly near him is a peak which is 12216 feet high the moon slid along behind the pinnacles and when she approached that one i watched her with intense interest for my reputation as a scientist must stand or fall by its decision i cannot describe the emotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when i saw the moon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more than two feet four inches of her upper rim above it i was secure then i knew she could rise no higher and i was right she sailed behind all the peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of them  while the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers its shadow was flung athwart the vacant heavensa long slanting cleancut dark raywith a streaming and energetic suggestion of force about it such as the ascending jet of water from a powerful fireengine affords it was curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon so intangible a field as the atmosphere  we went to bed at last and went quickly to sleep but i woke up after about three hours with throbbing temples and a head which was physically sore outside and in i was dazed dreamy wretched seedy unrefreshed i recognized the occasion of all this it was that torrent in the mountain villages of switzerland and along the roads one has always the roar of the torrent in his ears he imagines it is music and he thinks poetic things about it he lies in his comfortable bed and is lulled to sleep by it but by and by he begins to notice that his head is very sorehe cannot account for it in solitudes where the profoundest silence reigns he notices a sullen distant continuous roar in his ears which is like what he would experience if he had seashells pressed against themhe cannot account for it he is drowsy and absentminded there is no tenacity to his mind he cannot keep hold of a thought and follow it out if he sits down to write his vocabulary is empty no suitable words will come he forgets what he started to do and remains there pen in hand head tilted up eyes closed listening painfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears in his soundest sleep the strain continues he goes on listening always listening intently anxiously and wakes at last harassed irritable unrefreshed he cannot manage to account for these things   day after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleepingcar it actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting torrents that have been making all the mischief it is time for him to get out of switzerland then for as soon as he has discovered the cause the misery is magnified several fold the roar of the torrent is maddening then for his imagination is assisting the physical pain it inflicts is exquisite when he finds he is approaching one of those streams his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and avoid the implacable foe   eight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed from me the roar and thunder of the streets of paris brought it all back again i moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace about midnight the noises dulled away and i was sinking to sleep when i heard a new and curious sound i listened evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a double shuffle in the room over my head i had to wait for him to get through of course five long long minutes he smoothly shuffled awaya pause followed then something fell with a thump on the floor i said to myself therehe is pulling off his bootsthank heavens he is done another slight pausehe went to shuffling again i said to myself is he trying to see what he can do with only one boot on presently came another pause and another thump on the floor i said good he has pulled off his other bootnow he is done but he wasnt the next moment he was shuffling again i said confound him he is at it in his slippers after a little came that same old pause and right after it that thump on the floor once more i said hang him he had on two pair of boots for an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twentyfive pair and i was hovering on the verge of lunacy i got my gun and stole up there the fellow was in the midst of an acre of sprawling boots and he had a boot in his hand shuffling itno i mean polishing it the mystery was explained he hadnt been dancing he was the boots of the hotel and was attending to business     chapter xlix  i scale mont blancby telescope   after breakfast that next morning in chamonix we went out in the yard and watched the gangs of excursioning tourists arriving and departing with their mules and guides and porters then we took a look through the telescope at the snowy hump of mont blanc it was brilliant with sunshine and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards away with the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the pierre pointue which is located by the side of the great glacier and is more than three thousand feet above the level of the valley but with the telescope we could see all its details while i looked a woman rode by the house on a mule and i saw her with sharp distinctness i could have described her dress i saw her nod to the people of the house and rein up her mule and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun i was not used to telescopes in fact i had never looked through a good one before it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away i was satisfied that i could see all these details with my naked eye but when i tried it that mule and those vivid people had wholly vanished and the house itself was become small and vague i tried the telescope again and again everything was vivid the strong black shadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the house and i saw the mules silhouette wave its ears  the telescopulistor the telescopulariati do not know which is rightsaid a party were making a grand ascent and would come in sight on the remote upper heights presently so we waited to observe this performance presently i had a superb idea i wanted to stand with a party on the summit of mont blanc merely to be able to say i had done it and i believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the uppermost man the telescoper assured me that it could i then asked him how much i owed him for as far as i had got he said one franc i asked him how much it would cost to make the entire ascent three francs i at once determined to make the entire ascent but first i inquired if there was any danger he said nonot by telescope said he had taken a great many parties to the summit and never lost a man i asked what he would charge to let my agent go with me together with such guides and porters as might be necessary he said he would let harris go for two francs and that unless we were unusually timid he should consider guides and porters unnecessary it was not customary to take them when going by telescope for they were rather an encumbrance than a help he said that the party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part and if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes and could then join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without their knowledge and without expense to us   i then said we would start immediately i believe i said it calmly though i was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek in view of the nature of the exploit i was so unreflectingly engaged in but the old daredevil spirit was upon me and i said that as i had committed myself i would not back down i would ascend mont blanc if it cost me my life i told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and let us be off  harris was afraid and did not want to go but i heartened him up and said i would hold his hand all the way so he gave his consent though he trembled a little at first i took a last pathetic look upon the pleasant summer scene about me then boldly put my eye to the glass and prepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows  we took our way carefully and cautiously across the great glacier des bossons over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags and buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic proportions the desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was wild and desolate beyond description and the perils which beset us were so great that at times i was minded to turn back but i pulled my pluck together and pushed on  we passed the glacier safely and began to mount the steeps beyond with great alacrity when we were seven minutes out from the startingpoint we reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect an apparently limitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our faces as my eye followed that awful acclivity far away up into the remote skies it seemed to me that all i had ever seen before of sublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this   we rested a moment and then began to mount with speed within three minutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us and stopped to observe them they were toiling up a long slanting ridge of snowtwelve persons roped together some fifteen feet apart marching in single file and strongly marked against the clear blue sky one was a woman we could see them lift their feet and put them down we saw them swing their alpenstocks forward in unison like so many pendulums and then bear their weight upon them we saw the lady wave her handkerchief they dragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way for they had been climbing steadily from the grand mulets on the glacier des bossons since three in the morning and it was eleven now we saw them sink down in the snow and rest and drink something from a bottle after a while they moved on and as they approached the final short dash of the homestretch we closed up on them and joined them  presently we all stood together on the summit what a view was spread out below away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent billows of the farnese oberland their snowy crests glinting softly in the subdued lights of distance in the north rose the giant form of the wobblehorn draped from peak to shoulder in sable thunderclouds beyond him to the right stretched the grand processional summits of the cisalpine cordillera drowned in a sensuous haze to the east loomed the colossal masses of the yodelhorn the fuddelhorn and the dinnerhorn their cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun beyond them shimmered the faint far line of the ghauts of jubbelpore and the aiguilles des alleghenies in the south towered the smoking peak of popocatapetl and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless scrabblehorn in the westsouth the stately range of the himalayas lay dreaming in a purple gloom and thence all around the curving horizon the eye roved over a troubled sea of sunkissed alps and noted here and there the noble proportions and the soaring domes of the bottlehorn and the saddlehorn and the shovelhorn and the powderhorn all bathed in the glory of noon and mottled with softly gliding blots the shadows flung from drifting clouds  overcome by the scene we all raised a triumphant tremendous shout in unison a startled man at my elbow said  confound you what do you yell like that for right here in the street   that brought me down to chamonix like a flirt i gave that man some spiritual advice and disposed of him and then paid the telescope man his full fee and said that we were charmed with the trip and would remain down and not reascend and require him to fetch us down by telescope this pleased him very much for of course we could have stepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us home if we wanted to  i judged we could get diplomas now anyhow so we went after them but the chief guide put us off with one pretext or another during all the time we stayed in chamonix and we ended by never getting them at all so much for his prejudice against peoples nationality however we worried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some time he even said once that he wished there was a lunatic asylum in chamonix this shows that he really had fears that we were going to drive him mad it was what we intended to do but lack of time defeated it  i cannot venture to advise the reader one way or the other as to ascending mont blanc i say only this if he is at all timid the enjoyments of the trip will hardly make up for the hardships and sufferings he will have to endure but if he has good nerve youth health and a bold firm will and could leave his family comfortably provided for in case the worst happened he would find the ascent a wonderful experience and the view from the top a vision to dream about and tell about and recall with exultation all the days of his life  while i do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent i do not advise him against it but if he elects to attempt it let him be warily careful of two things chose a calm clear day and do not pay the telescope man in advance there are dark stories of his getting advance payers on the summit and then leaving them there to rot  a frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the chamonix telescopes think of questions and answers like these on an inquest  coroner you saw deceased lose his life  witness i did  c where was he at the time  w close to the summit of mont blanc  c where were you  w in the main street of chamonix  c what was the distance between you  w a little over five miles as the bird flies  this accident occurred in 1866 a year and a month after the disaster on the matterhorn three adventurous english gentlemen 1 of great experience in mountainclimbing made up their minds to ascend mont blanc without guides or porters all endeavors to dissuade them from their project failed powerful telescopes are numerous in chamonix these huge brass tubes mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed skyward from every choice vantageground have the formidable look of artillery and give the town the general aspect of getting ready to repel a charge of angels the reader may easily believe that the telescopes had plenty of custom on that august morning in 1866 for everybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot and all had fears that misfortune would result all the morning the tubes remained directed toward the mountain heights each with its anxious group around it but the white deserts were vacant  1 sir george young and his brothers james and albert  at last toward eleven oclock the people who were looking through the telescopes cried out there they areand sure enough far up on the loftiest terraces of the grand plateau the three pygmies appeared climbing with remarkable vigor and spirit they disappeared in the corridor and were lost to sight during an hour then they reappeared and were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit of mont blanc so all was well they remained a few minutes on that highest point of land in europe a target for all the telescopes and were then seen to begin descent suddenly all three vanished an instant after they appeared again two thousand feet below  evidently they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular slope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier naturally the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three corpses so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw two of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third during two hours and a half they watched the two busying themselves over the extended form of their brother who seemed entirely inert chamonixs affairs stood still everybody was in the street all interest was centered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage five miles away finally the twoone of them walking with great difficultywere seen to begin descent abandoning the third who was no doubt lifeless their movements were followed step by step until they reached the corridor and disappeared behind its ridge before they had had time to traverse the corridor and reappear twilight was come and the power of the telescope was at an end  the survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering darkness for they must get down to the grands mulets before they would find a safe stoppingplacea long and tedious descent and perilous enough even in good daylight the oldest guides expressed the opinion that they could not succeed that all the chances were that they would lose their lives   yet those brave men did succeed they reached the grands mulets in safety even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not sufficient to overcome their coolness and courage it would appear from the official account that they were threading their way down through those dangers from the closing in of twilight until two oclock in the morning or later because the rescuing party from chamonix reached the grand mulets about three in the morning and moved thence toward the scene of the disaster under the leadership of sir george young who had only just arrived  after having been on his feet twentyfour hours in the exhausting work of mountainclimbing sir george began the reascent at the head of the relief party of six guides to recover the corpse of his brother this was considered a new imprudence as the number was too few for the service required another relief party presently arrived at the cabin on the grands mulets and quartered themselves there to await events ten hours after sir georges departure toward the summit this new relief were still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high perch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the sea but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living thing appearing up there  this was alarming half a dozen of their number set out then early in the afternoon to seek and succor sir george and his guides the persons remaining at the cabin saw these disappear and then ensued another distressing wait four hours passed without tidings then at five oclock another relief consisting of three guides set forward from the cabin they carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their predecessors they took lanterns with them too night was coming on and to make matters worse a fine cold rain had begun to fall  at the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent the official guideinchief of the mont blanc region undertook the dangerous descent to chamonix all alone to get reinforcements however a couple of hours later at 7 pm the anxious solicitude came to an end and happily a bugle note was heard and a cluster of black specks was distinguishable against the snows of the upper heights the watchers counted these specks eagerlyfourteennobody was missing an hour and a half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin they had brought the corpse with them sir george young tarried there but a few minutes and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin to chamonix he probably reached there about two or three oclock in the morning after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two days and two nights his endurance was equal to his daring   the cause of the unaccountable delay of sir george and the relief parties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick fogor partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying the dead body down the perilous steeps  the corpse upon being viewed at the inquest showed no bruises and it was some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken one of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries but the other had suffered no hurt at all how these men could fall two thousand feet almost perpendicularly and live afterward is a most strange and unaccountable thing  a great many women have made the ascent of mont blanc an english girl miss stratton conceived the daring idea two or three years ago of attempting the ascent in the middle of winter she tried itand she succeeded moreover she froze two of her fingers on the way up she fell in love with her guide on the summit and she married him when she got to the bottom again there is nothing in romance in the way of a striking situation which can beat this love scene in midheaven on an isolated icecrest with the thermometer at zero and an artic gale blowing   the first woman who ascended mont blanc was a girl aged twentytwomlle maria paradis1809 nobody was with her but her sweetheart and he was not a guide the sex then took a rest for about thirty years when a mlle dangeville made the ascent 1838 in chamonix i picked up a rude old lithograph of that day which pictured her in the act  however i value it less as a work of art than as a fashionplate miss dangeville put on a pair of mens pantaloons to climb it which was wise but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat which was idiotic  one of the mournfulest calamities which mens disposition to climb dangerous mountains has resulted in happened on mont blanc in september 1870 m darve tells the story briefly in his histoire du mont blanc in the next chapter i will copy its chief features     chapter xlv  a catastrophe which cost eleven lives   on the 5th of september 1870 a caravan of eleven persons departed from chamonix to make the ascent of mont blanc three of the party were tourists messrs randall and bean americans and mr george corkindale a scotch gentleman there were three guides and five porters the cabin on the grands mulets was reached that day the ascent was resumed early the next morning september 6th the day was fine and clear and the movements of the party were observed through the telescopes of chamonix at two oclock in the afternoon they were seen to reach the summit a few minutes later they were seen making the first steps of the descent then a cloud closed around them and hid them from view  eight hours passed the cloud still remained night came no one had returned to the grands mulets sylvain couttet keeper of the cabin there suspected a misfortune and sent down to the valley for help a detachment of guides went up but by the time they had made the tedious trip and reached the cabin a raging storm had set in they had to wait nothing could be attempted in such a tempest  the wild storm lasted more than a week without ceasing but on the 17th couttet with several guides left the cabin and succeeded in making the ascent in the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon five bodies lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there while exhausted with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold and never knew when death stole upon them couttet moved a few steps further and discovered five more bodies the eleventh corpsethat of a porterwas not found although diligent search was made for it  in the pocket of mr bean one of the americans was found a notebook in which had been penciled some sentences which admit us in flesh and spirit as it were to the presence of these men during their last hours of life and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon and their failing consciousness took cognizance of  tuesday sept 6 i have made the ascent of mont blanc with ten personseight guides and mr corkindale and mr randall we reached the summit at half past 2 immediately after quitting it we were enveloped in clouds of snow we passed the night in a grotto hollowed in the snow which afforded us but poor shelter and i was ill all night  sept 7morning the cold is excessive the snow falls heavily and without interruption the guides take no rest  evening my dear hessie we have been two days on mont blanc in the midst of a terrible hurricane of snow we have lost our way and are in a hole scooped in the snow at an altitude of 15000 feet i have no longer any hope of descending  they had wandered around and around in the blinding snowstorm hopelessly lost in a space only a hundred yards square and when cold and fatigue vanquished them at last they scooped their cave and lay down there to die by inches unaware that five steps more would have brought them into the truth path they were so near to life and safety as that and did not suspect it the thought of this gives the sharpest pang that the tragic story conveys  the author of the histoire du mont blanc introduced the closing sentences of mr beans pathetic record thus  here the characters are large and unsteady the hand which traces them is become chilled and torpid but the spirit survives and the faith and resignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity  perhaps this notebook will be found and sent to you we have nothing to eat my feet are already frozen and i am exhausted i have strength to write only a few words more i have left means for cs education i know you will employ them wisely i die with faith in god and with loving thoughts of you farewell to all we shall meet again in heaven  i think of you always  it is the way of the alps to deliver death to their victims with a merciful swiftness but here the rule failed these men suffered the bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those mountains freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies     chapter xlvi  meeting a hog on a precipice   mr harris and i took some guides and porters and ascended to the hotel des pyramides which is perched on the high moraine which borders the glacier des bossons the road led sharply uphill all the way through grass and flowers and woods and was a pleasant walk barring the fatigue of the climb  from the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range after a rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner frontage of the moraine and stepped upon the glacier itself one of the shows of the place was a tunnellike cavern which had been hewn in the glacier the proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us into it it was three or four feet wide and about six feet high its walls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and rich blue light that produced a lovely effect and suggested enchanted caves and that sort of thing when we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness we turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and heights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the tender blue radiance of the tunnels atmosphere  the cavern was nearly a hundred yards long and when we reached its inner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles and left us buried in the bowels of the glacier and in pitchdarkness we judged his purpose was murder and robbery so we got out our matches and prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the glacier on fire if the worst came to the worstbut we soon perceived that this man had changed his mind he began to sing in a deep melodious voice and woke some curious and pleasing echoes by and by he came back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for we believed as much of that as we wanted to  thus our lives had been once more in imminent peril but by the exercise of the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often we had added another escape to the long list the tourist should visit that icecavern by all means for it is well worth the trouble but i would advise him to go only with a strong and wellarmed force i do not consider artillery necessary yet it would not be unadvisable to take it along if convenient the journey going and coming is about three miles and a half three of which are on level ground we made it in less than a day but i would counsel the unpracticedif not pressed for timeto allow themselves two nothing is gained in the alps by overexertion nothing is gained by crowding two days work into one for the poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward it will be found much better in the long run to do the thing in two days and then subtract one of them from the narrative this saves fatigue and does not injure the narrative all the more thoughtful among the alpine tourists do this   we now called upon the guideinchief and asked for a squadron of guides and porters for the ascent of the montanvert this idiot glared at us and said  you dont need guides and porters to go to the montanvert  what do we need then  such as youan ambulance  i was so stung by this brutal remark that i took my custom elsewhere  betimes next morning we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the sea here we camped and breakfasted there was a cabin therethe spot is called the cailletand a spring of icecold water on the door of the cabin was a sign in french to the effect that one may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes we did not invest what we wanted was to see a dead one  a little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on the montanvert and had a view of six miles right up the great glacier the famous mer de glace at this point it is like a sea whose deep swales and long rolling swells have been caught in midmovement and frozen solid but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows of ice   we descended a ticklish path in the steep side of the moraine and invaded the glacier there were tourists of both sexes scattered far and wide over it everywhere and it had the festive look of a skatingrink  the empress josephine came this far once she ascended the montanvert in 1810but not alone a small army of men preceded her to clear the pathand carpet it perhapsand she followed under the protection of sixtyeight guides  her successor visited chamonix later but in far different style  it was seven weeks after the first fall of the empire and poor marie louise exempress was a fugitive she came at night and in a storm with only two attendants and stood before a peasants hut tired bedraggled soaked with rain the red print of her lost crown still girdling her brow and implored admittanceand was refused a few days before the adulations and applauses of a nation were sounding in her ears and now she was come to this  we crossed the mer de glace in safety but we had misgivings the crevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious and it made one nervous to traverse them the huge round waves of ice were slippery and difficult to climb and the chances of tripping and sliding down them and darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable  in the bottom of a deep swale between two of the biggest of the icewaves we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure the safety of tourists he was soldiering when we came upon him but he hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a cat and charged us a franc or two for it then he sat down again to doze till the next party should come along   he had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already that day but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier perceptibly i have heard of a good many soft sinecures but it seems to me that keeping tollbridge on a glacier is the softest one i have encountered yet  that was a blazing hot day and it brought a persistent and persecuting thirst with it what an unspeakable luxury it was to slake that thirst with the pure and limpid icewater of the glacier down the sides of every great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by their own attrition better still wherever a rock had lain there was now a bowlshaped hole with smooth white sides and bottom of ice and this bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the careless observer would not see it at all but would think the bowl was empty these fountains had such an alluring look that i often stretched myself out when i was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till my teeth ached everywhere among the swiss mountains we had at hand the blessingnot to be found in europe except in the mountainsof water capable of quenching thirst everywhere in the swiss highlands brilliant little rills of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the roadsides and my comrade and i were always drinking and always delivering our deep gratitude  but in europe everywhere except in the mountains the water is flat and insipid beyond the power of words to describe it is served lukewarm but no matter ice could not help it it is incurably flat incurably insipid it is only good to wash with i wonder it doesnt occur to the average inhabitant to try it for that in europe the people say contemptuously nobody drinks water here indeed they have a sound and sufficient reason in many places they even have what may be called prohibitory reasons in paris and munich for instance they say dont drink the water it is simply poison  either america is healthier than europe notwithstanding her deadly indulgence in icewater or she does not keep the run of her deathrate as sharply as europe does i think we do keep up the death statistics accurately and if we do our cities are healthier than the cities of europe every month the german government tabulates the deathrate of the world and publishes it i scrapbooked these reports during several months and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same deathrate month after month the tables might as well have been stereotyped they varied so little these tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1000 population for a year munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1000 of her population yearly average chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17 dublin with her 48and so on  only a few american cities appear in these tables but they are scattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general average of city health in the united states and i think it will be granted that our towns and villages are healthier than our cities  here is the average of the only american cities reported in the german tables  chicago deaths in 1000 population annually 16 philadelphia 18 st louis 18 san francisco 19 new york the dublin of america 23  see how the figures jump up as soon as one arrives at the transatlantic list  paris 27 glasgow 27 london 28 vienna 28 augsburg 28 braunschweig 28 königsberg 29 cologne 29 dresden 29 hamburg 29 berlin 30 bombay 30 warsaw 31 breslau 31 odessa 32 munich 33 strasburg 33 pesth 35 cassel 35 lisbon 36 liverpool 36 prague 37 madras 37 bucharest 39 st petersburg 40 trieste 40 alexandria egypt 43 dublin 48 calcutta 55  edinburgh is as healthy as new york23 but there is no city in the entire list which is healthier except frankfortonthemain20 but frankfort is not as healthy as chicago san francisco st louis or philadelphia  perhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where one in 1000 of americas population dies two in 1000 of the other populations of the earth succumb  i do not like to make insinuations but i do think the above statistics darkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water on the sly  we climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier and then crept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so in pretty constant danger of a tumble to the glacier below the fall would have been only one hundred feet but it would have closed me out as effectually as one thousand therefore i respected the distance accordingly and was glad when the trip was done a moraine is an ugly thing to assault headfirst at a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand accurately shaped and nicely smoothed but close by it is found to be made mainly of rough boulders of all sizes from that of a mans head to that of a cottage  by and by we came to the mauvais pas or the villainous road to translate it feelingly it was a breakneck path around the face of a precipice forty or fifty feet high and nothing to hang on to but some iron railings i got along slowly safely and uncomfortably and finally reached the middle my hopes began to rise a little but they were quickly blighted for there i met a hoga longnosed bristly fellow that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me inquiringly a hog on a pleasure excursion in switzerlandthink of it it is striking and unusual a body might write a poem about it he could not retreat if he had been disposed to do it it would have been foolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room to stand upon our feet so we did nothing of the sort there were twenty or thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us we all turned about and went back and the hog followed behind the creature did not seem set up by what he had done he had probably done it before   we reached the restaurant on the height called the chapeau at four in the afternoon it was a mementofactory and the stock was large cheap and varied i bought the usual papercutter to remember the place by and had mont blanc the mauvais pas and the rest of the region branded on my alpenstock then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together this was not dangerous for the valley was five miles wide and quite level  we reached the hotel before nine oclock next morning we left for geneva on top of the diligence under shelter of a gay awning if i remember rightly there were more than twenty people up there it was so high that the ascent was made by ladder the huge vehicle was full everywhere inside and out five other diligences left at the same time all full we had engaged our seats two days beforehand to make sure and paid the regulation price five dollars each but the rest of the company were wiser they had trusted baedeker and waited consequently some of them got their seats for one or two dollars baedeker knows all about hotels railway and diligence companies and speaks his mind freely he is a trustworthy friend of the traveler   we never saw mont blanc at his best until we were many miles away then he lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens all white and cold and solemn and made the rest of the world seem little and plebeian and cheap and trivial  as he passed out of sight at last an old englishman settled himself in his seat and said  well i am satisfied i have seen the principal features of swiss scenerymont blanc and the goiternow for home     chapter xlvii  queer european manners   we spent a few pleasant restful days at geneva that delightful city where accurate timepieces are made for all the rest of the world but whose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident  geneva is filled with pretty shops and the shops are filled with the most enticing gimcrackery but if one enters one of these places he is at once pounced upon and followed up and so persecuted to buy this that and the other thing that he is very grateful to get out again and is not at all apt to repeat his experiment the shopkeepers of the smaller sort in geneva are as troublesome and persistent as are the salesmen of that monster hive in paris the grands magasins du louvrean establishment where illmannered pestering pursuing and insistence have been reduced to a science  in geneva prices in the smaller shops are very elasticthat is another bad feature i was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads suitable for a child i was only admiring them i had no use for them i hardly ever wear beads the shopwoman came out and offered them to me for thirtyfive francs i said it was cheap but i did not need them  ah but monsieur they are so beautiful  i confessed it but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character she darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands saying  ah but only see how lovely they are surely monsieur will take them monsieur shall have them for thirty francs there i have said itit is a loss but one must live  i dropped my hands and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation but no she dangled the beads in the sun before my face exclaiming ah monsieur cannot resist them she hung them on my coat button folded her hand resignedly and said goneand for thirty francs the lovely thingsit is incrediblebut the good god will sanctify the sacrifice to me  i removed them gently returned them and walked away shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passersby halted to observe the woman leaned out of her door shook the beads and screamed after me  monsieur shall have them for twentyeight  i shook my head  twentyseven it is a cruel loss it is ruinbut take them only take them  i still retreated still wagging my head  mon dieu they shall even go for twentysix there i have said it come  i wagged another negative a nurse and a little english girl had been near me and were following me now the shopwoman ran to the nurse thrust the beads into her hands and said  monsieur shall have them for twentyfive take them to the hotelhe shall send me the money tomorrownext daywhen he likes then to the child when thy father sends me the money come thou also my angel and thou shall have something oh so pretty   i was thus providentially saved the nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly and that ended the matter  the sights of geneva are not numerous i made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people rousseau and calvin but i had no success then i concluded to go home i found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it for that town is a bewildering place i got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets and stayed lost for an hour or two finally i found a street which looked somewhat familiar and said to myself now i am at home i judge but i was wrong this was hell street presently i found another place which had a familiar look and said to myself now i am at home sure it was another error this was purgatory street after a little i said now ive got the right place anyway  no this is paradise street im further from home than i was in the beginning those were queer namescalvin was the author of them likely hell and purgatory fitted those two streets like a glove but the paradise appeared to be sarcastic  i came out on the lakefront at last and then i knew where i was i was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when i saw a curious performance a lady passed by and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him he made no offer to step out of the way he did not apologize he did not even notice her she had to stop still and let him lounge by i wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely he strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water i waited presently a youth came by and this fellow got up and served him the same trick still it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately to satisfy my curiosity i went around the block and sure enough as i approached at a good round speed he got up and lounged lazily across my path fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight this proved that his previous performances had not been accidental but intentional   i saw that dandys curious game played afterward in paris but not for amusement not with a motive of any sort indeed but simply from a selfish indifference to other peoples comfort and rights one does not see it as frequently in paris as he might expect to for there the law says in effect it is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong we fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen paris fines the citizen for being run over at least so everybody saysbut i saw something which caused me to doubt i saw a horseman run over an old woman one daythe police arrested him and took him away that looked as if they meant to punish him  it will not do for me to find merit in american mannersfor are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished europe still i must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners a lady may traverse our streets all day going and coming as she chooses and she will never be molested by any man but if a lady unattended walks abroad in the streets of london even at noonday she will be pretty likely to be accosted and insultedand not by drunken sailors but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen it is maintained that these people are not gentlemen but are a lower sort disguised as gentlemen the case of colonel valentine baker obstructs that argument for a man cannot become an officer in the british army except he hold the rank of gentleman this person finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girlbut it is an atrocious story and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough london must have been more or less accustomed to bakers and the ways of bakers else london would have been offended and excited baker was imprisonedin a parlor and he could not have been more visited or more overwhelmed with attentions if he had committed six murders and thenwhile the gallows was preparinggot religionafter the manner of the holy charles peace of saintly memory arkansawit seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities and comparisons are always odious but stillarkansaw would certainly have hanged baker i do not say she would have tried him first but she would have hanged him anyway  even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection she will encounter less polish than she would in the old world but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it  the music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walkto italy but the road was so level that we took the train we lost a good deal of time by this but it was no matter we were not in a hurry we were four hours going to chambery the swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour in places but they are quite safe  that aged french town of chambèry was as quaint and crooked as heilbronn a drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun in one of these streets which was eight feet wide gracefully curved and built up with small antiquated houses i saw three fat hogs lying asleep and a boy also asleep taking care of them   from queer oldfashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head and shoulders of a catasleep the five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street there was not a sound absolute stillness prevailed it was sunday one is not used to such dreamy sundays on the continent in our part of the town it was different that night a regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from algiers and i judged they got thirsty on the way they sang and drank till dawn in the pleasant open air  we left for turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels we forgot to take a lantern along consequently we missed all the scenery our compartment was full a ponderous towheaded swiss woman who put on many finelady airs but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one propping them intermediately with her upended valise in the seat thus pirated sat two americans greatly incommoded by that womans majestic coffinclad feet one of them begged politely to remove them she opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare but answered nothing by and by he proferred his request again with great respectfulness she said in good english and in a deeply offended tone that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her rights by illbred foreigners even if she was alone and unprotected   but i have rights also madam my ticket entitles me to a seat but you are occupying half of it  i will not talk with you sir what right have you to speak to me i do not know you one would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen no gentleman would treat a lady as you have treated me  i come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same provocation  you have insulted me sir you have intimated that i am not a ladyand i hope i am not one after the pattern of your country  i beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head madam but at the same time i must insistalways respectfullythat you let me have my seat  here the fragile laundress burst into tears and sobs  i never was so insulted before never never it is shameful it is brutal it is base to bully and abuse an unprotected lady who has lost the use of her limbs and cannot put her feet to the floor without agony  good heavens madam why didnt you say that at first i offer a thousand pardons and i offer them most sincerely i did not knowi could not knowanything was the matter you are most welcome to the seat and would have been from the first if i had only known i am truly sorry it all happened i do assure you  but he couldnt get a word of forgiveness out of her she simply sobbed and sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours meantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertakerfurniture and paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little efforts to do something for her comfort then the train halted at the italian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a leg as any washerwoman of all her tribe and how sick i was to see how she had fooled me   turin is a very fine city in the matter of roominess it transcends anything that was ever dreamed of before i fancy it sits in the midst of a vast deadlevel and one is obliged to imagine that land may be had for the asking and no taxes to pay so lavishly do they use it the streets are extravagantly wide the paved squares are prodigious the houses are huge and handsome and compacted into uniform blocks that stretch away as straight as an arrow into the distance the sidewalks are about as wide as ordinary european streets and are covered over with a double arcade supported on great stone piers or columns one walks from one end to the other of these spacious streets under shelter all the time and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops and the most inviting dininghouses  there is a wide and lengthy court glittering with the most wickedly enticing shops which is roofed with glass high aloft overhead and paved with softtoned marbles laid in graceful figures and at night when the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and chatting and laughing multitude of pleasureseekers it is a spectacle worth seeing  everything is on a large scale the public buildings for instanceand they are architecturally imposing too as well as large the big squares have big bronze monuments in them at the hotel they gave us rooms that were alarming for size and parlor to match it was well the weather required no fire in the parlor for i think one might as well have tried to warm a park the place would have a warm look though in any weather for the windowcurtains were of red silk damask and the walls were covered with the same firehued goodsso also were the four sofas and the brigade of chairs the furniture the ornaments the chandeliers the carpets were all new and bright and costly we did not need a parlor at all but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and we might use it if we chose since it was to cost nothing we were not averse to using it of course  turin must surely read a good deal for it has more bookstores to the square rod than any other town i know of and it has its own share of military folk the italian officers uniforms are very much the most beautiful i have ever seen and as a general thing the men in them were as handsome as the clothes they were not large men but they had fine forms fine features rich olive complexions and lustrous black eyes  for several weeks i had been culling all the information i could about italy from tourists the tourists were all agreed upon one thingone must expect to be cheated at every turn by the italians i took an evening walk in turin and presently came across a little punch and judy show in one of the great squares twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience this miniature theater was not much bigger than a mans coffin stood on end the upper part was open and displayed a tinseled parlora goodsized handkerchief would have answered for a dropcurtain the footlights consisted of a couple of candleends an inch long various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other gesticulating a good deal and they generally had a fight before they got through they were worked by strings from above and the illusion was not perfect for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated themand the actors and actresses all talked in the same voice too the audience stood in front of the theater and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily  when the play was done a youth in his shirtsleeves started around with a small copper saucer to make a collection i did not know how much to put in but thought i would be guided by my predecessors unluckily i only had two of these and they did not help me much because they did not put in anything i had no italian money so i put in a small swiss coin worth about ten cents the youth finished his collection trip and emptied the result on the stage he had some very animated talk with the concealed manager then he came working his way through the little crowdseeking me i thought i had a mind to slip away but concluded i wouldnt i would stand my ground and confront the villainy whatever it was the youth stood before me and held up that swiss coin sure enough and said something i did not understand him but i judged he was requiring italian money of me the crowd gathered close to listen i was irritated and saidin english of course  i know its swiss but youll take that or none i havent any other   he tried to put the coin in my hand and spoke again i drew my hand away and said  no sir i know all about you people you cant play any of your fraudful tricks on me if there is a discount on that coin i am sorry but i am not going to make it good i noticed that some of the audience didnt pay you anything at all you let them go without a word but you come after me because you think im a stranger and will put up with an extortion rather than have a scene but you are mistaken this timeyoull take that swiss money or none  the youth stood there with the coin in his fingers nonplused and bewildered of course he had not understood a word an englishspeaking italian spoke up now and said  you are misunderstanding the boy he does not mean any harm he did not suppose you gave him so much money purposely so he hurried back to return you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your mistake take it and give him a pennythat will make everything smooth again  i probably blushed then for there was occasion through the interpreter i begged the boys pardon but i nobly refused to take back the ten cents i said i was accustomed to squandering large sums in that wayit was the kind of person i was then i retired to make a note to the effect that in italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat  the episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history i once robbed an aged and blind beggarwoman of four dollarsin a church it happened this way when i was out with the innocents abroad the ship stopped in the russian port of odessa and i went ashore with others to view the town i got separated from the rest and wandered about alone until late in the afternoon when i entered a greek church to see what it was like when i was ready to leave i observed two wrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall near the door with their brown palms open to receive alms i contributed to the nearer one and passed out i had gone fifty yards perhaps when it occurred to me that i must remain ashore all night as i had heard that the ships business would carry her away at four oclock and keep her away until morning it was a little after four now i had come ashore with only two pieces of money both about the same size but differing largely in valueone was a french gold piece worth four dollars the other a turkish coin worth two cents and a half with a sudden and horrified misgiving i put my hand in my pocket now and sure enough i fetched out that turkish penny  here was a situation a hotel would require pay in advance i must walk the street all night and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character there was but one way out of the difficultyi flew back to the church and softly entered there stood the old woman yet and in the palm of the nearest one still lay my gold piece i was grateful i crept close feeling unspeakably mean i got my turkish penny ready and was extending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange when i heard a cough behind me i jumped back as if i had been accused and stood quaking while a worshiper entered and passed up the aisle  i was there a year trying to steal that money that is it seemed a year though of course it must have been much less the worshipers went and came there were hardly ever three in the church at once but there was always one or more every time i tried to commit my crime somebody came in or somebody started out and i was prevented but at last my opportunity came for one moment there was nobody in the church but the two beggarwomen and me i whipped the gold piece out of the poor old paupers palm and dropped my turkish penny in its place poor old thing she murmured her thanksthey smote me to the heart then i sped away in a guilty hurry and even when i was a mile from the church i was still glancing back every moment to see if i was being pursued  that experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me for i resolved then that as long as i lived i would never again rob a blind beggarwoman in a church and i have always kept my word the most permanent lessons in morals are those which come not of booky teaching but of experience     chapter xlviii  beauty of womenand of old masters   in milan we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful arcade or gallery or whatever it is called blocks of tall new buildings of the most sumptuous sort rich with decoration and graced with statues the streets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height the pavements all of smooth and variegated marble arranged in tasteful patternslittle tables all over these marble streets people sitting at them eating drinking or smokingcrowds of other people strolling bysuch is the arcade i should like to live in it all the time the windows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open and one breakfasts there and enjoys the passing show  we wandered all over the town enjoying whatever was going on in the streets we took one omnibus ride and as i did not speak italian and could not ask the price i held out some copper coins to the conductor and he took two then he went and got his tariff card and showed me that he had taken only the right sum so i made a noteitalian omnibus conductors do not cheat  near the cathedral i saw another instance of probity an old man was peddling dolls and toy fans two small american children bought fans and one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins and both started away but they were called back and the franc and one of the coppers were restored to them hence it is plain that in italy parties connected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not cheat   the stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive generally in the vestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store we saw eight or ten wooden dummies grouped together clothed in woolen business suits and each marked with its price one suit was marked fortyfive francsnine dollars harris stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that nothing easier the old merchant dragged in the dummy brushed him off with a broom stripped him and shipped the clothes to the hotel he said he did not keep two suits of the same kind in stock but manufactured a second when it was needed to reclothe the dummy   in another quarter we found six italians engaged in a violent quarrel they danced fiercely about gesticulating with their heads their arms their legs their whole bodies they would rush forward occasionally with a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each others very faces we lost half an hour there waiting to help cord up the dead but they finally embraced each other affectionately and the trouble was over the episode was interesting but we could not have afforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of it but a reconciliation note madein italy people who quarrel cheat the spectator  we had another disappointment afterward we approached a deeply interested crowd and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly chattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered with a piece of old blanket every little while he would bend down and take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his fingertips as if to show there was no deceptionchattering away all the whilebut always just as i was expecting to see a wonder feat of legerdemain he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further however at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid in it and held it fair and frankly around for people to see that it was all right and he was taking no advantagehis chatter became more excited than ever i supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid and swallow it so i was greatly wrought up and interested i got a cent ready in one hand and a florin in the other intending to give him the former if he survived and the latter if he killed himselffor his loss would be my gain in a literary way and i was willing to pay a fair price for the item but this impostor ended his intensely moving performance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing the spoon then he held it aloft and he could not have shown a wilder exultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle the crowd applauded in a gratified way and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth when it says these children of the south are easily entertained  we spent an impressive hour in the noble cathedral where long shafts of tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty windows and falling on a pillar here a picture there and a kneeling worshiper yonder the organ was muttering censers were swinging candles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing silently past them the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts away and steep the soul in a holy calm a trim young american lady paused a yard or two from me fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks flecking the faroff altar bent her head reverently a moment then straightened up kicked her train into the air with her heel caught it deftly in her hand and marched briskly out   we visited the picturegalleries and the other regulation sights of milannot because i wanted to write about them again but to see if i had learned anything in twelve years i afterward visited the great galleries of rome and florence for the same purpose i found i had learned one thing when i wrote about the old masters before i said the copies were better than the originals that was a mistake of large dimensions the old masters were still unpleasing to me but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies the copy is to the original as the pallid smart inane new waxwork group is to the vigorous earnest dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate there is a mellow richness a subdued color in the old pictures which is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear that is the merit which is most loudly praised in the old picture and is the one which the copy most conspicuously lacks and which the copyist must not hope to compass it was generally conceded by the artists with whom i talked that that subdued splendor that mellow richness is imparted to the picture by age then why should we worship the old master for it who didnt impart it instead of worshiping old time who did perhaps the picture was a clanging bell until time muffled it and sweetened it   in conversation with an artist in venice i asked what is it that people see in the old masters i have been in the doges palace and i saw several acres of very bad drawing very bad perspective and very incorrect proportions paul veroneses dogs to not resemble dogs all the horses look like bladders on legs one man had a right leg on the left side of his body in the large picture where the emperor barbarossa is prostrate before the pope there are three men in the foreground who are over thirty feet high if one may judge by the size of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground and according to the same scale the pope is seven feet high and the doge is a shriveled dwarf of four feet  the artist said  yes the old masters often drew badly they did not care much for truth and exactness in minor details but after all in spite of bad drawing bad perspective bad proportions and a choice of subjects which no longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago there is a something about their pictures which is divinea something which is above and beyond the art of any epoch sincea something which would be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to attain it and therefore do not worry about it  that is what he saidand he said what he believed and not only believed but felt  reasoningespecially reasoning without technical knowledgemust be put aside in cases of this kind it cannot assist the inquirer it will lead him in the most logical progression to what in the eyes of artists would be a most illogical conclusion thus bad drawing bad proportion bad perspective indifference to truthful detail color which gets its merit from time and not from the artistthese things constitute the old master conclusion the old master was a bad painter the old master was not an old master at all but an old apprentice your friend the artist will grant your premises but deny your conclusion he will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed defects there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable about the old master and that there is no arguing the fact away by any system of reasoning whatsoever  i can believe that there are women who have an indefinable charm in their faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates but a cold stranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would fail he would say of one of these women this chin is too short this nose is too long this forehead is too high this hair is too red this complexion is too pallid the perspective of the entire composition is incorrect conclusion the woman is not beautiful but her nearest friend might say and say truly your premises are right your logic is faultless but your conclusion is wrong nevertheless she is an old mastershe is beautiful but only to such as know her it is a beauty which cannot be formulated but it is there just the same   i found more pleasure in contemplating the old masters this time than i did when i was in europe in former years but still it was a calm pleasure there was nothing overheated about it when i was in venice before i think i found no picture which stirred me much but this time there were two which enticed me to the doges palace day after day and kept me there hours at a time one of these was tintorettos threeacre picture in the great council chamber when i saw it twelve years ago i was not strongly attracted to itthe guide told me it was an insurrection in heavenbut this was an error  the movement of this great work is very fine there are ten thousand figures and they are all doing something there is a wonderful go to the whole composition some of the figures are driving headlong downward with clasped hands others are swimming through the cloudshoalssome on their faces some on their backsgreat processions of bishops martyrs and angels are pouring swiftly centerward from various outlying directionseverywhere is enthusiastic joy there is rushing movement everywhere there are fifteen or twenty figures scattered here and there with books but they cannot keep their attention on their readingthey offer the books to others but no one wishes to read now the lion of st mark is there with his book st mark is there with his pen uplifted he and the lion are looking each other earnestly in the face disputing about the way to spell a wordthe lion looks up in rapt admiration while st mark spells this is wonderfully interpreted by the artist it is the masterstroke of this imcomparable painting   i visited the place daily and never grew tired of looking at that grand picture as i have intimated the movement is almost unimaginably vigorous the figures are singing hosannahing and many are blowing trumpets so vividly is noise suggested that spectators who become absorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each others ears making eartrumpets of their curved hands fearing they may not otherwise be heard one often sees a tourist with the eloquent tears pouring down his cheeks funnel his hands at his wifes ear and hears him roar through them oh to be there and at rest   none but the supremely great in art can produce effects like these with the silent brush  twelve years ago i could not have appreciated this picture one year ago i could not have appreciated it my study of art in heidelberg has been a noble education to me all that i am today in art i owe to that  the other great work which fascinated me was bassanos immortal hair trunk this is in the chamber of the council of ten it is in one of the three fortyfoot pictures which decorate the walls of the room the composition of this picture is beyond praise the hair trunk is not hurled at the strangers headso to speakas the chief feature of an immortal work so often is no it is carefully guarded from prominence it is subordinated it is restrained it is most deftly and cleverly held in reserve it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to by the master and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last he is taken unawares he is unprepared and it bursts upon him with a stupefying surprise  one is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate planning must have cost a general glance at the picture could never suggest that there was a hair trunk in it the hair trunk is not mentioned in the title evenwhich is pope alexander iii and the doge ziani the conqueror of the emperor frederick barbarossa you see the title is actually utilized to help divert attention from the trunk thus as i say nothing suggests the presence of the trunk by any hint yet everything studiedly leads up to it step by step let us examine into this and observe the exquisitely artful artlessness of the plan  at the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women one of them with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting with bandaged head on the ground these people seem needless but no they are there for a purpose one cannot look at them without seeing the gorgeous procession of grandees bishops halberdiers and bannerbearers which is passing along behind them one cannot see the procession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither it is going it leads him to the pope in the center of the picture who is talking with the bonnetless dogetalking tranquilly too although within twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum and not far from the drummer two persons are blowing horns and many horsemen are plunging and rioting aboutindeed twentytwo feet of this great work is all a deep and happy holiday serenity and sundayschool procession and then we come suddenly upon eleven and onehalf feet of turmoil and racket and insubordination this latter state of things is not an accident it has its purpose but for it one would linger upon the pope and the doge thinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture whereas one is drawn along almost unconsciously to see what the trouble is about now at the very end of this riot within four feet of the end of the picture and full thirtysix feet from the beginning of it the hair trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the spectator in all its matchless perfection and the great masters triumph is sweeping and complete from that moment no other thing in those forty feet of canvas has any charm one sees the hair trunk and the hair trunk onlyand to see it is to worship it bassano even placed objects in the immediate vicinity of the supreme feature whose pretended purpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus delay and augment the surprise for instance to the right of it he has placed a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye for a momentto the left of it some six feet away he has placed a redcoated man on an inflated horse and that coat plucks your eye to that locality the next momentthen between the trunk and the red horseman he has intruded a man naked to his waist who is carrying a fancy floursack on the middle of his back instead of on his shoulderthis admirable feat interests you of coursekeeps you at bay a little longer like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing wolfbut at last in spite of all distractions and detentions the eye of even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the worlds masterpiece and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans upon his guide for support   descriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect yet they are of value the top of the trunk is arched the arch is a perfect halfcircle in the roman style of architecture for in the then rapid decadence of greek art the rising influence of rome was already beginning to be felt in the art of the republic the trunk is bound or bordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body many critics consider this leather too cold in tone but i consider this its highest merit since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast the impassioned fervor of the hasp the highlights in this part of the work are cleverly managed the motif is admirably subordinated to the ground tints and the technique is very fine the brass nailheads are in the purest style of the early renaissance the strokes here are very firm and boldevery nailhead is a portrait the handle on the end of the trunk has evidently been retouchedi think with a piece of chalkbut one can still see the inspiration of the old master in the tranquil almost too tranquil hang of it the hair of this trunk is real hairso to speakwhite in patches brown in patches the details are finely worked out the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and inactive attitude is charmingly expressed there is a feeling about this part of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art the sense of sordid realism vanishes awayone recognizes that there is soul here  view this trunk as you will it is a gem it is a marvel it is a miracle some of the effects are very daring approaching even to the boldest flights of the rococo the sirocco and the byzantine schoolsyet the masters hand never faltersit moves on calm majestic confidentand with that art which conceals art it finally casts over the tout ensemble by mysterious methods of its own a subtle something which refines subdues etherealizes the arid components and endures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of poesy  among the arttreasures of europe there are pictures which approach the hair trunkthere are two which may be said to equal it possiblybut there is none that surpasses it so perfect is the hair trunk that it moves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art when an erie baggagemaster saw it two years ago he could hardly keep from checking it and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence he gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments then slowly and unconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost and got out his chalk with the other these facts speak for themselves     chapter xlix  hanged with a golden rope   one lingers about the cathedral a good deal in venice there is a strong fascination about itpartly because it is so old and partly because it is so ugly too many of the worlds famous buildings fail of one chief virtueharmony they are made up of a methodless mixture of the ugly and the beautiful this is bad it is confusing it is unrestful one has a sense of uneasiness of distress without knowing why but one is calm before st marks one is calm within it one would be calm on top of it calm in the cellar for its details are masterfully ugly no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded anywhere and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole of soothing entrancing tranquilizing soulsatisfying ugliness ones admiration of a perfect thing always grows never declines and this is the surest evidence to him that it is perfect st marks is perfect to me it soon grew to be so nobly so augustly ugly that it was difficult to stay away from it even for a little while every time its squat domes disappeared from my view i had a despondent feeling whenever they reappeared i felt an honest rapturei have not known any happier hours than those i daily spent in front of florians looking across the great square at it propped on its long row of low thicklegged columns its back knobbed with domes it seemed like a vast warty bug taking a meditative walk  st marks is not the oldest building in the world of course but it seems the oldest and looks the oldestespecially inside  when the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged they are repaired but not altered the grotesque old pattern is preserved antiquity has a charm of its own and to smarten it up would only damage it one day i was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an ancient piece of apprenticework in mosaic illustrative of the command to multiply and replenish the earth the cathedral itself had seemed very old but this picture was illustrating a period in history which made the building seem young by comparison but i presently found an antique which was older than either the battered cathedral or the date assigned to the piece of history it was a spiralshaped fossil as large as the crown of a hat it was embedded in the marble bench and had been sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth contrasted with the inconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil those other things were flippantly modernjejunemere matters of daybeforeyesterday the sense of the oldness of the cathedral vanished away under the influence of this truly venerable presence  st marks is monumental it is an imperishable remembrancer of the profound and simple piety of the middle ages whoever could ravish a column from a pagan temple did it and contributed his swag to this christian one so this fane is upheld by several hundred acquisitions procured in that peculiar way in our day it would be immoral to go on the highway to get bricks for a church but it was no sin in the old times st marks was itself the victim of a curious robbery once the thing is set down in the history of venice but it might be smuggled into the arabian nights and not seem out of place there  nearly four hundred and fifty years ago a candian named stammato in the suite of a prince of the house of este was allowed to view the riches of st marks his sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself behind an altar with an evil purpose in his heart but a priest discovered him and turned him out afterward he got in againby false keys this time he went there night after night and worked hard and patiently all alone overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his toil and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble paneling which walled the lower part of the treasury this block he fixed so that he could take it out and put it in at will after that for weeks he spent all his midnights in his magnificent mine inspecting it in security gloating over its marvels at his leisure and always slipping back to his obscure lodgings before dawn with a dukes ransom under his cloak he did not need to grab haphazard and runthere was no hurry he could make deliberate and wellconsidered selections he could consult his esthetic tastes one comprehends how undisturbed he was and how safe from any danger of interruption when it is stated that he even carried off a unicorns horna mere curiositywhich would not pass through the egress entire but had to be sawn in twoa bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor he continued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost the charm of novelty and became monotonous then he ceased from it contented well he might be for his collection raised to modern values represented nearly fifty million dollars   he could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country and it might have been years before the plunder was missed but he was humanhe could not enjoy his delight alone he must have somebody to talk about it with so he exacted a solemn oath from a candian noble named crioni then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath away with a sight of his glittering hoard he detected a look in his friends face which excited his suspicion and was about to slip a stiletto into him when crioni saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment stammato made crioni a present of one of the states principal jewelsa huge carbuncle which afterward figured in the ducal cap of stateand the pair parted crioni went at once to the palace denounced the criminal and handed over the carbuncle as evidence stammato was arrested tried and condemned with the oldtime venetian promptness he was hanged between the two great columns in the piazzawith a gilded rope out of compliment to his love of gold perhaps he got no good of his booty at allit was all recovered  in venice we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the continenta home dinner with a private family if one could always stop with private families when traveling europe would have a charm which it now lacks as it is one must live in the hotels of course and that is a sorrowful business a man accustomed to american food and american domestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in europe but i think he would gradually waste away and eventually die  he would have to do without his accustomed morning meal that is too formidable a change altogether he would necessarily suffer from it he could get the shadow the sham the base counterfeit of that meal but it would do him no good and money could not buy the reality  to particularize the average americans simplest and commonest form of breakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak well in europe coffee is an unknown beverage you can get what the european hotelkeeper thinks is coffee but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles holiness it is a feeble characterless uninspiring sort of stuff and almost as undrinkable as if it had been made in an american hotel the milk used for it is what the french call christian milkmilk which has been baptized   after a few months acquaintance with european coffee ones mind weakens and his faith with it and he begins to wonder if the rich beverage of home with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it is not a mere dream after all and a thing which never existed  next comes the european breadfair enough good enough after a fashion but cold cold and tough and unsympathetic and never any change never any varietyalways the same tiresome thing  next the butterthe sham and tasteless butter no salt in it and made of goodness knows what  then there is the beefsteak they have it in europe but they dont know how to cook it neither will they cut it right it comes on the table in a small round pewter platter it lies in the center of this platter in a bordering bed of greasesoaked potatoes it is the size shape and thickness of a mans hand with the thumb and fingers cut off it is a little overdone is rather dry it tastes pretty insipidly it rouses no enthusiasm  imagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing and imagine an angel suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him a mighty porterhouse steak an inch and a half thick hot and sputtering from the griddle dusted with a fragrant pepper enriched with little melting bits of butter of the most unimpeachable freshness and genuineness the precious juices of the meat trickling out and joining the gravy archipelagoed with mushrooms a township or two of tender yellowish fat gracing an outlying district of this ample county of beefsteak the long white bone which divides the sirloin from the tenderloin still in its place and imagine that the angel also adds a great cup of american homemade coffee with a cream afroth on top some real butter firm and yellow and fresh some smoking hotbiscuits a plate of hot buckwheat cakes with transparent syrupcould words describe the gratitude of this exile  the european dinner is better than the european breakfast but it has its faults and inferiorities it does not satisfy he comes to the table eager and hungry he swallows his soupthere is an undefinable lack about it somewhere thinks the fish is going to be the thing he wantseats it and isnt sure thinks the next dish is perhaps the one that will hit the hungry placetries it and is conscious that there was a something wanting about it also and thus he goes on from dish to dish like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught every time it alights but somehow doesnt get caught after all and at the end the exile and the boy have fared about alike the one is full but grievously unsatisfied the other has had plenty of exercise plenty of interest and a fine lot of hopes but he hasnt got any butterfly there is here and there an american who will say he can remember rising from a european table dhôte perfectly satisfied but we must not overlook the fact that there is also here and there an american who will lie  the number of dishes is sufficient but then it is such a monotonous variety of unstriking dishes it is an inane deadlevel of fairtomiddling there is nothing to accent it perhaps if the roast of mutton or of beefa big generous onewere brought on the table and carved in full view of the client that might give the right sense of earnestness and reality to the thing but they dont do that they pass the sliced meat around on a dish and so you are perfectly calm it does not stir you in the least now a vast roast turkey stretched on the broad of his back with his heels in the air and the rich juices oozing from his fat sides  but i may as well stop there for they would not know how to cook him they cant even cook a chicken respectably and as for carving it they do that with a hatchet   this is about the customary table dhôte bill in summer    soup characterless    fishsole salmon or whitingusually tolerably good    roastmutton or

earlier timesbut the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years fielding and smollett could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day but we are not allowed to approach them very near even with nice and guarded forms of speech but not so with art the brush may still deal freely with any subject however revolting or indelicate it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore to go about rome and florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues these works which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages are all figleaved now yes every one of them nobody noticed their nakedness before perhaps nobody can help noticing it now the figleaf makes it so conspicuous but the comical thing about it all is that the figleaf is confined to cold and pallid marble which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty whereas warmblood paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it  at the door of the uffizzi in florence one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman noseless battered black with accumulated grimethey hardly suggest human beingsyet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously figleaved by this fastidious generation you enter and proceed to that mostvisited little gallery that exists in the worldthe tribuneand there against the wall without obstructing rag or leaf you may look your fill upon the foulest the vilest the obscenest picture the world possessestitians venus it isnt that she is naked and stretched out on a bedno it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand if i ventured to describe that attitude there would be a fine howlbut there the venus lies for anybody to gloat over that wants toand there she has a right to lie for she is a work of art and art has its privileges i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her i saw young men gaze long and absorbedly at her i saw aged infirm men hang upon her charms with a pathetic interest how i should like to describe herjust to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the worldjust to hear the unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and coarseness and all that the world says that no worded description of a moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle seen with ones own eyesyet the world is willing to let its son and its daughter and itself look at titians beast but wont stand a description of it in words which shows that the world is not as consistent as it might be  there are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thoughti am well aware of that i am not railing at such what i am trying to emphasize is the fact that titians venus is very far from being one of that sort without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong in truth it is too strong for any place but a public art gallery titian has two venuses in the tribune persons who have seen them will easily remember which one i am referring to  in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood carnage oozing brains putrefactionpictures portraying intolerable sufferingpictures alive with every conceivable horror wrought out in dreadful detailand similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibitedwithout a growl from anybodyfor they are innocent they are inoffensive being works of art but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly thingsthe critics would skin him alive well let it go it cannot be helped art retains her privileges literature has lost hers somebody else may cipher out the whys and the wherefores and the consistencies of iti havent got time  titians venus defiles and disgraces the tribune there is no softening that fact but his moses glorifies it the simple truthfulness of its noble work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor be he learned or ignorant after wearying ones self with the acres of stuffy sappy expressionless babies that populate the canvases of the old masters of italy it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child and feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of the real thing this is a human child this is genuine you have seen him a thousand timesyou have seen him just as he is hereand you confess without reserve that titian was a master the dollfaces of other painted babes may mean one thing they may mean another but with the moses the case is different the most famous of all the artcritics has said there is no room for doubt hereplainly this child is in trouble  i consider that the moses has no equal among the works of the old masters except it be the divine hair trunk of bassano i feel sure that if all the other old masters were lost and only these two preserved the world would be the gainer by it   my sole purpose in going to florence was to see this immortal moses and by good fortune i was just in time for they were already preparing to remove it to a more private and betterprotected place because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in europe at the time  i got a capable artist to copy the picture pannemaker the engraver of dorés books engraved it for me and i have the pleasure of laying it before the reader in this volume  we took a turn to rome and some other italian citiesthen to munich and thence to parispartly for exercise but mainly because these things were in our projected program and it was only right that we should be faithful to it  from paris i branched out and walked through holland and belgium procuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired and i had a tolerably good time of it by and large i worked spain and other regions through agents to save time and shoeleather  we crossed to england and then made the homeward passage in the cunarder gallia a very fine ship i was glad to get homeimmeasurably glad so glad in fact that it did not seem possible that anything could ever get me out of the country again i had not enjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure i felt in seeing new york harbor again europe has many advantages which we have not but they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country then we are such a homeless lot when we are over there so are europeans themselves for that matter they live in dark and chilly vast tombscostly enough maybe but without conveniences to be condemned to live as the average european family lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average american family  on the whole i think that short visits to europe are better for us than long ones the former preserve us from becoming europeanized they keep our pride of country intact and at the same time they intensify our affection for our country and our people whereas long visits have the effect of dulling those feelingsat least in the majority of cases i think that one who mixes much with americans long resident abroad must arrive at this conclusion   appendix   nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an appendix                 herodotus   appendix a  the portier  omar khayam the poetprophet of persia writing more than eight hundred years ago has said  in the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned books many that are able to lead armies and many also that are able to govern kingdoms and empires but few there be that can keep a hotel  a word about the european hotel portier he is a most admirable invention a most valuable convenience he always wears a conspicuous uniform he can always be found when he is wanted for he sticks closely to his post at the front door he is as polite as a duke he speaks from four to ten languages he is your surest help and refuge in time of trouble or perplexity he is not the clerk he is not the landlord he ranks above the clerk and represents the landlord who is seldom seen instead of going to the clerk for information as we do at home you go to the portier it is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know nothing whatever it is the pride of the portier to know everything you ask the portier at what hours the trains leavehe tells you instantly or you ask him who is the best physician in town or what is the hack tariff or how many children the mayor has or what days the galleries are open and whether a permit is required and where you are to get it and what you must pay for it or when the theaters open and close what the plays are to be and the price of seats or what is the newest thing in hats or how the bills of mortality average or who struck billy patterson it does not matter what you ask him in nine cases out of ten he knows and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you can turn around three times there is nothing he will not put his hand to suppose you tell him you wish to go from hamburg to peking by the way of jericho and are ignorant of routes and pricesthe next morning he will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it to the last detail before you have been long on european soil you find yourself still saying you are relying on providence but when you come to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the portier he discovers what is puzzling you or what is troubling you or what your need is before you can get the half of it out and he promptly says leave that to me consequently you easily drift into the habit of leaving everything to him there is a certain embarrassment about applying to the average american hotel clerk a certain hesitancy a sense of insecurity against rebuff but you feel no embarrassment in your intercourse with the portier he receives your propositions with an enthusiasm which cheers and plunges into their accomplishment with an alacrity which almost inebriates the more requirements you can pile upon him the better he likes it of course the result is that you cease from doing anything for yourself he calls a hack when you want one puts you into it tells the driver whither to take you receives you like a longlost child when you return sends you about your business does all the quarreling with the hackman himself and pays him his money out of his own pocket he sends for your theater tickets and pays for them he sends for any possible article you can require be it a doctor an elephant or a postage stamp and when you leave at last you will find a subordinate seated with the cabdriver who will put you in your railway compartment buy your tickets have your baggage weighed bring you the printed tags and tell you everything is in your bill and paid for at home you get such elaborate excellent and willing service as this only in the best hotels of our large cities but in europe you get it in the mere back countrytowns just as well  what is the secret of the portiers devotion it is very simple he gets fees and no salary his fee is pretty closely regulated too if you stay a week you give him five marksa dollar and a quarter or about eighteen cents a day if you stay a month you reduce this average somewhat if you stay two or three months or longer you cut it down half or even more than half if you stay only one day you give the portier a mark  the head waiters fee is a shade less than the portiers the boots who not only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes but is usually the porter and handles your baggage gets a somewhat smaller fee than the head waiter the chambermaids fee ranks below that of the boots you fee only these four and no one else a german gentleman told me that when he remained a week in a hotel he gave the portier five marks the head waiter four the boots three and the chambermaid two and if he stayed three months he divided ninety marks among them in about the above proportions ninety marks make 2250  none of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel though it be a yearexcept one of these four servants should go away in the mean time in that case he will be sure to come and bid you goodby and give you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him it is considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to remain longer in the hotel because if you gave him too little he might neglect you afterward and if you gave him too much he might neglect somebody else to attend to you it is considered best to keep his expectations on a string until your stay is concluded  i do not know whether hotel servants in new york get any wages or not but i do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in vogue is a heavy burden the waiter expects a quarter at breakfastand gets it you have a different waiter at luncheon and so he gets a quarter your waiter at dinner is another strangerconsequently he gets a quarter the boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your gas fumbles around and hangs around significantly and you fee him to get rid of him now you may ring for icewater and ten minutes later for a lemonade and ten minutes afterward for a cigar and by and by for a newspaperand what is the result why a new boy has appeared every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him something suppose you boldly put your foot down and say it is the hotels business to pay its servants you will have to ring your bell ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there and when he goes off to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him again you may struggle nobly for twentyfour hours maybe if you are an adamantine sort of person but in the mean time you will have been so wretchedly served and so insolently that you will haul down your colors and go to impoverishing yourself with fees   it seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the european feeing system into america i believe it would result in getting even the bells of the philadelphia hotels answered and cheerful service rendered  the greatest american hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier and pay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course of a year the great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling salary and a portier who pays the hotel a salary by the latter system both the hotel and the public save money and are better served than by our system one of our consuls told me that a portier of a great berlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position and yet cleared six thousand dollars for himself the position of portier in the chief hotels of saratoga long branch new york and similar centers of resort would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than five thousand dollars for perhaps  when we borrowed the feeing fashion from europe a dozen years ago the salary system ought to have been discontinued of course we might make this correction now i should think and we might add the portier too since i first began to study the portier i have had opportunities to observe him in the chief cities of germany switzerland and italy and the more i have seen of him the more i have wished that he might be adopted in america and become there as he is in europe the strangers guardian angel  yes what was true eight hundred years ago is just as true today few there be that can keep a hotel perhaps it is because the landlords and their subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without first learning it in europe the trade of hotelkeeper is taught the apprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several grades one after the other just as in our country printingoffices the apprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water then learns to roll then to sort pi then to set type and finally rounds and completes his education with jobwork and presswork so the landlordapprentice serves as callboy then as underwaiter then as a parlor waiter then as head waiter in which position he often has to make out all the bills then as clerk or cashier then as portier his trade is learned now and by and by he will assume the style and dignity of landlord and be found conducting a hotel of his own  now in europe the same as in america when a man has kept a hotel so thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great reputation he has his reward he can live prosperously on that reputation he can let his hotel run down to the last degree of shabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time for instance there is the hotel de ville in milan it swarms with mice and fleas and if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough to start another one with the food would create an insurrection in a poorhouse and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes up its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of triflesand without making any denials or excuses about it either but the hotel de villes old excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with travelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to warn them   appendix b  heidelberg castle heidelberg castle must have been very beautiful before the french battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago the stone is brown with a pinkish tint and does not seem to stain easily the dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a drawingroom rather than for the outside of a house many fruit and flower clusters human heads and grim projecting lions heads are still as perfect in every detail as if they were new but the statues which are ranked between the windows have suffered these are lifesize statues of oldtime emperors electors and similar grandees clad in mail and bearing ponderous swords some have lost an arm some a head and one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle there is a saying that if a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to the castle front without saying anything he can make a wish and it will be fulfilled but they say that the truth of this thing has never had a chance to be proved for the reason that before any stranger can walk from the drawbridge to the appointed place the beauty of the palace front will extort an exclamation of delight from him  a ruin must be rightly situated to be effective this one could not have been better placed it stands upon a commanding elevation it is buried in green woods there is no level ground about it but on the contrary there are wooded terraces upon terraces and one looks down through shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight reigns and the sun cannot intrude nature knows how to garnish a ruin to get the best effect one of these old towers is split down the middle and one half has tumbled aside it tumbled in such a way as to establish itself in a picturesque attitude then all it lacked was a fitting drapery and nature has furnished that she has robed the rugged mass in flowers and verdure and made it a charm to the eye the standing half exposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you like open toothless mouths there too the vines and flowers have done their work of grace the rear portion of the tower has not been neglected either but is clothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds and stains of time even the top is not left bare but is crowned with a flourishing group of trees and shrubs misfortune has done for this old tower what it has done for the human character sometimesimproved it  a gentleman remarked one day that it might have been fine to live in the castle in the day of its prime but that we had one advantage which its vanished inhabitants lackedthe advantage of having a charming ruin to visit and muse over but that was a hasty idea those people had the advantage of us they had the fine castle to live in and they could cross the rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of trifels besides the trifels people in their day five hundred years ago could go and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished now to the last stone there have always been ruins no doubt and there have always been pensive people to sigh over them and asses to scratch upon them their names and the important date of their visit within a hundred years after adam left eden the guide probably gave the usual general flourish with his hand and said place where the animals were named ladies and gentlemen place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood exact spot where adam and eve first met and here ladies and gentlemen adorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of tourists we have the crumbling remains of cains altarfine old ruin then no doubt he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go  an illumination of heidelberg castle is one of the sights of europe the castles picturesque shape its commanding situation midway up the steep and wooded mountainside its vast sizethese features combine to make an illumination a most effective spectacle it is necessarily an expensive show and consequently rather infrequent therefore whenever one of these exhibitions is to take place the news goes about in the papers and heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night i and my agent had one of these opportunities and improved it  about half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower bridge with some american students in a pouring rain and started up the road which borders the neunheim side of the river this roadway was densely packed with carriages and footpassengers the former of all ages and the latter of all ages and both sexes this black and solid mass was struggling painfully onward through the slop the darkness and the deluge we waded along for threequarters of a mile and finally took up a position in an unsheltered beergarden directly opposite the castle we could not see the castleor anything else for that matterbut we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the way through the pervading blackness and knew whereabouts the castle was located we stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden under our umbrellas the other ninetynine were occupied by standing men and women and they also had umbrellas all the region round about and up and down the riverroad was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden under an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas thus we stood during two drenching hours no rain fell on my head but the converging whalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling steams of water down my neck and sometimes into my ears and thus kept me from getting hot and impatient i had the rheumatism too and had heard that this was good for it afterward however i was led to believe that the water treatment is not good for rheumatism there were even little girls in that dreadful place a man held one in his arms just in front of me for as much as an hour with umbrelladrippings soaking into her clothing all the time  in the circumstances two hours was a good while for us to have to wait but when the illumination did at last come we felt repaid it came unexpectedly of coursethings always do that have been long looked and longed for with a perfectly breathtaking suddenness several mast sheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black throats of the castle towers accompanied by a thundering crash of sound and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor of fire and color for some little time the whole building was a blinding crimson mass the towers continued to spout thick columns of rockets aloft and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which clove their way to the zenith paused curved gracefully downward then burst into brilliant fountainsprays of richly colored sparks the red fires died slowly down within the castle and presently the shell grew nearly black outside the angry glare that shone out through the broken arches and innumerable sashless windows now reproduced the aspect which the castle must have borne in the old time when the french spoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and spoiling toward extinction  while we still gazed and enjoyed the ruin was suddenly enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire then in dazzling purple ones then a mixture of many colors followed then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated and from several rafts anchored in the river meteor showers of rockets roman candles bombs serpents and catharine wheels were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the skya marvelous sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as i was for a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day and yet the rain was falling in torrents all the time the evenings entertainment presently closed and we joined the innumerable caravan of halfdrowned strangers and waded home again  the castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful and as they joined the hotel grounds with no fences to climb but only some nobly shaded stone stairways to descend we spent a part of nearly every day in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves there was an attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables and benches and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at his foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd i say pretend because i only pretended to sip without really sipping that is the polite way but when you are ready to go you empty the beaker at a draught there was a brass band and it furnished excellent music every afternoon sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied every table filled and never a rough in the assemblageall nicely dressed fathers and mothers young gentlemen and ladies and children and plenty of university students and glittering officers with here and there a gray professor or a peaceful old lady with her knitting and always a sprinkling of gawky foreigners everybody had his glass of beer before him or his cup of coffee or his bottle of wine or his hot cutlet and potatoes young ladies chatted or fanned themselves or wrought at their crocheting or embroidering the students fed sugar to their dogs or discussed duels or illustrated new fencing tricks with their little canes and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment and everywhere peace and goodwill to men the trees were jubilant with birds and the paths with rollicking children one could have a seat in that place and plenty of music any afternoon for about eight cents or a family ticket for the season for two dollars  for a change when you wanted one you could stroll to the castle and burrow among its dungeons or climb about its ruined towers or visit its interior showsthe great heidelberg tun for instance everybody has heard of the great heidelberg tun and most people have seen it no doubt it is a winecask as big as a cottage and some traditions say it holds eighteen thousand bottles and other traditions say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels i think it likely that one of these statements is a mistake and the other is a lie however the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence since the cask is empty and indeed has always been empty history says an empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me   i do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in when you can get a better quality outside any day free of expense what could this cask have been built for the more one studies over that the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes some historians say that thirty couples some say thirty thousand couples can dance on the head of this cask at the same time even this does not seem to me to account for the building of it it does not even throw light on it a profound and scholarly englishmana specialistwho had made the great heidelberg tun his sole study for fifteen years told me he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make german cream in he said that the average german cow yielded from one to two and half teaspoons of milk when she was not worked in the plow or the haywagon more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day this milk was very sweet and good and a beautiful transparent bluish tint but in order to get cream from it in the most economical way a peculiar process was necessary now he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several milkings in a teacup pour it into the great tun fill up with water and then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the german empire demanded  this began to look reasonable it certainly began to account for the german cream which i had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels and restaurants but a thought struck me  why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and his own cask of water and mix them without making a government matter of it  where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion of water  very true it was plain that the englishman had studied the matter from all sides still i thought i might catch him on one point so i asked him why the modern empire did not make the nations cream in the heidelberg tun instead of leaving it to rot away unused but he answered as one prepared  a patient and diligent examination of the modern german cream had satisfied me that they do not use the great tun now because they have got a bigger one hid away somewhere either that is the case or they empty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the rhine all summer  there is a museum of antiquities in the castle and among its most treasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with german history there are hundreds of these and their dates stretch back through many centuries one of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a successor of charlemagne in the year 896 a signature made by a hand which vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago is a more impressive thing than even a ruined castle luthers weddingring was shown me also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era and an early bootjack and there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who was assassinated about sixty years ago the stabwounds in the face were duplicated with unpleasant fidelity one or two real hairs still remained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast that trifle seemed to almost change the counterfeit into a corpse  there are many aged portraitssome valuable some worthless some of great interest some of none at all i bought a coupleone a gorgeous duke of the olden time and the other a comely blueeyed damsel a princess maybe i bought them to start a portraitgallery of my ancestors with i paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the princess one can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these in europe if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for chances   appendix c  the college prison it seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws without having to answer to the public authorities his case must come before the university for trial and punishment if a policeman catches him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him the offender proclaims that he is a student and perhaps shows his matriculation card whereupon the officer asks for his address then goes his way and reports the matter at headquarters if the offense is one over which the city has no jurisdiction the authorities report the case officially to the university and give themselves no further concern about it the university court send for the student listen to the evidence and pronounce judgment the punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment in the university prison as i understand it a students case is often tried without his being present at all then something like this happens a constable in the service of the university visits the lodgings of the said student knocks is invited to come in does so and says politely  if you please i am here to conduct you to prison  ah says the student i was not expecting it what have i been doing  two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you  it is true i had forgotten it very well i have been complained of tried and found guiltyis that it  exactly you are sentenced to two days solitary confinement in the college prison and i am sent to fetch you  student o i cant go today  officer if you pleasewhy  student because ive got an engagement  officer tomorrow then perhaps  student no i am going to the opera tomorrow  officer could you come friday  student reflectively let me seefridayfriday i dont seem to have anything on hand friday  officer then if you please i will expect you on friday  student all right ill come around friday  officer thank you good day sir  student good day  so on friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord and is admitted  it is questionable if the worlds criminal history can show a custom more odd than this nobody knows now how it originated there have always been many noblemen among the students and it is presumed that all students are gentlemen in the old times it was usual to mar the convenience of such folk as little as possible perhaps this indulgent custom owes its origin to this  one day i was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an american student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison i asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as he conveniently could so that i might try to get in there and visit him and see what college captivity was like he said he would appoint the very first day he could spare  his confinement was to endure twentyfour hours he shortly chose his day and sent me word i started immediately when i reached the university place i saw two gentlemen talking together and as they had portfolios under their arms i judged they were tutors or elderly students so i asked them in english to show me the college jail i had learned to take it for granted that anybody in germany who knows anything knows english so i had stopped afflicting people with my german these gentlemen seemed a trifle amusedand a trifle confused toobut one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place he asked me why i wanted to get in there and i said to see a friendand for curiosity he doubted if i would be admitted but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian  he rang the bell a door opened and we stepped into a paved way and then up into a small livingroom where we were received by a hearty and goodnatured german woman of fifty she threw up her hands with a surprised ach gott herr professor and exhibited a mighty deference for my new acquaintance by the sparkle in her eye i judged she was a good deal amused too the herr professor talked to her in german and i understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible reasons to bear for admitting me they were successful so the herr professor received my earnest thanks and departed the old dame got her keys took me up two or three flights of stairs unlocked a door and we stood in the presence of the criminal then she went into a jolly and eager description of all that had occurred downstairs and what the herr professor had said and so forth and so on plainly she regarded it as quite a superior joke that i had waylaid a professor and employed him in so odd a service but i wouldnt have done it if i had known he was a professor therefore my conscience was not disturbed  now the dame left us to ourselves the cell was not a roomy one still it was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell it had a window of good size irongrated a small stove two wooden chairs two oaken tables very old and most elaborately carved with names mottoes faces armorial bearings etcthe work of several generations of imprisoned students and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress but no sheets pillows blankets or coverletsfor these the student must furnish at his own cost if he wants them there was no carpet of course  the ceiling was completely covered with names dates and monograms done with candlesmoke the walls were thickly covered with pictures and portraits in profile some done with ink some with soot some with a pencil and some with red blue and green chalks and whenever an inch or two of space had remained between the pictures the captives had written plaintive verses or names and dates i do not think i was ever in a more elaborately frescoed apartment  against the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws i made a note of one or two of these for instance the prisoner must pay for the privilege of entering a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money for the privilege of leaving when his term had expired 20 cents for every day spent in the prison 12 cents for fire and light 12 cents a day the jailer furnishes coffee mornings for a small sum dinners and suppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner choosesand he is allowed to pay for them too  here and there on the walls appeared the names of american students and in one place the american arms and motto were displayed in colored chalks  with the help of my friend i translated many of the inscriptions  some of them were cheerful others the reverse i will give the reader a few specimens  in my tenth semester my best one i am cast here through the complaints of others let those who follow me take warning  iii tage ohne grund angeblich aus neugierde which is to say he had a curiosity to know what prison life was like so he made a breach in some

the nature of the wrong that had been done and what sort of vengeance was wanted and whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not but there was no way of finding out these things  occasionally a name was followed simply by the remark ii days for disturbing the peace and without comment upon the justice or injustice of the sentence  in one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap corps with a bottle of champagne in each hand and below was the legend these make an evil fate endurable  there were two prison cells and neither had space left on walls or ceiling for another name or portrait or picture the inside surfaces of the two doors were completely covered with cartes de visite of former prisoners ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and injury by glass  i very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocketknives but red tape was in the way the custodian could not sell one without an order from a superior and that superior would have to get it from his superior and this one would have to get it from a higher oneand so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment the system was right and nobody could find fault with it but it did not seem justifiable to bother so many people so i proceeded no further it might have cost me more than i could afford anyway for one of those prison tables which was at the time in a private museum in heidelberg was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars it was not worth more than a dollar or possibly a dollar and half before the captive students began their work on it persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it  among them many who have tasted the college prisons dreary hospitality was a lively young fellow from one of the southern states of america whose first years experience of german university life was rather peculiar the day he arrived in heidelberg he enrolled his name on the college books and was so elated with the fact that his dearest hope had found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and renowned university that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event by a grand lark in company with some other students in the course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the universitys most stringent laws sequel before noon next day he was in the college prisonbooked for three months the twelve long weeks dragged slowly by and the day of deliverance came at last a great crowd of sympathizing fellowstudents received him with a rousing demonstration as he came forth and of course there was another grand larkin the course of which he managed to make a wide breach of the citys most stringent laws sequel before noon next day he was safe in the city lockupbooked for three months this second tedious captivity drew to an end in the course of time and again a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed soberly and calmly but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down the sleety street from sheer excess of joy sequel he slipped and broke his leg and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months  when he at last became a free man again he said he believed he would hunt up a brisker seat of learning the heidelberg lectures might be good but the opportunities of attending them were too rare the educational process too slow he said he had come to europe with the idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time but if he had averaged the heidelberg system correctly it was rather a matter of eternity   appendix d  the awful german language     a little learning makes the whole world kin                  proverbs xxxii 7  i went often to look at the collection of curiosities in heidelberg castle and one day i surprised the keeper of it with my german i spoke entirely in that language he was greatly interested and after i had talked a while he said my german was very rare possibly a unique and wanted to add it to his museum  if he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it harris and i had been hard at work on our german during several weeks at that time and although we had made good progress it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance for three of our teachers had died in the mean time a person who has not studied german can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is  surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless and so slippery and elusive to the grasp one is washed about in it hither and thither in the most helpless way and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech he turns over the page and reads let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions he runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it so overboard he goes again to hunt for another ararat and find another quicksand such has been and continues to be my experience every time i think i have got one of these four confusing cases where i am master of it a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence clothed with an awful and unsuspected power and crumbles the ground from under me for instance my book inquires after a certain birdit is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody where is the bird now the answer to this questionaccording to the bookis that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain of course no bird would do that but then you must stick to the book very well i begin to cipher out the german for that answer i begin at the wrong end necessarily for that is the german idea i say to myself regen rain is masculineor maybe it is feminineor possibly neuterit is too much trouble to look now therefore it is either der the regen or die the regen or das the regen according to which gender it may turn out to be when i look in the interest of science i will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine very wellthen the rain is der regen if it is simply in the quiescent state of being mentioned without enlargement or discussionnominative case but if this rain is lying around in a kind of a general way on the ground it is then definitely located it is doing somethingthat is resting which is one of the german grammars ideas of doing something and this throws the rain into the dative case and makes it dem regen however this rain is not resting but is doing something activelyit is fallingto interfere with the bird likelyand this indicates movement which has the effect of sliding it into the accusative case and changing dem regen into den regen having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter i answer up confidently and state in german that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop wegen on account of den regen then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word wegen drops into a sentence it always throws that subject into the genitive case regardless of consequencesand therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop wegen des regens  nbi was informed later by a higher authority that there was an exception which permits one to say wegen den regen in certain peculiar and complex circumstances but that this exception is not extended to anything but rain  there are ten parts of speech and they are all troublesome an average sentence in a german newspaper is a sublime and impressive curiosity it occupies a quarter of a column it contains all the ten parts of speechnot in regular order but mixed it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot and not to be found in any dictionarysix or seven words compacted into one without joint or seamthat is without hyphens it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own with here and there extra parentheses making pens within pens finally all the parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of kingparentheses one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of itafter which comes the verb and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about and after the verbmerely by way of ornament as far as i can make outthe writer shovels in haben sind gewesen gehabt haven geworden sein or words to that effect and the monument is finished i suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a mans signaturenot necessary but pretty german books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the lookingglass or stand on your headso as to reverse the constructionbut i think that to learn to read and understand a german newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner  yet even the german books are not entirely free from attacks of the parenthesis distemperthough they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent german novelwith a slight parenthesis in it i will make a perfectly literal translation and throw in the parenthesismarks and some hyphens for the assistance of the readerthough in the original there are no parenthesismarks or hyphens and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can  but when he upon the street the insatinandsilkcoverednowveryunconstrainedafterthenewestfashioneddressed government counselors wife met etc etc 1  1 wenn er aber auf der strasse der in sammt und seide gehuellten jetz sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten regierungsrathin begegnet  that is from the old mamselles secret by mrs marlitt and that sentence is constructed upon the most approved german model you observe how far that verb is from the readers base of operations well in a german newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page and i have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all of course then the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state  we have the parenthesis disease in our literature too and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect whereas with the germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people for surely it is not clearnessit necessarily cant be clearness even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that a writers ideas must be a good deal confused a good deal out of line and sequence when he starts out to say that a man met a counselors wife in the street and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the womans dress that is manifestly absurd it reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste  the germans have another kind of parenthesis which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that these things are called separable verbs the german grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance a favorite one is reiste abwhich means departed here is an example which i culled from a novel and reduced to english  the trunks being now ready he de after kissing his mother and sisters and once more pressing to his bosom his adored gretchen who dressed in simple white muslin with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her rich brown hair had tottered feebly down the stairs still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself parted  however it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs one is sure to lose his temper early and if he sticks to the subject and will not be warned it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language and should have been left out for instance the same sound sie means you and it means she and it means her and it means it and it means they and it means them think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of sixand a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that but mainly think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey this explains why whenever a person says sie to me i generally try to kill him if a stranger  now observe the adjective here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage therefore for no other reason the inventor of this language complicated it all he could when we wish to speak of our good friend or friends in our enlightened tongue we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it but with the german tongue it is different when a german gets his hands on an adjective he declines it and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it it is as bad as latin he says for instance  singular  nominativemein guter freund my good friend genitivesmeines guten freundes of my good friend dativemeinem guten freund to my good friend accusativemeinen guten freund my good friend  plural  nmeine guten freunde my good friends gmeiner guten freunde of my good friends dmeinen guten freunden to my good friends ameine guten freunde my good friends  now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations and see how soon he will be elected one might better go without friends in germany than take all this trouble about them i have shown what a bother it is to decline a good male friend well this is only a third of the work for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine and still another when the object is neuter now there are more adjectives in this language than there are black cats in switzerland and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested difficulttroublesomethese words cannot describe it i heard a californian student in heidelberg say in one of his calmest moods that he would rather decline two drinks than one german adjective  the inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of for instance if one is casually referring to a house haus or a horse pferd or a dog hund he spells these words as i have indicated but if he is referring to them in the dative case he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them hause pferde hunde so as an added e often signifies the plural as the s does with us the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of a dative dog before he discovers his mistake and on the other hand many a new student who could ill afford loss has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them because he ignorantly bought that dog in the dative singular when he really supposed he was talking pluralwhich left the law on the sellers side of course by the strict rules of grammar and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie  in german all the nouns begin with a capital letter now that is a good idea and a good idea in this language is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness i consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it you fall into error occasionally because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it german names almost always do mean something and this helps to deceive the student i translated a passage one day which said that the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest tannenwald when i was girding up my loins to doubt this i found out that tannenwald in this instance was a mans name  every noun has a gender and there is no sense or system in the distribution so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart there is no other way to do this one has to have a memory like a memorandumbook in german a young lady has no sex while a turnip has think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip and what callous disrespect for the girl see how it looks in printi translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the german sundayschool books  gretchen wilhelm where is the turnip  wilhelm she has gone to the kitchen  gretchen where is the accomplished and beautiful english maiden  wilhelm it has gone to the opera  to continue with the german genders a tree is male its buds are female its leaves are neuter horses are sexless dogs are male cats are femaletomcats included of course a persons mouth neck bosom elbows fingers nails feet and body are of the male sex and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it and not according to the sex of the individual who wears itfor in germany all the women wear either male heads or sexless ones a persons nose lips shoulders breast hands and toes are of the female sex and his hair ears eyes chin legs knees heart and conscience havent any sex at all the inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay  now by the above dissection the reader will see that in germany a man may think he is a man but when he comes to look into the matter closely he is bound to have his doubts he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine the humiliating second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land  in the german it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language a woman is a female but a wife weib is notwhich is unfortunate a wife here has no sex she is neuter so according to the grammar a fish is he his scales are she but a fishwife is neither to describe a wife as sexless may be called underdescription that is bad enough but overdescription is surely worse a german speaks of an englishman as the englÄnnder to change the sex he adds inn and that stands for englishwomanenglÄnderinn that seems descriptive enough but still it is not exact enough for a german so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine and writes it down thus die engländerinnwhich means the sheenglishwoman i consider that that person is overdescribed  well after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns he is still in a difficulty because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as he and she and him and her which it has been always accustomed to refer to as it when he even frames a german sentence in his mind with the hims and hers in the right places and then works up his courage to the utterancepoint it is no usethe moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and all those labored males and females come out as its and even when he is reading german to himself he always calls those things it whereas he ought to read in this way  tale of the fishwife and its sad fate 2  2 i capitalize the nouns in the german and ancient english fashion  it is a bleak day hear the rain how he pours and the hail how he rattles and see the snow how he drifts along and of the mud how deep he is ah the poor fishwife it is stuck fast in the mire it has dropped its basket of fishes and its hands have been cut by the scales as it seized some of the falling creatures and one scale has even got into its eye and it cannot get her out it opens its mouth to cry for help but if any sound comes out of him alas he is drowned by the raging of the storm and now a tomcat has got one of the fishes and she will surely escape with him no she bites off a fin she holds her in her mouthwill she swallow her no the fishwifes brave motherdog deserts his puppies and rescues the finwhich he eats himself as his reward o horror the lightning has struck the fishbasket he sets him on fire see the flame how she licks the doomed utensil with her red and angry tongue now she attacks the helpless fishwifes footshe burns him up all but the big toe and even she is partly consumed and still she spreads still she waves her fiery tongues she attacks the fishwifes leg and destroys it she attacks its hand and destroys her also she attacks the fishwifes leg and destroys her also she attacks its body and consumes him she wreathes herself about its heart and it is consumed next about its breast and in a moment she is a cinder now she reaches its neckhe goes now its chinit goes now its noseshe goes in another moment except help come the fishwife will be no more time pressesis there none to succor and save yes joy joy with flying feet the sheenglishwoman comes but alas the generous shefemale is too late where now is the fated fishwife it has ceased from its sufferings it has gone to a better land all that is left of it for its loved ones to lament over is this poor smoldering ashheap ah woeful woeful ashheap let us take him up tenderly reverently upon the lowly shovel and bear him to his long rest with the prayer that when he rises again it will be a realm where he will have one good square responsible sex and have it all to himself instead of having a mangy lot of assorted sexes scattered all over him in spots  there now the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue i suppose that in all languages the similarities of look and sound between words which have no similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the foreigner it is so in our tongue and it is notably the case in the german now there is that troublesome word vermÄhlt to me it has so close a resemblanceeither real or fanciedto three or four other words that i never know whether it means despised painted suspected or married until i look in the dictionary and then i find it means the latter there are lots of such words and they are a great torment to increase the difficulty there are words which seem to resemble each other and yet do not but they make just as much trouble as if they did for instance there is the word vermiethen to let to lease to hire and the word verheirathen another way of saying to marry i heard of an englishman who knocked at a mans door in heidelberg and proposed in the best german he could command to verheirathen that house then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize the first syllable but mean something very different if you throw the emphasis on the last syllable for instance there is a word which means a runaway or the act of glancing through a book according to the placing of the emphasis and another word which signifies to associate with a man or to avoid him according to where you put the emphasisand you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble  there are some exceedingly useful words in this language schlag for example and zug there are threequarters of a column of schlags in the dictonary and a column and a half of zugs the word schlag means blow stroke dash hit shock clap slap time bar coin stamp kind sort manner way apoplexy woodcutting enclosure field forestclearing this is its simple and exact meaningthat is to say its restricted its fettered meaning but there are ways by which you can set it free so that it can soar away as on the wings of the morning and never be at rest you can hang any word you please to its tail and make it mean anything you want to you can begin with schlagader which means artery and you can hang on the whole dictionary word by word clear through the alphabet to schlagwasser which means bilgewaterand including schlagmutter which means motherinlaw  just the same with zug strictly speaking zug means pull tug draught procession march progress flight direction expedition train caravan passage stroke touch line flourish trait of character feature lineament chessmove organstop team whiff bias drawer propensity inhalation disposition but that thing which it does not meanwhen all its legitimate pennants have been hung on has not been discovered yet  one cannot overestimate the usefulness of schlag and zug armed just with these two and the word also what cannot the foreigner on german soil accomplish the german word also is the equivalent of the english phrase you know and does not mean anything at allin talk though it sometimes does in print every time a german opens his mouth an also falls out and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was trying to get out  now the foreigner equipped with these three noble words is master of the situation let him talk right along fearlessly let him pour his indifferent german forth and when he lacks for a word let him heave a schlag into the vacuum all the chances are that it fits it like a plug but if it doesnt let him promptly heave a zug after it the two together can hardly fail to bung the hole but if by a miracle they should fail let him simply say also and this will give him a moments chance to think of the needful word in germany when you load your conversational gun it is always best to throw in a schlag or two and a zug or two because it doesnt make any difference how much the rest of the charge may scatter you are bound to bag something with them then you blandly say also and load up again nothing gives such an air of grace and elegance and unconstraint to a german or an english conversation as to scatter it full of alsos or you knows  in my notebook i find this entry  july 1in the hospital yesterday a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patienta north german from near hamburg but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place under the impression that he contained a panorama he died the sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community  that paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subjectthe length of german words some german words are so long that they have a perspective observe these examples  freundschaftsbezeigungen  dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten  stadtverordnetenversammlungen  these things are not words they are alphabetical processions and they are not rare one can open a german newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the pageand if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music too they impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject i take a great interest in these curiosities whenever i come across a good one i stuff it and put it in my museum in this way i have made quite a valuable collection when i get duplicates i exchange with other collectors and thus increase the variety of my stock here are some specimens which i lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bricabrac hunter  generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen  alterthumswissenschaften  kinderbewahrungsanstalten  unabhängigkeitserklärungen  wiedererstellungbestrebungen  waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen   of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the printed page it adorns and ennobles that literary landscapebut at the same time it is a great distress to the new student for it blocks up his way he cannot crawl under it or climb over it or tunnel through it so he resorts to the dictionary for help but there is no help there the dictionary must draw the line somewhereso it leaves this sort of words out and it is right because these long things are hardly legitimate words but are rather combinations of words and the inventor of them ought to have been killed they are compound words with the hyphens left out the various words used in building them are in the dictionary but in a very scattered condition so you can hunt the materials out one by one and get at the meaning at last but it is a tedious and harassing business i have tried this process upon some of the above examples freundshaftsbezeigungen seems to be friendship demonstrations which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying demonstrations of friendship unabhängigkeitserklärungen seems to be independencedeclarations which is no improvement upon declarations of independence so far as i can see generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen seems to be generalstatesrepresentativesmeetings as nearly as i can get at ita mere rhythmical gushy euphemism for meetings of the legislature i judge we used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature but it has gone out now we used to speak of a thing as a nevertobeforgotten circumstance instead of cramping it into the simple and sufficient word memorable and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened in those days we were not content to embalm the thing and bury it decently we wanted to build a monument over it  but in our newspapers the compoundingdisease lingers a little to the present day but with the hyphens left out in the german fashion this is the shape it takes instead of saying mr simmons clerk of the county and district courts was in town yesterday the new form puts it thus clerk of the county and district courts simmons was in town yesterday this saves neither time nor ink and has an awkward sound besides one often sees a remark like this in our papers mrs assistant district attorney johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season that is a case of really unjustifiable compounding because it not only saves no time or trouble but confers a title on mrs johnson which she has no right to but these little instances are trifles indeed contrasted with the ponderous and dismal german system of piling jumbled compounds together i wish to submit the following local item from a mannheim journal by way of illustration  in the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyafterelevenoclock night the inthistownstandingtavern called the wagoner was downburnt when the fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting storks nest reached flew the parent storks away but when the bytheraging firesurrounded nest itself caught fire straightway plunged the quickreturning motherstork into the flames and died her wings over her young ones outspread  even the cumbersome german construction is not able to take the pathos out of that pictureindeed it somehow seems to strengthen it this item is dated away back yonder months ago i could have used it sooner but i was waiting to hear from the fatherstork i am still waiting  also if i had not shown that the german is a difficult language i have at least intended to do so i have heard of an american student who was asked how he was getting along with his german and who answered promptly i am not getting along at all i have worked at it hard for three level months and all i have got to show for it is one solitary german phrasezwei glas two glasses of beer he paused for a moment reflectively then added with feeling but ive got that solid  and if i have not also shown that german is a harassing and infuriating study my execution has been at fault and not my intent i heard lately of a worn and sorely tried american student who used to fly to a certain german word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations no longerthe only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and healing to his lacerated spirit this was the word damit it was only the sound that helped him not the meaning 3 and so at last when he learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable his only stay and support was gone and he faded away and died  3 it merely means in its general sense herewith  i think that a description of any loud stirring tumultuous episode must be tamer in german than in english our descriptive words of this character have such a deep strong resonant sound while their german equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless boom burst crash roar storm bellow blow thunder explosion howl cry shout yell groan battle hell these are magnificent words the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe but their german equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with or else my aweinspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a schlacht or would not a comsumptive feel too much bundled up who was about to go out in a shirtcollar and a sealring into a storm which the birdsong word gewitter was employed to describe and observe the strongest of the several german equivalents for explosionausbruch our word toothbrush is more powerful than that it seems to me that the germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with the german word for hellhoellesounds more like helly than anything else therefore how necessarily chipper frivolous and unimpressive it is if a man were told in german to go there could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted  having pointed out in detail the several vices of this language i now come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues the capitalizing of the nouns i have already mentioned but far before this virtue stands anotherthat of spelling a word according to the sound of it after one short lesson in the alphabet the student can tell how any german word is pronounced without having to ask whereas in our language if a student should inquire of us what does b o w spell we should be obliged to reply nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off by itself you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out what it signifieswhether it is a thing to shoot arrows with or a nod of ones head or the forward end of a boat  there are some german words which are singularly and powerfully effective for instance those which describe lowly peaceful and affectionate home life those which deal with love in any and all forms from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing stranger clear up to courtship those which deal with outdoor nature in its softest and loveliest aspectswith meadows and forests and birds and flowers the fragrance and sunshine of summer and the moonlight of peaceful winter nights in a word those which deal with any and all forms of rest repose and peace those also which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland and lastly and chiefly in those words which express pathos is the language surpassingly rich and affective there are german songs which can make a stranger to the language cry that shows that the sound of the words is correctit interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness and so the ear is informed and through the ear the heart  the germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the right one they repeat it several times if they choose that is wise but in english when we have used a word a couple of times in a paragraph we imagine we are growing tautological and so we are weak enough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates exactness to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish repetition may be bad but surely inexactness is worse   there are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion or a language and then go blandly about their business without suggesting any remedy i am not that kind of person i have shown that the german language needs reforming very well i am ready to reform it at least i am ready to make the proper suggestions such a course as this might be immodest in another but i have devoted upward of nine full weeks first and last to a careful and critical study of this tongue and thus have acquired a confidence in my ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have conferred upon me  in the first place i would leave out the dative case it confuses the plurals and besides nobody ever knows when he is in the dative case except he discover it by accidentand then he does not know when or where it was that he got into it or how long he has been in it or how he is ever going to get out of it again the dative case is but an ornamental follyit is better to discard it  in the next place i would move the verb further up to the front you may load up with ever so good a verb but i notice that you never really bring down a subject with it at the present german rangeyou only cripple it so i insist that this important part of speech should be brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked eye  thirdly i would import some strong words from the english tongueto swear with and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things in a vigorous way 4  1 verdammt and its variations and enlargements are words which have plenty of meaning but the sounds are so mild and ineffectual that german ladies can use them without sin german ladies who could not be induced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion promptly rip out one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or dont like the soup it sounds about as wicked as our my gracious german ladies are constantly saying ach gott mein gott gott in himmel herr gott der herr jesus etc they think our ladies have the same custom perhaps for i once heard a gentle and lovely old german lady say to a sweet young american girl the two languages are so alikehow pleasant that is we say ach gott you say goddamn  fourthly i would reorganizes the sexes and distribute them accordingly to the will of the creator this as a tribute of respect if nothing else  fifthly i would do away with those great long compounded words or require the speaker to deliver them in sections with intermissions for refreshments to wholly do away with them would be best for ideas are more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when they come in bulk intellectual food is like any other it is pleasanter and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel  sixthly i would require a speaker to stop when he is done and not hang a string of those useless haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden seins to the end of his oration this sort of gewgaws undignify a speech instead of adding a grace they are therefore an offense and should be discarded  seventhly i would discard the parenthesis also the reparenthesis the rereparenthesis and the rererererereparentheses and likewise the final widereaching allenclosing kingparenthesis i would require every individual be he high or low to unfold a plain straightforward tale or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace infractions of this law should be punishable with death  and eighthly and last i would retain zug and schlag with their pendants and discard the rest of the vocabulary this would simplify the language  i have now named what i regard as the most necessary and important changes these are perhaps all i could be expected to name for nothing but there are other suggestions which i can and will make in case my proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the government in the work of reforming the language  my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english barring spelling and pronouncing in thirty hours french in thirty days and german in thirty years it seems manifest then that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired if it is to remain as it is it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages for only the dead have time to learn it  a fourth of july oration in the german tongue delivered at a banquet of the angloamerican club of students by the author of this book  gentlemen since i arrived a month ago in this old wonderland this vast garden of germany my english tongue has so often proved a useless piece of baggage to me and so troublesome to carry around in a country where they havent the checking system for luggage that i finally set to work and learned the german language also es freut mich dass dies so ist denn es muss in ein hauptsächlich degree höflich sein dass man auf ein occasion like this sein rede in die sprache des landes worin he boards aussprechen soll dafuer habe ich aus reinische verlegenheitno vergangenheitno i mean höflichkeitaus reinishe höflichkeit habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the german language um gottes willen also sie muessen so freundlich sein und verzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei englischer worte hie und da denn ich finde dass die deutsche is not a very copious language and so when youve really got anything to say youve got to draw on a language that can stand the strain  wenn haber man kann nicht meinem rede verstehen so werde ich ihm später dasselbe uebersetz wenn er solche dienst verlangen wollen haben werden sollen sein hätte i dont know what wollen haben werden sollen sein hätte means but i notice they always put it at the end of a german sentencemerely for general literary gorgeousness i suppose  this is a great and justly honored daya day which is worthy of the veneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and nationalitiesa day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and speech und meinem freundeno meinen freundenmeines

can the terse german tongue rise to the expression of this impulse is it freundschaftsbezeigungenstadtverordnetenversammlungenfamilieneigenthümlichkeiten nein o nein this is a crisp and noble word but it fails to pierce the marrow of the impulse which has gathered this friendly meeting and produced diese anblickeine anblich welche ist gut zu sehengut fuer die augen in a foreign land and a far countryeine anblick solche als in die gewöhnliche heidelberger phrase nennt man ein schönes aussicht ja freilich natürlich wahrscheinlich ebensowohl also die aussicht auf dem koenigsstuhl mehr grösser ist aber geistlische sprechend nicht so schön lob gott because sie sind hier zusammengetroffen in bruderlichem concord ein grossen tag zu feirn whose high benefits were not for one land and one locality but have conferred a measure of good upon all lands that know liberty today and love it hundert jahre vorueber waren die engländer und die amerikaner feinde aber heut sind sie herzlichen freunde gott sei dank may this goodfellowship endure may these banners here blended in amity so remain may they never any more wave over opposing hosts or be stained with blood which was kindred is kindred and always will be kindred until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to say this bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins of the descendant   appendix e  legend of the castles called the swallows nest and the brothers as condensed from the captains tale  in the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the swallows nest and the larger castle between it and neckarsteinach were owned and occupied by two old knights who were twin brothers and bachelors they had no relatives they were very rich they had fought through the wars and retired to private lifecovered with honorable scars they were honest honorable men in their dealings but the people had given them a couple of nicknames which were very suggestiveherr givenaught and herr heartless the old knights were so proud of these names that if a burgher called them by their right ones they would correct them  the most renowned scholar in europe at the time was the herr doctor franz reikmann who lived in heidelberg all germany was proud of the venerable scholar who lived in the simplest way for great scholars are always poor he was poor as to money but very rich in his sweet young daughter hildegarde and his library he had been all his life collecting his library book and book and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded gold he said the two strings of his heart were rooted the one in his daughter the other in his books and that if either were severed he must die now in an evil hour hoping to win a marriage portion for his child this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper to be ventured in a glittering speculation but that was not the worst of it he signed a paperwithout reading it that is the way with poets and scholars they always sign without reading this cunning paper made him responsible for heaps of things the rest was that one night he found himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of goldan amount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it it was a night of woe in that house  i must part with my libraryi have nothing else so perishes one heartstring said the old man  what will it bring father asked the girl  nothing it is worth seven hundred pieces of gold but by auction it will go for little or nothing  then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of your life to no purpose since so mighty a burden of debt will remain behind  there is no help for it my child our darlings must pass under the hammer we must pay what we can  my father i have a feeling that the dear virgin will come to our help let us not lose heart  she cannot devise a miracle that will turn nothing into eight thousand gold pieces and lesser help will bring us little peace  she can do even greater things my father she will save us i know she will  toward morning while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair where he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his beloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the aftertime of empty desolation his daughter sprang into the room and gently woke him saying  my presentiment was true she will save us three times has she appeared to me in my dreams and said go to the herr givenaught go to the herr heartless ask them to come and bid there did i not tell you she would save us the thrice blessed virgin  sad as the old man was he was obliged to laugh  thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as to the harder ones that lie in those mens breasts my child they bid on books writ in the learned tonguesthey can scarce read their own  but hildegardes faith was in no wise shaken bright and early she was on her way up the neckar road as joyous as a bird  meantime herr givenaught and herr heartless were having an early breakfast in the formers castlethe sparrows nestand flavoring it with a quarrel for although these twins bore a love for each other which almost amounted to worship there was one subject upon which they could not touch without calling each other hard namesand yet it was the subject which they oftenest touched upon  i tell you said givenaught you will beggar yourself yet with your insane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor and worthy objects all these years i have implored you to stop this foolish custom and husband your means but all in vain you are always lying to me about these secret benevolences but you never have managed to deceive me yet every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet i have detected your hand in itincorrigible ass  every time you didnt set him on his feet yourself you mean where i give one unfortunate a little private lift you do the same for a dozen the idea of your swelling around the country and petting yourself with the nickname of givenaughtintolerable humbug before i would be such a fraud as that i would cut my right hand off your life is a continual lie but go on i have tried my best to save you from beggaring yourself by your riotous charitiesnow for the thousandth time i wash my hands of the consequences a maundering old fool thats what you are  and you a blethering old idiot roared givenaught springing up  i wont stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to call me such names mannerless swine  so saying herr heartless sprang up in a passion but some lucky accident intervened as usual to change the subject and the daily quarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation the grayheaded old eccentrics parted and herr heartless walked off to his own castle  half an hour later hildegarde was standing in the presence of herr givenaught he heard her story and said  i am sorry for you my child but i am very poor i care nothing for bookish rubbish i shall not be there  he said the hard words kindly but they nearly broke poor hildegardes heart nevertheless when she was gone the old heartbreaker muttered rubbing his hands  it was a good stroke i have saved my brothers pocket this time in spite of him nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to rescue the old scholar the pride of germany from his trouble the poor child wont venture near him after the rebuff she has received from his brother the givenaught  but he was mistaken the virgin had commanded and hildegarde would obey she went to herr heartless and told her story but he said coldly  i am very poor my child and books are nothing to me i wish you well but i shall not come  when hildegarde was gone he chuckled and said  how my fool of a softheaded softhearted brother would rage if he knew how cunningly i have saved his pocket how he would have flown to the old mans rescue but the girl wont venture near him now  when hildegarde reached home her father asked her how she had prospered she said  the virgin has promised and she will keep her word but not in the way i thought she knows her own ways and they are best  the old man patted her on the head and smiled a doubting smile but he honored her for her brave faith nevertheless  ii  next day the people assembled in the great hall of the ritter tavern to witness the auctionfor the proprietor had said the treasure of germanys most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place hildegarde and her father sat close to the books silent and sorrowful and holding each others hands there was a great crowd of people present the bidding began  how much for this precious library just as it stands all complete called the auctioneer  fifty pieces of gold  a hundred  two hundred  three  four  five hundred  five twentyfive  a brief pause  five forty  a longer pause while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions  fivefortyfive  a heavy dragthe auctioneer persuaded pleaded imploredit was useless everybody remained silent  well thengoing goingonetwo  five hundred and fifty  this in a shrill voice from a bent old man all hung with rags and with a green patch over his left eye everybody in his vicinity turned and gazed at him it was givenaught in disguise he was using a disguised voice too  good cried the auctioneer going goingonetwo  five hundred and sixty  this in a deep harsh voice from the midst of the crowd at the other end of the room the people near by turned and saw an old man in a strange costume supporting himself on crutches he wore a long white beard and blue spectacles it was herr heartless in disguise and using a disguised voice  good again going goingone  six hundred  sensation the crowd raised a cheer and some one cried out go it greenpatch this tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted go it greenpatch  goinggoinggoingthird and last callonetwo  seven hundred  huzzahwell done crutches cried a voice the crowd took it up and shouted altogether well done crutches  splendid gentlemen you are doing magnificently going going  a thousand  three cheers for greenpatch up and at him crutches  goinggoing  two thousand  and while the people cheered and shouted crutches muttered who can this devil be that is fighting so to get these useless booksbut no matter he shant have them the pride of germany shall have his books if it beggars me to buy them for him  going going going  three thousand  come everybodygive a rouser for greenpatch  and while they did it greenpatch muttered this cripple is plainly a lunatic but the old scholar shall have his books nevertheless though my pocket sweat for it  goinggoing  four thousand  huzza  five thousand  huzza  six thousand  huzza  seven thousand  huzza  eight thousand  we are saved father i told you the holy virgin would keep her word blessed be her sacred name said the old scholar with emotion the crowd roared huzza huzza huzzaat him again greenpatch  goinggoing  ten thousand as givenaught shouted this his excitement was so great that he forgot himself and used his natural voice his brother recognized it and muttered under cover of the storm of cheers  aha you are there are you besotted old fool take the books i know what youll do with them  so saying he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end givenaught shouldered his way to hildegarde whispered a word in her ear and then he also vanished the old scholar and his daughter embraced and the former said truly the holy mother has done more than she promised child for she has given you a splendid marriage portionthink of it two thousand pieces of gold  and more still cried hildegarde for she has given you back your books the stranger whispered me that he would none of themthe honored son of germany must keep them so he said i would i might have asked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing but he was our ladys angel and it is not meet that we of earth should venture speech with them that dwell above   appendix f  german journals the daily journals of hamburg frankfort baden munich and augsburg are all constructed on the same general plan i speak of these because i am more familiar with them than with any other german papers they contain no editorials whatever no personalsand this is rather a merit than a demerit perhaps no funnyparagraph column no policecourt reports no reports of proceedings of higher courts no information about prizefights or other dogfights horseraces walkingmachines yachtingcontents riflematches or other sporting matters of any sort no reports of banquet speeches no department of curious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip no rumors about anything or anybody no prognostications or prophecies about anything or anybody no lists of patents granted or sought or any reference to such things no abuse of public officials big or little or complaints against them or praises of them no religious columns saturdays no rehash of cold sermons mondays no weather indications no local item unveiling of what is happening in townnothing of a local nature indeed is mentioned beyond the movements of some prince or the proposed meeting of some deliberative body  after so formidable a list of what one cant find in a german daily the question may well be asked what can be found in it it is easily answered a childs handful of telegrams mainly about european national and international political movements lettercorrespondence about the same things market reports there you have it that is what a german daily is made of a german daily is the slowest and saddest and dreariest of the inventions of man our own dailies infuriate the reader pretty often the german daily only stupefies him once a week the german daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy columnsthat is it thinks it lightens them upwith a profound an abysmal book criticism a criticism which carries you down down down into the scientific bowels of the subjectfor the german critic is nothing if not scientificand when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see the bonny daylight once more you resolve without a dissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up a german daily sometimes in place of the criticism the firstclass daily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essayabout ancient grecian funeral customs or the ancient egyptian method of tarring a mummy or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the flood did not approve of cats these are not unpleasant subjects they are not uninteresting subjects they are even exciting subjectsuntil one of these massive scientists gets hold of them he soon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way as to make a person lowspirited  as i have said the average german daily is made up solely of correspondencesa trifle of it by telegraph the rest of it by mail every paragraph has the sidehead london vienna or some other town and a date and always before the name of the town is placed a letter or a sign to indicate who the correspondent is so that the authorities can find him when they want to hang him stars crosses triangles squares halfmoons sunssuch are some of the signs used by correspondents  some of the dailies move too fast others too slowly for instance my heidelberg daily was always twentyfour hours old when it arrived at the hotel but one of my munich evening papers used to come a full twentyfour hours before it was due  some of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a continued story every day it is strung across the bottom of the page in the french fashion by subscribing for the paper for five years i judge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story  if you ask a citizen of munich which is the best munich daily journal he will always tell you that there is only one good munich daily and that it is published in augsburg forty or fifty miles away it is like saying that the best daily paper in new york is published out in new jersey somewhere yes the augsburg allgemeine zeitung is the best munich paper and it is the one i had in my mind when i was describing a firstclass german daily above the entire paper opened out is not quite as large as a single page of the new york herald it is printed on both sides of course but in such large type that its entire contents could be put in herald type upon a single page of the heraldand there would still be room enough on the page for the zeitungs supplement and some portion of the zeitungs next days contents  such is the firstclass daily the dailies actually printed in munich are all called secondclass by the public if you ask which is the best of these secondclass papers they say there is no difference one is as good as another i have preserved a copy of one of them it is called the mÜnchener tagesanzeiger and bears date january 25 1879 comparisons are odious but they need not be malicious and without any malice i wish to compare this journal published in a german city of 170000 inhabitants with journals of other countries i know of no other way to enable the reader to size the thing  a column of an average daily paper in america contains from 1800 to 2500 words the readingmatter in a single issue consists of from 25000 to 50000 words the readingmatter in my copy of the munich journal consists of a total of 1654 words for i counted them that would be nearly a column of one of our dailies a single issue of the bulkiest daily newspaper in the worldthe london timesoften contains 100000 words of readingmatter considering that the daily anzeiger issues the usual twentysix numbers per month the reading matter in a single number of the london times would keep it in copy two months and a half  the anzeiger is an eightpage paper its page is one inch wider and one inch longer than a foolscap page that is to say the dimensions of its page are somewhere between those of a schoolboys slate and a ladys pocket handkerchief onefourth of the first page is taken up with the heading of the journal this gives it a rather topheavy appearance the rest of the first page is readingmatter all of the second page is readingmatter the other six pages are devoted to advertisements  the readingmatter is compressed into two hundred and five smallpica lines and is lighted up with eight pica headlines the bill of fare is as follows first under a pica headline to enforce attention and respect is a fourline sermon urging mankind to remember that although they are pilgrims here below they are yet heirs of heaven and that when they depart from earth they soar to heaven perhaps a fourline sermon in a saturday paper is the sufficient german equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the newyorkers get in their monday morning papers the latest news two days old follows the fourline sermon under the pica headline telegramsthese are telegraphed with a pair of scissors out of the augsburger zeitung of the day before these telegrams consist of fourteen and twothirds lines from berlin fifteen lines from vienna and two and fiveeights lines from calcutta thirtythree smallpica lines of telegraphic news in a daily journal in a kings capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an overdose next we have the pica heading news of the day under which the following facts are set forth prince leopold is going on a visit to vienna six lines prince arnulph is coming back from russia two lines the landtag will meet at ten oclock in the morning and consider an election law three lines and one word over a city government item five and onehalf lines prices of tickets to the proposed grand charity ball twentythree linesfor this one item occupies almost onefourth of the entire first page there is to be a wonderful wagner concert in frankfurtonthemain with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments seven and onehalf lines that concludes the first page eightyfive lines altogether on that page including three headlines about fifty of those lines as one perceives deal with local matters so the reporters are not overworked  exactly onehalf of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism fiftythree lines three of them being headlines and death notices ten lines  the other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under the head of miscellaneous news one of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the czar of russia and his eldest son twentyone and a half lines and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents forty lines or onefifth of the total of the readingmatter contained in the paper  consider what a fifth part of the readingmatter of an american daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to think what a mass it is would any one suppose i could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again if the reader lost his place surely not i will translate that childmurder word for word to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the readingmatter of a munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye  from oberkreuzberg january 21st the donau zeitung receives a long account of a crime which we shortened as follows in rametuach a village near eppenschlag lived a young married couple with two children one of which a boy aged five was born three years before the marriage for this reason and also because a relative at iggensbach had bequeathed m400 100 to the boy the heartless father considered him in the way so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the cruelest possible manner they proceeded to starve him slowly to death meantime frightfully maltreating himas the village people now make known when it is too late the boy was shut in a hole and when people passed by he cried and implored them to give him bread his longcontinued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last on the third of january the sudden sic death of the child created suspicion the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier therefore the coroner gave notice and an inquest was held on the 6th what a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then the body was a complete skeleton the stomach and intestines were utterly empty they contained nothing whatsoever the flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood there was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body wounds scars bruises discolored extravasated blood everywhereeven on the soles of the feet there were wounds the cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck however they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at deggendorf  yes they were arrested two weeks after the inquest what a home sound that has that kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my native land than german journalism does  i think a german daily journal doesnt do any good to speak of but at the same time it doesnt do any harm that is a very large merit and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of  the german humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper and the illustrations are finely drawn finely engraved and are not vapidly funny but deliciously so so also generally speaking are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures i remember one of these pictures a most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm he says well begging is getting played out only about five marks 125 for the whole day many an official makes more and i call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples  merchant pettishlyno dont i dont want to buy anything  drummerif you please i was only going to show you  merchantbut i dont wish to see them  drummer after a pause pleadinglybut do you you mind letting me look at them i havent seen them for three weeks
