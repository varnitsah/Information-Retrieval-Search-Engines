52438375	digging for gold by rm ballantyne    chapter one  adventures in california  begins with differences of opinion  if ever there was a man in this world who was passionately fond of painting and cut out for a painter that man was frank allfrey but fate in the form of an old uncle had decided that frank should not follow the bent of his inclinations  we introduce our hero to the reader at the interesting age of eighteen but long before that period of life he had shown the powerful leaning of his spirit  all his schoolbooks were covered with heads of dogs horses and portraits of his companions  most of his storybooks were illustrated with coloured engravings the colouring of which had been the work of his busy hand and the walls of his nursery were decorated with cartoons done in charcoal which partial friends of the family sometimes declared were worthy of raphael  at the age of thirteen his unclefor the poor fellow was an orphan asked him one day what he would like to be  this was an extraordinary condescension on the part of mr allfrey senior who was a grim hardfeatured man with little or no soul to speak of and with an enormously large illfavoured body  the boy although taken by surprisefor his uncle seldom addressed him on any subjectanswered promptly id like to be an artist sir  a what  an artist  get along you goose  this was all that was said at the time and as it is the only conversation which is certainly known to have taken place between the uncle and nephew during the early youth of the latter we have ventured at the risk of being tedious to give the whole of it  frank was one of those unfortunates who are styled neglected boys  he was naturally sharpwitted active in mind and body goodtempered and well disposed but disinclined to study and fond of physical exertion he might have been a great man had he been looked after in youth but no one looked after him  he was an infant when his father and mother died and left him to the care of his uncle who cared not for him but left him to care for himself having as he conceived done his duty towards him when he had supplied him with food clothing and lodging and paid his school fees  no blame therefore to poor frank that he grew up a halfeducated youth without fixed habits of study or thought and with little capacity for close or prolonged mental exertion  mr allfrey entertained the ridiculous idea that there were only three grand objects of ambition in life namely to work to eat and drink and to sleep  at least if he did not say in definite terms that such was his belief he undoubtedly acted as though it were  his mind appeared to revolve in a sort of small circle  he worked in order that he might eat and drink he ate and drank that he might be strengthened for work and he slept in order to recruit his energies that he might be enabled to work for the purposes of eating and drinking  he was a species of selfblinded humanhorse that walked the everlasting round of a businessmill of his own creating  it is almost unnecessary to add that he was selfish to the backbone and that the only individual who did not see the fact was himself  when frank reached the age of eighteen mr allfrey called him into his private studyso called because he was in the habit of retiring regularly at fixed periods every day to study nothing thereand having bidden him sit down accosted him thus  well boy have you thought over what i said to you yesterday about fixing upon some profession  you are aware that you cannot expect to lead a life of idleness in this world  i know that you are fit for nothing but fit or not fit you must take to something without delay  frank felt a sensation of indignation at being spoken to thus rudely and in his heart he believed that if he was indeed fit for nothing his sad condition was due much more to his uncles neglect than to his own perversity  he did not however give utterance to the thought because he was of a respectful nature he merely flushed and saidreally uncle you do me injustice  i may not be fit for much and every day i live i feel bitterly the evil of a neglected education but  its well at all events interrupted mr allfrey that you admit the fact of your having neglected it  that gives you some chance of amendment  frank flushed again and drew his breath shortly after a moments silence he went on  but if i am not fit for much i am certainly fit for something  i have only a smattering of latin and greek it is true and a very slight knowledge of french but if i am to believe my teachers reports i am not a bad arithmetician and i know a good deal of mathematics besides being a pretty fair penman  humph well but you know you have said that you dont want to enter a mercantile or engineers office and a smattering of latin and greek will not do for the learned professions  what therefore do you propose to yourself the army eh it is the only opening left because you are now too old for the navy  i wish to be an artist said frank with some firmness  i thought so the old story  no sir you shall never be an artistat least not with my consent  why do you suppose that because you can scribble caricatures on the flyleaves of your books you have necessarily the genius of rubens or titian  not quite replied frank smiling in spite of himself at the irascibility of the old gentleman and yet i presume that rubens and titian began to paint before either themselves or others were aware of the fact that they possessed any genius at all  tut tut cried mr allfrey impatiently but what have you ever done boy to show your ability to paint  i have studied much uncle said frank eagerly although i have said little to you about the matter knowing your objection to it but if you would condescend to look at a few of my drawings from nature i think  drawing from nature cried mr allfrey with a look of supreme contempt what do i care for nature  what have you to do with nature in this nineteenth century  nature sir is only fit for savages  there is nothing natural nowadays  why what do you suppose would become of my ledger and cashbook my office and business if i and my clerks raved about nature as you do  a fig for naturethe less you study it the better  i never do  excuse me sir said frank respectfully if i refuse to believe you because i have heard you frequently express to friends your admiration of the view from your own drawingroom window  of course you have you goose and you ought to have known that that was a mere bit of conventional humbug because since one is constrained unavoidably to live in a world full of monstrous contradictions it is necessary to fall in with its habits  you ought to know that it is customary to express admiration for a fine view  you spoke as if you felt what you said replied frank and i am certain that there are thousands of men in the position of yourself and your clerks who delight in nature in all her varied aspects who because they unfortunately see so little of her in town make it their ambition to have cottages in the country when they can afford it and many of whom decorate their walls with representations of nature  frank said mr allfrey somewhat solemnly as he turned his gaze full on the animated face of his nephew if i could get you put into a lunatic asylum without a doctors certificate i would do so without delay but that being impossible just nowalthough i think it will be not only possible but necessary ere longi have to make you a final proposal  it is thisthat as you express such a powerful objection to enter an office in this country you should go abroad and see whether a threelegged stool is more attractive in foreign parts than it is in england  now i happen to have a friend in california  if your geography has not been neglected as much as your latin you will remember that this country lies on the western seaboard of north america not far from those goldfields which have been recently turning the world upsidedown  will you go  i shall be delighted to go said frank with enthusiasm  eh exclaimed mr allfrey with a look of surprise as if he could not understand the readiness with which his nephew agreed to the proposal why hows this  i had fully expected you to refuse  remember boy it is not to be a romantic golddigger which is another name for a born idiot that i would send you out to california  it is to be a clerk a quilldriver  dyou understand  i understand uncle perfectly replied frank with a smile  the fact is that i had made up my mind lately not to oppose your wishes any longer but to agree to go into an office at home  of course it is more agreeable to me to think of going into one abroad  im glad you take such a sensible view of the matter frank said mr allfrey much mollified  besides continued frank i have read a good deal about that country of late and the descriptions of the magnificence of the scenery have made me long to have an opportunity of painting it and  he paused abruptly and started up for his uncle had seized a book which usually lay open on his desk and was in fact a sort of dummy intended to indicate the study that was supposed to go on there  next moment frank sprang laughing into the passage and the book flew with a crash against the panels of the door as he shut it behind him leaving mr allfrey to solace himself with a large meerschaum almost the only unfailing friend that he possessed  thus it came to pass that frank allfrey went out to the gold regions of california    chapter two  frank discusses his prospects with a friend  we pass over our heros long voyage round the horn and introduce him in a totally new scene and under widely different circumstancesseated near a magnificent tree of which he is making a study and clad in a white linen coat and pantaloons and a broadbrimmed straw hat  just the day before the house to which he had been sent had failed two years had he spent in grinding at its account books perched on a threelegged stool and now he found himself suddenly cast loose on the world  of course when the stool was knocked from under him his salary was stopped and he was told by his employers that it would be necessary for him to go elsewhere to earn a subsistence  this was rather a startling piece of advice and for a time frank felt much depressed but on returning to his lodgings the day he received his dismissal his eye fell on his palette and brushes which he at once seized and hastening out to his favourite tree was soon so thoroughly absorbed in the study of nature that his sorrows vanished like morning mist  after three hours steady work he arose refreshed in soul and comforted  thereafter he returned to his lodgings and sat down to think over his prospects  his cogitations were temporarily interrupted and afterwards materially assisted by a short thickset man of about thirty years of age who entered with a deferential air and pulled his forelock  come in joe  i was just thinking over my future plans and i daresay you can assist me being i suppose in the same fix with myself  joe graddy had been a porter in the house which had failed and was indeed in the same fix as frank said with himself  ive comed sir said joe to ax yer advice an to offer ye my sarvice it its of any use said the porter who was a shrewd straightforward man and had originally been a sailor  if you had come to offer me advice and ask my services said frank i would have been better pleased to see you  however sit down and let me hear what you have to say  well sir said joe this is wot ive got for to say that we are in what the yankees call a pretty considerable fix  i know it joe but how do you think we are to get out of the fix  thats just wot i comed for to ax said the man and when youve told me how ill lend a hand to weigh anchor an set sail  the fact is im in want of a place and im willing to engage with you sir  frank allfrey experienced a strange mingling of feelings when he heard this  of course he felt much gratified by the fact that a man so grave and sensible as joe graddy should come and deferentially offer to become his servant at a time when he possessed nothing but the remnant of a months salary and when he considered his own youth he felt amazed that one so old and manly should volunteer to place himself under his orders  the fact is that frank was not aware that his straightforward earnest manner had commended him very strongly to those with whom he had lately come in contact  he was one of those attractive men whose countenances express exactly what they feel who usually walk with a quick earnest step if we may say so and with a somewhat downcast contemplative look  frank knew well enough that he was strong and tall unusually so for his age and therefore did not continually assert the fact by walking as if he was afraid to fall forward which is a common practice among men who wish to look bigger than they are  besides being an ardent student of nature frank was himself natural as well as amiable and these qualities had endeared him to many people without his being aware of it  why joe he exclaimed what do you mean  i mean wot i says sir  are you aware said frank smiling that i do not possess a shilling beyond the few dollars that i saved off my last months salary  i sposed as much sir  then if you engage with me as you express it how do you expect to be paid  i dont expect to be paid sir  come joe explain your meaning for i dont pretend to be a diviner of mens thoughts  well sir this is how it is  wen we got the sack the other day says i to myself says i now youre afloat on the world without rudder compass or charts but youve got a tight craft of your ownsomewhat scrubbed no doubt with rough usage but soundso its time for you to look out for rudder compass and charts and it seems to me that thems to be found with young mister allfrey so youd better go an git him to become skipper o your ship without delay  you see sir havin said that to myself ive took my own advice so if youll take command of me sir you may steer me where you please for im ready to be your sarvant for love seein that you hant got no money  most obliging of you said frank laughing and by this offer i understand that you wish to become my companion  of coorse in a country o this kind replied graddy its difficulti might amost say unpossibleto be a mans sarvant without bein his companion likewise  but here is a great difficulty at the outset joe  i have not yet made up my mind what course to pursue  just so sir said the exseaman with a look of satisfaction i knowd you wouldnt be doin that in a hurry so ive comed to have a talk with e about it  very good sit down said frank and let us consider it  in the first place i regret to say that i have not been taught any trade so that i cannot become a blacksmith or a carpenter or anything of that sort  a clerks duties i can undertake but it seems to me that clerks are not much wanted here just now  porterage is heavy work and rather slow  i may be reduced to that if nothing better turns up but it has occurred to me that i might try painting with success  what would you say to that joe  the man looked at frank in surprise  well said he people dont look as if they wanted to paint their houses here an most of ems got no houses  why man i dont mean housepainting  it is portrait and landscape painting that i refer to said frank laughing  joe shook his head gravely  never do mr frank  stop if you and i are to be companions in trouble you must not call me mister frank you must drop the mister  then i wont go with e sir thats all about it said joe firmly  very well please yourself said frank with a laugh but if painting is so hopeless what would you advise  the diggins answered joe  i thought so said frank shaking his head  most men out of work rush to the diggings  indeed many men are fools enough to leave their work to go there but i confess that i dont like the notion  it has always appeared to me such a pitiful thing to see men who are fit for better things go grubbing in the mud for gold  but what are men to do mr frank wen they cant git no other work  of course it is better to dig than to idle or starve or be a burden on ones friends nevertheless i dont like the notion of it  i suppose however that i must try it just now for it is quite certain that we cannot exist here without gold  by the way joe have you got any more  not a rap sir  hm then i doubt whether i have enough to buy tools not to speak of provisions  ive bin thinkin about that sir said joe and it seems to me that our only chance lie in settin up a grog and provision store  a grog and provision store  yes sir the fact is that i had laid in a stock of pipes and baccy tea and brandy for winters use this year  now as things have turned out i shant want these just at this minute so we can sell em off to the diggers at a large profit  we might make a good thing of it sir for youve no notion wot prices theyll give for things on the road to the diggins  frank here interrupted his friend with a hearty laugh and at the same time declared that he would have nothing to do with the grog and provision store that he would rather take to porterage than engage in any such enterprise  well then sir we wont say no more about that but wot coorse would ye advise the ships head to be laid  frank was silent for a few minutes as he sat with downcast eyes absorbed in meditation  then he looked up suddenly and said joe ill give you a definite answer to that question tomorrow morning tonight i will think over it and make arrangements  meanwhile let it suffice that i have made up my mind to go to the diggings and if you remain in the same mind tomorrow come here all ready for a start  the ruddy countenance of the sturdy exporter beamed with gratification as he rose and took his leave of frank who heard him as he walked away making sundry allusions in nautical phraseology to having his anchor tripped at last and the sails shook out all ready for a start with the first o the floodtide in the morning    chapter three  a visit to the diggings resolved on  terrible commencement of the journey  when next morning arrived joe graddy true to his word appeared with the firstif not of the floodtide at least of the morning sun and frank told him that on the previous evening he had made arrangements to go to the diggings in company with a party that was to start the following day that he had already made purchases of the few things which they would require on the journey and that the only thing remaining to be done was to pack up  now joe you must go at once to the principal guide and make arrangements with him as to that brandy and tea on which you expect to found your future fortunes  i told him to expect a visit from you early in the day  wotiver you do do it at once said joe putting on his straw hat with an energetic slap  thats one of my mottos  ill go an carry it into practice  the following day saw frank and his man set forth with a party of about thirty men all of whom were clad in blue or red flannel shirts straw hats big boots and other rough garments with rifles on their shoulders and bowieknives and pistols in their belts  these were men of various nations californians chinamen malays americans scotch and english and many of them looked not only rough but savage  in truth they were as diverse in their characters as in their appearance some of them being men who had evidently moved in good society while others were as evidently of the lowestprobably the convictclass they had all however been thrown together by the force of a common interest  all were bound for the goldmines and it was necessary that they should travel in company for mutual protection and assistance  there were two guides who had charge of ten packmules loaded with provisions for the storekeepers at some remote diggings  these guides were stern powerful bronzed fellows who had to make their way among rough men in difficult circumstances and they seemed to be quite prepared to do so being fearless resolute and armed to the teeth  joe graddy had obtained permission on promise of payment to place his little fortune on the backs of the mules so that he and frank had nothing to carry save their weapons and blankets besides a tin cup each at their girdles and a waterbag  come i like this sort of thing said one of the party an englishman when the order was given to start  if it is all like this it will be uncommonly jolly  i guess it aint all like this stranger said one of the americans with a goodhumoured grin  one of the guides laughed and the other ejaculated humph as they set forward  there was indeed some ground for the remark of the englishman for the country through which they passed was most beautiful and the weather delicious  their track lay over an undulating region of parklike land covered with short grass clumps of bushes were scattered here and there about the plain and high above these towered some magnificent specimens of the oak sycamore and californian cypress while in the extreme distance rose the ranges of the golden mountainsthe sierra nevada in the midst of which lay the treasures of which they were in search  all the members of the party were on foot and being fresh full of hope and eager to reach their destination  they chatted gaily as they marched over the prairie  on the way the goodhumoured american seemed to take a fancy to frank with whom he had a great deal of animated conversation  after asking our hero every possible question in regard to himself and intentions he told him that he was yankeea piece of superfluous information by the waythat his name was jeffson that he was a storekeeper at one of the farthest off diggings that the chief part of the loading of one of the mules belonged to him and that he was driving a considerable business in golddust without the trouble of digging for it  towards evening they came to a very small hole in the plain which was dignified with the name of a well  here they stopped to replenish their watercasks  take as much as you can carry men said the principal guide weve a long march to the next well over sandy ground and sometimes there aint much water in it  they all followed this advice with the exception of one man a coarse savagelooking fellow with a huge black beard and matted locks who called himself bradling though there was ground for doubting whether that was the name by which he had been at first known in the world this man pulled out an enormous brandyflask and with a scoffing laugh said  this is the water for me mister guide pure and unmixed theres nothin like it  he nodded as he spoke and put the flask to his lips while the guide who made no rejoinder eyed him with a grave stern expression of countenance  that night they all encamped under the shade of a small clump of trees kindled several large fires and heartily glad to be relieved of their backburdens sat down to enjoy supper  after it was over pipes were smoked and stories told until it was time to retire to rest  then each man lay down under his blanket the sky being his canopy and the howling of the wolves his lullaby  it seemed to each sleeper when awakened next morning that he had only just closed his eyes so sound had been his repose and there was a great deal of violent yawning stretching grumbling and winking before the whole party was finally aroused and ready to set forth  however they got under way at last and early in the forenoon came to the edge of a sandy plain which appeared to be interminable with scarcely a blade of grass on it  here they halted for a few minutes  how wide is the plain guide inquired frank  forty miles replied the man and theres not a drop of water to be had till the end of the first twenty  well get there about sundown and replenish our kegs if its not all gone dry  let me warn you however to use the water you have sparingly  do we encamp at the end o the first twenty asked jeffson  yes youll find it a long enough days march  no one made any reply but by their looks they appeared to think nothing of a twentymile walk  they found however that such a distance traversed over loose sand ankledeep and under a burning sun was not what any of them had been accustomed to  on entering the plain they observed that the heat had opened cracks and fissures in the earth which omitted a fiery heat  at intervals pyramids of sand arose which were borne with great velocity through the air sometimes appearing in the shape of columns sixty feet high which moved majestically over the plain  ere long some of these clouds of sand enveloped them and they were accompanied by hot winds which seemed to shrivel up not only the skin but the very vitals of the travellers  the pores of their skin closed producing feverish heat in the blood and terrible thirst while their eyes became inflamed by the dazzling glare of the sun on the white sand  of course most of the party applied pretty frequently to their waterkegs and bottles  even bradling gave up his brandy and was content to refresh himself with the little of the pure element which chanced to remain in his formerly despised but now cherished waterbottle  the guides carried skins of water for themselves and the mules but these they opened very seldom knowing full well the torments that would ensue if they should run short before getting across the scorching desert  thus they went on hour after hour becoming more and more oppressed at every step  the improvident among them drank up the precious water too fast and towards evening began to sigh for relief and to regard with longing eyes the supplies of their more selfdenying companions  they consoled themselves however to some extent with thoughts of the deep draughts they hoped to obtain at night  our hero and joe were among those who reserved their supplies  as night approached the thirst of the travellers increased to a terrible extent insomuch that they appeared to forget their fatigue and hurried forward at a smart pace in the eager hope of coming to the promised waterhole  great therefore was their dismay when the guides told them that it was impossible to reach the place that night that the mules were too much knocked up but that they would get to it early on the following day  they said little however seeming to be too much depressed to express their disappointment in words but their haggard looks were fearfully eloquent  some of those who had wasted their supplies earnestly implored their more prudent comrades to give them a little a very little of the precious element and two or three were generous enough to give away a few drops of the little that still remained to them  the place where they had halted was without a scrap of vegetation and as there was no wood wherewith to kindle a fire they were compelled to encamp without one  to most of the travellers however this was a matter of little importance because they were too much exhausted to eat  those who had water drank a mouthful sparingly and then lay down to sleep  those who had none also lay down in gloomy silence  they did not even indulge in the usual solace of a pipe for fear of adding to the burning thirst with which they were consumed  at daybreak they were aroused by the guides and rose with alacrity feeling a little refreshed and being anxious to push on to the waterhole but when the sun rose and sent its dazzling rays over the dreary waste giving promise of another dreadful day their spirits sank again  seeing this the principal guide encouraged them by saying that the waterhole was not more than three miles distant  onward they pushed with renewed energy and hope  at last they reached the place and found that the hole was dry  with consternation depicted on their haggard countenances the men looked at the guide  dig men dig he said with a troubled look on his bronzed face there may be a little below the surface  they did dig with shovels spades knives sticks hands anything and they dug as never men did for gold  all the gold in california would they have given at that time for a cupful of cold water but all the gold in the world could not have purchased one drop from the parched sand  never was despair more awfully pictured on mens faces as they gazed at one another after finding that their efforts were unavailing their case was truly pitiable and they turned to the guide as if they expected commiseration but the case had become too desperate for him to think of others  in a stern hard voice he cried  onwards men onwards  the nearest stream is forty miles off  none of those who have water can spare a drop and death lies in delay  every man for himself now  onward men for your lives  saying this he applied the whip to the poor mules which with glazed eyes and hanging ears snorted with agony and dropped down frequently as they went along but a sharp thrust of the goad forced them to rise again and stumble forward  god help the poor wretches murmured joe graddy to frank as they staggered along side by side  is our supply nearly outcould we not give them a drop  frank stopped suddenly and with desperate energy seized the keg which hung over his shoulder and shook it close to the ear of his companion  listen he said can we afford to spare any with forty miles of the desert before us  it is our life we must guard it  graddy shook his head and admitting that the thing was out of the question went silently forward  it was all that frank himself could do to refrain from drinking the little that remained for his very vitals seemed on fire  indeed in this respect he suffered more than some of his companions for while those of them who had not charge of the waterkegs and bottles experienced the pain of suffering and hopeless longing he himself had the additional misery of having to resist temptation for at any moment he could have obtained temporary relief by gratifying his desires at the expense of his companions  overpowered with heat and burnt up with thirst those without water to moisten their parched lips and throats could scarcely keep pace with the guide  by degrees they threw away their possessionstheir blankets their clothesuntil the plain behind was strewn with them  dont go so fast groaned one  wont ye halt a while said another uttering a cursethen suddenly changing his tone he implored them to halt  we cannot halt  it is death to halt said the guide in a tone so resolute and callous that those who were enfeebled lost heart altogether and began to lag behind  at that time the man bradling who had become nearly mad with drinking brandy ran in succession to each of those who had water and offered all that he possessed of the former for one mouthful of the latter  his flushed face glassy eyes and haggard air told how terrible was his extremity but although some might have felt a touch of commiseration not one was moved to relieve him  the law of selfpreservation had turned the hearts of all to stone  yet not quite to stone for there were one or two among them who although nothing would induce them to give a single drop to a comrade were content to do with less in order that they might relieve a friend  one man in his desperation attempted to lick the bodies of the mules hoping to obtain relief from the exudations of their skins but the dust on them rendered this unavailing  suddenly bradling darted at the waterskin hanging by the side of the guides mule and swore he would have it or die  youll die then observed the guide quietly cocking a pistol and presenting it at his head  bradling hesitated and looked at the man  there was a cold stony stare without the least excitement in his look which convinced him that his attempt if continued would end in certain death  he fell back at once with a deep groan  onward they pressed hour after hour until in many of them exhausted nature began to give way  they became slightly delirious and finding that they could not keep up with the party a few determined if left behind to keep together  among the number was bradling and terrible were the imprecations which he hurled after the more fortunate as they parted  it seemed cruel but to remain with them would have done no good while it would have sacrificed more lives  bradling seemed to regard frank as his chief enemy for he shouted his name as he was moving off praying god to send down the bitterest curses on his head  a sudden impulse moved the heart of frank  he turned back poured about half a wineglassful of water into a tin can and gave it to the unfortunate man who seized and drained it greedily licking the rim of the can and gazing into it to see that not a drop had escaped him with an eagerness of manner that was very painful to behold  god bless you he said to frank with a deep sigh  do you think said frank earnestly that god will curse and bless at your bidding  i dont know and dont care replied the man but i say god bless you  go away and be content with that  frank had already lost too much time  he turned and hastened after the others as fast as possible  they wont last long said the guide harshly as he came up  the wolves or the redskins will soon finish them  you were a fool to waste your water on them  you are a fool to give your opinion to one who neither asks nor cares for it retorted frank  the man took no notice of the reply and frank afterwards felt somewhat ashamed of being so hasty for at night when they encamped the guide advised him in a friendly way to keep a sharp lookout on the water as those who had finished theirs during the day would be not unlikely to make an attack on those who had any left  frank thanked him but being too much fatigued to mount guard he and graddy with his yankee friend jeffson slept together rolled in their blankets with pistols in their hands and the waterbottles attached to them  nothing disturbed them however during the night save the howling of wolves and the imploring cries irritated exclamations and angry discontent of the suffering men which latter sounds were far more terrible than the cries of wild beasts  a little before daybreak some who could not rest sprang up and continued their journey walking at their utmost speed until they sighted the woodland  then indeed did a new sensation of delight fill their souls as they gazed upon the green verdure  even the mules though their eyes were bandaged seemed to know that water was near they snuffed the breeze pricked up their ears and neighed loudly  on reaching the woods and sighting the river a momentary halt was called to cast off the burdens of the mules  this was speedily done and then they all rushedmen and mules togetherdeep into the stream and luxuriated in the cool water  when they had slaked their thirst to the uttermost graddy proposed that a party should be sent back to the relief of those left behind and offered to join it  frank seconded this proposal and the yankee jeffson volunteered to join it  a german named meyer who had borne his sufferings with great fortitude also volunteered as did a scotchman named douglas  you may propose what you please said the guide when he heard them talking but i will not wait for you  why not inquired frank somewhat angrily  because i was not hired for such work  it is my business to push on to the mines and push on i will follow who pleases  bot fat if ve compel you for to stay asked the german with an indignant air  then you will guide yourselves as you best may i will refuse to go a step further  is it fair that i should be hired for a special job and then be asked to turn aside and risk my life for the sake of men who have chosen to throw their own lives away and who are no doubt dead by this time  a number of the travellers applauded this sentiment and it was evident that the philanthropists were very much in the minority but here frank stepped in and turned the scale at least to some extent  men said he raising his clenched fist i know not what your notions of humanity may be or your ideas of justice but this i know that the man who has the power to help a fellowmortal in deadly distress and holds back his hand is worse than a beast for he has reason to guide him and a beast has not  i and my comrade joe graddy at least will remain behind even though we should be left alone but i am convinced that we shall not be left alone  meanwhile he added addressing the guide i shall pay you my share of what is due after which you may go and i shall wish you no worse luck than that your conscience may go with you and be a lively companion  there is more to be said than that observed the yankee at this point you are so very fond of fulfilling your duty mister guide that i have concluded to relieve you of some of it  one of these mules is loaded entirely with my goods  now i guess ill remain behind with mister allfrey and keep the mule at a reasonable valuation  ill not part with him at any price said the guide with a sneer ill carry your goods to the diggings or ill unstrap them stranger and let you carry them the best way you can but im not bound to sell my mules to you  now men cried the yankee springing forward and addressing his comrades i appeal to you all in the name of fairplay  here am i willin to pay this man a fair price for his mule  theres not a pick or shovel belongin to any one else on its back so im doin damage to nobody by the proposal  this critter is bent on refusin me out of spite now i propose to settle the question here with the rifle or pistol or bowieknife  he is welcome to choose his weaponit matters nothin to me and whichever falls loses the day  there was a burst of laughter at this and the majority insisted that the guide should give in while a few who were fond of excitement suggested that the two should be allowed to fight it out but this the guide refused to do and when his comrade the second guide stepped forward and said he would join those who wanted to remain he grumblingly agreed to part with the mule for its full value  the bargain was soon made  the one party continued their journey the other with an abundant supply of water returned to those who had been left behind and reached them in time to save their lives  that night as frank and graddy lay together under the same blanket the latter observed that he had travelled a goodish bit over the univarse but that he had niver before comed across nothin like the experiences of the last two days and that if the end of their diggin for goold woe to be as bad as the begginin the sooner they set about diggin their graves the better  with which sentiment frank allfrey heartily agreed and thereafter fell asleep    chapter four  describes an incident of devouring interest an unexpected visit and a violent assault  next day our goldhunters and the rescued men reached the forest and after resting a short time to recruit continued their journey to the diggings  the particular part towards which their steps were directed was bigbear gully a small and comparatively unknown because recently discovered gorge opening out of the great sacramento valley  on the way they passed through a country the very reverse of that which had so nearly cost them their lives  it was well wooded and watered and abounded with game of various kinds particularly hares deer quails and other creatures shooting these afforded pleasant pastime to the sporting characters of the party and consuming them was enjoyed by all without exception  rance the guide now that he was separated from his comrade turned out to be a capital fellow and during the remainder of the journey did much to make the travellers harmonise  the party now consisted of our hero and joe graddy jeffson the yankee douglas the scot meyer the german and bradling all of whom excepting the last were good and true men  as for bradling no one could make out what he was for at times he was amiable and polite while at other times he was savage and morose  one night the travellers reached a part of the mountains which was densely covered with wood  as there was no moon and it was almost impossible to see a step before them rance called a halt  we must sleep here he said to jeffson  i had half expected to make out bigbear gully tonight but the road is not safe too many precipices and steep parts which require to be passed in daylight  very good rance then we had better set about encamping  tis a drearylooking place said frank allfrey glancing round him  twill look more cheery when the fire is kindled said jeffson  dismal enough to give a man the blues just now anyhow observed joe graddy  this was undoubtedly true  there is perhaps nothing more desolate more cheerless more oppressive to the spirits than the influence of the woods at night  they are so dark so blacklooking and dismal that one is led irresistibly to contrast them with home and its bright fireside and wellremembered facesjust as the starving man is led by his condition to dream of rich feasts  in both cases the result is the same  the dream of food makes the starving mans case more terrible and the thought of home makes the dreariness of the dark wilderness more dismal  but what magic there is in a spark of light  the first burst of flame drives all the sad lonesome feelings away and the blaze of the increasing fire creates positively a homefeeling in the breast  the reason of this is plain enough  before the fire is kindled the eye wanders restlessly through the dim light that may chance to straggle among the trees  the mind follows the eye and gets lost among indistinct objects which it cannot understand  the feelings and the faculties are scatteredfixed upon nothing except perhaps on this that the wanderer is far very far from home  but when the bright glare of the fire springs up everything beyond the circle of light becomes pure black  the thoughts and feelings are confined within that chamber with the ebony walls and are forcibly attracted and made to rest upon the treestems the leaves the flowers and other objects that glow in the ruddy blaze  thus the thoughts are collected and the wanderer feels once more something of the homefeeling  it was not long before our travellers realised this agreeable change the depression of their spirits vanished with the darkness and rose with the leaping flames until some of the members of the party became quite facetious  this was especially the case when supper had been disposed of and the pipes were lighted  it was then that rance became chatty and anecdotal in his tendencies and jeffson told marvellous stories of yankeeland and douglas who devoted himself chiefly to his pipe became an attentive listener and an awkward tripper up of the heels of those who appeared to be drawing the longbow and meyer looked if possible more solid and amiable than at other times and frank enjoyed himself in a general way and made himself generally agreeable while joe graddy became profoundly sententious  even bradlings nature appeared to be softened for he looked less forbidding and grumpy than at other times and once condescended to remark that a life in the woods was not such a bad one after all  not such a bad one cried joe graddy why messmate is that all youve got to say about it  now ill give e my opinion on that head this is where it liessee here  joe removed his pipe from his mouth and held up his forefinger by way of being very impressive ive travelled pretty well now in every quarter of the globe gone right round it in fact and found that it is round after allcause why i went in so to speak at one end from the westard an comed out at the same end from the eastard though i must confess it all appeared to me as flats a pancake always exceptin the mountainous parts of it wich must be admitted to be lumpy  howsever as i wos sayin ive bin amost all over the worldive smoked wi the turks an hobnobbled with john chinaman an scrambled through the jungles of the indies an gone aloft the himalayas  what have you seen the himalayas asked jeffson with a doubtful look  how could i be among em without seein of em replied joe  ah das is gootvair goot said meyer opening his huge mouth very wide to let out a cloud of smoke and a quiet laugh  well but you know said jeffson apologetically a poor fellow livin out here in the wilderness aint just always quite up in the geegraphical changes that take place on the airth  when was it that they cut a ship canal up to the himalayas and in what sort o craft did ye sail there  i didnt go for to say i sailed there at all retorted joe i walked it partly and went part o the way on elephants an horses and went aloft o them there mountains pretty nigh as far up as the maintopmast crosstrees of em ive also slep in the snowhuts of the eskimos an bin tossed about in amost every sort o craft that swims but wot ive got to say is this that of all the things i ever did see travellin in californy beats em all to sticks and stivers  youve got a somewhat indefinite way of stating things observed douglas  dee mean to say that it beats them in a good or a bad way  i means wot i says replied joe with a stern expression of countenance as he relighted his pipe with the burnt end of a piece of stick  i means that it beats em both waysif ye havent got schoolin enough to understand plain english youd better go home again an get your edicashun completed  id do that at once joe if i could only make sure o finding the schoolmaster alive that reared you  ha goot observed the german  him must be von notable krakter  further conversation on this point was cut short by the sudden appearance within the circle of light of an indian who advanced in a halfcrouching attitude as if he feared a bad reception yet could not resist the attraction of the fire  at that time some of the tribes in the neighbourhood of bigbear gully had committed numerous depredations at the diggings and had murdered several white men so that the latter had begun to regard the red men as their natural enemies  indeed some of the more violent among them had vowed that they would treat them as vermin and shoot down every native they chanced to meet whether he belonged to the guilty tribe or not the indian who now approached the campfire of the white men knew that he had good ground to fear the nature of his reception and there is no doubt that it would have been an unpleasant one had it not been for the fact that his appearance was pitiable in the extreme  he was squalid dirty and small and so attenuated that it was evident he had for some time been suffering from starvation  he wore no clothing carried no arms of any kind and was so utterly abject and so evidently incapable of doing harm to any one that none of the party thought it worth while to rise or lay hands on a weapon  when he appeared joe graddy merely pointed to him with the stem of his pipe and said  theres a beauty aint it another of the cooriosities of californy  starvin observed rance  poor wretch exclaimed frank as the man advanced slowly with timid steps while his large sunken eyes absolutely glared at the broken meat which lay scattered about  give him von morsel suggested meyer  give him a bullet in his dirty carcase growled bradling  the indian stopped when within ten paces of the fire and grinned horribly  here stop up your ghastly mouth wi that cried jeffson tossing a lump of saltpork towards him  he caught it with the dexterity of a monkey and squatting down on the trunk of a fallen tree devoured it with the ravenous ferocity of a famishing hyena  the piece of pork would have been a sufficient meal for any ordinary man but it quickly vanished down the throat of the savage who licked his fingers and with eyes which required no tongue to interpret their meaning asked for more  look out cried joe graddy tossing him a sea biscuit as one throws a quoit  the indian caught it deftly crash went his powerful teeth into the hard mass and in an incredibly short time it waswith the pork  the whole party were so highly amused by this that they went in as jeffson said for an evenings entertainment  one tossed the poor man a cut of ham another a slice of pork a third a mass of bread and so they continued to ply him with victuals determined to test his powers to the uttermost  try another bit of pork said douglas laughing as he threw him a cut as large as the first youve finished all the cooked meat now  the indian caught it eagerly and began to devour it as though he had eaten nothing  hes tightening up like a drum observed jeffson handing him a greasy wedge off a raw flitch of bacon  him vill boost said meyer staring at the indian and smoking slowly owing to the strength of his amazement  jack the giant killer was a joke to him muttered graddy  a bottomless pit observed rance referring to his stomach  the indian however proved that rance was wrong by suddenly coming to a dead halt and dropping the last morsel he was in the act of raising to his mouth  he then heaved a deep sigh and looked round on the whole party with a radiant smile which was literally sparkling by reason of the firelight which glittered on his greasy countenance  what stuffed full at last exclaimed jeffson as they all burst into a fit of laughter  ay chock full to the beams said joe graddy moreover hatches battened down topsails shook out anchor up and away  this was indeed the case  having eaten as much as he could hold the poor indian attempted to rise and walk off but he suddenly fell down and rolled about groaning and rubbing himself as if in great agony  the alarmed travellers began to fear that the poor little man had absolutely as joe said eaten himself to death  he recovered however in a few minutes rose again with some difficulty and went off in the midst of a splendid burst of moonlight which appeared to have come out expressly to light him on his way  his gait was awkward and he was obliged to sit down every twenty or thirty yards like a man resting under a heavy load  when last seen on his diminutive legs he looked like a huge bloated spider waddling into the obscurity of the forest  how disgusting perhaps exclaims the reader  true yet not much more disgusting than the gormandising which goes on among too many civilised men who besides possessing better knowledge have got dyspepsia to inform them that they daily act the part of the californian savage while many learned doctors we believe tell them that it is not so much quality as quantity that kills  that eventful night did not terminate however with the departure of the indian  another scene was enacted but unlike the popular mode of theatrical procedure the farce was followed by a tragedy  before lying down to rest the fire was drawn together fresh logs were heaped upon it and a great blaze was made to scare away the wolves frank jeffson and douglas then rolled themselves in their blankets and lay down with their feet towards the fire and their rifles beside them  the others lighted their pipes for a finishing whiffa nightcap as joe styled it  they had not sat long thus making occasional quiet remarks as fatigued and sleepy men are wont to do before going to rest when they were startled by the sound of heavy footsteps in the woods  rance whose duty it was to keep watch the first part of the night instantly leaped up and cocked his rifle while the sleepers awoke raised themselves on their elbows and looked about somewhat bewildered  before any one had time to act or speak a man clad in the flannel shirt heavy boots etcetera of a miner strode into the circle of light with the air of one whose intentions are peaceful  evening strangers he said looking round and setting the butt of a long rifle on the ground ive got lost  youll not object to let me rest a bit by your fire i daresayhallo  the latter exclamation was uttered when the strangers eyes fell on bradling who was gazing at him with the expression of a man who had seen a ghost  at the same time the stranger threw forward his rifle and his countenance became unusually pale  for two seconds each looked at the other in profound silence which was only broken by the sharp click of the lock as the stranger cocked his piece  like a flash of lightning bradling plucked a revolver from his belt pointed full at the mans breast and fired  he fell without uttering a cry and his rifle exploded as he went down but the ball passed harmlessly over the heads of the party  for a few seconds the travellers stood as if paralysed and bradling himself remained motionless gazing sullenly on his victim  then frank allfrey leaped upon him and grasping him by the throat wrenched the pistol out of his hand  murderer he exclaimed tightening his hold as bradling struggled to release himself  im no murderer gasped bradling you saw as well as i did that the fellow threatened to shoot me  besides he is not dead  thats true said joe graddy turning towards the fallen man whom rance and some of the others were examining and who had showed some symptoms of returning consciousness but his wound is a bad one and if you aint a murderer yet praps it wont be long afore ye are one  hearing this frank flung bradling violently off and turned to examine the wounded man  as he did so the other pointed his pistol deliberately at franks back fired and then sprang into the woods  before he had quite disappeared however each man who could seize his gun or pistol in time fired a shot after him but apparently without effect for although they examined the bushes carefully afterwards no marks of blood could be found  fortunately the miscreant missed frank yet so narrowly that the ball had touched his hair as it whistled past his ear  the wounded man was as carefully tended as was possible in the circumstances but neither on that night nor the following day did he recover sufficiently to be able to give any account of himself  he was left at the first ranch they came to next day with directions from frank that he should be cared for and sent back to sacramento city as soon as possible  our hero was unable of course to pay his expenses but he and all the party contributed a small sum which with the gold found on the strangers person was sufficient to satisfy the ranchero who appeared to be a more amiable man than the rest of his class  to secure as far as possible the faithful performance of his duty frank earnestly assured him that if he was attentive to the man he would give him something additional on his return from the diggings  thats very good of you sir said the ranchero with a peculiar smile but i wouldnt promise too much if i were you  mayhap you wont be able to fulfil it  all golddiggers dont make fortunes  perhaps not said frank but few of them i believe fail to make enough to pay off their debts  hm except those who die said the ranchero  well but i am not going to die said frank with a smile  i hope not  all the young and strong ones seem to think as you do when they go up but i have lived here off an on since the first rush and all i can say is that i have seen a lot more men go up to the diggins than ever i saw come down from em and of those who did return more were poor than rich while very few of em looked either as stout or as cheerful as they did when passing up  come shut up your potatotrap old man and dont try to take the heart out of us all in that fashion said jeffson but lets have a feed of the best you have in the house for were all alive and kicking as yet anyhow and not too poor to pay our way and i say lets have some homebrewed beer if you can because weve got a german with us and a haggis also for our scotchman  you have forgotten roastbeef for the englishman said frank laughing  i daresay you wont want sauce observed the host with an air of simplicity my meat never seems to want it when theres a yankee in the room  saying this the worthy ranchero went to work and speedily supplied the travellers with a meal consisting of hard biscuit and rancid pork with a glass of bitter brandy to wash it down for which he charged them the sum of eight shillings a head    chapter five  the travellers meet with indians and are led to wish that they had not gone seeking for gold  it was the evening of a hot sultry day when our travellers fatigued and footsore arrived at the entrance of a small valley not far distant from the intended scene of their future operations  here they determined to encamp for the night on the margin of a small stream where there was grass for the mule and shelter under the trees for the men  on making their way however to the place they observed an indian village down on a plain below and being uncertain as to the numbers or the temper of the natives they were about to cross the stream and continue their journey a little further when a party of six indians suddenly made their appearance in front and advanced fearlessly making signs of friendship  it was found that they understood and could talk a little spanish which rance spoke fluently  after a short conversation the guide thought that it would be quite safe to stay beside them  the encampment therefore was made and supper prepared  while this was in progress frank and joe went to the top of a neighbouring mound to survey the village  it was a curious residence for human beings  joes remark that it resembled a colony of big moles was not inappropriate for the huts of which there were about forty were not unlike huge molehills  these huts it was found they formed by excavating circular holes in the earth about twelve feet in diameter and four feet deep then bending over these a number of stout saplings which they bound together with tendrils of the vine they formed a domeshaped roof which was plastered with a thick coat of clay  an opening in one side of each formed a door through which entrance could be made by creeping  on the roofs of these curious dwellings many of the natives were seated evidently awaiting the result of the deputations conference with the white men  the main object that the indians appeared to have in view was the obtaining of firearms and it was observed that they cast longing eyes upon the rifles which leaned on the trees beside the fire  rance therefore advised every man to look carefully after his weapons while he talked with the chief and told him that he had no guns or ammunition to spare  in order to please him however he gave him an old rusty carbine which was bent in the barrel and nearly useless in exchange for a few fresh fish  my white brother is liberal said the delighted savage in bad spanish as he surveyed the weapon with admiration but it is necessary to have black powder and balls  i have none to spare replied rance but the settlements of the white men are not far off  besides the indian chief is wise  he does not require to be told that white men come here continually searching for gold and that they bring much powder and ball with them  let gold be offered and both may be obtained  the chief took this remark for a hint and at once offered some golddust in exchange for powder and shot but rance shook his head knowing that if obtained the ammunition would in all probability be used against himself  the chief was therefore obliged to rest content in the mean time with the harmless weapon  meanwhile another party of seven or eight indians had gone towards frank and joe and by signs made them to understand that there was something worth shooting on the other side of a cliff not fifty yards off  our hero and his nautical friend were both of unsuspicious natures and being much amused by the ludicrous gesticulations of the savages in their efforts to enlighten them as well as curious to ascertain what it could be that was on the other side of the cliff they accompanied them in that direction  the moment they had passed out of sight of the camp a powerful savage leaped on frank from behind and grasping him round the throat with both arms endeavoured to throw him while another indian wrenched the rifle out of his hand  at the same moment joe graddy was similarly seized  the savages had however underrated the strength of their antagonists  frank stooped violently forward almost to the ground and hurled the indian completely over his head  at the same time he drew a revolver from his belt fired at and wounded the other indian who dropped the rifle and doubled like a hare into the bushes  the others fled right and left as frank sprang forward and recovered his weapon all save the one whose unhappy lot it had been to assault joe graddy and who was undergoing rapid strangulation when frank ran to his rescue  have mercy on him joe he cried  marcy why should i have marcy on such a dirtylie still then said joe sternly as he pressed his knee deeper into the pit of the indians stomach and compressed his throat with both hands until his tongue protruded and both eyes seemed about to start from their sockets  come come joe you volunteered to be my servant so you are bound to obey me  saying this frank seized the angry tar by the collar and dragged him forcibly off his victim who after a gasp or two rose and limped away  he has got quite enough continued frank to keep you vividly in his remembrance for the rest of his life so we must hasten to the camp for i fear that the indians wont remain friendly after this unfortunate affair  grunting out his dissatisfaction pretty freely joe accompanied his friend to the campfire where their comrades were found in a state of great alarm about their safety  they had heard the shots and shouts and were on the point of hastening to the rescue  the chief and his companions meanwhile were making earnest protestations that no evil was intended  when frank and joe appeared rance turned angrily on the chief and ordered him and his men to quit the camp instantly  this they hesitated to do for a little and the chief made fresh efforts to calm the irritated guide but rance knew that he had to deal with treacherous men and repeated his order to be off at the same time throwing forward his rifle in a threatening manner  whereupon the chief flew into a violent rage and after using a good deal of abusive language returned to his village where he immediately summoned a council of war and by his violent gesticulations and frequent looking and pointing towards the camp left no doubt on the minds of the travellers as to his intentions  rance therefore made the best preparations possible in the circumstances to repel an attack  their position was very critical for the indians numbered about a hundred men while their own party consisted only of six  but they had the one great advantage over their enemiesthe possession of firearms and felt much confidence in consequence  get out all your weapons big and little said rance as he loaded his rifle and fire em off to begin with  it will show them that we are well prepared  accordingly they commenced letting off their pieces and what with rifles double shotguns double and single barrelled pistols and revolvers they made up the formidable number of fiftythree discharges which had a very warlike effect when fired in quick and regular succession  carrying these in their hands and disposed round their persons intermixed with short swords and long bowieknives the whole party mounted guard bristling like human hedgehogs and placed at equal intervals on each side of the camp marched about for an hour or two without seeing or hearing anything more of their enemies  at last their mule became a little restive putting them on the alert and shortly afterwards an arrow whizzed past joes ear  he instantly presented his carbine in the direction whence it came and fired  the shot was answered by a perfect shower of arrows which pierced the clothes of some of the white men and slightly wounded douglas in the left arm but fortunately did no further damage  the discharge was followed by a quick movement in the bushes rendered audible by the crushing of dried leaves and breaking of branches  this guided the whites in their aim and a volley was poured into the bush followed by several random shots from revolvers  soon after all noise was hushed and a brief examination of the surrounding bushes was made but it could not be ascertained that any damage had been done to the indians who always make it a point when possible to carry off their dead to prevent their being scalpeda dishonour they fear almost as much as death  now one half of us may sleep said rance when the party was again collected round the fire  sleep exclaimed frank  ay theres nothing more to fear from the rascals tonight if we keep a good lookoutand that may be done as effectively by three of us as by six  if we each get a wink of an hour or two we shall be quite fit to travel or to fight in the morning  so let me advise you to lose no time about itnot badly hurt sir i hope he added addressing douglas  nothing to speak of answered the scot only a graze of the skin  well get away to rest  you can take the second watch and it is not likely they will disturb you before morning  if they do you wont require to be called so keep your weapons handy  as rance prophesied so it turned out  the indians had got an unexpectedly severe repulse and did not attempt to interfere with the travellers during the night but in the morning they were found to have posted themselves on the opposite banks of the stream evidently with the intention of disputing the further progress of the party  nothing now but prompt determination could save them from being cut off by overwhelming numbers for if they were to hesitate or waver in the least the indians would be encouraged to make an attack  they therefore calmly and deliberately blew up the fire boiled their kettle and had breakfast after which the mule was loaded and the party prepared to cross the stream  before doing so however rance and jeffson being the best marksmen advanced to the edge of the bank with two of the largest rifles and took aim at the indians hoping by that means to frighten them away without being obliged to shed more blood  in this they failed for the distance being fully five hundred yards the natives evidently believed that it was impossible for a ball to tell at such a distance  on seeing rance point his rifle at them they set up a yell of derision  there was nothing for it therefore but to fire  this rance did and one of the indians fell  jeffson also fired and hit the chief who reeled but did not fall  the savages immediately began a hurried retreat and the travellers refrained from firing in order to convince them that all they desired was to be allowed to go on their way unmolested  the crossing of the stream was then effected  on mounting the opposite bank it was found that the indians had taken up their position fully armed on the top of their huts with an air of quiet resolution that showed they apprehended an attack and were prepared to defend their homes to the death  this however they were not called upon to do for the travellers turned off to the right and pursued their way as if nothing had happened  but two of the indians had been badly hit perhaps killed and the thought of this dwelt much on the minds of frank and his friend joe all that day  another thing that distressed them much was the wellknown custom of the natives to take their revenge at the first favourable opportunity  it was a rule among them to take two lives of white men for every redskin killed and they were known not to be particular as to who the whites might besufficient for them that they were of the offending and hated race  the fact that the innocent might thus suffer for the guilty was to them a matter of perfect indifference  the route over which the whites travelled that day chanced to be unusually picturesque and beautiful  the path or trailfor there was scarcely anything worthy the name of pathwound through a sycamore and whiteoak grove that fringed the river the sloping banks of which were covered with an infinite variety of shrubs and evergreens bearing flowers and blossoms of most delicate beauty and exquisite fragrance amidst which tangled festoons of the indigenous vine drooped with pendant bunches of purple grapes  arbutus shrubs of immense size were seen and the landscape was in some places interspersed thickly with manzanita rushes the crimson berries of which are much in favour with the indians also with the grizzly bear  some of the plains they crossed were studded with magnificent oaks devoid of underwood such as one is accustomed to see in noblemens parks in england  but all this beauty and luxuriance made comparatively little impression on frank and joe for they could not forget that human life had probably been sacrificed that daya thought which filled them with sincere regret that it had ever entered into their hearts to go digging for gold    chapter six  arrival at the goldfields and lessons in goldwashing received  at last bigbear gully was reached and our travellersespecially those of them who being new to the work were all enthusiasmpressed eagerly forward anxious to begin without delay  bigbear gullyso named because of a huge grizzly bear that had been shot there at the commencement of digging operationswas a wild and somewhat gloomy but picturesque mountain gorge the first sight of which with its lights and shadows stupendous cliffs and clumps of wood clinging to the hillsides called forth a burst of delight and admiration from frank allfrey whose mind at once leaped with loving desire to the brush and the colourbox but as these implements were at that time packed among the baggage on the mules back and as the love of art was not sufficiently strong in the guide to induce him to permit of a moments delay in the journey our hero was fain to content himself with visions of future indulgence in his favourite study  the diggings which they first got sight of in the afternoon of a fine and sunny but cool day were at the mouth of a deep gorge at the lower end of the gully having an abrupt mountain acclivity about eight hundred feet high on one side and on the other a plain bounded by mountains  here numbers of tents of all sizes and various shapes were pitched on the slopes and near the banks of the river that brawled down the centre of the little valley  no sooner had the travellers entered the camp than the diggers left their work and flocked round them to ask the news and more particularly to ascertain what provisions had been brought to the valleyfor the necessaries of life at that time were getting scarce and the party from which frank and his companions had separated strange to say had not arrived  great anxiety was manifested by the diggers on hearing of this separation because on the safe and speedy arrival of that party they depended almost for their existence and deep as well as loud were the expressions of disappointment and discontent when they were told that if all had gone well they should have been at the gully some days before  soon however the diggers had exhausted their queries and returned to their work leaving the new arrivals to look after their own affairs this they proceeded to do promptly  now friends said jeffson our journeying together has come to an end and it remains for you to settle whether you shall keep together and work in company or separate  as for me my business compels me to leave you  yonder white tent which you see about half a mile up the river belongs to me and my partner  it is the great economicouniversal store of jeffson and company which supplies diggers liberally on the most moderate terms giving credit as long as it seems advisable to do so  when jeffson is absent company takes charge of the concern and it is my opinion that company will be kind o glad tonight to see the head of the firm come back safe and sound with fresh supplies  you see gentlemen i feel it sort of incumbent on me to make you a farewell speech as a fellowtraveller because i mean to become a host for tonight and ask you to come up to the store and partake of our hospitality  i am quite sure that you will acquit me of the unworthy motive of wishing to attract you as customers when i tell you that i am already certain of your custom seeing that there is no other store in the gully and i guess you wont be inclined to go down to sacramento for supplies for some time to come  there was a general laugh at this followed by a hearty expression of thanks from all the party who forthwith adjourned to the store where they found company who was an irishman named quin barely able to keep his legs in consequence of a violent attack of dysentery which had reduced him to a mere shadow  the poor man could scarcely refrain from shedding tears of joy at the sight of his partner who to do him justice was almost as much affected by sorrow at the miserable appearance presented by his friend  sure its dead i am intirelyall but said quin as he wrung jeffsons hand again and again if yed bin a day later its my belaif id have gone under the sod  well you do look like it quin said jeffson stepping back to take a more critical view of him  what on airth pulled all the flesh off yer bones in this fashion  sickness no less  faix theres more than me is in the same fix  jim dander down at the cross creek has got so thin that its of no manner o use looking at him sideways hes not quite visible till he turns his flat front to ye  and foxey is all but gone and theres many a man besides as is on the road to the grave if not there already  sure the doctors the only man that makes money now though he kills more than he cures  the baste called to try his hand on mysilf but i flung my big boots at his head an saw no more of him  thats a bad account of things said jeffson however here i am back again with fresh supplies so cheer up man and well weather the storm yet  ive brought some fellowtravellers you see and hope you will receive them hospitably  that must not be said frank allfrey advancing it would be unfair to put your friend to unnecessary trouble considering the state of weakness to which  waikness is it exclaimed quin seizing franks hand and shaking it well now its little i thought id iver live to be called waik howsever its too thrue but me moral strength is wonderful so youre heartily welcome if ye can slaip on a plank floor an ait saltpork an paise  there now dont be botherin a sick man wid yer assurances just make yerselves at home gintlemen an the head o the firm will git yer supper ready  saying this the poor man who was quite worn out with excitement and the exertion of welcoming his partner flung himself on his couch with a deep sigh  as jeffson also pressed his friends to remain they made no further objection  while supper was being prepared frank and joe went out to look at the diggers  now said the former as they sauntered along the bank of the river the question that you and i must settle at once is are we two to work by ourselves or are we to join with our late friends and work in company  jine em say i replied joe  im fond of meyer and i like the scotchman too though he is rather fond of argification besides it strikes me that from what we have heard of diggers ways we shall be the better of being a strong party  four men dont form a very strong party joe however i agree with you  it would be well that we four should stick together  so thats settled and now we shall go and ask yonder fellow in the red shirt and big boots something about our prospects  the scene in the midst of which they now found themselves was curious interesting and suggestive  for two miles along its course the banks of the river were studded with tents and on each side of it were diggers working at short distances apart or congregated together according to the richness of the deposits  about twenty feet was the space generally allowed at that time to a washing machine  most of the diggers worked close to the banks of the stream others partially diverted its course to get at its bed which was considered the richest soil  at one place a company of eighty men had banded together for the purpose of cutting a fresh channel for the rivera proceeding which afterwards resulted in a fierce and fatal affray with the men who worked below them  elsewhere on the sides of the mountains and in gulches formed by torrents men toiled singly and in twos or threes with picks shovels washingpans and cradles  all were very busy but all were not equally hopeful for while some had been successful in finding the precious metal others had failed and were very desponding  have you had good fortune today asked frank stopping at the edge of the hole in which the miner with the red shirt toiled  not very good replied the man whose voice betokened him an englishman  he was an immensely powerful goodlooking fellow and paused in his work to reply to franks question with a hearty air  have you to dig very deep inquired frank  not very he replied the depth varies in different parts of the diggings  here it is seldom necessary to go deeper than four feet indeed a white rock usually lays about the depth of two feet under the soil  it is difficult to cut through and does not pay for the trouble  do you find gold on the surface continued frank  almost none  being weighty it sinks downwards through the loose earth and settles on the rock  i see gentlemen that you are strangers and if i mistake not englishmen  i am a countryman hailing from cornwall and if you have no objection will accompany you in your inspection of the diggings  my experience may be of service to you perhaps and i can at all events guard you from the scoundrels who make a livelihood by deceiving and cheating newcomers  frank thanked the cornish miner for his kind offer and accompanied by this new and intelligent friend he and joe continued their ramble  one of the first men whom they addressed happened to be one of the sharpers referred to  he was a yankee and although the yankees were by no means the only scoundrels there for there was no lack of such english scotch irish german and chinesethey were unquestionably the cutest  this man was very busy when they approached and appeared to be quite indifferent to them  observing however that they were about to pass by he looked up and wiping his brow said goodevening  goodevening said frank what luck  luck enough replied the man im tired of luck the fact is i have made my pile and want to make tracks for home but this is such a splendid claim that i cant tear myself away from it  see here  he struck his shovel into the ground as he spoke and lifted a quantity of earth or dirt into a basin washed it out and displayed to the astonished gaze of the greenhorns as newcomers were called a large quantity of golddust with several small nuggets interspersed  splendid exclaimed frank  youll make your fortin said joe graddy  its made already i reckon said the yankee with the air of a man who was overburdened with success  the truth is i want to get away before the rainy season comes on and will part with this here claim for an old song  im half inclined to make you a present of it but i dont quite see my way to that  however ive no objection to hand it over for say a hundred dollars  hm ejaculated the cornish man will you take a shovelful from the other end of the claim and wash it out  the yankee smiled put his finger on the side of his nose and wishing them success in whatever line of life they chose to undertake went on with his work  the cornish miner laughed and as he walked away explained to his astonished companions that this was a common dodge  the rascals he said hide a little gold in a claim that is valueless and digging it up as you have seen wash it out in the presence of newcomers in the hope of taking them in  but here we come to a party who will show you a little of legitimate goldwashing  they approached as he spoke a bend of the river where several men were busy at worksome with pick and shovel some with the cradle and others with tin washingpans  here they stood for some time watching the process of goldwashing  at the time of which we write only the two simple processes of washing with the pan and with the cradle were practised at bigbear gully the more elaborate methods of crushing quartz etcetera not having been introduced  the most simple of these was the pan process which was much in favour because the soil or dirt was so rich in golddust that it paid well and it only required that the miner should possess a pick a shovel and a tin pan  with this very limited stock in trade he could begin without delay and earn at least a subsistence perhaps even make his pile or in other words his fortune  one of the men connected with the party above referred to was engaged in panwashing  he stood in a hole four feet deep and had just filled a flat tin dish with dirt as frank and his companions stopped to observe him  pouring water on the dirt the miner set the pan down dipped both hands into it and stirred the contents about until they became liquid mudremoving the stones in the process and operating in such a manner that he caused some of the contents to escape or spill off the top at each revolution  more water was added from time to time and the process continued until all the earthy matter was washed away and nothing but a kind of black sand which contained the gold left at the bottom  the separation of the metal from the black sand was an after process and a more difficult one  it was accomplished in some cases by means of a magnet which attracted the sand  in other cases this was blown carefully off from a sheet of paper but a few of the miners who managed matters in a more extensive and thorough manner effected the separation by means of quicksilver  they mixed it with the sand added a little water and stirred it about until the gold amalgamated with the quicksilver converting it into a little massive tangible and soft heap  it was then put into a buckskin cloth through the pores of which the quicksilver was squeezed leaving the pure gold behind  any trifling quantity of the former that might still remain was afterwards evaporated on a heated shovel or pan  an expert worker in average ground could gather and wash a panful of dirt every ten minutes  there were few places in bigbear gully that would not yield two shillings worth of gold to the panful so that in those early days while the surface soil was still fresh a man could by steady work alonewithout incidental nuggetswork out golddust to the value of between five and six pounds sterling a day while occasionally he came upon a lump or nugget equal perhaps to what he could procure by the labour of a week or more  many however of the more energetic miners worked in companies and used cradles by means of which they washed out a much larger quantity of gold in shorter time and in places which did not yield a sufficient return by the pan process to render it worth while working the cradle owners obtained ample remuneration for their toil  the cradle which frank and his comrades saw working not far from the panwasher was by no means a complex affair  it was a semicircular trough hollowed out of a log six feet long by sixteen inches diameter at one end of this was a perforated copper or iron plate with a rim of iron or wood round it on which the dirt was thrown and water poured thereon by one man while the cradle was rocked by another  the gold earth and small gravel were thus separated from the larger stones and washed down the trough in which at intervals two tranverse bars were placed the first of these arrested the gold which from its great weight sunk to the bottom while the gravel and lighter substances were swept away by the current  the lower bar caught any particles that by awkward management might have passed the upper one  having satisfied their curiosity and learned from an obliging miner the method of washing the gold our adventurers returned to jeffsons store and there spent the night in discussing their plan of procedure  it was decided first of all that they should stick together and work in company  you see mates observed joe graddy after the others had given their opinions this is how it stands  i must stick by mister allfrey cause why weve bin pullin in the same boat together for some time past an its natral for to wish to continue so to do  then douglas and meyer ought to stick to us cause we have for so long stuck to them an they ought to stick to one another cause theyre mootooally fond o mistyphysical jabberin on religious subjects which is greatly to our edification seein that we dont onderstand it and finds it highly amoosin while we smoke our pipes after a hard days work dye see  so on them grounds i votes that we jine company an go to work at seven oclock tomorrow mornin  das ist goot advise said the german slapping joe on the shoulder an i vould add mine vott vich is to make you commandair of de forces  very good then i command you to shut your mouth and go to bed  unpossabil replied meyer for i do snor an always do him troo de mout  i prefers to do it through the nose remarked joe rolling his blanket round him and lying down on the hard boards with his head on a sack  expressing a hope that they would restrain their snoring propensities as much as possible the remaining members of the new copartnery lay down beside them and were speedily in the land of dreams  need we add that their dreams that night were of gold  surely not and perhaps it were equally unnecessary to observe that their slumbers were profound    chapter seven  gives the result of the first days digging and shows the powerful effect of lynchlaw  next morning frank and his friends went out to choose their claim  as we have said the bigbear gully was not at that time generally known  a comparatively small number of diggers had set to work in it and they were careful to avoid giving much information to prospecting or searching parties because they knew that if the richness of the soil were known there would be a general rush to it from all quarters there was therefore no lack of unoccupied ground  a suitable spot was chosen in a pleasant grove on the banks of the stream where it swept round the base of a magnificent precipice not far from jeffsons store  here douglas meyer and joe set to work to build a kind of hut of logs branches and mud while frank returned to the store to purchase the necessary tools  having little money left he was compelled to take credit which jeffson readily granted to him knowing full well that there was little fear of the account remaining long unpaid  in order that the reader may have an idea of the charges made at the diggings in those days we subjoin the list of purchases made at the commencement of operations by the firm of allfrey douglas and company   a rocker or cradle                                                 6 pounds 5 shillings   a spade shovel pickaxe and two tin washingpans                3 pounds 15 shillings  12 pounds weight of biscuit 12 pounds weight of saltpork and beef                       4 pounds weight of lard and 6 pounds weight of flour              10 pounds 8 shillings  a fryingpan saucepan and four tin mugs                         2 pounds 12 shillings  sumtotal                                                          23 pounds 0 shillings   when joe graddy heard the sumtotal he looked very blank indeed but quickly recovering himself insisted that they should leave off housebuilding which in the fine weather he said wos o no manner o use and it was a matter o prime importance to go to dig at once an pay off their debt without delay  joe was overruled however and when it was explained to him that the fine weather might not last long that it was essential to health that they should have a roof of some sort to keep off the dews and that digging might be commenced in right earnest on the morrow he consented to continue his labours at the hut  that night they slept sounder than usual and on the following morning began to dig for gold  they commenced within a few feet of the waters edge  joe handled the pick and spade meyer carried the dirt on his broad shoulders to douglas who rocked the cradle while frank washed out the auriferous matter in one of the tin pans until nothing but pure gold and black sand remained  it was reserved for evening to separate the sand from the gold and ascertain the result of their days labour  at noon in accordance with the universal custom at the mines they threw down their tools and went up to the hut for an hours rest and refreshment  of course they discussed while they dined and hoped largely but their jaws were more active than their tongues and the moment the hour was completed they returned vigorously to work  when the shades of evening began to descend they returned to the hut and kindling a fire commenced to fry blacksand and gold being anxious to ascertain the result of the first days work before supper  as each panful was dried and blown the gold was weighed and put into a small white bowl the bottom of which was soon heaped up with shining particles varying in size from the smallest visible specks to little lumps like grains of corn  a neighbouring miner who had offered to weigh the result for them pronounced this first days work as an unusually successful one being he said a little over thirtysix pounds sterling  how much exclaimed joe graddy in amazement  thirtysix pounds sterling repeated the miner  you dont mean that  indeed i do replied the miner smiling  then our fortins is made areadyall but  not quite you forget the price of our outfit said frank  no doubt i did answered the seaman a little subdued  and the price o grub added douglas not to mention clothing which we shall want very soon i fear for the tear and wear of this kind of work is considerable  why i found today when i took a stroll at noon that they charge five pounds sterling for a flannel shirt and four pounds for a pair of boots and everything else is in proportion so you see our thirtysix pounds wont do much for us at that rate however i admit that we have reason to be satisfied with the days work  you certainly have said their friend the miner for it is very seldom that beginners do so much  and now i would give you one piece of advice before i go which is that you appoint one of your number to cook for the rest  more men are killed i believe by eating halfcooked victuals than by hard work  they come in fagged and wet at night cook their grub hastily bolt it and then lie down to sleep in damp clothes  of course they soon break down  our party have kept very fair health in the midst of great sickness and i believe it is chiefly owing to the fact that on first setting to work we appointed one of our number who had a talent that way to attend to the cooking department  we relieved him of a great deal of the hard labour but gave him his equal share of the profits  the consequence has been that we are all in firstrate health and dig more energetically than our neighbours  has there then been much sickness here of late asked frank  a great deal and i fear there will be much more when the rains set in but let me urge you again to take my advice about appointing a cook  that said joe graddy is just wot we means to do mister wotsyername  stewart said the miner  well mister stewart ill apint myself cook to our party havin if i may say so a natral talent that way wich wos deweloped on my first voyage round the world wen our cook died of a broken heartso its saidcause the doctor knocked off his grog and put him on an allowance o lime juice  saying this joe heaved a deep sigh seized the fryingpan and commenced his selfimposed duties  our hero took up the bowl of golddust and was about to leave the hut when douglas arrested him with  hallo frank where away  i shall have to shout stop thief if you go off like that with the gold  im going to pay our debt to jeffson said frank with a laugh  i have great belief douglas in the plan of paying as one goes  debt is a heavy weight which i never mean to carry if i can help it  a good old aunt of mine used often to din into everybodys ears the text owe no man anything and i really believe she has caused it to take a strong hold of me for i cant rest till i square off jeffsons account  frank hastened away and soon after returned with the balance thirteen pounds which as douglas observed when they began supper was the nucleus of their future fortune while joe remarked that he didnt know wot nooklius wos but if it meant the beginnin of their fortin it wasnt a big un as things went at the diggins  the proceeds of the next days work were nearly equal to those of the first and the spirits of the diggers were proportionally high but on the third day they did not wash out much more than half the quantity of gold  they were therefore somewhat depressed and this condition of mind was increased by one of those events which were at times of frequent occurrence there  this was the murder of one miner by another and the summary application of lynchlaw to the criminal  it occurred about noon when the miners were at dinner  a man named higson who was noted for swearing and brutality was standing near jeffsons store when a young miner named elms came up greatly excited in consequence of having just found a large nugget which he wished to have weighed  to the surprise of all and the indignation of elms higson suddenly snatched the nugget out of his hand and swore that it had been got in a claim to which elms had no title and that being alongside of his own and included in the line he had marked off the nugget was his by rights  the young man sprang upon higson and a struggle ensued in the midst of which the latter drew his bowieknife and stabbed elms to the heart when he fell higson attempted to run but a stout german tripped up his heels and a cry of wild anger arose from those who had witnessed the deed  lynch him they shouted furiously  frank allfrey and his friends heard the shout and ran to the spot but the administration of justice was so prompt that before they reached it the murderer was swinging by the neck to the branch of a tree  surely you have been too hasty exclaimed frank advancing without any settled intention but under an indefinable sense that wrong was being done  at this several miners leaped forward and drawing their revolvers swore with a terrible oath that they would shoot any man who should attempt to cut the murderer down  as one of the miners here explained hastily why it was that justice had been meted out with such promptitude our hero drew back and left the spot feeling however that judge lynch was a very dangerous character seeing that he might be just as prompt with the innocent as with the guilty although he would find it rather difficult to recall life if he should find out afterwards that he had been mistaken in his views  this event was followed two days after by another incident which caused considerable excitement in bigbear gully  with the increase of miners there had been a considerable increase of crime as might naturally have been expected in a country where while there were undoubtedly many honest men there were also thousands of scoundrels of all nations who had been attracted thither by the dazzling accounts given of the new el dorado in the west  rows more or less severe in reference to claims and boundaries had become frequent  coldblooded murders were on the increase and thefts became so common that a general sense of insecurity began to be felt  this state of things at last wrought its own cure  one day a youth went into the hut of a neighbouring digger a yankee and stole a coffeetin he was taken in the act and as this was the second time that he had been caught purloining his neighbours goods those in the vicinity rose up en masse in a furore of indignation  a hurried meeting of all the miners was called and it was unanimously resolvedat least so unanimously that those who dissented thought it advisable to be silent that lynchlaw should be rigorously put in force  accordingly several of the most energetic and violent of the miners constituted themselves judges on the spot and on hearing a brief statement of the case decreed that the culprit was to be subjected to whatever punishment should be determined on by the man whom he had injured  the yankee at once decided that the rims of his ears should be cut off and that he should be seared deeply in the cheek with a redhot iron which sentence was carried into execution on the spot  it happened that while this was going on another of the thieving fraternity who did not know of the storm that was gathering and about to burst over the heads of such as he took advantage of the excitement to enter a tent and abstract therefrom a bag of gold worth several hundred pounds  it chanced that the owner of it happened to be ailing slightly that day and instead of following his companions had lain still in his tent rolled up in blankets  he was awakened by the thief sprang up and collared him and observing what he was about dragged him before the tribunal which was still sitting in deliberation on the affairs of the community  the man was instantly condemned to be shot and this was done at onceseveral of the exasperated judges assisting the firing party to carry the sentence into execution  now men cried a tall rawboned yankee from the western states mounting on a stump after the body had been removed and speaking with tremendous vehemence i guess things have come to such a deadlock here that its time for honest men to carry things with a high hand so i opine we had better set about it and make a few lawsan if you have no objections ill lay down a lot o them slick offbran new laws warranted to work well and stand wear and tear and ready greased for action  hear hear cried several voices in the crowd that surrounded this western solon while others laughed at his impudence  all however were eager to see the prevailing state of things put right and glad to back any one who appeared able and willing to act with vigour  wall then here goes cried the yankee  let it be decreed that whatever critter shall be nabbed in the act of makin tracks with what isnt hisn shall have his ears cut off if its a mild case and be hanged or shot if its a bad un  a hearty and stern assent was at once given to this law and the lawgiver went on to lay down others  he said that of course murder would be punished also with death and for several other offences men should be flogged or branded on the cheeks with redhot irons  having in little more than ten minutes laid down these points he enacted that thenceforth each man should be entitled to a claim of ten feet square which being multiplied by the number of his mess would give the limits of the allotments in particular locations but that he said would not prevent any man from moving from one site and fixing on another  to this proposition however some of the miners demurred and the lawgiver found that although in criminal law he had been allowed to have it all his own way in civil matters he must listen to the opinion of others  however after much wrangling this law was agreed to and it was also arranged among other things that as long as any one left his tools in his claim his rights were to be respected  this meeting had the most beneficial influence on the miners  rough and ready as well as harsh though their proceedings were they accomplished the end in view most effectually for after several terrible examples had been made which proved to evildoers that men were thoroughly in earnest stealing quarrelling about boundaries and murdering were seldom heard of in that districtinsomuch that men could leave bags of gold in their tents unwatched for days together and their tools quite open in their claims without the slightest fear of their being touched  the reader must not suppose here that we are either upholding or defending the proceedings of the celebrated judge lynch  we are merely recording facts which prove how efficacious his severe code was in bringing order out of confusion in bigbear gully at that time  it is not necessary that we should follow the varied fortunes of our hero and his friends day by day while they were engaged in digging for gold  suffice it to say that sometimes they were fortunate sometimes the reverse but that on the whole they were successful beyond the average of diggers and became sanguine of making their fortunes in a short time  nevertheless frank allfrey did not like the life  whatever else might arouse his ambition he was evidently not one of those whose soul was set upon the acquisition of wealth  although successful as a digger and with more gold in his possession than he knew what to do with he detested the dirty laborious work of digging and dabbling in mud from morning till night  he began to see that as far as the nature of his daily toil was concerned he worked harder and was worse off than the poorest navvy who did the dirtiest work in old england  he sighed for more congenial employment meditated much over the subject and finally resolved to give up golddigging  before however he could carry this resolve into effect he was smitten with a dire disease and in a few days lay on the damp floor of his poor hut as weak and helpless as a little child    chapter eight  frank and joe take to wandering see some wonderful things and have a narrow escape  before our hero became convalescent his comrade douglas was laid down with dysentery  in these circumstances the digging went on slowly for much of the time of meyer and graddy was necessarily occupied in nursingand truly kind and devoted though rough nurses they proved to be in that hour of need  gradually but surely douglas sank  there was no doctor to prescribe for him no medicine to be had for love or money  in that wretched hut he lay beside his sick friend and conversed as strength permitted in faint low tones on the folly of having thrown his life away for mere gold and on the importance of the things that concern the soul  as he drew near his end the name of the saviour was often on his lips and often did he reproach himself for having neglected the great salvation until it was almost too late  sometimes he spoke of homein scotlandand gave many messages to frank which he begged him to deliver to his mother if he should ever get well and live to return home  there was something in that if which went with a thrill to franks heart as he lay there and realised vividly that his comrade was actually dying and that he too might die  one evening joe entered the hut with more alacrity than he had done for many a day  he had a large nugget just dug up in his hand and had hastened to his companions to cheer them if possible with a sight of it  douglas was just passing away  he heard his comrades hearty remarks and looked upon the mass of precious metal  joe he whispered faintly wisdom is more to be desired than gold the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom  he never spoke again and died within an hour after that  at last frank began to mend and soon found himself strong enough to travel he therefore made arrangements to leave bigbear gully with his inseparable friend joe  meyer being a very strong man and in robust health determined to remain and work out their claim which still yielded abundance of gold  meyer said frank the evening before his departure im very sorry that we are obliged to leave you  ya das ist mos miserable said the poor german looking disconsolate  but you see continued frank that my remaining in my present state of health is out of the question  now joe and i have been talking over our affairs  we intend to purchase three mules and set off under the guidance of a halfcaste californian to visit different parts of this country  we will continue our journey as long as our gold lasts and then return to san francisco and take passage for englandfor we have both come to the unalterable determination that we wont try to make our fortunes by golddigging  we have sufficient dust to give us a long trip and pay our passage to england without making use of that big nugget found by joe which is worth at least 200 pounds so we have determined to leave it in possession of jeffson to be used by you if luck should ever take a wrong turnas it will sometimes doand you should chance to get into difficulties  of course if you continue prosperous we will reclaim our share of it on our return hither  ah you is too goot cried the warmhearted german seizing franks hand and wringing it bot i vill nevair use de nuggutnevair  you sall find him here sartainly ven you do com bak  well i hope so for your own sake said frank because that will show you have been successful  but if you get into low water and do not use it believe me i shall feel very much aggrieved  next day about noon our hero and joe with junk their vaquero mounted their mules and rode away  a new style o cruisin this said joe graddy one fine day as they pulled up under the shade of a large tree at a spot where the scenery was so magnificent that frank resolved to rest and sketch it  new indeed and splendid too he exclaimed enthusiastically leaping off his mule  you can go shoot squirrels or bears if you like joe but here i remain for the next three or four hours  as frank had been in the habit of treating his friend thus almost every day since starting on their tour he was quite prepared for it smiled knowingly ordered the vaquero to tether the mules and accompany him into the forest and then taking his bearings with a small pocketcompass and critically inspecting the sun and a huge pinchbeck watch which was the faithful companion of his wanderings he shouldered his gun and went off leaving the enthusiastic painter to revel in the glories of the landscape  and truly magnificent the scenery was  they had wandered by that time far from the diggings and were involved in all the grandeur of the primeval wilderness  stupendous mountains capped with snow surrounded the beautiful valley through which they were travelling and herbage of the richest description clothed the ground while some of the trees were so large that many of the giant oaks of old england would have appeared small beside them  some of the precipices of the valley were fully three thousand feet high without a break from top to bottom and the mountainranges in the background must have been at least as high again large tracts of the low grounds were covered with wild oats and rich grasses affording excellent pasturage to the deer which could be seen roving about in herds  lakes of various sizes were alive with waterfowl whose shrill and plaintive cries filled the air with wild melody  a noble river coursed throughout the entire length of the valley and its banks were clothed with oaks cypresses and chestnuts while up on the mountain sides firs of truly gigantic size reared their straight stems above the surrounding trees with an air of towering magnificence which gave them indisputable right to be considered the aristocracy of those grand solitudes  of these firs frank observed one so magnificent that although anxious to begin work without delay he could not resist the desire to examine it closely  laying down his book and pencil he ran towards it and stood for some time in silent amazement feeling that he was indeed in the presence of the queen of the forest  it was a pine which towered to a height of certainly not less than three hundred and sixty feet and after careful measurement was found to be ninetythree feet in circumference  in regarding this tree as the queen frank was doubly correct for the natives styled it the mother of the forest  the bark of it to the height of a hundred and sixteen feet was in after years carried to england and built up in its original form in the crystal palace of sydenham  it was unfortunately destroyed in the great fire which a few years ago consumed a large part of that magnificent building  but this was not the only wonderful sight that was seen that day  after frank had finished his drawing and added it to a portfolio which was already well filled he fired a shot to recall his nautical comrade and the vaquero  they soon rejoined him and continuing their journey came to a waterfall which in some respects excelled that of the farfamed niagara itself  it had sounded like murmuring thunder in their ears the greater part of that day and as they approached it the voice of its roar became so deafening that they were prepared for something unusually grand but not for the stupendous sight and sound that burst upon them when on turning round the base of a towering precipice they came suddenly in full view of one of the most wonderful of the creators works in that land  a succession of walllike mountains rose in two tiers before them into the clouds  some of the lower clouds floated far below the highest peaks  from the summit of the highest range a river equal to the thames at richmond dropt sheer down a precipice of more than two thousand feet  here it met the summit of the lower mountainrange on which it burst with a deeptoned sullen roar comparable only to eternal thunder  a white cloud of spray received the falling river in its soft embrace and sent it forth again turbulent and foambespeckled towards its second leapanother thousand feetinto the plain below  the entire height of this fall was above three thousand feet  our hero was of course anxious to make a careful drawing of it but having already exhausted the greater part of the day he was fain to content himself with a sketch after making which they pushed rapidly forward and encamped for the night still within sight and sound of the mighty fall  dyou know joe said frank leaning back against a tree stem as he gazed meditatively into into the fire after supper was concluded it has often struck me that men are very foolish for not taking full possession of the splendid world in which they have been placed  frank paused a few moments but the observation not being sufficiently definite for joe who was deep in the enjoyment of his first pipe no reply was made beyond an interjectional hm  just look around you pursued frank waving his hand towards the landscape at this magnificent country what timber what soil what an amount of game what lakes what rivers what facilities for farming manufacturing fishingeverything in fact that is calculated to gladden the heart of man  includin gold suggested joe  including gold assented frank and there it all lieshas lain since creationhundreds of thousands of acres of splendid land unoccupied  ha theres a screw loose somewhere said joe taking the pipe from his lips and looking at it earnestly as if the remark were addressed to it somethin out o jinta plank started so to speakcernly  no doubt of it said frank and the broad acres which we now look upon as well as those over which we have lately travelled are as nothing compared with the other waste but fertile lands in america on which hundreds of thousands of the human race might live happily  yet strange to say men seem to prefer congregating together in little worlds of brick stone and mortar living tier upon tier above each others heads breathing noxious gases instead of the scent of flowers treading upon mud stone and dust instead of green grass and dwelling under a sky of smoke instead of bright blue etherand this too in the face of the bible command to go forth and replenish the earth  yes theres great room said joe for the settin up of a ginral enlightenment an universal emigration society but i raither think it wouldnt pay  i know it wouldnt but why not demanded frank  ah why not repeated joe  as neither of them appeared to be able to answer the question they both remained for some time in a profound reverie frank gazing as he was wont to do into the fire and joe staring through smoke of his own creation at the vaquero who reclined on the opposite side of the fire enjoying the tobacco to the full by letting it puff slowly out at his nose as well as his mouth  joe said frank  ay ay sir answered joe with nautical promptitude  i have been thinking a good deal about our affairs of late and have come to the conclusion that the sooner we go home the better  my notions precisely  moreover continued frank i think that we have come far enough in this direction and that it would be a good plan to return to bigbear gully by a different route from that by which we came here and thus have an opportunity of seeing some of the other parts of the diggings what say you to that  im agreeable answered joe  well then shall we decide to commence our return journey tomorrow  by all means  down wi the helm bout ship an lay our course on another tack by daylight said joe shaking the ashes out of his pipe with the slow unwilling air of a man who knows that he has had enough but is loath to give up i always like to set sail by daylight  it makes one feel up to the mark so to speak as if one had lost none of the day and i suppose he added with a sigh which resolved itself into a yawn that if we means to start so bright an early the sooner we tumble in the better  true said frank whose mouth irresistibly followed the example of joes i think it will be as well to turn in  there was a quiet easygoing lowness in the speech and motions of the two friends which showed that they were just in a state of readiness to fall into the arms of the drowsy god  they rolled themselves in their blankets placed their rifles by their sides their heads on their saddles and their feet to the fire  joe graddys breathing proclaimed that he had succumbed at once but frank lay for a considerable time winking owlishly at the stars which returned him the compliment with interest by twinkling at him through the branches of the overhanging trees  early next morning they arose remounted their mules and turned back diverging according to arrangement from their former track and making for a particular part of the diggings where frank had been given to understand there were many subjects of interest for his pencil  we would fain linger by the way to describe much of what they saw but the limits of our space require that we should hasten onward and transport the reader at once to a place named the great canon which being a very singular locality and peculiarly rich in gold merits description  it was a gloomy gap or gorgea sort of gigantic split in the earth lying between two parallel ranges of hills at a depth of several hundred feet shaped like a wedge and so narrow below that there was barely standing room  the gold all lay at the bottom the slopes being too steep to afford it a restingplace  the first diggers who went there were said to have gathered vast quantities of gold and when frank and joe arrived there was quite enough to repay hard work liberally  the miners did not work in companies there  indeed the form of the chasm did not admit of operations on a large scale being carried on at any one place  most of the men worked singly with the pan and used large bowieknives with which they picked gold from the crevices of the rocks in the bed of the stream or scratched the gravelly soil from the roots of the overhanging trees which were usually rich in deposits  the gorge about four miles in extent presented one continuous string of men in single file all eagerly picking up gold and admitting that in this work they were unusually successful  but these poor fellows paid a heavy price for the precious metal in the loss of health the air being very bad as no refreshing breezes could reach them at the bottom of the gloomy defile  the gold at that place was found both in very large and very small grains and was mixed with quantities of fine black sand which the miners blew off from it somewhat carelesslymost of them being green hands and anxious to get at the gold as quickly as possible  this carelessness on their part was somewhat cleverly taken advantage of by a keen old fellow who chanced to enter the hut of a miner when frank and joe were there  he had a bag on his back and a humorous twinkle in his eye  well old foxey what do you want asked the owner of the hut who happened to be blowing off the sand from a heap of his gold at the time  sure its only a little sand i want said the man in a brogue which betrayed his origin  sand paddy what for  for emery sure said the man with a very rueful look troth its myself as is gittin too owld entirely for the diggins  i was a broth of a boy wance but what wid dysentery and rheumatiz theres little or nothin o me left so im obleeged to contint myself wid gatherin the black sand and sellin it as a substitute for emery  well that is a queer dodge said the miner with a laugh  true for ye it is quare but its what im redooced to so av youll be so kind as plaze to blow the sand on to this here tray itll be doin a poor man a good turn an costin ye nothin  he held up a tin tray as he spoke and the miner cheerfully blew the sand off his golddust on to it  thanking him with all the fervour peculiar to his race the irishman emptied the sand into his bag and heaving a heavy sigh left the hut to request a similar favour of other miners  you may depend on it said frank as the old man went out that fellow is humbugging you  it is gold not sand that he wants  thats a fact said joe graddy with an emphatic nod and wink  nonsense said the miner i dont believe we lose more than a few specks in blowing off the sandcertainly nothing worth speaking of  the man was wrong in this however for it was afterwards discovered that the sly old fellow carried his black sand to his hut and there every night by the agency of quicksilver he extracted from the sand double the average of gold obtained by the hardest working miner in the canon  at each end of this place there was a hut made of calico stretched on a frame of wood in which were sold brandy and other strong liquors of the most abominable kind at a charge of about two shillings for a small glass  cards were also to be found there by those who wished to gamble away their hardearned gains or double them  places of iniquity these which abounded everywhere throughout the diggings and were the nightly resort of hundreds of diggers and the scene of their wildest orgies on the sabbathday  leaving the great canon our travellerswe might almost term them inspectorscame to a creek one raw wet morning where a large number of miners where at work  here they resolved to spend the day and test the nature of the ground  accordingly the vaquero was directed to look after the mules while frank and joe went to work with pick shovel and pan  they took the dirt from a steep incline considerably above the winter level of the stream in a stratum of hard bluish clay almost as hard as rock with a slight surfacecovering of earth  it yielded prodigiously at night they found that they had washed out gold to the value of forty pounds sterling  the particles of gold were all large many being the size of a grain of corn with occasional nuggets intermixed besides quartz amalgamations  if this had been my first experience o them there diggins said joe graddy as he smoked his pipe that night in the chief gambling and drinking store of the place i would have said our fortin wos made all but  howsever i dont forget that the last pair o boots i got cost me four pound an the last glass o brandy two shillinsnot to speak o death cuttin an carvin all round an the rainy season acomin on so its my advice that we bout ship for home as soon as may be  i agree with you joe said frank and i really dont think i would exchange the pleasure i have derived from journeying through this land and sketching the scenery for all the gold it contains  nevertheless i would not like to be tempted with the offer of such an exchangenow ill turn in  next morning the rain continued to pour incessantly and frank allfrey had given the order to get ready for a start when a loud shouting near the hut in which they had slept induced them to run out  a band of men were hurrying toward the tavern with great haste and much gesticulation dragging a man in the midst of them who struggled and protested violently  frank saw at a glance that the prisoner was his former companion bradling and that one of the men who held him was the stranger who had been so badly wounded by him at the campfire as formerly related  on reaching the tavern in front of which grew a large oaktreeone of the limbs of which was much chafed as if by the sawing of a rope against itthe stranger whose comrades called him dick stood up on a stump and said  i tell you what it is mates im as sure that he did it as i am of my own existence  the man met his death at the hands of this murderer bradling ha he knows his own name you see  he is an escaped convict  and what are you said bradling turning on him bitterly  that is no mans business so long as i hurt nobody cried dick passionately  i tell you he continued addressing the crowd which had quickly assembled i found this fellow skulking in the bush close to where the body was found and i know he did it because he all but murdered me not many months ago and there he continued with a look of surprise pointing straight at our hero is a man who can swear to the truth of what i say  all eyes were at once turned on frank who stepped forward and said  i can certainly testify to the fact that this man bradling did attempt to shoot the man whom you call dick but i know nothing about the murder which seems to have been perpetrated here and  its a young feller as was a quiet harmless sort o critter said one of the bystanders who was found dead under a bush this morning with his skull smashed in and its my opinion gentlemen that since this stranger has sworn to the fact that bradling tried to murder dick he should swing for it  i protest gentlemen said frank energetically that i did not swear at all  i did not even say that bradling tried to murder anybody on the contrary i think the way in which the man dick handled his gun at the time when bradling fired was very susp  a shout from the crowd drowned the remainder of this speech  string him up without more ado cried several voices  three men at once seized bradling and a rope was quickly flung over the bough of the oak  mercy mercy cried the unhappy man i swear that i did not murder the man  i have made my pile down at bigbear gully and ill give it allevery centif you will wait to have the matter examined  stay he added seeing that they paid no heed to him let me speak one word before i die with mr allfrey  i want to tell him where my gold lies hid  its a dodge cried one of the executioners with a sneer but have your say out  its the last youll have a chance to say here so look sharp about it  frank went forward to the man who was trembling and very pale and begged those who held him to move off a few paces  oh  mr allfrey said bradling i am innocent of this i am an escaped convict it is true and i did try to kill that man dick who has given me provocation enough god knows but as he shall be my judge at last i swear i did not commit this murder  if you will cut the cords that bind my hands you will prevent a coldblooded murder being committed now  you saved my life once before  oh save it again  the man said all this in a hurried whisper but there was something so intensely earnest and truthful in his bearing that frank under a sudden and irresistible impulse which he could not afterwards account for drew his knife and cut the cords that bound him  instantly bradling bounded away like a hunted deer overturning several men in his flight and being followed by a perfect storm of bullets from rifles and revolvers until he had disappeared in the neighbouring wood then the miners turned with fury on frank but paused abruptly on seeing that he and joe graddy stood back to back with a revolver in each hand  of course revolvers and rifles were instantly pointed at them but fortunately the miners in their exasperation had discharged all their firearms at bradlingnot a piece remained loaded  several therefore commenced hurriedly to reload but frank shouted in a voice that there was no misunderstanding  the first who attempts to load is a dead man  this caused them to hesitate for in those times men when desperate were wont to be more prompt to act than to threaten  still there were some present who would have run the risk and it is certain that our hero and his friend would have then and there terminated their career had not a backwoods hunter stepped forward and said  well now ye air makin a pretty noise bout nothin  see here i know that feller bradling well  he didnt kill the man  it was a redskin as did it i came up in time to see him do it and killed the redskin afore he could get away  in proof whereof here is his gun an youll find his carcase under the bank where the murder was committed if yeve a mind to look for it  but bradling is a murderer  i knows him of old an so although hes innocent of this partikler murder i didnt see no occasion to try to prevent him gittin his desarts  its another matter howsever when youre goin to scrag the men as let him off if yell take the advice of an old hunter as knows a thing or two youll go to work on yer claims slick off for the rains are comin on and they will pull ye up sharp i guess  youll make hay while the sun shines if youre wise  the opportune interference of this hunter saved frank and joe who after thanking their deliverer were not slow to mount their mules and hasten back to bigbear gully resolved more firmly than ever to wind up their affairs and bid a final adieu to the diggings    chapter nine  conclusion  when they arrived at bigbear gully they found the condition of the people most deplorable owing to scarcity of provisions prevailing sickness and the total absence of physic or medical attendance  to make matters worse there were indications that the rainy season was about to set in an event that would certainly increase the violence of the disease which had already swept away so many of the miners not a few of whom fell down in the holes where they were digging for gold and thus in digging their own graves ended their golden dreams with golddust for their windingsheets  in california there may be said to be only two seasonsa wet one and a dry  the wet season is from november to march during which period foggy weather and cold southwest winds prevail  during the remaining months of the year arid scorching northeast winds blow so frequently and so long that everything green becomes parched and shrivelled up  of course this state of things is modified in different localities by the proximity or absence of mountains rivers and sandy plains and there are various periods throughout the year during which the climate is delightful but on the whole it is considered badespecially during the rains when water comes down in such continuous deluges that golddigging and all other work is much interfered withsometimes stopped altogether  at midday in this season there is frequently july heat while in the morning and evening there is january cold  anxious to escape before the weather became worse frank went at once to jeffsons store to obtain supplies settle up accounts and inquire for his friend meyer  he found jeffson looking very illhe having recently had a severe attack of the prevailing complaint but company had recovered completely and was very busy with the duties of his store which company being a warmhearted man included gratuitous attendance on and sympathy with the sick  itll ruin us intirely he was wont to say for we cant stand by and see them die o sickness an intarvation mixed an the poor critters has nothin wotever to pay  howsever vartue is its own reward an we makes the tough miners pay handsome for their supplies which makes up for the sick wans an kapes us goin on hearty enough  and what of meyer asked frank somewhat anxiously  instead of answering jeffson put on his hat and bidding him follow went out of the store  he led him and joe towards a large pinetree at the root of which there was a low mound carefully covered with green turf  pointing to it the yankee storekeeper said with some emotion  there he lies poor fellow and a better more kindhearted or honester man never drove pick and shovel into the airth  in compliance with the request of frank who was deeply moved jeffson told how that after the departure of his friends the poor germans spirits sank and while he was in this state he was prevented from rallying by a severe attack of dysentery which ended in his death  i trust that he was not pressed by poverty at the last said frank  he would have been replied the yankee if he had been allowed to have is own way for being unable to work of course he ran out o golddust and nothing would persuade him to touch the nugget you left in my charge  i hit upon a plan however which answered very well  i supplied him all through his illness with everything that he required to make him as comfortable as could be poor fellow tellin him it was paid for in full by a friend of his whose name i couldnt and wouldnt mention  jeffson says he startin up like a livin skeleton and lookin at me so serious with his hollow eyes jeffson if it bees you dat give me de tings i vill not have dem  i vill die first  you is poor an ve cannot expect you keep all de dyin miners vor noting  well says i i wont go for to say im over rich for times air raither hard just now but it aint me as is the friend  i assure you im paid for it in full so you make your mind easy  with that he lay down an gave a long sigh  he was exhausted and seemed to have dismissed the subject from his mind for he never spoke of it again  i rather suspect said frank that you did not tell him the exact truth  i guess i did replied the yankee  who then was the friend  yourself said jeffson with a peculiar smile  i intend to keep payment of it all off your nugget for you see it is a fact that we aint in very flourishing circumstances at present and i knew you would thank me for not deserting your friend in his distress  you did quite right said frank earnestly and i thank you with all my heart for your kindness to poor meyer as well as your correct estimate of me  frank did not forget that his own resources were at a low ebb just then and that he had been counting on the nugget for the payment of his expenses to the coast and his passage to england but he made no mention of the fact  his comrade joe graddy however could not so easily swallow his disappointment in silence  well said he turning his quid from one cheek to the otherfor joe was guilty of the bad habit of chewing tobaccowell its not for the likes o me to put my opinion contrairy to yourn an in coorse its all very right that our poor messmate should have been looked arter an im very glad he wos  notwithstandin im bound for to say it is raither okard as it stands for were pretty nigh cleaned out an have got to make for the coast in the rainy season wich it appears to me is very like settin sail in a heavy gale without ballast  come joe interposed frank were not quite so hard up as that comes to  there is a little ballast leftsufficient if we only turn to and wash out a little more gold to take us home  sorry to hear youre in such a fix said jeffson still regarding his friends with a peculiar smile on his cadaverous countenance but i think i can get ye out of it  see here he added leading them to another grave not far distant from that of meyer can you guess who lies under the sod there  he was a friend of yours though perhaps you would scarcely have acknowledged him had he been alive  you remember bradling  what our old travelling companion exclaimed frank  the same  why i saved his life only a few days ago  i know it said jeffson he came here late one night all covered with blood and flinging himself down on a bench in my store said that he was done for  and so he was i guessall riddled with bullets none of which however had given him a mortal wound but he had lost so much blood by the way that he had no chance of recovering  i did my best for him poor fellow but he sank rapidly  before he died he told me how you had saved him from being scragged and said that he wanted to make you his heir  poor fellow said frank with a sad smile it was a kind expression of gratitude that i did not expect of him considering his reputation  i spose said joe graddy with a sarcastic laugh that youll be goin to set up your carriage an four an make me your coachman mayhap  i think i may promise that with safety replied frank  indeed you may said jeffson for bradling has been one of the most successful diggers in bigbear gully since you left it and has made his fortune twice over  the value of golddust and nuggets left by him in my charge for you is about ninetysix thousand dollars which i believe is nigh twenty thousands pounds sterling of your money  gammon exclaimed joe  you are jesting said frank  that i am not as you shall see if you will come with me to the store when he felt sure that he was dying bradling asked me to call together a few of the honest and trustworthy men in the diggings  i did so and he told us the amount of his gatherings and after explaining how you had helped him in his hour of need said that he took us all solemnly to witness that he left you his heir  he got one of the miners to write out a will for him and signed it after which he directed us to a tree under which he said his gold was hid  we thought at first that he was raving but after he was dead we went to the tree and there sure enough we found the gold just as he had described it and on weighing it found that it amounted to the sum i have namedso mr allfrey i guess that i may congratulate you on your good fortune  but come i will show you the will and the witnesses  saying this he led them into the store where he showed the will to frank and joe who were at first sceptical and afterwards began to doubt the evidence of their senses  but when the witnesses were called and had confirmed jeffsons statements and above all when the bags of golddust and nuggets were handed over to him frank could no longer question the amazing fact that he had suddenly come into possession of a comfortable fortune  need we say reader that he insisted on sharing it with joe graddy without whose prompt and vigorous aid the rescue of bradling could not have been effected and need we add that the two friends found their way to the seacoast as quickly as possible and set sail for england without delay  we think not  but it may be as well to state that on his arrival in england frank found his old uncle in a very sour condition of mind indeed having become more bilious and irascible than ever over his cashbooks and ledgershis own special diggingswithout having added materially to his gold  when frank made his appearance the old gentleman was very angry supposing that he had returned to be a burden and a bore to him but on learning the true state of the case his feelings towards his successful nephew were wonderfully modified and mollified  it was very difficult at first to convince him of the truth of franks good fortune and he required the most incontestable proofs thereof before he would believe  at length however he was convinced and condescended to offer his nephew his hearty congratulations  now uncle said frank i shall build a house somewhere hereabouts and live beside you  you could not do better said the old gentleman who became suddenly and wonderfully amiable  and i dont intend to bother myself with business uncle  quite right my boy you have no occasion to do so  but i intend to devote much of my time to painting  a most interesting occupation said the tractable old gentleman  and a good deal of it also continued frank to the consideration of the cases of persons in sickness and poverty  hm a most laudable purpose though it has always appeared to me that this is a duty which devolves upon the guardians of the poor nevertheless the intention is creditable to you but i am surprised to hear you who are so young and can have seen so little of poverty or sickness talk of giving much of your time to such work  you are wrong uncle in supposing that i have seen little  during my wanderings in foreign lands i have seen much very much of poverty and sickness and have felt something of both as my friend joe graddy can testify  joe who was sitting by and had been listening to the conversation with much interest bore testimony forthwith by stoutly asserting that that was a fact and slapping his thigh with great vehemence by way of giving emphasis to the assertion  the fact is sir continued joe kindling with enthusiasm that your nephy has gone through a deal o rough work since he left home an im free for to say has learned with myself a lot o walooable lessons he has made his fortin at the goldmines kooriously enough without diggin for it an has come for to know that its sometimes possible to pay too high a price for that same metal as is proved by many an many a lonely grave in the wilds of californy  your nephy an me sir has comed to the conclusion that distributin gold is better than diggin for it so we intends to set up in that line an hopes that your honour will go into pardnership along with us  mr allfrey senior received joes invitation with a benignant and patronising smile but he did not accept it neither did he give him any encouragement to suppose that he sympathised with his views on that subject  there is reason to believe however that his opinions on this head were somewhat modified in after years  if report speaks truly he came to admit the force of that text in scripture which says that as it is certain man brings nothing into the world so he takes nothing out of it and that therefore it was the wisest policy to do as much good with his gold as he could while he possessed it  acting on these convictions it is said he joined the firm of allfrey and graddy and making over his cashbooks and ledgers to the rising generation fairly and finally like his new partners renounced his ancient habit of digging for gold  the end
