in a house hum the son of buz our country neighbours the diverting history of little whiskey    hen that hatched ducks    once there was a nice young hen that we will call mrs feathertop she was a hen of most excellent family being a direct descendant of the bolton grays and as pretty a young fowl as you could wish to see of a summers day  she was moreover as fortunately situated in life as it was possible for a hen to be  she was bought by young master fred little john with four or five family connections of hers and a lively young cock who was held to be as brisk a scratcher and as capable a head of a family as any halfdozen sensible hens could desire  i cant say that at first mrs feathertop was a very sensible hen she was very pretty and lively to be sure and a great favourite with master bolton gray cock on account of her bright eyes her finely shaded feathers and certain saucy dashing ways that she had which seemed greatly to take his fancy  but old mrs scratchard living in the neighbouring yard assured all the neighbourhood that gray cock was a fool for thinking so much of that flighty young thing that she had not the smallest notion how to get on in life and thought of nothing in the world but her own pretty feathers wait till she comes to have chickens said mrs scratchard then you will see  i have brought up ten broods myselfas likely and respectable chickens as ever were a blessing to societyand i think i ought to know a good hatcher and brooder when i see her and i know that fine piece of trumpery with her white feathers tipped with gray never will come down to family life  she scratch for chickens bless me she never did anything in all her days but run round and eat the worms which somebody else scratched up for her  when master bolton gray heard this he crowed very loudly like a cock of spirit and declared that old mrs scratchard was envious because she had lost all her own tailfeathers and looked more like a worn out old featherduster than a respectable hen and that therefore she was filled with sheer envy of anybody that was young and pretty  so young mrs feathertop cackled gay defiance at her busy rubbishy neighbour as she sunned herself under the bushes on fine june afternoons  now master fred little john had been allowed to have these hens by his mamma on the condition that he would build their house himself and take all the care of it and to do master fred justice he executed the job in a small way quite creditably  he chose a sunny sloping bank covered with a thick growth of bushes and erected there a nice little henhouse with two glass windows a little door and a good pole for his family to roost on  he made moreover a row of nice little boxes with hay in them for nests and he bought three or four little smooth white china eggs to put in them so that when his hens did lay he might carry off their eggs without their being missed  this henhouse stood in a little grove that sloped down to a wide river just where there was a little cove which reached almost to the henhouse  this situation inspired one of master freds boy advisers with a new scheme in relation to his poultry enterprise  hallo  i say fred said tom seymour you ought to raise ducks youve got a capital place for ducks there  yes but ive bought hens you see said freddy so its no use trying  no use  of course there is  just as if your hens couldnt hatch ducks eggs  now you just wait till one of your hens wants to sit and you put ducks eggs under her and youll have a family of ducks in a twinkling  you can buy ducks eggs a plenty of old sam under the hill  he always has hens hatch his ducks  so freddy thought it would be a good experiment and informed his mother the next morning that he intended to furnish the ducks for the next christmas dinner and when she wondered how he was to come by them he said mysteriously oh i will show you how but did not further explain himself  the next day he went with tom seymour and made a trade with old sam and gave him a middleaged jackknife for eight of his ducks eggs  sam bytheby was a woollyheaded old negro man who lived by the pond hard by and who had long cast envying eyes on freds jackknife because it was of extra fine steel having been a christmas present the year before  but fred knew very well there were any number more of jackknives where that came from and that in order to get a new one he must dispose of the old so he made the purchase and came home rejoicing  now about this time mrs feathertop having laid her eggs daily with great credit to herself notwithstanding mrs scratchards predictions began to find herself suddenly attacked with nervous symptoms  she lost her gay spirits grew dumpish and morose stuck up her feathers in a bristling way and pecked at her neighbours if they did so much as look at her  master gray cock was greatly concerned and went to old dr peppercorn who looked solemn and recommended an infusion of angleworms and said he would look in on the patient twice a day till she was better  gracious me gray cock said old goody kertarkut who had been lolling at the corner as he passed aint you a foolcocks always are fools  dont you know whats the matter with your wife  she wants to sit thats all and you just let her sit  a fiddlestick for dr peppercorn  why any good old hen that has brought up a family knows more than a doctor about such things  you just go home and tell her to sit if she wants to and behave herself  when gray cock came home he found that master freddy had been before him and had established mrs feathertop upon eight nice eggs where she was sitting in gloomy grandeur  he tried to make a little affable conversation with her and to relate his interview with the doctor and goody kertarkut but she was morose and sullen and only pecked at him now and then in a very sharp unpleasant way  so after a few more efforts to make himself agreeable he left her and went out promenading with the captivating mrs red comb a charming young spanish widow who had just been imported into the neighbouring yard  bless my soul said he youve no idea how cross my wife is  o you horrid creature said mrs red comb  how little you feel for the weaknesses of us poor hens  on my word maam said gray cock you do me injustice  but when a hen gives way to temper maam and no longer meets her husband with a smilewhen she even pecks at him whom she is bound to honour and obey  horrid monster talking of obedience  i should say sir you came straight from turkey  and mrs red comb tossed her head with a most bewitching air and pretended to run away and old mrs scratchard looked out of her coop and called to goody kertarkut   look how mr gray cock is flirting with that widow  i always knew she was a baggage  and his poor wife left at home alone said goody kertarkut  its the way with em all  yes yes said dame scratchard shell know what real life is now and she wont go about holding her head so high and looking down on her practical neighbours that have raised families  poor thing whatll she do with a family said goody kertarkut  well what business have such young flirts to get married said dame scratchard  i dont expect shell raise a single chick and theres gray cock flirting about fine as ever  folks didnt do so when i was young  im sure my husband knew what treatment a sitting hen ought to havepoor old long spur he never minded a peck or so and then  i must say these modern fowls aint what fowls used to be  meanwhile the sun rose and set and master fred was almost the only friend and associate of poor little mrs feathertop whom he fed daily with meal and water and only interrupted her sad reflections by pulling her up occasionally to see how the eggs were coming on  at last peep peep peep began to be heard in the nest and one little downy head after another poked forth from under the feathers surveying the world with round bright winking eyes and gradually the brood were hatched and mrs feathertop arose a proud and happy mother with all the bustling scratching caretaking instincts of familylife warm within her breast  she clucked and scratched and cuddled the little downy bits of things as handily and discreetly as a sevenyearold hen could have done exciting thereby the wonder of the community  master gray cock came home in high spirits and complimented her told her she was looking charmingly once more and said very well very nice as he surveyed the young brood  so that mrs feathertop began to feel the world going well with her when suddenly in came dame scratchard and goody kertarkut to make a morning call  lets see the chicks said dame scratchard  goodness me said goody kertarkut what a likeness to their dear papa  well but bless me whats the matter with their bills said dame scratchard  why my dear these chicks are deformed  im sorry for you my dear but its all the result of your inexperience  you ought to have eaten pebblestones with your meal when you were sitting  dont you see dame kertarkut what bills they have thatll increase and theyll be frightful  what shall i do said mrs feathertop now greatly alarmed  nothing as i know of said dame scratchard since you didnt come to me before you sat  i could have told you all about it  maybe it wont kill em but theyll always be deformed  and so the gossips departed leaving a sting under the pinfeathers of the poor little hen mamma who began to see that her darlings had curious little spoonbills different from her own and to worry and fret about it  my dear she said to her spouse do get dr peppercorn to come in and look at their bills and see if anything can be done  dr peppercorn came in and put on a monstrous pair of spectacles and said hum ha extraordinary case very singular  did you ever see anything like it doctor said both parents in a breath  ive read of such cases  its a calcareous enlargement of the vascular bony tissue threatening ossification said the doctor  oh dreadful  can it be possible shrieked both parents  can anything be done  well i should recommend a daily lotion made of mosquitoes horns and bicarbonate of frogs toes together with a powder to be taken morning and night of muriate of fleas  one thing you must be careful about  they must never wet their feet nor drink any water  dear me doctor i dont know what i shall do for they seem to have a particular fancy for getting into water  yes a morbid tendency often found in these cases of bony tumification of the vascular tissue of the mouth but you must resist it maam as their life depends upon it  and with that dr peppercorn glared gloomily on the young ducks who were stealthily poking the objectionable little spoonbills out from under their mothers feathers  after this poor mrs feathertop led a weary life of it for the young fry were as healthy and enterprising a brood of young ducks as ever carried saucepans on the end of their noses and they most utterly set themselves against the doctors prescriptions murmured at the muriate of fleas and the bicarbonate of frogs toes and took every opportunity to waddle their little ways down to the mud and water which was in their near vicinity  so their bills grew larger and larger as did the rest of their bodies and family government grew weaker and weaker  youll wear me out children you certainly will said poor mrs feathertop  youll go to destruction do ye hear said master gray cock  did you ever see such frights as poor mrs feathertop has got said dame scratchard  i knew what would come of her familyall deformed and with a dreadful sort of madness which makes them love to shovel mud with those shocking spoonbills of theirs  its a kind of idiocy said goody kertarkut  poor things they cant be kept from the water nor made to take powders and so they get worse and worse  i understand its affecting their feet so that they cant walk and a dreadful sort of net is growing between their toes  what a shocking visitation  she brought it on herself said dame scratchard  why didnt she come to me before she sat  she was always an upstart selfconceited thing but im sure i pity her  meanwhile the young ducks throve apace  their necks grew glossy like changeable green and gold satin and though they would not take the doctors medicine and would waddle in the mud and waterfor which they always felt themselves to be very naughty ducksyet they grew quite vigorous and hearty  at last one day the whole little tribe waddled off down to the bank of the river  it was a beautiful day and the river was dancing and dimpling and winking as the little breezes shook the trees that hung over it  well said the biggest of the little ducks in spite of dr peppercorn i cant help longing for the water  i dont believe it is going to hurt me at any rate here goes and in he plumped and in went every duck after him and they threw out their great brown feet as cleverly as if they had taken swimming lessons all their lives and sailed off on the river away away among the ferns under the pink azaleas through reeds and rushes and arrowheads and pickerelweed the happiest ducks that ever were born and soon they were quite out of sight  well mrs feathertop this is a dispensation said mrs scratchard  your children are all drowned at last just as i knew theyd be  the old musicteacher master bullfrog that lives down in waterdock lane saw em all plump madly into the water together this morning  thats what comes of not knowing how to bring up a family  mrs feathertop gave only one shriek and fainted dead away and was carried home on a cabbageleaf and mr gray cock was sent for where he was waiting on mrs red comb through the squashvines  its a serious time in your family sir said goody kertarkut and you ought to be at home supporting your wife  send for dr peppercorn without delay  now as the case was a very dreadful one dr peppercorn called a council from the barnyard of the squire two miles off and a brisk young dr partlett appeared in a fine suit of brown and gold with tailfeathers like meteors  a fine young fellow he was lately from paris with all the modern scientific improvements fresh in his head  when he had listened to the whole story he clapped his spur into the ground and leaning back laughed so loudly that all the cocks in the neighbourhood crowed  mrs feathertop rose up out of her swoon and mr gray cock was greatly enraged  what do you mean sir by such behaviour in the house of mourning  my dear sir pardon me but there is no occasion for mourning  my dear madam let me congratulate you  there is no harm done  the simple matter is dear madam you have been under a hallucination all along  the neighbourhood and my learned friend the doctor have all made a mistake in thinking that these children of yours were hens at all  they are ducks maam evidently ducks and very finelyformed ducks i daresay  at this moment a quack was heard and at a distance the whole tribe were seen coming waddling home their feathers gleaming in green and gold and they themselves in high good spirits  such a splendid day as we have had they all cried in a breath and we know now how to get our own living we can take care of ourselves in future so you need have no further trouble with us  madam said the doctor making a bow with an air which displayed his tailfeathers to advantage let me congratulate you on the charming family you have raised  a finer brood of young healthy ducks i never saw  give me your claw my dear friend he said addressing the eldest son  in our barnyard no family is more respected than that of the ducks  and so madam feathertop came off glorious at last  and when after this the ducks used to go swimming up and down the river like so many nabobs among the admiring hens dr peppercorn used to look after them and say ah i had the care of their infancy and mr gray cock and his wife used to say it was our system of education did that    the nutcrackers of nutcracker lodge    mr and mrs nutcracker were as respectable a pair of squirrels as ever wore gray brushes over their backs  they were animals of a settled and serious turn of mind not disposed to run after vanities and novelties but filling their station in life with prudence and sobriety  nutcracker lodge was a hole in a sturdy old chestnut overhanging a shady dell and was held to be as respectably kept an establishment as there was in the whole forest  even miss jenny wren the greatest gossip of the neighbourhood never found anything to criticise in its arrangements and old parson toowhit a venerable owl who inhabited a branch somewhat more exalted as became his profession was in the habit of saving himself much trouble in his parochial exhortations by telling his parishioners in short to look at the nutcrackers if they wanted to see what it was to live a virtuous life  everything had gone on prosperously with them and they had reared many successive families of young nutcrackers who went forth to assume their places in the forest of life and to reflect credit on their bringing upso that naturally enough they began to have a very easy way of considering themselves models of wisdom  but at last it came along in the course of events that they had a son named featherhead who was destined to bring them a great deal of anxiety  nobody knows what the reason is but the fact was that master featherhead was as different from all the former children of this worthy couple as if he had been dropped out of the moon into their nest instead of coming into it in the general way  young featherhead was a squirrel of good parts and a lively disposition but he was sulky and contrary and unreasonable and always finding matter of complaint in everything his respectable papa and mamma did instead of assisting in the cares of a familypicking up nuts and learning other lessons proper to a young squirrelhe seemed to settle himself from his earliest years into a sort of lofty contempt for the nutcrackers for nutcracker lodge and for all the good old ways and institutions of the domestic hole which he declared to be stupid and unreasonable and entirely behind the times  to be sure he was always on hand at mealtimes and played a very lively tooth on the nuts which his mother had collected always selecting the very best for himself but he seasoned his nibbling with so much grumbling and discontent and so many severe remarks as to give the impression that he considered himself a peculiarly illused squirrel in having to eat their old grub as he very unceremoniously called it  papa nutcracker on these occasions was often fiercely indignant and poor little mamma nutcracker would shed tears and beg her darling to be a little more reasonable but the young gentleman seemed always to consider himself as the injured party  now nobody could tell why or wherefore master featherhead looked upon himself as injured or aggrieved since he was living in a good hole with plenty to eat and without the least care or labour of his own but he seemed rather to value himself upon being gloomy and dissatisfied  while his parents and brothers and sisters were cheerfully racing up and down the branches busy in their domestic toils and laying up stores for the winter featherhead sat gloomily apart declaring himself weary of existence and feeling himself at liberty to quarrel with everybody and everything about him  nobody understood him he saidhe was a squirrel of a peculiar nature and needed peculiar treatment and nobody treated him in a way that did not grate on the finer nerves of his feelings  he had higher notions of existence than could be bounded by that old rotten hole in a hollow tree he had thoughts that soared far above the miserable petty details of everyday life and he could not and would not bring down these soaring aspirations to the contemptible toil of laying up a few chestnuts or hickorynuts for winter  depend upon it my dear said mrs nutcracker solemnly that fellow must be a genius  fiddlestick on his genius said old mr nutcracker what does he do  oh nothing of course thats one of the first marks of genius geniuses you know never can come down to common life  he eats enough for any two remarked old nutcracker and he never helps to gather nuts  my dear ask parson toowhit  he has conversed with him and quite agrees with me that he says very uncommon things for a squirrel of his age he has such fine feelingsso much above those of the common crowd  fine feelings be hanged said old nutcracker  when a fellow eats all the nuts that his mother gives him and then grumbles at her i dont believe much in his fine feelings  why dont he set himself about something  im going to tell my fine young gentleman that if he doesnt behave himself ill tumble him out of the nest neck and crop and see if hunger wont do something towards bringing down his fine airs  but then mrs nutcracker fell on her husbands neck with both paws and wept and besought him so piteously to have patience with her darling that old nutcracker who was himself a softhearted old squirrel was prevailed upon to put up with the airs and graces of his young scapegrace a little longer and secretly in his silly old heart he revolved the question whether possibly it might not be that a great genius was actually to come of his household  the nutcrackers belonged to the oldestablished race of the grays but they were sociable friendly people and kept on the best of terms with all branches of the nutcracker family  the chipmunks of chipmunk hollow were a very lively cheerful sociable race and on the very best of terms with the nutcracker grays  young tip chipmunk the oldest son was in all respects a perfect contrast to master featherhead  he was always lively and cheerful and so very alert in providing for the family that old mr and mrs chipmunk had very little care but could sit sociably at the door of their hole and chat with neighbours quite sure that tip would bring everything out right for them and have plenty laid up for winter  now featherhead took it upon him for some reason or other to look down upon tip chipmunk and on every occasion to disparage him in the social circle as a very common kind of squirrel with whom it would be best not to associate too freely  my dear said mrs nutcracker one day when he was expressing these ideas it seems to me that you are too hard on poor tip he is a most excellent son and brother and i wish you would be civil to him  oh i dont doubt that tip is good enough said featherhead carelessly but then he is so very common he hasnt an idea in his skull above his nuts and his hole  he is goodnatured enough to be surethese very ordinary people often are goodnaturedbut he wants manner he has really no manner at all and as to the deeper feelings tip hasnt the remotest idea of them  i mean always to be civil to tip when he comes in my way but i think the less we see of that sort of people the better and i hope mother you wont invite the chipmunks at christmasthese family dinners are such a bore  but my dear your father thinks a great deal of the chipmunks and it is an old family custom to have all the relatives here at christmas  and an awful bore it is  why must people of refinement and elevation be forever tied down because of some distant relationship now there are our cousins the highflyersif we could get them there would be some sense in it  young whisk rather promised me for christmas but its seldom now you can get a flying squirrel to show himself in our parts and if we are intimate with the chipmunks it isnt to be expected  confound him for a puppy said old nutcracker when his wife repeated these sayings to him  featherhead is a fool  common forsooth  i wish good industrious painstaking sons like tip chipmunk were common  for my part i find these uncommon people the most tiresome  they are not content with letting us carry the whole load but they sit on it and scold at us while we carry them  but old mr nutcracker like many other good old gentlemen squirrels found that christmas dinners and other things were apt to go as his wife said and his wife was apt to go as young featherhead said and so when christmas came the chipmunks were not invited for the first time in many years  the chipmunks however took all pleasantly and accepted poor old mrs nutcrackers awkward apologies with the best possible grace and young tip looked in on christmas morning with the compliments of the season and a few beechnuts which he had secured as a great dainty  the fact was that tips little striped fur coat was so filled up and overflowing with cheerful goodwill to all that he never could be made to understand that any of his relations could want to cut him and therefore featherhead looked down on him with contempt and said he had no tact and couldnt see when he was not wanted  it was wonderful to see how by means of persisting in remarks like these young featherhead at last got all his family to look up to him as something uncommon  though he added nothing to the family and required more to be done for him than all the others put together though he showed not the smallest real perseverance or ability in anything usefulyet somehow all his brothers and sisters and his poor foolish old mother got into a way of regarding him as something wonderful and delighting in his sharp sayings as if they had been the wisest things in the world  but at last old papa declared that it was time for featherhead to settle himself to some business in life roundly declaring that he could not always have him as a hangeron in the paternal hole  what are you going to do my boy said tip chipmunk to him one day we are driving now a thriving trade in hickorynuts and if you would like to join us  thank you said featherhead but i confess i have no fancy for anything so slow as the hickory trade i never was made to grub and delve in that way  the fact was that featherhead had lately been forming alliances such as no reputable squirrel should even think of  he had more than once been seen going out evenings with the rats of rat hollowa race whose reputation for honesty was more than doubtful  the fact was further that old longtooth rat an old sharper and moneylender had long had his eye on featherhead as just about silly enough for their purposesengaging him in what he called a speculation but which was neither more nor less than downright stealing  near by the chestnuttree where nutcracker lodge was situated was a large barn filled with corn and grain besides many bushels of hazel nuts chestnuts and walnuts  now old longtooth proposed to young featherhead that he should nibble a passage into this loft and there establish himself in the commission business passing the nuts and corn to him as he wanted them  old longtooth knew what he was about in the proposal for he had heard talk of a brisk scotch terrier that was about to be bought to keep the rats from the grain but you may be sure he kept his knowledge to himself so that featherhead was none the wiser for it  the nonsense of fellows like tip chipmunk said featherhead to his admiring brothers and sistersthe perfectly stupid nonsense  there he goes delving and poking picking up a nut here and a grain there when i step into property at once  but i hope my son you are careful to be honest in your dealings said old nutcracker who was a very moral squirrel  with that young featherhead threw his tail saucily over one shoulder winked knowingly at his brothers and said certainly sir  if honesty consists in getting what you can while it is going i mean to be honest  very soon featherhead appeared to his admiring companions in the height of prosperity  he had a splendid hole in the midst of a heap of chestnuts and he literally seemed to be rolling in wealth he never came home without showering lavish gifts on his mother and sisters he wore his tail over his back with a buckish air and patronized tip chipmunk with a gracious nod whenever he met him and thought that the world was going well with him  but one luckless day as featherhead was lolling in his hole up came two boys with the friskiest wiriest scotch terrier you ever saw his eyes blazed like torches and poor featherheads heart died within him as he heard the boys say now well see if we cant catch the rascal that eats our grain  featherhead tried to slink out at the hole he had gnawed to come in by but found it stopped  oh you are there are you mister said the boy  well you dont get out and now for a chase  and sure enough poor featherhead ran distracted with terror up and down through the bundles of hay between barrels and over casks but with the barking terrier ever at his heels and the boys running shouting and cheering his pursuer on  he was glad at last to escape through a crack though he left half of his fine brush behind him for master wasp the terrier made a snap at it just as he was going and cleaned all the hair off of it so that it was bare as a rats tail  poor featherhead limped off bruised and beaten and bedraggled with the boys and dog still after him and they would have caught him after all if tip chipmunks hole had not stood hospitably open to receive him  tip took him in like a goodnatured fellow as he was and took the best of care of him but the glory of featherheads tail had departed for ever  he had sprained his left paw and got a chronic rheumatism and the fright and fatigue which he had gone through had broken up his constitution so that he never again could be what he had been but tip gave him a situation as underclerk in his establishment and from that time he was a sadder and a wiser squirrel than he ever had been before    the history of tiptop    under the window of a certain pretty little cottage there grew a great old appletree which in the spring had thousands and thousands of lovely pink blossoms on it and in the autumn had about half as many bright red apples as it had blossoms in the spring  the nursery of this cottage was a little bower of a room papered with mossygreen paper and curtained with white muslin and here five little children used to come in their white nightgowns to be dressed and have their hair brushed and curled every morning  first there were alice and mary brighteyed laughing little girls of seven and eight years and then came stout little jamie and charlie and finally little puss whose real name was ellen but who was called puss and pussy and birdie and toddlie and any other pet name that came to mind  now it used to happen every morning that the five little heads would be peeping out of the window together into the flowery boughs of the appletree and the reason was this  a pair of robins had built a very pretty smoothlined nest in a fork of the limb that came directly under the window and the building of this nest had been superintended day by day by the five pairs of bright eyes of these five children  the robins at first had been rather shy of this inspection but as they got better acquainted they seemed to think no more of the little curly heads in the window than of the pink blossoms about them or the daisies and buttercups at the foot of the tree  all the little hands were forward to help some threw out flossy bits of cottonfor which we grieve to say charlie had cut a hole in the crib quiltand some threw out bits of thread and yarn and allie ravelled out a considerable piece from one of her garters which she threw out as a contribution and they exulted in seeing the skill with which the little builders wove everything in  little birds little birds they would say you shall be kept warm for we have given you cotton out of our crib quilt and yarn out of our stockings  nay so far did this generosity proceed that charlie cut a flossy golden curl from toddlies head and threw it out and when the birds caught it up the whole flock laughed to see toddlies golden hair figuring in a birdsnest  when the little thing was finished it was so neat and trim and workmanlike that the children all exulted over it and called it our nest and the two robins they called our birds  but wonderful was the joy when the little eyes opening one morning saw in the nest a beautiful palegreen egg and the joy grew from day to day for every day there came another egg and so on till there were five little eggs and then the oldest girl alice said there are five eggs  that makes one for each of us and each of us will have a little bird byandbyat which all the children laughed and jumped for glee  when the five little eggs were all laid the motherbird began to sit on them and at any time of day or night when a little head peeped out of the nursery window might be seen a round bright patient pair of birds eyes contentedly waiting for the young birds to come it seemed a long time for the children to wait but every day they put some bread and cake from their luncheon on the windowsill so that the birds might have something to eat but still there she was patiently sitting  how long long long she waits said jamie impatiently  i dont believe shes ever going to hatch  oh yes she is said grave little alice  jamie you dont understand about these things it takes a long long time to hatch eggs  old sam says his hens sit three weeksonly think almost a month  three weeks looked a long time to the five bright pairs of little watching eyes but jamie said the eggs were so much smaller than hens eggs that it wouldnt take so long to hatch them he knew jamie always thought he knew all about everything and was so sure of it that he rather took the lead among the children  but one morning when they pushed their five heads out of the window the round patient little birdeyes were gone and there seemed to be nothing in the nest but a bunch of something hairy  upon this they all cried out o mamma do come here the bird is gone and left her nest  and when they cried out they saw five wide little red mouths open in the nest and saw that the hairy bunch of stuff was indeed the first of five little birds  they are dreadfullooking things said mary i didnt know that little birds began by looking so badly  they seem to be all mouth said jamie  we must feed them said charliehere little birds heres some gingerbread for you he said and he threw a bit of his gingerbread which fortunately only hit the nest on the outside and fell down among the buttercups where two crickets made a meal of it and agreed that it was as excellent gingerbread as if old mother cricket herself had made it  take care charlie said his mamma we do not know enough to feed young birds  we must leave that to their papa and mamma who probably started out bright and early in the morning to get breakfast for them  sure enough while they were speaking back came mr and mrs robin whirring through the green shadows of the apple tree and thereupon all the five little red mouths flew open and the birds put something into each  it was great amusement after this to watch the daily feeding of the little birds and to observe how when not feeding them the mother sat brooding on the nest warming them under her soft wings while the fatherbird sat on the topmost bough of the appletree and sang to them  in time they grew and grew and instead of a nest full of little red mouths there was a nest full of little fat speckled robins with round bright cunning eyes just like their parents and the children began to talk together about their birds  im going to give my robin a name said mary  i call him brown eyes  and i call mine tiptop said jamie because i know hell be a tiptop bird  and i call mine singer said alice  i all mine toddy said little toddlie who would not be behindhand in anything that was going on  hurrah for toddlie said charlie hers is the best of all  for my part i call mine speckle  so then the birds were all made separate characters by having each a separate name given it  browneyes tiptop singer toddy and speckle made as they grew bigger a very crowded nestful of birds  now the children had early been taught to say in a little hymn   birds in their little nests agree and tie a shameful sight when children of one family fall out and chide and fight    and they thought anything really written and printed in a hymn must be true therefore they were very much astonished to see from day to day that their little birds in their nest did not agree  tiptop was the biggest and strongest bird and he was always shuffling and crowding the others and clamouring for the most food and when mrs robin came in with a nice bit of anything tiptops red mouth opened so wide and he was so noisy that one would think the nest was all his  his mother used to correct him for these gluttonous ways and sometimes made him wait till all the rest were helped before she gave him a mouthful but he generally revenged himself in her absence by crowding the others and making the nest generally uncomfortable  speckle however was a bird of spirit and he used to peck at tiptop so they would sometimes have a regular sparringmatch across poor browneyes who was a meek tender little fellow and would sit winking and blinking in fear while his big brothers quarrelled  as to toddy and singer they turned out to be sister birds and showed quite a feminine talent for chattering they used to scold their badly behaving brothers in a way that made the nest quite lively  on the whole mr and mrs robin did not find their family circle the peaceable place the poet represents  i say said tiptop one day to them this old nest is a dull mean crowded hole and its quite time some of us were out of it just give us lessons in flying wont you and let us go  my dear boy said mother robin we shall teach you to fly as soon as your wings are strong enough  you are a very little bird said his father and ought to be good and obedient and wait patiently till your wingfeathers grow and then you can soar away to some purpose  wait for my wingfeathers  humbug tiptop would say as he sat balancing with his little short tail on the edge of the nest and looking down through the grass and cloverheads below and up into the blue clouds above  father and mother are slow old birds they keep a fellow back with their confounded notions  if they dont hurry up ill take matters into my own claws and be off some day before they know it  look at those swallows skimming and diving through the blue air  thats the way i want to do  but dear brother the way to learn to do that is to be good and obedient while we are little and wait till our parents think it best for us to begin  shut up your preaching said tiptop what do you girls know of flying  about as much as you said speckle  however im sure i dont care how soon you take yourself off for you take up more room than all the rest put together  you mind yourself master speckle or youll get something you dont like said tiptop still strutting in a very cavalier way on the edge of the nest and sticking up his little short tail quite valiantly  o my darlings said their mamma now fluttering home cannot i ever teach you to live in love  its all tiptops fault screamed the other birds in a flutter  my fault  of course everything in this nest that goes wrong is laid to me said tiptop and ill leave it to anybody now if i crowd anybody  ive been sitting outside on the very edge of the nest and theres speckle has got my place  who wants your place said speckle  im sure you can come in if you please  my dear boy said the mother do go into the nest and be a good little bird and then you will be happy  thats always the talk said tiptop  im too big for the nest and i want to see the world  its full of beautiful things i know now theres the most lovely creature with bright eyes that comes under the tree every day and wants me to come down in the grass and play with her  my son my son beware said the frightened mother that lovely seeming creature is our dreadful enemy the cata horrid monster with teeth and claws  at this all the little birds shuddered and cuddled deeper in the nest only tiptop in his heart disbelieved it  im too old a bird said he to himself to believe that story mother is chaffing me  but ill show her that i can take care of myself  so the next morning after the father and mother were gone tiptop got on the edge of the nest again and looked over and saw lovely miss pussy washing her face among the daisies under the tree and her hair was sleek and white as the daisies and her eyes were yellow and beautiful to behold and she looked up to the tree bewitchingly and said little birds little birds come down pussy wants to play with you  only look at her said tiptop her eyes are like gold  no dont look said singer and speckle  she will bewitch you and then eat you up  id like to see her try to eat me up said tiptop again balancing his short tail over the nest  just as if she would  shes just the nicest most innocent creature going and only wants us to have fun we never do have any fun in this old nest  then the yellow eyes below shot a bewildering light into tiptops eyes and a voice sounded sweet as silver  little birds little birds come down pussy wants to play with you  her paws are as white as velvet said tiptop and so soft  i dont believe she has any claws  dont go brother dont screamed both sisters  all we know about it is that a moment after a direful scream was heard from the nursery window  o mamma mamma do come here  tip tops fallen out of the nest and the cat has got him  away ran pussy with foolish little tiptop in her mouth and he squeaked dolefully when he felt her sharp teeth  wicked miss pussy had no mind to eat him at once she meant just as she said to play with him  so she ran off to a private place among the currant bushes while all the little curly heads were scattered up and down looking for her  did you ever see a cat play with a bird or a mouse  she sets it down and seems to go off and leave it but the moment it makes the first movement to get awaypounce she springs on it and shakes it in her mouth and so she teases and tantalizes it till she gets ready to kill and eat it  i cant say why she does it except that it is a cats nature and it is a very bad nature for foolish young robins to get acquainted with  oh where is he where is he  do find my poor tiptop said jamie crying as loud as he could scream  ill kill that horrid catill kill her  mr and mrs robin who had come home meantime joined their plaintive chirping to the general confusion and mrs robins bright eyes soon discovered her poor little son where pussy was patting and rolling him from one paw to the other under the currantbushes and settling on the bush above she called the little folks to the spot by her cries  jamie plunged under the bush and caught the cat with luckless tip top in her mouth and with one or two good thumps he obliged her to let him go  tiptop was not dead but in a sadly draggled and torn state  some of his feathers were torn out and one of his wings was broken and hung down in a melancholy way  oh what shall we do for him  he will die  poor tiptop said the children  lets put him back into the nest children said mamma  his mother will know best what to do with him  so a ladder was got and papa climbed up and put poor tiptop safely into the nest  the cat had shaken all the nonsense well out of him he was a dreadfully humbled young robin  the time came at last when all the other birds in the nest learned to fly and fluttered and flew about everywhere but poor melancholy tiptop was still confined to the nest with a broken wing  finally as it became evident that it would be long before he could fly jamie took him out of the nest and made a nice little cage for him and used to feed him every day and he would hop about and seem tolerably contented but it was evident that he would be a lamewinged robin all his days  jamies mother told him that tiptops history was an allegory  i dont know what you mean mamma said jamie  when something in a birds life is like something in a boys life or when a story is similar in its meaning to reality we call it an allegory  little boys when they are about half grown up sometimes do just as tiptop did  they are in a great hurry to get away from home into the great world and then temptation comes with bright eyes and smooth velvet paws and promises them fun and they go to bad places they get to smoking and then to drinking and finally the bad habit gets them in its teeth and claws and plays with them as a cat does with a mouse  they try to reform just as your robin tried to get away from the cat but their bad habits pounce on them and drag them back  and so when the time comes that they want to begin life they are miserable brokendown creatures like your brokenwinged robin  so jamie remember and dont try to be a man before your time and let your parents judge for you while you are young and never believe in any soft white pussy with golden eyes that comes and wants to tempt you to come down and play with her  if a big boy offers to teach you to smoke a cigar that is pussy  if a boy wants you to go into a billiardsaloon that is pussy  if a boy wants you to learn to drink anything with spirit in it however sweetened and disguised remember pussy is there  and pussys claws are long and pussys teeth are strong and if she gives you one shake in your youth you will be like a brokenwinged robin all your days    miss katydid and miss cricket    miss katydid sat on the branch of a flowering azalea in her best suit of fine green and silver with wings of pointlace from mother natures finest web  miss katy was in the very highest possible spirits because her gallant cousin colonel katydid had looked in to make her a morning visit  it was a fine morning too which goes for as much among the katydids as among men and women  it was in fact a morning that miss katy thought must have been made on purpose for her to enjoy herself in  there had been a patter of rain the night before which had kept the leaves awake talking to each other till nearly morning but by dawn the small winds had blown brisk little puffs and whisked the heavens clear and bright with their tiny wings as you have seen susan clear away the cobwebs in your mammas parlour and so now there were only left a thousand blinking burning waterdrops hanging like convex mirrors at the end of each leaf and miss katy admired herself in each one  certainly i am a pretty creature she said to herself and when the gallant colonel said something about being dazzled by her beauty she only tossed her head and took it as quite a matter of course  the fact is my dear colonel she said i am thinking of giving a party and you must help me to make out the lists  my dear you make me the happiest of katydids  now said miss katydid drawing an azalealeaf towards her let us seewhom shall we have  the fireflies of course everybody wants them they are so brillianta little unsteady to be sure but quite in the higher circles  yes we must have the fireflies echoed the colonel  well then and the butterflies and the moths  now theres a trouble  theres such an everlasting tribe of those moths and if you invite dull people theyre always sure all to come every one of them  still if you have the butterflies you cant leave out the moths  old mrs moth has been laid up lately with a gastric fever and that may keep two or three of the misses moth at home said the colonel  whatever could give the old lady such a turn said miss katy  i thought she never was sick  i suspect its high living  i understand she and her family ate up a whole ermine cape last month and it disagreed with them  for my part i cant conceive how the moths can live as they do said miss katy with a face of disgust  why i could no more eat worsted and fur as they do  that is quite evident from the fairylike delicacy of your appearance said the colonel  one can see that nothing so gross or material has ever entered into your system  im sure said miss katy mamma says she dont know what does keep me alive half a dewdrop and a little bit of the nicest part of a roseleaf i assure you often last me for a day  but we are forgetting our list  lets seethe fireflies butterflies moths the bees must come i suppose  the bees are a worthy family said the colonel  worthy enough but dreadfully humdrum said miss katy  they never talk about anything but honey and housekeeping still they are a class of people one cannot neglect  well then there are the bumblebees  oh i dote on them  general bumble is one of the most dashing brilliant fellows of the day  i think he is shockingly corpulent said colonel katydid not at all pleased to hear him praised dont you  i dont know but he is a little stout said miss katy but so distinguished and elegant in his mannerssomething quite martial and breezy about him  well if you invite the bumblebees you must have the hornets  those spiteful hornets  i detest them  nevertheless dear miss katy one does not like  to offend the hornets  no one cant  there are those five misses hornetdreadful old maidsas full of spite as they can live  you may be sure they will every one come and be looking about to make spiteful remarks  put down the hornets though  how about the mosquitoes said the colonel  those horrid mosquitoesthey are dreadfully plebeian  cant one cut them  well dear miss katy said the colonel if you ask my candid opinion as a friend i should say not  theres young mosquito who graduated last year has gone into literature and is connected with some of our leading papers and they say he carries the sharpest pen of all the writers  it wont do to offend him  and so i suppose we must have his old aunts and all six of his sisters and all his dreadfully common relations  it is a pity said the colonel but one must pay ones tax to society  just at this moment the conference was interrupted by a visitor miss keziah cricket who came in with her workbag on her arm to ask a subscription for a poor family of ants who had just had their house hoed up in clearing the gardenwalks  how stupid of them said katy not to know better than to put their house in the gardenwalk thats just like those ants  well they are in great trouble all their stores destroyed and their father killedcut quite in two by a hoe  how very shocking  i dont like to hear of such disagreeable things it affects my nerves terribly  well im sure i havent anything to give  mamma said yesterday she was sure she didnt know how our bills were to be paid and theres my green satin with point lace yet to come home  and miss katydid shrugged her shoulders and affected to be very busy with colonel katydid in just the way that young ladies sometimes do when they wish to signify to visitors that they had better leave  little miss cricket perceived how the case stood and so hopped briskly off without giving herself even time to be offended  poor extravagant little thing said she to herself it was hardly worth while to ask her  pray shall you invite the crickets said colonel katydid  who  i  why colonel what a question  invite the crickets  of what can you be thinking  and shall you not ask the locusts and the grasshoppers  certainly  the locusts of coursea very old and distinguished family and the grasshoppers are pretty well and ought to be asked but we must draw a line somewhereand the crickets why its shocking even to think of  i thought they were nice respectable people  oh perfectly nice and respectablevery good people in fact so far as that goes  but then you must see the difficulty  my dear cousin i am afraid you must explain  why their colour to be sure  dont you see  oh said the colonel  thats it is it  excuse me but i have been living in france where these distinctions are wholly unknown and i have not yet got myself in the train of fashionable ideas here  well then let me teach you said miss katy  you know we republicans go for no distinctions except those created by nature herself and we found our rank upon colour because that is clearly a thing that none has any hand in but our maker  you see  yes but who decides what colour shall be the reigning colour  im surprised to hear the question  the only true colourthe only proper oneis our colour to be sure  a lovely peagreen is the precise shade on which to found aristocratic distinction  but then we are liberalwe associate with the moths who are gray with the butterflies who are blueandgold coloured with the grasshoppers yellow and brown and society would become dreadfully mixed if it were not fortunately ordered that the crickets are black as jet  the fact is that a class to be looked down upon is necessary to all elegant society and if the crickets were not black we could not keep them down because as everybody knows they are often a great deal cleverer than we are  they have a vast talent for music and dancing they are very quick at learning and would be getting to the very top of the ladder if we once allowed them to climb  but their being black is a convenience because as long as we are green and they black we have a superiority that can never be taken from us dont you see now  oh yes i see exactly said the colonel  now that keziah cricket who just came in here is quite a musician and her old father plays the violin beautifullyby the way we might engage him for our orchestra   and so miss katys ball came off and the performers kept it up from sundown till daybreak so that it seemed as if every leaf in the forest were alive  the katydids and the mosquitoes and the locusts and a full orchestra of crickets made the air perfectly vibrate insomuch that old parson toowhit who was preaching a thursday evening lecture to a very small audience announced to his hearers that he should certainly write a discourse against dancing for the next weekly occasion  the good doctor was even with his word in the matter and gave out some very sonorous discourses without in the least stopping the round of gaieties kept up by these dissipated katydids which ran on night after night till the celebrated jack frost epidemic which occurred somewhere about the first of september  poor miss katy with her flimsy green satin and pointlace was one of the first victims and fell from the bough in company with a sad shower of last years leaves  the worthy cricket family however avoided jack frost by emigrating in time to the chimneycorner of a nice little cottage that had been built in the wood that summer  there good old mr and mrs cricket with sprightly miss keziah and her brothers and sisters found a warm and welcome home and when the storm howled without and lashed the poor naked trees the crickets on the warm hearth would chirp out cheery welcome to papa as he came in from the snowy path or mamma as she sat at her workbasket  cheep cheep cheep little freddy would say  mamma who is it says cheep  dear freddy its our own dear little cricket who loves us and comes to sing to us when the snow is on the ground  so when poor miss katydids satin and lace were all swept away the warm hometalents of the crickets made for them a welcome refuge    mother magpies mischief    old mother magpie was about the busiest character in the forest  but you must know that there is a great difference between being busy and being industrious  one may be very busy all the time and yet not in the least industrious and this was the case with mother magpie  she was always full of everybodys business but her ownup and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyones affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do and ready to cast her advice gratis at every bird and beast of the woods  now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oaktree to tell old parson toowhit what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who was always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into mrs orioles nest sit chattering on a bough above and pour forth floods of advice which poor little mrs oriole used to say to her husband bewildered her more than a hard northeast storm  depend upon it my dear mother magpie would say that this way of building your nest swinging like an old empty stocking from a bough isnt at all the thing  i never built one so in my life and i never have headaches  now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you  its all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner  but my dear piped mrs oriole timidly the orioles always have built in this manner and it suits our constitution  a fiddle on your constitution  how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try  you own you are not well you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain  ask old dr kite  i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he mrs magpie i perfectly agree with you  but my husband prefers this style of building  thats only because he isnt properly instructed  pray did you ever attend dr kites lectures on the nervous system  no i have no time to attend lectures  who would sit on the eggs  why your husband to be sure dont he take his turn in sitting if he dont he ought to  i shall speak to him about it  my husband always sits regularly half the time that i may have time to go about and exercise  o mrs magpie pray dont speak to my husband he will think ive been complaining  no no he wont  let me alone  i understand just how to say the thing  ive advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offence  but i tell you mrs magpie i dont want any interference between my husband and me and i will not have it says mrs oriole with her little round eyes flashing with indignation  dont put yourself in a passion my dear the more you talk the more sure i am that your nervous system is running down or you wouldnt forget good manners in this way  youd better take my advice for i understand just what to doand away sails mother magpie and presently young oriole comes home all in a flutter  i say my dear if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie  my dear i dont gossip  she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said  but you must cut her  i try to all i can but she wont be cut  its enough to make a bird swear said tommy oriole  tommy oriole to say the truth had as good a heart as ever beat under birds feathers but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsomest bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didnt confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy wren  but he determined that he wouldnt have old mother magpie interfering with his affairs  the fact is quoth tommy i am a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate  if she has a brilliant husband whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it  im sure billy wrens wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home  to say the truth my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered  it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to  so after this tommy oriole went to rather more concerts and spent less time at home than ever he did before which was all that mother magpie effected in that quarter  i confess this was very bad in tommy but then birds are no better than men in domestic matters and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a meddlesome magpie gets her claw into their nest  but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter  she bustled off down to waterdock lane where as we said in a former narrative lived the old musicteacher dr bullfrog the poor old doctor was a simpleminded good amiable creature who had played the doublebass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when  latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age  in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts  they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions when old dr bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones  this was not the worst of it  the little varlets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts and mimicking the tones of his bassviol  there you go paddygodonk paddygodonk umphchunk some rascal of a boy would shout while poor old bullfrogs yellow spectacles would be bedewed with tears of honest indignation  in time the jeers of these little savages began to tell on the society in the forest and to corrupt their simple manners and it was whispered among the younger and more heavy birds and squirrels that old bullfrog was a bore and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer  poor old dr bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning  well neighbour how unreasonable people are  who would have thought that the youth of our generation should have no more consideration for established merit  now for my part i think your musicteaching never was better and as for our choir i maintain constantly that it never was in better order butwell one may wear her tongue out but one can never make these young folks listen to reason  i really dont understand you maam said poor dr bullfrog  what you havent heard of a committee that is going to call on you to ask you to resign the care of the parish music  madam said dr bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i dont believe iti cant believe it  you must have made a mistake  i mistake  no no my good friend i never make mistakes  what i know i know certainly  wasnt it i that said i knew there was an engagement between tim chipmunk and nancy nibble who are married this very day  i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts and i can tell you you are going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated dr bullfrog  bless me we shall all be ruined said mrs bullfrog my poor husband  oh as to that if you take things in time and listen to my advice said mother magpie we may yet pull you through  you must alter your style a littleadapt it to modern times  everybody now is a little touched with the operatic fever and theres tommy oriole has been to new orleans and brought back a touch of the artistic  if you would try his style a littlesomething tyrolean you see  dear madam consider my voice  i never could hit the high notes  how do you know  its all practice tommy oriole says so  just try the scales  as to your voice your manner of living has a great deal to do with it  i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing  suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips in water as you dohis voice would be as hoarse and rough as yours  come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do  we are the true musical race  and so poor mr bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cattails where his green spectacles and honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion  he came up into the garden and established himself under a burdock and began to practise italian scales  the result was that poor old dr bullfrog instead of being considered as a respectable old bore got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners  every bird and beast in the forest had a gibe at him and even old parson toowhit thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and standing  as to mother magpie you may be sure that she assured every one how sorry she was that dear old dr bullfrog had made such a fool of himself if he had taken her advice he would have kept on respectably as a nice old bullfrog should  but the tragedy for the poor old musicteacher grew even more melancholy in its termination for one day as he was sitting disconsolately under a currantbush in the garden practising his poor old notes in a quiet way thump came a great blow of a hoe which nearly broke his back  hallo what ugly beast have we got here said tom noakes the gardeners boy  here here wasp my boy  what a fright for a poor quiet old bullfrog as little wiry wicked wasp came at him barking and yelping  he jumped with all his force sheer over a patch of bushes into the river and swam back to his old home among the cattails  and always after that it was observable that he was very lowspirited and took very dark views of life but nothing made him so angry as any allusion to mother magpie of whom from that time he never spoke except as old mother mischief    the squirrels that live in a house    once upon a time a gentleman went out into a great forest and cut away the trees and built there a very nice little cottage  it was set very low on the ground and had very large bowwindows and so much of it was glass that one could look through it on every side and see what was going on in the forest  you could see the shadows of the fernleaves as they flickered and wavered over the ground and the scarlet partridgeberry and wintergreen plums that matted round the roots of the trees and the bright spots of sunshine that fell through their branches and went dancing about among the bushes and leaves at their roots  you could see the chirping sparrows and the thrushes and robins and bluebirds building their nests here and there among the branches and watch them from day to day as they laid their eggs and hatched their young  you could also see red squirrels and gray squirrels and little striped chipsquirrels darting and springing about here and there and everywhere running races with each other from bough to bough and chattering at each other in the gayest possible manner  you may be sure that such a strange thing as a house for human beings to live in did not come into this wild wood without making quite a stir and excitement among the inhabitants that lived there before all the time it was building there was the greatest possible commotion in the breasts of all the older population and there wasnt even a black ant or a cricket that did not have his own opinion about it and did not tell the other ants and crickets just what he thought the world was coming to in consequence  old mrs rabbit declared that the hammering and pounding made her nervous and gave her most melancholy forebodings of evil times depend upon it children she said to her longeared family no good will come to us from this establishment  where man is there comes always trouble for us poor rabbits  the old chestnuttree that grew on the edge of the woodland ravine drew a great sigh which shook all his leaves and expressed it as his conviction that no good would ever come of ita conviction that at once struck to the heart of every chestnutburr  the squirrels talked together of the dreadful state of things that would ensue why said old father gray its evident that nature made the nuts for us but one of these great human creatures will carry off and gormandize upon what would keep a hundred poor families of squirrels in comfort  old groundmole said it did not require very sharp eyes to see into the future and it would just end in bringing down the price of real estate in the whole vicinity so that every decent minded and respectable quadruped would be obliged to move awayfor his part he was ready to sell out for anything he could get  the bluebirds and bobolinks it is true took more cheerful views of matters but then as old mrs groundmole observed they were a flighty sethalf their time careering and dissipating in the southern statesand could not be expected to have that patriotic attachment to their native soil that those had who had grubbed in it from their earliest days  this race of man said the old chestnuttree is never ceasing in its restless warfare on nature  in our forest solitudes hitherto how peacefully how quietly how regularly has everything gone on  not a flower has missed its appointed time of blossoming or failed to perfect its fruit  no matter how hard has been the winter how loud the winds have roared and how high the snowbanks have been piled all has come right again in spring  not the least root has lost itself under the snows so as not to be ready with its fresh leaves and blossoms when the sun returns to melt the frosty chains of winter  we have storms sometimes that threaten to shake everything to piecesthe thunder roars the lightning flashes and the winds howl and beat but when all is past everything comes out better and brighter than beforenot a bird is killed not the frailest flower destroyed  but man comes and in one day he will make a desolation that centuries cannot repair  ignorant boor that he is and all incapable of appreciating the glorious works of nature it seems to be his glory to be able to destroy in a few hours what it was the work of ages to produce  the noble oak that has been cut away to build this contemptible human dwelling had a life older and wiser than that of any man in this country  that tree has seen generations of men come and go  it was a fresh young tree when shakespeare was born it was hardly a middleaged tree when he died it was growing here when the first ship brought the white men to our shores and hundreds and hundreds of those whom they call bravest wisest strongestwarriors statesmen orators and poetshave been born have grown up lived and died while yet it has outlived them all it has seen more wisdom than the best of them but two or three hours of brutal strength sufficed to lay it low  which of these dolts could make a tree  id like to see them do anything like it  how noisy and clumsy are all their movementschopping pounding rasping hammering  and after all what do they build  in the forest we do everything so quietly  a tree would be ashamed of itself that could not get its growth without making such a noise and dust and fuss  our life is the perfection of good manners  for my part i feel degraded at the mere presence of these human beings but alas i am old a hollow place at my heart warns me of the progress of decay and probably it will be seized upon by these rapacious creatures as an excuse for laying me as low as my noble green brother  in spite of all this disquiet about it the little cottage grew and was finished  the walls were covered with pretty paper the floors carpeted with pretty carpets and in fact when it was all arranged and the garden walks laid out and beds of flowers planted around it began to be confessed even among the most critical that it was not after all so bad a thing as was to have been feared  a black ant went in one day and made a tour of exploration up and down over chairs and tables up the ceilings and down again and coming out wrote an article for the crickets gazette in which he described the new abode as a veritable palace  several butterflies fluttered in and sailed about and were wonderfully delighted and then a bumblebee and two or three honeybees who expressed themselves well pleased with the house but more especially enchanted with the garden  in fact when it was found that the proprietors were very fond of the rural solitudes of nature and had come out there for the purpose of enjoying them undisturbed that they watched and spared the anemones and the violets and bloodroots and dogs tooth violets and little woolly rolls of fern that began to grow up under the trees in spring that they never allowed a gun to be fired to scare the birds and watched the building of their nests with the greatest interestthen an opinion in favour of human beings began to gain ground and every cricket and bird and beast was loud in their praise  mamma said young titbit a frisky young squirrel to his mother one day why wont you let frisky and me go into that pretty new cottage to play  my dear said his mother who was a very wary and careful old squirrel how can you think of it  the race of man are full of devices for traps and pitfalls and who could say what might happen if you put yourself in their power  if you had wings like the butterflies and bees you might fly in and out again and so gratify your curiosity but as matters stand its best for you to keep well out of their way  but mother there is such a nice good lady lives there  i believe she is a good fairy and she seems to love us all so she sits in the bowwindow and watches us for hours and she scatters corn all round at the roots of the tree for us to eat  she is nice enough said the old mothersquirrel if you keep far enough off but i tell you you cant be too careful  now this good fairy that the squirrels discoursed about was a nice little old lady that the children used to call aunt esther and she was a dear lover of birds and squirrels and all sorts of animals and had studied their little ways till she knew just what would please them and so she would every day throw out crumbs for the sparrows and little bits of bread and wool and cotton to help the birds that were building their nests and would scatter corn and nuts for the squirrels and while she sat at her work in the bowwindow she would smile to see the birds flying away with the wool and the squirrels nibbling their nuts  after a while the birds grew so tame that they would hop into the bowwindow and eat their crumbs off the carpet  there mamma said titbit and frisky only see jenny wren and cock robin have been in at the bowwindow and it didnt hurt them and why cant we go  well my dears said old mother squirrel you must do it very carefully never forget that you havent wings like jenny wren and cock robin  so the next day aunt esther laid a train of corn from the roots of the trees to the bowwindow and then from the bowwindow to her workbasket which stood on the floor beside her and then she put quite a handful of corn in the workbasket and sat down by it and seemed intent on her sewing  very soon creep creep creep came titbit and frisky to the window and then into the room just as sly and as still as could be and aunt esther sat just like a statue for fear of disturbing them  they looked all around in high glee and when they came to the basket it seemed to them a wonderful little summerhouse made on purpose for them to play in  they nosed about in it and turned over the scissors and the needlebook and took a nibble at her white wax and jostled the spools meanwhile stowing away the corn on each side of their little chops till they both of them looked as if they had the mumps  at last aunt esther put out her hand to touch them when whisk frisk out they went and up the trees chattering and laughing before she had time even to wink  but after this they used to come in every day and when she put corn in her hand and held it very still they would eat out of it and finally they would get into her hand until one day she gently closed it over them and frisky and titbit were fairly caught  oh how their hearts beat but the good fairy only spoke gently to them and soon unclosed her hand and let them go again  so day after day they grew to have more and more faith in her till they would climb into her workbasket sit on her shoulder or nestle away in her lap as she sat sewing  they made also long exploring voyages all over the house up and through all the chambers till finally i grieve to say poor frisky came to an untimely end by being drowned in the watertank at the top of the house  the dear good fairy passed away from the house in time and went to a land where the flowers never fade and the birds never die but the squirrels still continue to make the place a favourite resort  in fact my dear said old mother red one winter to her mate what is the use of ones living in this cold hollow tree when these amiable people have erected this pretty cottage where there is plenty of room for us and them too  now i have examined between the eaves and there is a charming place where we can store our nuts and where we can whip in and out of the garret and have the free range of the house and say what you will these humans have delightful ways of being warm and comfortable in winter  so mr and mrs red set up housekeeping in the cottage and had no end of nuts and other good things stored up there  the trouble of all this was that as mrs red was a notable body and got up to begin her housekeeping operations and woke up all her children at four oclock in the morning the good people often were disturbed by a great rattling and fuss in the walls while yet it seemed dark night  then sometimes too i grieve to say mrs squirrel would give her husband vigorous curtain lectures in the night which made him so indignant that he would rattle off to another quarter of the garret to sleep by himself and all this broke the rest of the worthy people who built the house  what is to be done about this we dont know  what would you do about it  would you let the squirrels live in your house or not  when our good people come down of a cold winter morning and see the squirrels dancing and frisking down the trees and chasing each other so merrily over the garden chair between them or sitting with their tails saucily over their backs they look so jolly and jaunty and pretty that they almost forgive them for disturbing their nights rest and think that they will not do anything to drive them out of the garret today  and so it goes on but how long the squirrels will rent the cottage in this fashion im sure i dare not undertake to say    hum the son of buz    at rye beach during our summers vacation there came as there always will to seaside visitors two or three cold chilly rainy daysdays when the skies that long had not rained a drop seemed suddenly to bethink themselves of their remissness and to pour down water not by drops but by pailfuls  the chilly wind blew and whistled the water dashed along the ground and careered in foamy rills along the roadside and the bushes bent beneath the constant flood  it was plain that there was to be no seabathing on such a day no walks no rides and so shivering and drawing our blanket shawls close about us we sat down at the window to watch the storm outside  the rosebushes under the window hung dripping under their load of moisture each spray shedding a constant shower on the spray below it  on one of these lower sprays under the perpetual drip what should we see but a poor little hummingbird drawn up into the tiniest shivering ball and clinging with a desperate grasp to his uncomfortable perch  a hummingbird we knew him to be at once though his feathers were so matted and glued down by the rain that he looked not much bigger than a honeybee and as different as possible from the smart pert airy little character that we had so often seen flirting with the flowers  he was evidently a hummingbird in adversity and whether he ever would hum again looked to us exceedingly doubtful  immediately however we sent out to have him taken in  when the friendly hand seized him he gave a little faint watery squeak evidently thinking that his last hour was come and that grim death was about to carry him off to the land of dead birds  what a time we had reviving himholding the little wet thing in the warm hollow of our hands and feeling him shiver and palpitate  his eyes were fast closed his tiny claws which looked slender as cobwebs were knotted close to his body and it was long before one could feel the least motion in them  finally to our great joy we felt a brisk little kick and then a flutter of wings and then a determined peck of the beak which showed that there was sonic bird left in him yet and that he meant at any rate to find out where he was  unclosing our hands a small space out popped the little head with a pair of round brilliant eyes  then we bethought ourselves of feeding him and forthwith prepared him a stiff glass of sugar and water a drop of which we held to his bill  after turning his head attentively like a bird who knew what he was about and didnt mean to be chaffed he briskly put out a long flexible tongue slightly forked at the end and licked off the comfortable beverage with great relish  immediately he was pronounced out of danger by the small humane society which had undertaken the charge of his restoration and we began to cast about for getting him a settled establishment in our apartment  i gave up my workbox to him for a sleepingroom and it was medically ordered that he should take a nap  so we filled the box with cotton and he was formally put to bed with a folded cambric handkerchief round his neck to keep him from beating his wings  out of his white wrappings he looked forth green and grave as any judge with his bright round eyes  like a bird of discretion he seemed to understand what was being done to him and resigned himself sensibly to go to sleep  the box was covered with a sheet of paper perforated with holes for purposes of ventilation for even hummingbirds have a little pair of lungs and need their own little portion of air to fill them so that they may make bright scarlet little drops of blood to keep lifes fire burning in their tiny bodies  our birds lungs manufactured brilliant blood as we found out by experience for in his first nap he contrived to nestle himself into the cotton of which his bed was made and to get more of it than he needed into his long bill  we pulled it out as carefully as we could but there came out of his bill two round bright scarlet little drops of blood  our chief medical authority looked grave pronounced a probable hemorrhage from the lungs and gave him over at once  we less scientific declared that we had only cut his little tongue by drawing out the filaments of cotton and that he would do well enough in timeas it afterwards appeared he did for from that day there was no more bleeding  in the course of the second day he began to take short flights about the room though he seemed to prefer to return to us perching on our fingers or heads or shoulders and sometimes choosing to sit in this way for half an hour at a time  these great giants he seemed to say to himself are not bad people after all they have a comfortable way with them how nicely they dried and warmed me truly a bird might do worse than to live with them  so he made up his mind to form a fourth in the little company of three that usually sat and read worked and sketched in that apartment and we christened him hum the son of buz  he became an individuality a character whose little doings formed a part of every letter and some extracts from these will show what some of his little ways were  hum has learned to sit upon my finger and eat his sugar and water out of a teaspoon with most christianlike decorum  he has but one weaknesshe will occasionally jump into the spoon and sit in his sugar and water and then appear to wonder where it goes to  his plumage is in rather a drabbled state owing to these performances i have sketched him as he sat today on a bit of spiraea which i brought in for him  when absorbed in reflection he sits with his bill straight up in the air as i have drawn him  mr a reads macaulay to us and you should see the wise air with which perched on jennys thumb he cocked his head now one side and then the other apparently listening with most critical attention  his confidence in us seems unbounded  he lets us stroke his head smooth his feathers without a flutter and is never better pleased than when sitting as he has been doing all this while on my hand turning up his bill and watching my face with great edification  i have just been having a sort of maternal struggle to make him go to bed in his box but he evidently considers himself sufficiently convalescent to make a stand for his rights as a bird and so scratched indignantly out of his wrappings and set himself up to roost on the edge of the box with an air worthy of a turkey at the very least  having brought in a lamp he has opened his eyes round and wide and sits cocking his little head at me reflectively  when the weather cleared away and the sun came out bright hum became entirely well and seemed resolved to take the measure of his new life with us  our windows were closed in the lower part of the sash by frames with mosquito gauze so that the sun and air found free admission and yet our little rover could not pass out  on the first sunny day he took an exact survey of our apartment from ceiling to floor humming about examining every point with his billall the crevices mouldings each little indentation in the bedposts each windowpane each chair and stand and as it was a very simply furnished seaside apartment his scrutiny was soon finished  we wondered at first what this was all about but on watching him more closely we found that he was actively engaged in getting his living by darting out his long tongue hither and thither and drawing in all the tiny flies and insects which in summer time are to be found in an apartment  in short we found that though the nectar of flowers was his dessert yet he had his roast beef and muttonchop to look after and that his bright brilliant blood was not made out of a simple vegetarian diet  very shrewd and keen he was too in measuring the size of insects before he attempted to swallow them  the smallest class were whisked off with lightning speed but about larger ones he would sometimes wheel and hum for some minutes darting hither and thither and surveying them warily and if satisfied that they could be carried he would come down with a quick central dart which would finish the unfortunate at a snap  the larger flies seemed to irritate him especially when they intimated to him that his plumage was sugary by settling on his wings and tail when he would lay about him spitefully wielding his bill like a sword  a grasshopper that strayed in and was sunning himself on the windowseat gave him great discomposure  hum evidently considered him an intruder and seemed to long to make a dive at him but with characteristic prudence confined himself to threatening movements which did not exactly hit  he saw evidently that he could not swallow him whole and what might ensue from trying him piecemeal he wisely forbore to essay  hum had his own favourite places and perches  from the first day he chose for his nightly roost a towelline which had been drawn across the corner over the washstand where he every night established himself with one claw in the edge of the towel and the other clasping the line and ruffling up his feathers till he looked like a little chestnutburr he would resign himself to the soundest sleep  he did not tuck his head under his wing but seemed to sink it down between his shoulders with his bill almost straight up in the air  one evening one of us going to use the towel jarred the line and soon after found that hum had been thrown from his perch and was hanging head downward fast asleep still clinging to the line  another evening being discomposed by somebody coming to the towelline after he had settled himself he fluttered off but so sleepy that he had not discretion to poise himself again and was found clinging like a little bunch of green floss silk to the mosquito netting of the window  a day after this we brought in a large green bough and put it up over the lookingglass  hum noticed it before it had been there five minutes flew to it and began a regular survey perching now here now there till he seemed to find a twig that exactly suited him and after that he roosted there every night  who does not see in this change all the signs of reflection and reason that are shown by us in thinking over our circumstances and trying to better them  it seemed to say in so many words  that towelline is an unsafe place for a bird i get frightened and wake from bad dreams to find myself head downwards so i will find a better roost on this twig  when our little jenny one day put on a clean white muslin gown embellished with red sprigs hum flew towards her and with his bill made instant examination of these new appearances and one day being very affectionately disposed perched himself on her shoulder and sat some time  on another occasion while mr a was reading hum established himself on the top of his head just over the middle of his forehead in the precise place where our young belles have lately worn stuffed hummingbirds making him look as if dressed out for a party  hums most favourite perch was the back of the great rocking chair which being covered by a tidy gave some hold into which he could catch his little claws  there he would sit balancing himself cleverly if its occupant chose to swing to and fro and seeming to be listening to the conversation or reading  hum had his different moods like human beings  on cold cloudy gray days he appeared to be somewhat depressed in spirits hummed less about the room and sat humped up with his feathers ruffled looking as much like a bird in a greatcoat as possible  but on hot sunny days every feather sleeked itself down and his little body looked natty and trim his head alert his eyes bright and it was impossible to come near him for his agility  then let mosquitoes and little flies look about them  hum snapped them up without mercy and seemed to be all over the ceiling in a moment and resisted all our efforts at any personal familiarity with a saucy alacrity  hum had his established institutions in our room the chief of which was a tumbler with a little sugar and water mixed in it and a spoon laid across out of which he helped himself whenever he felt in the moodsitting on the edge of the tumbler and dipping his long bill and lapping with his little forked tongue like a kitten  when he found his spoon accidentally dry he would stoop over and dip his bill in the water in the tumbler which caused the prophecy on the part of some of his guardians that he would fall in someday and be drowned  for which reason it was agreed to keep only an inch in depth of the fluid at the bottom of the tumbler  a wise precaution this proved for the next morning i was awaked not by the usual hum over my head but by a sharp little flutter and found mr hum beating his wings in the tumblerhaving actually tumbled in during his energetic efforts to get his morning coffee before i was awake  hum seemed perfectly happy and satisfied in his quarters but one day when the door was left open he made a dart out and so into the open sunshine  then to be sure we thought we had lost him  we took the mosquito netting out of all the windows and setting his tumbler of sugar and water in a conspicuous place went about our usual occupations  we saw him joyous and brisk among the honeysuckles outside the window and it was gravely predicted that he would return no more  but at dinnertime in came hum familiar as possible and sat down to his spoon as if nothing had happened instantly we closed our windows and had him secure once more  at another time i was going to ride to the atlantic house about a mile from my boardingplace  i left all secure as i supposed at home  while gathering moss on the walls there i was surprised by a little green hummingbird flying familiarly right towards my face and humming above my head  i called out here is hums very brother but on returning home i saw that the door of the room was open and hum was gone  now certainly we gave him up for lost  i sat down to painting and in a few minutes in flew hum and settled on the edge of my tumbler in a social confidential way which seemed to say oh youve got back then  after taking his usual drink of sugar and water he began to fly about the ceiling as usual and we gladly shut him in  when our five weeks at the seaside were up and it was time to go home we had great questionings what was to be done with hum  to get him home with us was our desire but who ever heard of a hummingbird travelling by railroad  great were the consultings  a little basket of indian work was filled up with cambric handkerchiefs and a bottle of sugar and water provided and we started with him for a days journey  when we arrived at night the first care was to see what had become of hum who had not been looked at since we fed him with sugar and water in boston  we found him alive and well but so dead asleep that we could not wake him to roost so we put him to bed on a toilet cushion and arranged his tumbler for morning  the next day found him alive and humming exploring the room and pictures perching now here and now there but as the weather was chilly he sat for the most part of the time in a humpedup state on the tip of a pair of stags horns  we moved him to a more sunny apartment but alas the equinoctial storm came on and there was no sun to be had for days hum was blue the pleasant seaside days were over his room was lonely the pleasant three that had enlivened the apartment at rye no longer came in and out evidently he was lonesome and gave way to depression  one chilly morning he managed again to fall into his tumbler and wet himself through and notwithstanding warm bathings and tender nursings the poor little fellow seemed to get diphtheria or something quite as bad for hummingbirds  we carried him to a neighbouring sunny parlour where ivy embowers all the walls and the sun lies all day  there he revived a little danced up and down perched on a green spray that was wreathed across the breast of a psyche and looked then like a little flitting soul returning to its rest  towards evening he drooped and having been nursed and warmed and cared for he was put to sleep on a green twig laid on the piano  in that sleep the little head droopednodded fell and little hum went where other bright dreams goto the land of the hereafter    our country neighbours    we have just built our house in rather an outoftheway placeon the bank of a river and under the shade of a patch of woods which is a veritable remain of quite an ancient forest  the checkerberry and partridgeplum with their glossy green leaves and scarlet berries still carpet the ground under its deep shadows and princespine and other kindred evergreens declare its native wildnessfor these are children of the wild woods that never come after plough and harrow have once broken a soil  when we tried to look out the spot for our house we had to get a surveyor to go before us and cut a path through the dense underbrush that was laced together in a general network of boughs and leaves and grew so high as to overtop our heads  where the house stands four or five great old oaks and chestnuts had to be cut away to let it in and now it stands on the bank of the river the edges of which are still overhung with old foresttrees chestnuts and oaks which look at themselves in the glassy stream  a little knoll near the house was chosen for a gardenspot a dense dark mass of trees above of bushes in midair and of all sorts of ferns and wildflowers and creeping vines on the ground  all these had to be cleared out and a dozen great trees cut down and dragged off to a neighbouring sawmill there to be transformed into boards to finish off our house  then fetching a great machine such as might be used to pull a giants teeth with ropes pulleys oxen and men and might and main we pulled out the stumps with their great prongs and their network of roots and fibres and then alas we had to begin with all the pretty wild lovely bushes and the checkerberries and ferns and wild blackberries and huckleberry bushes and dig them up remorselessly that we might plant our corn and squashes  and so we got a house and a garden right out of the heart of our piece of wild wood about a mile from the city of h  well then people said it was a lonely place and far from neighboursby which they meant that it was a good way for them to come to see us  but we soon found that whoever goes into the woods to live finds neighbours of a new kind and some to whom it is rather hard to become accustomed  for instance on a fine day early in april as we were crossing over to superintend the building of our house we were startled by a striped snake with his little bright eyes raising himself to look at us and putting out his red forked tongue  now there is no more harm in these little gardensnakes than there is in a robin or a squirrelthey are poor little peaceable timid creatures which could not do any harm if they would but the prejudices of society are so strong against them that one does not like to cultivate too much intimacy with them  so we tried to turn out of our path into a tangle of bushes and there instead of one we found four snakes we turned on the other side and there were two more  in short everywhere we looked the dry leaves were rustling and coiling with them and we were in despair  in vain we said that they were harmless as kittens and tried to persuade ourselves that their little bright eyes were pretty and that their serpentine movements were in the exact line of beauty  for the life of us we could not help remembering their family name and connections we thought of those disagreeable gentlemen the anacondas the rattlesnakes and the copperheads and all of that bad line immediate family friends of the old serpent to whom we are indebted for all the mischief that is done in this world  so we were quite apprehensive when we saw how our new neighbourhood was infested by them until a neighbour calmed our fears by telling us that snakes always crawled out of their holes to sun themselves in the spring and that in a day or two they would all be gone  so it proved  it was evident they were all out merely to do their spring shopping or something that serves with them the same purpose that spring shopping does with us and where they went afterwards we do not know  people speak of snakes holes and we have seen them disappearing into such subterranean chambers but we never opened one to see what sort of underground housekeeping went on there  after the first few days of spring a snake was a rare visitor though now and then one appeared  one was discovered taking his noontide repast one day in a manner which excited much prejudice  he was in fact regaling himself by sucking down into his maw a small frog which he had begun to swallow at the toes and had drawn about half down  the frog it must be confessed seemed to view this arrangement with great indifference making no struggle and sitting solemnly with his great unwinking eyes to be sucked in at the leisure of his captor  there was immense sympathy however excited for him in the family circle and it was voted that a snake which indulged in such very disagreeable modes of eating his dinner was not to be tolerated in our vicinity so i have reason to believe that that was his last meal  another of our wild woodland neighbours made us some trouble  it was no other than a veritable woodchuck whose hole we had often wondered at when we were scrambling through the underbrush after spring flowers  the hole was about the size of a peckmeasure and had two openings about six feet apart  the occupant was a gentleman we never had had the pleasure of seeing but we soon learned his existence from his ravages in our garden  he had a taste it appears for the very kind of things we wanted to eat ourselves and helped himself without asking  we had a row of fine crisp heads of lettuce which were the pride of our gardening and out of which he would from day to day select for his table just the plants we had marked for ours he also nibbled our young beans and so at last we were reluctantly obliged to let john gardiner set a trap for him  poor old simple minded hermit he was too artless for this world  he was caught at the very first snap and found dead in the trapthe agitation and distress having broken his poor woodland heart and killed him  we were grieved to the very soul when the poor fat old fellow was dragged out with his useless paws standing up stiff and imploring as it was he was given to denis our pig which without a single scruple of delicacy ate him up as thoroughly as he ate up the lettuce  this business of eating it appears must go on all through creation we eat ducks turkeys and chickens though we dont swallow them whole feathers and all  our fourfooted friends less civilized take things with more directness and simplicity and chew each other up without ceremony or swallow each other alive  of these unceremonious habits we had other instances  our house had a central court on the southern side into which looked the library diningroom and front hall as well as several of the upper chambers  it was designed to be closed in with glass to serve as a conservatory in winter and meanwhile we had filled it with splendid plumy ferns taken up out of the neighbouring wood  in the centre was a fountain surrounded by stones shells mosses and various waterplants  we had bought three little goldfish to swim in our basin and the spray of it as it rose in the air and rippled back into the water was the pleasantest possible sound of a hot day we used to lie on the sofa in the hall and look into the court and fancy we saw some scene of fairyland and watersprites coming up from the fountain  suddenly a newcomer presented himselfno other than an immense bullfrog that had hopped up from the neighbouring river apparently with a view to making a permanent settlement in and about our fountain  he was to be seen often for hours sitting reflectively on the edge of it beneath the broad shadow of the callaleaves  when sometimes missed thence he would be found under the ample shield of a great bignonia whose striped leaves grew hard by  the family were prejudiced against him  what did he want there  it was surely some sinister motive impelled him  he was probably watching for an opportunity to gobble up the goldfish  we took his part however and strenuously defended his moral character and patronized him in all ways  we gave him the name of unke and maintained that he was a wellconducted philosophical old water sprite who showed his good taste in wanting to take up his abode in our conservatory  we even defended his personal appearance praised the invisiblegreen coat which he wore on his back and his gray vest and solemn gold spectacles and though he always felt remarkably slimy when we touched him yet as he would sit still and allow us to stroke his head and pat his back we concluded his social feelings might be warm notwithstanding a cold exterior  who knew after all but he might be a beautiful young prince enchanted there till the princess should come to drop the golden ball into the fountain and so give him a chance to marry her and turn into a man again  such things we are credibly informed are matters of frequent occurrence in germany  why not here  byandby there came to our fountain another visitora frisky green young frog of the identical kind spoken of by the poet   there was a frog lived in a well rig dum pully metakimo   this thoughtless dapper individual with his bright green coat his faultless white vest and seagreen tights became rather the popular favourite  he seemed just rakish and gallant enough to fulfil the conditions of the song   the frog he would acourting ride with sword and pistol by his side   this lively young fellow whom we shall call cricri like other frisky and gay young people carried the day quite over the head of the solemn old philosopher under the callaleaves  at night when all was still he would trill a joyous little note in his throat while old unke would answer only with a cracked guttural more singular than agreeable and to all outward appearance the two were as good friends as their different natures would allow  one day however the conservatory became the scene of a tragedy of the deepest dye  we were summoned below by shrieks and howls of horror  do pray come down and see what this vile nasty horrid old frog has been doing  down we came and there sat our virtuous old philosopher with his poor little brothers hind legs still sticking out of the corner of his mouth as if he were smoking them for a cigar all helplessly palpitating as they were  in fact our solemn old friend had done what many a solemn hypocrite before has done swallowed his poor brother neck and cropand sat there with the most brazen indifference looking as if he had done the most proper and virtuous thing in the world  immediately he was marched out of the conservatory at the point of a walkingstick and made to hop down to the river into whose waters he splashed and we saw him no more  we regret to say that the popular indignation was so precipitate in its results otherwise the special artist who sketched hum the son of buz intended to have made a sketch of the old villain as he sat with his luckless victims hind legs projecting from his solemn mouth  with all his moral faults he was a good sitter and would probably have sat immovable any length of time that could be desired  of other woodland neighbours there were some which we saw occasionally  the shores of the river were lined here and there with the holes of the muskrats and in rowing by their settlements we were sometimes strongly reminded of them by the overpowering odour of the perfume from which they get their name  there were also owls whose nests were high up in some of the old chestnuttrees  often in the lonely hours of the night we could hear them gibbering with a sort of wild hollow laugh among the distant trees  but one tenant of the woods made us some trouble in the autumn  it was a little flyingsquirrel who took to making excursions into our house in the night season coming down the chimney into the chambers rustling about among the clothes cracking nuts or nibbling at any morsels of anything that suited his fancy  for a long time the inmates of the rooms were awakened in the night by mysterious noises thumps and rappings and so lighted candles and searched in vain to find whence they came for the moment any movement was made the rogue whipped up the chimney and left us a prey to the most mysterious alarms  what could it be  but one night our fine gentleman bounced in at the window of another room which had no fireplace and the fair occupant rising in the night shut the window without suspecting that she had cut off the retreat of any of her woodland neighbours  the next morning she was startled by what she thought a gray rat running past her bed  she rose to pursue him when he ran up the wall and clung against the plastering showing himself very plainly a gray flyingsquirrel with large soft eyes and wings which consisted of a membrane uniting the fore paws to the hind ones like those of a bat  he was chased into the conservatory and a window being opened out he flew upon the ground and made away for his native woods and thus put an end to many fears as to the nature of our nocturnal rappings  so you see how many neighbours we found by living in the woods and after all no worse ones than are found in the great world    the diverting history of little whiskey    and now at the last i am going to tell you something of the ways and doings of one of the queer little people whom i shall call whiskey  you cannot imagine how pretty he is  his back has the most beautiful smooth shining stripes of reddish brown and black his eyes shine like bright glass beads and he sits up jauntily on his hind quarters with his little tail thrown over his back like a ruffle  and where does he live  well that is telling as we children say it was somewhere up in the mountains of berkshire in a queer quaint oldfashioned garden that i made mr whiskeys acquaintance  here there lives a young parson who preaches every sunday in a little brown church and during weekdays goes through all these hills and valleys visiting the poor and gathering children into sunday schools  his wife is a very smallsized ladynot much bigger than you my little marybut very fond of all sorts of dumb animals and by constantly watching their actions and ways she has come to have quite a strange power over them as i shall relate  the little lady fixed her mind on whiskey and gave him his name without consulting him upon the subject  she admired his bright eyes and resolved to cultivate his acquaintance  by constant watching she discovered that he had a small hole of his own in the grassplot a few paces from her backdoor  so she used to fill her pocket with hazelnuts and go out and sit in the back porch and make a little noise such as squirrels make to each other to attract his attention  in a minute or two up would pop the little head with the bright eyes in the grassplot and master whiskey would sit on his haunches and listen with one small ear cocked towards her  then she would throw him a hazelnut and he would slip instantly down into his hole again  in a minute or two however his curiosity would get the better of his prudence and she sitting quiet would see the little brownstriped head slowly slowly coming up again over the tiny green spikes of the grassplot  quick as a flash he would dart at the nut whisk it into a little bag on one side of his jaws which madam nature has furnished him with for his provisionpouch and down into his hole again  an ungrateful suspicious little brute he was too for though in this way he bagged and carried off nut after nut until the patient little woman had used up a pound of hazelnuts still he seemed to have the same wild fright at sight of her and would whisk off and hide himself in his hole the moment she appeared in vain she called whiskey whiskey whiskey in the most flattering tones in vain she coaxed and cajoled  no no he was not to be caught napping  he had no objection to accepting her nuts as many as she chose to throw to him but as to her taking any personal liberty with him you see it was by no means to be thought of  but at last patience and perseverance began to have their reward little master whiskey said to himself surely this is a nice kind lady to take so much pains to give me nuts she is certainly very considerate and with that he edged a little nearer and nearer every day until quite to the delight of the small lady he would come and climb into her lap and seize the nuts when she rattled them there and after that he seemed to make exploring voyages all over her person  he would climb up and sit on her shoulder he would mount and perch himself on her head and when she held a nut for him between her teeth he would take it out of her mouth  after a while he began to make tours of discovery in the house  he would suddenly appear on the ministers writingtable when he was composing his sunday sermon and sit cocking his little pert head at him seeming to wonder what he was about  but in all his explorations he proved himself a true yankee squirrel having always a shrewd eye on the main chance  if the parson dropped a nut on the floor down went whiskey after it and into his provisionbag it went and then he would look up as if he expected another for he had a wallet on each side of his jaws and he always wanted both sides handsomely filled before he made for his hole  so busy and active and always intent on this one object was he that before long the little lady found he had made way with six pounds of hazelnuts  his general rule was to carry off four nuts at a timethree being stuffed into the sidepockets of his jaws and the fourth held in his teeth  when he had furnished himself in this way he would dart like lightning for his hole and disappear in a moment but in a short time up he would come brisk and wideawake and ready for the next supply  once a person who had the curiosity to dig open a chipping squirrels hole found in it two quarts of buckwheat a quantity of grassseed nearly a peck of acorns some indian corn and a quart of walnuts a pretty handsome supply for a squirrels winter storeroomdont you think so  whiskey learned in time to work for his living in many artful ways that his young mistress devised  sometimes she would tie his nuts up in a paper package which he would attack with great energy gnawing the strings and rustling the nuts out of the paper in wonderfully quick time  sometimes she would tie a nut to the end of a bit of twine and swing it backward and forward over his head and after a succession of spry jumps he would pounce upon it and hang swinging on the twine till he had gnawed the nut away  another squirrel doubtless hearing of whiskeys good luck began to haunt the same yard but whiskey would by no means allow him to cultivate his young mistresss acquaintance  no indeed he evidently considered that the institution would not support two  sometimes he would appear to be conversing with the stranger on the most familiar and amicable terms in the backyard but if his mistress called his name he would immediately start and chase his companion quite out of sight before he came back to her  so you see that selfseeking is not confined to men alone and that whiskeys fine little fur coat covers a very selfish heart  as winter comes on whiskey will go down into his hole which has many long galleries and winding passages and a snug little bedroom well lined with leaves  here he will doze and dream away his long winter months and nibble out the inside of his store of nuts  if i hear any more of his cunning tricks i will tell you of them
