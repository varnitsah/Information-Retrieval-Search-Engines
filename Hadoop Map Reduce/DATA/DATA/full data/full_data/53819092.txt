53819092	the magic egg  and other stories   by  frank r stockton     contents     the magic egg   his wifes deceased sister   the widows cruise   captain elis best ear   love before breakfast   the staying power of sir rohan   a piece of red calico   the christmas wreck   my well and what came out of it   mr tolman   my unwilling neighbor   our archery club     the magic egg  the pretty little theatre attached to the building of the unicorn club had been hired for a certain january afternoon by mr herbert loring who wished to give therein a somewhat novel performance to which he had invited a small audience consisting entirely of friends and acquaintances  loring was a handsome fellow about thirty years old who had travelled far and studied much  he had recently made a long sojourn in the far east and his friends had been invited to the theatre to see some of the wonderful things he had brought from that country of wonders  as loring was a clubman and belonged to a family of good social standing his circle of acquaintances was large and in this circle a good many unpleasant remarks had been made regarding the proposed entertainmentmade of course by the people who had not been invited to be present  some of the gossip on the subject had reached loring who did not hesitate to say that he could not talk to a crowd and that he did not care to show the curious things he had collected to people who would not thoroughly appreciate them  he had been very particular in regard to his invitations  at three oclock on the appointed afternoon nearly all the people who had been invited to the unicorn theatre were in their seats  no one had stayed away except for some very good reason for it was well known that if herbert loring offered to show anything it was worth seeing  about forty people were present who sat talking to one another or admiring the decoration of the theatre  as loring stood upon the stagewhere he was entirely alone his exhibition requiring no assistantshe gazed through a loophole in the curtain upon a very interesting array of faces  there were the faces of many men and women of society of students of workers in various fields of thought and even of idlers in all fields of thought but there was not one which indicated a frivolous or listless disposition  the owners of those faces had come to see something and they wished to see it  for a quarter of an hour after the time announced for the opening of the exhibition loring peered through the hole in the curtain and then although all the people he had expected had not arrived he felt it would not do for him to wait any longer  the audience was composed of wellbred and courteous men and women but despite their polite selfrestraint loring could see that some of them were getting tired of waiting  so very reluctantly and feeling that further delay was impossible he raised the curtain and came forward on the stage  briefly he announced that the exhibition would open with some fireworks he had brought from corea  it was plain to see that the statement that fireworks were about to be set off on a theatre stage by an amateur had rather startled some of the audience and loring hastened to explain that these were not real fireworks but that they were contrivances made of colored glass which were illuminated by the powerful lens of a lantern which was placed out of sight and while the apparent pyrotechnic display would resemble fireworks of strange and grotesque designs it would be absolutely without danger  he brought out some little bunches of bits of colored glass hung them at some distance apart on a wire which was stretched across the stage just high enough for him to reach it and then lighted his lantern which he placed in one of the wings lowered all the lights in the theatre and began his exhibition  as loring turned his lantern on one of the clusters of glass lenses strips and points and unseen himself caused them to move by means of long cords attached the effects were beautiful and marvellous little wheels of colored fire rapidly revolved miniature rockets appeared to rise a few feet and to explode in the air and while all the ordinary forms of fireworks were produced on a diminutive scale there were some effects that were entirely novel to the audience  as the light was turned successively upon one and another of the clusters of glass sometimes it would flash along the whole line so rapidly that all the various combinations of color and motion seemed to be combined in one and then for a time each particular set of fireworks would blaze sparkle and coruscate by itself scattering particles of colored light as if they had been real sparks of fire  this curious and beautiful exhibition of miniature pyrotechnics was extremely interesting to the audience who gazed upward with rapt and eager attention at the line of wheels stars and revolving spheres so far as interest gave evidence of satisfaction there was never a better satisfied audience  at first there had been some hushed murmurs of pleasure but very soon the attention of every one seemed so completely engrossed by the dazzling display that they simply gazed in silence  for twenty minutes or longer the glittering show went on and not a sign of weariness or inattention was made by any one of the assembled company  then gradually the colors of the little fireworks faded the stars and wheels revolved more slowly the lights in the body of the theatre were gradually raised and the stage curtain went softly down  anxiously and a little pale herbert loring peered through the loophole in the curtain  it was not easy to judge of the effects of his exhibition and he did not know whether or not it had been a success  there was no applause but on the other hand there was no signs that any one resented the exhibition as a childish display of colored lights  it was impossible to look upon that audience without believing that they had been thoroughly interested in what they had seen and that they expected to see more  for two or three minutes loring gazed through his loophole and then still with some doubt in his heart but with a little more color in his checks he prepared for the second part of his performance  at this moment there entered the theatre at the very back of the house a young lady  she was handsome and well dressed and as she opened the doorloring had employed no ushers or other assistants in this little social performanceshe paused for a moment and looked into the theatre and then noiselessly stepped to a chair in the back row and sat down  this was edith starr who a month before had been betrothed to herbert loring  edith and her mother had been invited to this performance and front seats had been reserved for them for each guest had received a numbered card  but mrs starr had a headache and could not go out that afternoon and for a time her daughter had thought that she too must give up the pleasure loring had promised her and stay with her mother  but when the elder lady dropped into a quiet sleep edith thought that late as it was she would go by herself and see what she could of the performance  she was quite certain that if her presence were known to loring he would stop whatever he was doing until she had been provided with a seat which he thought suitable for her for he had made a point of her being properly seated when he gave the invitations  therefore being equally desirous of not disturbing the performance and of not being herself conspicuous she sat behind two rather large men where she could see the stage perfectly well but where she herself would not be likely to be seen  in a few moments the curtain rose and loring came forward carrying a small light table which he placed near the front of the stage and for a moment stood quietly by it  edith noticed upon his face the expression of uncertainty and anxiety which had not yet left it standing by the side of the table and speaking very slowly but so clearly that his words could be heard distinctly in all parts of the room he began some introductory remarks regarding the second part of his performance  the extraordinary and i may say marvellous thing which i am about to show you he said is known among east indian magicians as the magic egg  the exhibition is a very uncommon one and has seldom been seen by americans or europeans and it was by a piece of rare good fortune that i became possessed of the appliances necessary for this exhibition  they are indeed very few and simple but never before to the best of my knowledge and belief have they been seen outside of india  i will now get the little box which contains the articles necessary for this magical performance and i will say that if i had time to tell you of the strange and amazing adventure which resulted in my possession of this box i am sure you would be as much interested in that as i expect you to be in the contents of the box  but in order that none of you may think this is an ordinary trick executed by means of concealed traps or doors i wish you to take particular notice of this table which is as you see a plain unpainted pine table with nothing but a flat top and four straight legs at the corners  you can see under and around it and it gives no opportunity to conceal anything then standing for a few moments as if he had something else to say he turned and stepped toward one of the wings  edith was troubled as she looked at her lover during these remarks her interest was great greater indeed than that of the people about her but it was not a pleasant interest  as loring stopped speaking and looked about him there was a momentary flush on his face  she knew this was caused by excitement and she was pale from the same cause  very soon loring came forward and stood by the table  here is the box he said of which i spoke and as i hold it up i think you all can see it  it is not large being certainly not more than twelve inches in length and two deep but it contains some very wonderful things  the outside of this box is covered with delicate engraving and carving which you cannot see and these marks and lines have i think some magical meaning but i do not know what it is  i will now open the box and show you what is inside  the first thing i take out is this little stick not thicker than a leadpencil but somewhat longer as you see  this is a magical wand and is covered with inscriptions of the same character as those on the outside of the box  the next thing is this little red bag well filled as you see which i shall put on the table for i shall not yet need it  now i take out a piece of cloth which is folded into a very small compass but as i unfold it you will perceive that it is more than a foot square and is covered with embroidery  all those strange lines and figures in gold and red which you can plainly see on the cloth as i hold it up are also characters in the same magic language as those on the box and wand  i will now spread the cloth on the table and then take out the only remaining thing in the box and this is nothing in the world but an egga simple ordinary hens egg as you all see as i hold it up  it may be a trifle larger than an ordinary egg but then after all it is nothing but a common eggthat is in appearance  in reality it is a good deal more  now i will begin the performance  and as he stood by the back of the table over which he had been slightly bending and threw his eyes over the audience his voice was stronger and his face had lost all its pallor  he was evidently warming up with his subject  i now take up this wand he said which while i hold it gives me power to produce the phenomena which you are about to behold  you may not all believe that there is any magic whatever about this little performance and that it is all a bit of machinery but whatever you may think about it you shall see what you shall see  now with this wand i gently touch this egg which is lying on the square of cloth  i do not believe you can see what has happened to this egg but i will tell you  there is a little line like a hair entirely around it  now that line has become a crack  now you can see it i know  it grows wider and wider  look  the shell of the egg is separating in the middle  the whole egg slightly moves  do you notice that  now you can see something yellow showing itself between the two parts of the shell  see  it is moving a good deal and the two halves of the shell are separating more and more  and now out tumbles this queer little object  do you see what it is  it is a poor weak little chick not able to stand but alivealive  you can all perceive that it is alive  now you can see that it is standing on its feet feebly enough but still standing  behold it takes a few steps  you cannot doubt that it is alive and came out of that egg  it is beginning to walk about over the cloth do you notice that it is picking the embroidery  now little chick i will give you something to eat  this little red bag contains grain a magical grain with which i shall feed the chicken  you must excuse my awkwardness in opening the bag as i still hold the wand but this little stick i must not drop  see little chick there are some grains  they look like rice but in fact i have no idea what they are  but he knows he knows  look at him  see how he picks it up there  he has swallowed one two three  that will do little chick for a first meal  the grain seems to have strengthened him already for see how lively he is and how his yellow down stands out on him so puffy and warm you are looking for some more grain are you  well you cannot have it just yet and keep away from those pieces of eggshell which by the way i will put back into the box  now sir try to avoid the edge of the table and to quiet you i will give you a little tap on the back with my wand  now then please observe closely  the down which just now covered him has almost gone  he is really a good deal bigger and ever so much uglier  see the little pinfeathers sticking out over him  some spots here and there are almost bare but he is ever so much more active  ha  listen to that  he is so strong that you can hear his beak as he pecks at the table  he is actually growing bigger and bigger before our very eyes  see that funny little tail how it begins to stick up and quills are showing at the end of his wings  another tap and a few more grains  careful sir  dont tear the cloth  see how rapidly he grows  he is fairly covered with feathers red and black with a tip of yellow in front  you could hardly get that fellow into an ostrich egg  now then what do you think of him he is big enough for a broiler though i dont think any one would want to take him for that purpose  some more grain and another tap from my wand  see  he does not mind the little stick for he has been used to it from his very birth  now then he is what you would call a good halfgrown chick  rather more than half grown i should say  do you notice his tail  there is no mistaking him for a pullet  the long feathers are beginning to curl over already  he must have a little more grain  look out sir or you will be off the table  come back here  this table is too small for him but if he were on the floor you could not see him so well  another tap  now see that comb on the top of his head you scarcely noticed it before and now it is bright red  and see his spurs beginning to showon good thick legs too  there is a fine young fellow for you  look how he jerks his head from side to side like the young prince of a poultryyard as he well deserves to be  the attentive interest which had at first characterized the audience now changed to excited admiration and amazement  some leaned forward with mouths wide open  others stood up so that they could see better ejaculations of astonishment and wonder were heard on every side and a more thoroughly fascinated and absorbed audience was never seen  now my friends loring continued i will give this handsome fowl another tap  behold the resulta noble fullgrown cock  behold his spurs  they are nearly an inch long  see there is a comb for you and what a magnificent tail of green and black contrasting so finely with the deep red of the rest of his body  well sir you are truly too big for this table  as i cannot give you more room i will set you up higher  move over a little and i will set this chair on the table there  upon the seat  thats right but dont stop  there is the back which is higher yet  up with you  ha  there he nearly upset the chair but i will hold it  see  he has turned around  now then look at him  see his wings as he flaps them  he could fly with such wings  look at him  see that swelling breast  ha ha  listen  did you ever hear a crow like that  it fairly rings through the house yes i knew it  there is another  at this point the people in the house were in a state of wild excitement  nearly all of them were on their feet and they were in such a condition of frantic enthusiasm that loring was afraid some of them might make a run for the stage  come sir cried loring now almost shouting that will do  you have shown us the strength of your lungs  jump down on the seat of the chair now on the table  there i will take away the chair and you can stand for a moment on the table and let our friends look at you but only for a moment  take that tap on your back  now do you see any difference  perhaps you may not but i do  yes i believe you all do he is not the big fellow he was a minute ago  he is really smalleronly a fine cockerel  a nice tail that but with none of the noble sweep that it had a minute ago  no dont try to get off the table  you cant escape my wand  another tap  behold a halfgrown chicken good to eat but with not a crow in him  hungry are you but you need not pick at the table that way  you get no more grain but only this little tap  ha ha  what are you coming to  there is a chicken barely feathered enough for us to tell what color he is going to be  another tap will take still more of the conceit out of him  look at him  there are his pinfeathers and his bare spots  dont try to get away i can easily tap you again  now then  here is a lovely little chick fluffy with yellow down  he is active enough but i shall quiet him  one tap and now what do you see  a poor feeble chicken scarcely able to stand with his down all packed close to him as if he had been out in the rain  ah little chick i will take the two halves of the eggshell from which you came and put them on each side of you come now get in  i close them up  you are lost to view  there is nothing to be seen but a crack around the shell  now it has gone there my friends as i hold it on high behold the magic egg exactly as it was when i first took it out of the box into which i will place it again with the cloth and the wand and the little red bag and shut it up with a snap  i will let you take one more look at this box before i put it away behind the scenes  are you satisfied with what i have shown you  do you think it is really as wonderful as you supposed it would be  at these words the whole audience burst into riotous applause during which loring disappeared but he was back in a moment  thank you he cried bowing low and waving his arms before him in the manner of an eastern magician making a salaam  from side to side he turned bowing and thanking and then with a hearty goodby to you goodby to you all he stepped back and let down the curtain  for some moments the audience remained in their seats as if they were expecting something more and then they rose quietly and began to disperse  most of them were acquainted with one another and there was a good deal of greeting and talking as they went out of the theatre  when loring was sure the last person had departed he turned down the lights locked the door and gave the key to the steward of the club  he walked to his home a happy man  his exhibition had been a perfect success with not a break or a flaw in it from beginning to end  i feel thought the young man as he strode along as if i could fly to the top of that steeple and flap and crow until all the world heard me  that evening as was his daily custom herbert loring called upon miss starr  he found the young lady in the library  i came in here she said because i have a good deal to talk to you about and i do not want interruptions  with this arrangement the young man expressed his entire satisfaction and immediately began to inquire the cause of her absence from his exhibition in the afternoon  but i was there said edith  you did not see me but i was there mother had a headache and i went by myself  you were there exclaimed loring almost starting from his chair  i dont understand  you were not in your seat   no answered edith  i was on the very back row of seats you could not see me and i did not wish you to see me  edith exclaimed loring rising to his feet and leaning over the library table which was between them  when did you come  how much of the performance did you see  i was late she said  i did not arrive until after the fireworks or whatever they were  for a moment loring was silent as if he did not understand the situation  fireworks he said  how did you know there had been fireworks  i heard the people talking of them as they left the theatre she answered  and what did they say he inquired quickly  they seemed to like them very well she replied but i do not think they were quite satisfied  from what i heard some persons say i inferred that they thought it was not very much of a show to which you had invited them  again loring stood in thought looking down at the table  but before he could speak again edith sprang to her feet  herbert loring she cried what does all this mean  i was there during the whole of the exhibition of what you called the magic egg  i saw all those people wild with excitement at the wonderful sight of the chicken that came out of the egg and grew to full size and then dwindled down again and went back into the egg and herbert there was no egg and there was no little box and there was no wand and no embroidered cloth and there was no red bag nor any little chick and there was no fullgrown fowl and there was no chair that you put on the table  there was nothing absolutely nothing but you and that table  even the table was not what you said it was  it was not an unpainted pine table with four straight legs  it was a table of dark polished wood and it stood on a single post with feet  there was nothing there that you said was there  everything was a sham and a delusion every word you spoke was untrue  and yet everybody in that theatre excepting you and me saw all the things that you said were on the stage  i know they saw them all for i was with the people and heard them and saw them and at times i fairly felt the thrill of enthusiasm which possessed them as they glared at the miracles and wonders you said were happening  loring smiled  sit down my dear edith he said  you are excited and there is not the slightest cause for it  i will explain the whole affair to you  it is simple enough  you know that study is the great object of my life  i study all sorts of things and just now i am greatly interested in hypnotism  the subject has become fascinating to me  i have made a great many successful trials of my power and the affair of this afternoon was nothing but a trial of my powers on a more extensive scale than anything i have yet attempted  i wanted to see if it were possible for me to hypnotize a considerable number of people without any one suspecting what i intended to do the result was a success  i hypnotized all those people by means of the first part of my performance which consisted of some combinations of colored glass with lights thrown upon them  they revolved and looked like fireworks and were strung on a wire high up on the stage  i kept up the glittering and dazzling showwhich was well worth seeing i can assure youuntil the people had been straining their eyes upward for almost half an hour  and this sort of thingi will tell you if you do not know itis one of the methods of producing hypnotic sleep  there was no one present who was not an impressionable subject for i was very careful in sending out my invitations and when i became almost certain that my audience was thoroughly hypnotized i stopped the show and began the real exhibition which was not really for their benefit but for mine  of course i was dreadfully anxious for fear i had not succeeded entirely and that there might be at least some one person who had not succumbed to the hypnotic influences and so i tested the matter by bringing out that table and telling them it was something it was not if i had had any reason for supposing that some of the audience saw the table as it really was i had an explanation ready and i could have retired from my position without any one supposing that i had intended making hypnotic experiments  the rest of the exhibition would have been some things that any one could see and as soon as possible i would have released from their spell those who were hypnotized  but when i became positively assured that every one saw a light pine table with four straight legs i confidently went on with the performances of the magic egg  edith starr was still standing by the library table  she had not heeded lorings advice to sit down and she was trembling with emotion  herbert loring she said you invited my mother and me to that exhibition  you gave us tickets for front seats where we would be certain to be hypnotized if your experiment succeeded and you would have made us see that false show which faded from those peoples minds as soon as they recovered from the spell for as they went away they were talking only of the fireworks and not one of them mentioned a magic egg or a chicken or anything of the kind  answer me this did you not intend that i should come and be put under that spell  loring smiled  yes he said of course i did  but then your case would have been different from that of the other spectators i should have explained the whole thing to you and i am sure we would have had a great deal of pleasure and profit too in discussing your experiences  the subject is extremely  explain to me she cried  you would not have dared to do it  i do not know how brave you may be but i know you would not have had the courage to come here and tell me that you had taken away my reason and my judgment as you took them away from all those people and that you had made me a mere tool of your willglaring and panting with excitement at the wonderful things you told me to see where nothing existed  i have nothing to say about the others  they can speak for themselves if they ever come to know what you did to them  i speak for myself  i stood up with the rest of the people  i gazed with all my power and over and over again i asked myself if it could be possible that anything was the matter with my eyes or my brain and if i could be the only person there who could not see the marvellous spectacle that you were describing  but now i know that nothing was real not even the little pine tablenot even the man  not even me exclaimed loring  surely i was real enough  on that stage yes she said  but you there proved you were not the herbert loring to whom i promised myself  he was an unreal being  if he had existed he would not have been a man who would have brought me to that public place all ignorant of his intentions to cloud my perceptions to subject my intellect to his own and make me believe a lie  if a man should treat me in that way once he would treat me so at other times and in other ways if he had the chance  you have treated me in the past as today you treated those people who glared at the magic egg  in the days gone by you made me see an unreal man but you will never do it again  goodby  edith cried loring you dont  but she had disappeared through a side door and he never spoke to her again  walking home through the dimly lighted streets loring involuntarily spoke aloud  and this he said is what came out of the magic egg     his wifes deceased sister  it is now five years since an event occurred which so colored my life or rather so changed some of its original colors that i have thought it well to write an account of it deeming that its lessons may be of advantage to persons whose situations in life are similar to my own  when i was quite a young man i adopted literature as a profession and having passed through the necessary preparatory grades i found myself after a good many years of hard and often unremunerative work in possession of what might be called a fair literary practice  my articles grave gay practical or fanciful had come to be considered with a favor by the editors of the various periodicals for which i wrote on which i found in time i could rely with a very comfortable certainty  my productions created no enthusiasm in the reading public they gave me no great reputation or very valuable pecuniary return but they were always accepted and my receipts from them at the time to which i have referred were as regular and reliable as a salary and quite sufficient to give me more than a comfortable support  it was at this time i married  i had been engaged for more than a year but had not been willing to assume the support of a wife until i felt that my pecuniary position was so assured that i could do so with full satisfaction to my own conscience  there was now no doubt in regard to this position either in my mind or in that of my wife  i worked with great steadiness and regularity i knew exactly where to place the productions of my pen and could calculate with a fair degree of accuracy the sums i should receive for them  we were by no means rich but we had enough and were thoroughly satisfied and content  those of my readers who are married will have no difficulty in remembering the peculiar ecstasy of the first weeks of their wedded life  it is then that the flowers of this world bloom brightest that its sun is the most genial that its clouds are the scarcest that its fruit is the most delicious that the air is the most balmy that its cigars are of the highest flavor that the warmth and radiance of early matrimonial felicity so rarefy the intellectual atmosphere that the soul mounts higher and enjoys a wider prospect than ever before  these experiences were mine  the plain claret of my mind was changed to sparkling champagne and at the very height of its effervescence i wrote a story  the happy thought that then struck me for a tale was of a very peculiar character and it interested me so much that i went to work at it with great delight and enthusiasm and finished it in a comparatively short time  the title of the story was his wifes deceased sister and when i read it to hypatia she was delighted with it and at times was so affected by its pathos that her uncontrollable emotion caused a sympathetic dimness in my eyes which prevented my seeing the words i had written  when the reading was ended and my wife had dried her eyes she turned to me and said this story will make your fortune  there has been nothing so pathetic since lamartines history of a servant girl  as soon as possible the next day i sent my story to the editor of the periodical for which i wrote most frequently and in which my best productions generally appeared  in a few days i had a letter from the editor in which he praised my story as he had never before praised anything from my pen  it had interested and charmed he said not only himself but all his associates in the office  even old gibson who never cared to read anything until it was in proof and who never praised anything which had not a joke in it was induced by the example of the others to read this manuscript and shed as he asserted the first tears that had come from his eyes since his final paternal castigation some forty years before  the story would appear the editor assured me as soon as he could possibly find room for it   if anything could make our skies more genial our flowers brighter and the flavor of our fruit and cigars more delicious it was a letter like this  and when in a very short time the story was published we found that the reading public was inclined to receive it with as much sympathetic interest and favor as had been shown to it by the editors  my personal friends soon began to express enthusiastic opinions upon it  it was highly praised in many of the leading newspapers and altogether it was a great literary success  i am not inclined to be vain of my writings and in general my wife tells me i think too little of them  but i did feel a good deal of pride and satisfaction in the success of his wifes deceased sister if it did not make my fortune as my wife asserted it would it certainly would help me very much in my literary career  in less than a month from the writing of this story something very unusual and unexpected happened to me  a manuscript was returned by the editor of the periodical in which his wifes deceased sister had appeared   it is a good story he wrote but not equal to what you have just done  you have made a great hit and it would not do to interfere with the reputation you have gained by publishing anything inferior to his wifes deceased sister which has had such a deserved success   i was so unaccustomed to having my work thrown back on my hands that i think i must have turned a little pale when i read the letter  i said nothing of the matter to my wife for it would be foolish to drop such grains of sand as this into the smoothly oiled machinery of our domestic felicity but i immediately sent the story to another editor i am not able to express the astonishment i felt when in the course of a week it was sent back to me  the tone of the note accompanying it indicated a somewhat injured feeling on the part of the editor   i am reluctant he said to decline a manuscript from you but you know very well that if you sent me anything like his wifes deceased sister it would be most promptly accepted  i now felt obliged to speak of the affair to my wife who was quite as much surprised though perhaps not quite as much shocked as i had been  let us read the story again she said and see what is the matter with it  when we had finished its perusal hypatia remarked  it is quite as good as many of the stories you have had printed and i think it very interesting although of course it is not equal to his wifes deceased sister  of course not said i that was an inspiration that i cannot expect every day  but there must be something wrong about this last story which we do not perceive  perhaps my recent success may have made me a little careless in writing it  i dont believe that said hypatia  at any rate i continued i will lay it aside and will go to work on a new one  in due course of time i had another manuscript finished and i sent it to my favorite periodical  it was retained some weeks and then came back to me  it will never do the editor wrote quite warmly for you to go backward  the demand for the number containing his wifes deceased sister still continues and we do not intend to let you disappoint that great body of readers who would be so eager to see another number containing one of your stories   i sent this manuscript to four other periodicals and from each of them it was returned with remarks to the effect that although it was not a bad story in itself it was not what they would expect from the author of his wifes deceased sister  the editor of a western magazine wrote to me for a story to be published in a special number which he would issue for the holidays  i wrote him one of the character and length he desired and sent it to him  by return mail it came back to me   i had hoped the editor wrote when i asked for a story from your pen to receive something like his wifes deceased sister and i must own that i am very much disappointed   i was so filled with anger when i read this note that i openly objurgated his wifes deceased sister  you must excuse me i said to my astonished wife for expressing myself thus in your presence but that confounded story will be the ruin of me yet  until it is forgotten nobody will ever take anything i write  and you cannot expect it ever to be forgotten said hypatia with tears in her eyes  it is needless for me to detail my literary efforts in the course of the next few months  the ideas of the editors with whom my principal business had been done in regard to my literary ability had been so raised by my unfortunate story of his wifes deceased sister that i found it was of no use to send them anything of lesser merit  and as to the other journals which i tried they evidently considered it an insult for me to send them matter inferior to that by which my reputation had lately risen  the fact was that my successful story had ruined me  my income was at an end and want actually stared me in the face and i must admit that i did not like the expression of its countenance  it was of no use for me to try to write another story like his wifes deceased sister  i could not get married every time i began a new manuscript and it was the exaltation of mind caused by my wedded felicity which produced that story  its perfectly dreadful said my wife  if i had had a sister and she had died i would have thought it was my fault  it could not be your fault i answered and i do not think it was mine  i had no intention of deceiving anybody into the belief that i could do that sort of thing every time and it ought not to be expected of me  suppose raphaels patrons had tried to keep him screwed up to the pitch of the sistine madonna and had refused to buy anything which was not as good as that  in that case i think he would have occupied a much earlier and narrower grave than the one on which mr morris moore hangs his funeral decorations  but my dear said hypatia who was posted on such subjects the sistine madonna was one of his latest paintings  very true said i  but if he had married as i did he would have painted it earlier  i was walking homeward one afternoon about this time when i met barbel a man i had known well in my early literary career  he was now about fifty years of age but looked older  his hair and beard were quite gray and his clothes which were of the same general hue gave me the idea that they like his hair had originally been black  age is very hard on a mans external appointments  barbel had an air of having been to let for a long time and quite out of repair  but there was a kindly gleam in his eye and he welcomed me cordially  why what is the matter old fellow said he  i never saw you look so woebegone  i had no reason to conceal anything from barbel  in my younger days he had been of great use to me and he had a right to know the state of my affairs  i laid the whole case plainly before him  look here he said when i had finished come with me to my room i have something i would like to say to you there  i followed barbel to his room  it was at the top of a very dirty and wellworn house which stood in a narrow and lumpy street into which few vehicles ever penetrated except the ash and garbagecarts and the rickety wagons of the venders of stale vegetables  this is not exactly a fashionable promenade said barbel as we approached the house but in some respects it reminds me of the streets in italian towns where the palaces lean over toward each other in such a friendly way  barbels room was to my mind rather more doleful than the street  it was dark it was dusty and cobwebs hung from every corner  the few chairs upon the floor and the books upon a greasy table seemed to be afflicted with some dorsal epidemic for their backs were either gone or broken  a little bedstead in the corner was covered with a spread made of new york heralds with their edges pasted together  there is nothing better said barbel noticing my glance toward this novel counterpane for a bedcovering than newspapers they keep you as warm as a blanket and are much lighter  i used to use tribunes but they rattled too much  the only part of the room which was well lighted was one end near the solitary window  here upon a table with a spliced leg stood a little grindstone  at the other end of the room said barbel is my cookstove which you cant see unless i light the candle in the bottle which stands by it  but if you dont care particularly to examine it i wont go to the expense of lighting up  you might pick up a good many odd pieces of bricabrac around here if you chose to strike a match and investigate  but i would not advise you to do so  it would pay better to throw the things out of the window than to carry them downstairs the particular piece of indoor decoration to which i wish to call your attention is this  and he led me to a little wooden frame which hung against the wall near the window  behind a dusty piece of glass it held what appeared to be a leaf from a small magazine or journal there said he you see a page from the grasshopper a humorous paper which flourished in this city some halfdozen years ago  i used to write regularly for that paper as you may remember  oh yes indeed i exclaimed  and i shall never forget your conundrum of the anvil which appeared in it  how often have i laughed at that most wonderful conceit and how often have i put it to my friends  barbel gazed at me silently for a moment and then he pointed to the frame  that printed page he said solemnly contains the conundrum of the anvil  i hang it there so that i can see it while i work that conundrum ruined me  it was the last thing i wrote for the grasshopper  how i ever came to imagine it i cannot tell  it is one of those things which occur to a man but once in a lifetime  after the wild shout of delight with which the public greeted that conundrum my subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision  the grasshopper turned its hind legs upon me  i sank from bad to worsemuch worseuntil at last i found myself reduced to my present occupation which is that of grinding points on pins  by this i procure my bread coffee and tobacco and sometimes potatoes and meat  one day while i was hard at work an organgrinder came into the street below  he played the serenade from trovatore and the familiar notes brought back visions of old days and old delights when the successful writer wore good clothes and sat at operas when he looked into sweet eyes and talked of italian airs when his future appeared all a succession of bright scenery and joyous acts without any provision for a dropcurtain  and as my ear listened and my mind wandered in this happy retrospect my every faculty seemed exalted and without any thought upon the matter i ground points upon my pins so fine so regular and so smooth that they would have pierced with ease the leather of a boot or slipped without abrasion among the finest threads of rare old lace  when the organ stopped and i fell back into my real world of cobwebs and mustiness i gazed upon the pins i had just ground and without a moments hesitation i threw them into the street and reported the lot as spoiled  this cost me a little money but it saved me my livelihood  after a few moments of silence barbel resumed  i have no more to say to you my young friend  all i want you to do is to look upon that framed conundrum then upon this grindstone and then to go home and reflect  as for me i have a gross of pins to grind before the sun goes down  i cannot say that my depression of mind was at all relieved by what i had seen and heard  i had lost sight of barbel for some years and i had supposed him still floating on the sunsparkling stream of prosperity where i had last seen him  it was a great shock to me to find him in such a condition of poverty and squalor and to see a man who had originated the conundrum of the anvil reduced to the souldepressing occupation of grinding pinpoints  as i walked and thought the dreadful picture of a totally eclipsed future arose before my mind  the moral of barbel sank deep into my heart  when i reached home i told my wife the story of my friend barbel  she listened with a sad and eager interest  i am afraid she said if our fortunes do not quickly mend that we shall have to buy two little grindstones  you know i could help you at that sort of thing  for a long time we sat together and talked and devised many plans for the future  i did not think it necessary yet for me to look out for a pin contract but i must find some way of making money or we should starve to death  of course the first thing that suggested itself was the possibility of finding some other business  but apart from the difficulty of immediately obtaining remunerative work in occupations to which i had not been trained i felt a great and natural reluctance to give up a profession for which i had carefully prepared myself and which i had adopted as my lifework  it would be very hard for me to lay down my pen forever and to close the top of my inkstand upon all the bright and happy fancies which i had seen mirrored in its tranquil pool  we talked and pondered the rest of that day and a good deal of the night but we came to no conclusion as to what it would be best for us to do  the next day i determined to go and call upon the editor of the journal for which in happier days before the blight of his wifes deceased sister rested upon me i used most frequently to write and having frankly explained my condition to him to ask his advice  the editor was a good man and had always been my friend  he listened with great attention to what i told him and evidently sympathized with me in my trouble  as we have written to you he said the only reason why we did not accept the manuscripts you sent us was that they would have disappointed the high hopes that the public had formed in regard to you  we have had letter after letter asking when we were going to publish another story like his wifes deceased sister  we felt and we still feel that it would be wrong to allow you to destroy the fair fabric which you yourself have raised  but he added with a kind smile i see very plainly that your welldeserved reputation will be of little advantage to you if you should starve at the moment that its genial beams are so to speak lighting you up  its beams are not genial i answered  they have scorched and withered me  how would you like said the editor after a short reflection to allow us to publish the stories you have recently written under some other name than your own  that would satisfy us and the public would put money in your pocket and would not interfere with your reputation  joyfully i seized the noble fellow by the hand and instantly accepted his proposition  of course said i a reputation is a very good thing but no reputation can take the place of food clothes and a house to live in and i gladly agree to sink my overillumined name into oblivion and to appear before the public as a new and unknown writer  i hope that need not be for long he said for i feel sure that you will yet write stories as good as his wifes deceased sister  all the manuscripts i had on hand i now sent to my good friend the editor and in due and proper order they appeared in his journal under the name of john darmstadt which i had selected as a substitute for my own permanently disabled  i made a similar arrangement with other editors and john darmstadt received the credit of everything that proceeded from my pen  our circumstances now became very comfortable and occasionally we even allowed ourselves to indulge in little dreams of prosperity  time passed on very pleasantly  one year another and then a little son was born to us  it is often difficult i believe for thoughtful persons to decide whether the beginning of their conjugal career or the earliest weeks in the life of their firstborn be the happiest and proudest period of their existence  for myself i can only say that the same exaltation of mind the same rarefication of idea and invention which succeeded upon my wedding day came upon me now  as then my ecstatic emotions crystallized themselves into a motive for a story and without delay i set myself to work upon it  my boy was about six weeks old when the manuscript was finished and one evening as we sat before a comfortable fire in our sittingroom with the curtains drawn and the soft lamp lighted and the baby sleeping soundly in the adjoining chamber i read the story to my wife  when i had finished my wife arose and threw herself into my arms  i was never so proud of you she said her glad eyes sparkling as i am at this moment  that is a wonderful story  it is indeed i am sure it is just as good as his wifes deceased sister  as she spoke these words a sudden and chilling sensation crept over us both  all her warmth and fervor and the proud and happy glow engendered within me by this praise and appreciation from one i loved vanished in an instant  we stepped apart and gazed upon each other with pallid faces  in the same moment the terrible truth had flashed upon us both  this story was as good as his wifes deceased sister  we stood silent  the exceptional lot of barbels superpointed pins seemed to pierce our very souls  a dreadful vision rose before me of an impending fall and crash in which our domestic happiness should vanish and our prospects for our boy be wrecked just as we had began to build them up  my wife approached me and took my hand in hers which was as cold as ice  be strong and firm she said  a great danger threatens us but you must brace yourself against it  be strong and firm  i pressed her hand and we said no more that night  the next day i took the manuscript i had just written and carefully infolded it in stout wrappingpaper  then i went to a neighboring grocery store and bought a small strong tin box originally intended for biscuit with a cover that fitted tightly  in this i placed my manuscript and then i took the box to a tinsmith and had the top fastened on with hard solder  when i went home i ascended into the garret and brought down to my study a ships cashbox which had once belonged to one of my family who was a seacaptain  this box was very heavy and firmly bound with iron and was secured by two massive locks  calling my wife i told her of the contents of the tin case which i then placed in the box and having shut down the heavy lid i doubly locked it  this key said i putting it in my pocket i shall throw into the river when i go out this afternoon  my wife watched me eagerly with a pallid and firmset countenance but upon which i could see the faint glimmer of returning happiness  wouldnt it be well she said to secure it still further by sealingwax and pieces of tape  no said i  i do not believe that any one will attempt to tamper with our prosperity  and now my dear i continued in an impressive voice no one but you and in the course of time our son shall know that this manuscript exists  when i am dead those who survive me may if they see fit cause this box to be split open and the story published  the reputation it may give my name cannot harm me then     the widows cruise  the widow ducket lived in a small village about ten miles from the new jersey seacoast  in this village she was born here she had married and buried her husband and here she expected somebody to bury her but she was in no hurry for this for she had scarcely reached middle age she was a tall woman with no apparent fat in her composition and full of activity both muscular and mental  she rose at six oclock in the morning cooked breakfast set the table washed the dishes when the meal was over milked churned swept washed ironed worked in her little garden attended to the flowers in the front yard and in the afternoon knitted and quilted and sewed and after tea she either went to see her neighbors or had them come to see her  when it was really dark she lighted the lamp in her parlor and read for an hour and if it happened to be one of miss mary wilkinss books that she read she expressed doubts as to the realism of the characters therein described  these doubts she expressed to dorcas networthy who was a small plump woman with a solemn face who had lived with the widow for many years and who had become her devoted disciple  whatever the widow did that also did dorcasnot so well for her heart told her she could never expect to do that but with a yearning anxiety to do everything as well as she could  she rose at five minutes past six and in a subsidiary way she helped to get the breakfast to eat it to wash up the dishes to work in the garden to quilt to sew to visit and receive and no one could have tried harder than she did to keep awake when the widow read aloud in the evening  all these things happened every day in the summertime but in the winter the widow and dorcas cleared the snow from their little front path instead of attending to the flowers and in the evening they lighted a fire as well as a lamp in the parlor  sometimes however something different happened but this was not often only a few times in the year  one of the different things occurred when mrs ducket and dorcas were sitting on their little front porch one summer afternoon one on the little bench on one side of the door and the other on the little bench on the other side of the door each waiting until she should hear the clock strike five to prepare tea  but it was not yet a quarter to five when a onehorse wagon containing four men came slowly down the street  dorcas first saw the wagon and she instantly stopped knitting  mercy on me she exclaimed  whoever those people are they are strangers here and they dont know where to stop for they first go to one side of the street and then to the other  the widow looked around sharply  humph said she  those men are sailormen  you might see that in a twinklin of an eye  sailormen always drive that way because that is the way they sail ships  they first tack in one direction and then in another  mr ducket didnt like the sea remarked dorcas for about the three hundredth time  no he didnt answered the widow for about the two hundred and fiftieth time for there had been occasions when she thought dorcas put this question inopportunely  he hated it and he was drowned in it through trustin a sailorman which i never did nor shall  do you really believe those men are comin here  upon my word i do said dorcas and her opinion was correct  the wagon drew up in front of mrs duckets little white house and the two women sat rigidly their hands in their laps staring at the man who drove  this was an elderly personage with whitish hair and under his chin a thin whitish beard which waved in the gentle breeze and gave dorcas the idea that his head was filled with hair which was leaking out from below  is this the widow duckets inquired this elderly man in a strong penetrating voice  thats my name said the widow and laying her knitting on the bench beside her she went to the gate  dorcas also laid her knitting on the bench beside her and went to the gate  i was told said the elderly man at a house we touched at about a quarter of a mile back that the widow duckets was the only house in this village where there was any chance of me and my mates getting a meal  we are four sailors and we are making from the bay over to cuppertown and thats eight miles ahead yet and we are all pretty sharp set for something to eat  this is the place said the widow and i do give meals if there is enough in the house and everything comes handy  does everything come handy today said he  it does said she and you can hitch your horse and come in but i havent got anything for him  oh thats all right said the man we brought along stores for him so well just make fast and then come in  the two women hurried into the house in a state of bustling preparation for the furnishing of this meal meant one dollar in cash  the four mariners all elderly men descended from the wagon each one scrambling with alacrity over a different wheel  a box of broken shipbiscuit was brought out and put on the ground in front of the horse who immediately set himself to eating with great satisfaction  tea was a little late that day because there were six persons to provide for instead of two but it was a good meal and after the four seamen had washed their hands and faces at the pump in the back yard and had wiped them on two towels furnished by dorcas they all came in and sat down  mrs ducket seated herself at the head of the table with the dignity proper to the mistress of the house and dorcas seated herself at the other end with the dignity proper to the disciple of the mistress  no service was necessary for everything that was to be eaten or drunk was on the table  when each of the elderly mariners had had as much bread and butter quickly baked sodabiscuit dried beef cold ham cold tongue and preserved fruit of every variety known as his storage capacity would permit the mariner in command captain bird pushed back his chair whereupon the other mariners pushed back their chairs  madam said captain bird we have all made a good meal which didnt need to be no better nor more of it and were satisfied but that horse out there has not had time to rest himself enough to go the eight miles that lies ahead of us so if its all the same to you and this good lady wed like to sit on that front porch awhile and smoke our pipes  i was alooking at that porch when i came in and i bethought to myself what a rare good place it was to smoke a pipe in  theres pipes been smoked there said the widow rising and it can be done again  inside the house i dont allow tobacco but on the porch neither of us minds   so the four captains betook themselves to the porch two of them seating themselves on the little bench on one side of the door and two of them on the little bench on the other side of the door and lighted their pipes  shall we clear off the table and wash up the dishes said dorcas or wait until they are gone  we will wait until they are gone said the widow for now that they are here we might as well have a bit of a chat with them  when a sailorman lights his pipe he is generally willin to talk but when he is eatin you cant get a word out of him  without thinking it necessary to ask permission for the house belonged to her the widow ducket brought a chair and put it in the hall close to the open front door and dorcas brought another chair and seated herself by the side of the widow  do all you sailormen belong down there at the bay asked mrs ducket thus the conversation began and in a few minutes it had reached a point at which captain bird thought it proper to say that a great many strange things happen to seamen sailing on the sea which landspeople never dream of  such as anything in particular asked the widow at which remark dorcas clasped her hands in expectancy  at this question each of the mariners took his pipe from his mouth and gazed upon the floor in thought  theres a good many strange things happened to me and my mates at sea would you and that other lady like to hear any of them asked captain bird  we would like to hear them if they are true said the widow  theres nothing happened to me and my mates that isnt true said captain bird and here is something that once happened to me  i was on a whaling vyage when a big spermwhale just as mad as a fiery bull came at us head on and struck the ship at the stern with such tremendous force that his head crashed right through her timbers and he went nearly half his length into her hull  the hold was mostly filled with empty barrels for we was just beginning our vyage and when he had made kindlingwood of these there was room enough for him  we all expected that it wouldnt take five minutes for the vessel to fill and go to the bottom and we made ready to take to the boats but it turned out we didnt need to take to no boats for as fast as the water rushed into the hold of the ship that whale drank it and squirted it up through the two blowholes in the top of his head and as there was an open hatchway just over his head the water all went into the sea again and that whale kept working day and night pumping the water out until we beached the vessel on the island of trinidadthe whale helping us wonderful on our way over by the powerful working of his tail which being outside in the water acted like a propeller  i dont believe any thing stranger than that ever happened to a whaling ship  no said the widow i dont believe anything ever did  captain bird now looked at captain sanderson and the latter took his pipe out of his mouth and said that in all his sailing around the world he had never known anything queerer than what happened to a big steamship he chanced to be on which ran into an island in a fog everybody on board thought the ship was wrecked but it had twin screws and was going at such a tremendous speed that it turned the island entirely upside down and sailed over it and he had heard tell that even now people sailing over the spot could look down into the water and see the roots of the trees and the cellars of the houses  captain sanderson now put his pipe back into his mouth and captain burress took out his pipe  i was once in an obeliskship said he that used to trade regular between egypt and new york carrying obelisks  we had a big obelisk on board  the way they ship obelisks is to make a hole in the stern of the ship and run the obelisk in pinted end foremost and this obelisk filled up nearly the whole of that ship from stern to bow  we was about ten days out and sailing afore a northeast gale with the engines at full speed when suddenly we spied breakers ahead and our captain saw we was about to run on a bank  now if we hadnt had an obelisk on board we might have sailed over that bank but the captain knew that with an obelisk on board we drew too much water for this and that wed be wrecked in about fiftyfive seconds if something wasnt done quick  so he had to do something quick and this is what he did he ordered all steam on and drove slambang on that bank  just as he expected we stopped so suddint that that big obelisk bounced forard its pinted end foremost and went clean through the bow and shot out into the sea  the minute it did that the vessel was so lightened that it rose in the water and we easily steamed over the bank  there was one man knocked overboard by the shock when we struck but as soon as we missed him we went back after him and we got him all right  you see when that obelisk went overboard its buttend which was heaviest went down first and when it touched the bottom it just stood there and as it was such a big obelisk there was about five and a half feet of it stuck out of the water  the man who was knocked overboard he just swum for that obelisk and he climbed up the hiryglyphics  it was a mighty fine obelisk and the egyptians had cut their hiryglyphics good and deep so that the man could get hand and foothold and when we got to him and took him off he was sitting high and dry on the pinted end of that obelisk  it was a great pity about the obelisk for it was a good obelisk but as i never heard the company tried to raise it i expect it is standing there yet  captain burress now put his pipe back into his mouth and looked at captain jenkinson who removed his pipe and said  the queerest thing that ever happened to me was about a shark  we was off the banks and the time of year was july and the ice was coming down and we got in among a lot of it  not far away off our weather bow there was a little iceberg which had such a queerness about it that the captain and three men went in a boat to look at it  the ice was mighty clear ice and you could see almost through it and right inside of it not more than three feet above the waterline and about two feet or maybe twenty inches inside the ice was a whopping big shark about fourteen feet longa regular maneaterfrozen in there hard and fast  bless my soul said the captain this is a wonderful curiosity and im going to git him out  just then one of the men said he saw that shark wink but the captain wouldnt believe him for he said that shark was frozen stiff and hard and couldnt wink  you see the captain had his own idees about things and he knew that whales was warmblooded and would freeze if they was shut up in ice but he forgot that sharks was not whales and that theyre coldblooded just like toads  and there is toads that has been shut up in rocks for thousands of years and they stayed alive no matter how cold the place was because they was coldblooded and when the rocks was split out hopped the frog  but as i said before the captain forgot sharks was coldblooded and he determined to git that one out  now you both know being housekeepers that if you take a needle and drive it into a hunk of ice you can split it  the captain had a sailneedle with him and so he drove it into the iceberg right alongside of the shark and split it  now the minute he did it he knew that the man was right when he said he saw the shark wink for it flopped out of that iceberg quicker nor a flash of lightning  what a happy fish he must have been ejaculated dorcas forgetful of precedent so great was her emotion  yes said captain jenkinson it was a happy fish enough but it wasnt a happy captain  you see that shark hadnt had anything to eat perhaps for a thousand years until the captain came along with his sailneedle  surely you sailormen do see strange things now said the widow and the strangest thing about them is that they are true  yes indeed said dorcas that is the most wonderful thing  you wouldnt suppose said the widow ducket glancing from one bench of mariners to the other that i have a seastory to tell but i have and if you like i will tell it to you  captain bird looked up a little surprised  we would like to hear itindeed we would madam said he  ay ay said captain burress and the two other mariners nodded  it was a good while ago she said when i was living on the shore near the head of the bay that my husband was away and i was left alone in the house  one mornin my sisterinlaw who lived on the other side of the bay sent me word by a boy on a horse that she hadnt any oil in the house to fill the lamp that she always put in the window to light her husband home who was a fisherman and if i would send her some by the boy she would pay me back as soon as they bought oil  the boy said he would stop on his way home and take the oil to her but he never did stop or perhaps he never went back and about five oclock i began to get dreadfully worried for i knew if that lamp wasnt in my sisterinlaws window by dark she might be a widow before midnight so i said to myself ive got to get that oil to her no matter what happens or how its done  of course i couldnt tell what might happen but there was only one way it could be done and that was for me to get into the boat that was tied to the post down by the water and take it to her for it was too far for me to walk around by the head of the bay  now the trouble was i didnt know no more about a boat and the managin of it than any one of you sailormen knows about clear starchin  but there wasnt no use of thinkin what i knew and what i didnt know for i had to take it to her and there was no way of doin it except in that boat  so i filled a gallon can for i thought i might as well take enough while i was about it and i went down to the water and i unhitched that boat and i put the oilcan into her and then i got in and off i started and when i was about a quarter of a mile from the shore  madam interrupted captain bird did you row oror was there a sail to the boat  the widow looked at the questioner for a moment  no said she i didnt row  i forgot to bring the oars from the house but it didnt matter for i didnt know how to use them and if there had been a sail i couldnt have put it up for i didnt know how to use it either  i used the rudder to make the boat go  the rudder was the only thing i knew anything about  id held a rudder when i was a little girl and i knew how to work it  so i just took hold of the handle of the rudder and turned it round and round and that made the boat go ahead you know and  madam exclaimed captain bird and the other elderly mariners took their pipes from their mouths  yes that is the way i did it continued the widow briskly  big steamships are made to go by a propeller turning round and round at their back ends and i made the rudder work in the same way and i got along very well too until suddenly when i was about a quarter of a mile from the shore a most terrible and awful storm arose  there must have been a typhoon or a cyclone out at sea for the waves came up the bay bigger than houses and when they got to the head of the bay they turned around and tried to get out to sea again  so in this way they continually met and made the most awful and roarin pilin up of waves that ever was known  my little boat was pitched about as if it had been a feather in a breeze and when the front part of it was cleavin itself down into the water the hind part was stickin up until the rudder whizzed around like a patent churn with no milk in it  the thunder began to roar and the lightnin flashed and three seagulls so nearly frightened to death that they began to turn up the whites of their eyes flew down and sat on one of the seats of the boat forgettin in that awful moment that man was their natral enemy  i had a couple of biscuits in my pocket because i had thought i might want a bite in crossing and i crumbled up one of these and fed the poor creatures  then i began to wonder what i was goin to do for things were gettin awfuller and awfuller every instant and the little boat was aheavin and apitchin and arollin and histin itself up first on one end and then on the other to such an extent that if i hadnt kept tight hold of the rudderhandle id slipped off the seat i was sittin on  all of a sudden i remembered that oil in the can but just as i was puttin my fingers on the cork my conscience smote me  am i goin to use this oil i said to myself and let my sisterinlaws husband be wrecked for want of it  and then i thought that he wouldnt want it all that night and perhaps they would buy oil the next day and so i poured out about a tumblerful of it on the water and i can just tell you sailormen that you never saw anything act as prompt as that did in three seconds or perhaps five the water all around me for the distance of a small front yard was just as flat as a table and as smooth as glass and so invitin in appearance that the three gulls jumped out of the boat and began to swim about on it primin their feathers and lookin at themselves in the transparent depths though i must say that one of them made an awful face as he dipped his bill into the water and tasted kerosene  now i had time to sit quiet in the midst of the placid space i had made for myself and rest from workin of the rudder  truly it was a wonderful and marvellous thing to look at  the waves was roarin and leapin up all around me higher than the roof of this house and sometimes their tops would reach over so that they nearly met and shut out all view of the stormy sky which seemed as if it was bein torn to pieces by blazin lightnin while the thunder pealed so tremendous that it almost drowned the roar of the waves  not only above and all around me was every thing terrific and fearful but even under me it was the same for there was a big crack in the bottom of the boat as wide as my hand and through this i could see down into the water beneath and there was  madam ejaculated captain bird the hand which had been holding his pipe a few inches from his mouth now dropping to his knee and at this motion the hands which held the pipes of the three other mariners dropped to their knees  of course it sounds strange continued the widow but i know that people can see down into clear water and the water under me was clear and the crack was wide enough for me to see through and down under me was sharks and swordfishes and other horrible water creatures which i had never seen before all driven into the bay i havent a doubt by the violence of the storm out at sea  the thought of my bein upset and fallin in among those monsters made my very blood run cold and involuntarylike i began to turn the handle of the rudder and in a moment i shot into a wall of ragin seawater that was towerin around me  for a second i was fairly blinded and stunned but i had the cork out of that oilcan in no time and very soonyoud scarcely believe it if i told you how sooni had another placid millpond surroundin of me  i sat there apantin and fannin with my straw hat for youd better believe i was flustered and then i began to think how long it would take me to make a line of millponds clean across the head of the bay and how much oil it would need and whether i had enough  so i sat and calculated that if a tumblerful of oil would make a smooth place about seven yards across which i should say was the width of the one i was inwhich i calculated by a measure of my eye as to how many breadths of carpet it would take to cover itand if the bay was two miles across betwixt our house and my sisterinlaws and although i couldnt get the thing down to exact figures i saw pretty soon that i wouldnt have oil enough to make a level cuttin through all those mountainous billows and besides even if i had enough to take me across what would be the good of goin if there wasnt any oil left to fill my sisterinlaws lamp  while i was thinkin and calculatin a perfectly dreadful thing happened which made me think if i didnt get out of this pretty soon id find myself in a mighty risky predicament  the oilcan which i had forgotten to put the cork in toppled over and before i could grab it every drop of the oil ran into the hind part of the boat where it was soaked up by a lot of dry dust that was there  no wonder my heart sank when i saw this  glancin wildly around me as people will do when they are scared i saw the smooth place i was in gettin smaller and smaller for the kerosene was evaporatin as it will do even off woollen clothes if you give it time enough  the first pond i had come out of seemed to be covered up and the great towerin throbbin precipice of seawater was aclosin around me  castin down my eyes in despair i happened to look through the crack in the bottom of the boat and oh what a blessed relief it was for down there everything was smooth and still and i could see the sand on the bottom as level and hard no doubt as it was on the beach suddenly the thought struck me that that bottom would give me the only chance i had of gettin out of the frightful fix i was in  if i could fill that oilcan with air and then puttin it under my arm and takin a long breath if i could drop down on that smooth bottom i might run along toward shore as far as i could and then when i felt my breath was givin out i could take a pull at the oilcan and take another run and then take another pull and another run and perhaps the can would hold air enough for me until i got near enough to shore to wade to dry land  to be sure the sharks and other monsters were down there but then they must have been awfully frightened and perhaps they might not remember that man was their natral enemy  anyway i thought it would be better to try the smooth water passage down there than stay and be swallowed up by the ragin waves on top  so i blew the can full of air and corked it and then i tore up some of the boards from the bottom of the boat so as to make a hole big enough for me to get throughand you sailormen neednt wriggle so when i say that for you all know a divinbell hasnt any bottom at all and the water never comes inand so when i got the hole big enough i took the oilcan under my arm and was just about to slip down through it when i saw an awful turtle awalkin through the sand at the bottom  now i might trust sharks and swordfishes and seaserpents to be frightened and forget about their natral enemies but i never could trust a gray turtle as big as a cart with a black neck a yard long with yellow bags to its jaws to forget anything or to remember anything  id as lieve get into a bathtub with a live crab as to go down there  it wasnt of no use even so much as thinkin of it so i gave up that plan and didnt once look through that hole again  and what did you do madam asked captain bird who was regarding her with a face of stone  i used electricity she said  now dont start as if you had a shock of it  thats what i used  when i was younger than i was then and sometimes visited friends in the city we often amused ourselves by rubbing our feet on the carpet until we got ourselves so full of electricity that we could put up our fingers and light the gas  so i said to myself that if i could get full of electricity for the purpose of lightin the gas i could get full of it for other purposes and so without losin a moment i set to work  i stood up on one of the seats which was dry and i rubbed the bottoms of my shoes backward and forward on it with such violence and swiftness that they pretty soon got warm and i began fillin with electricity and when i was fully charged with it from my toes to the top of my head i just sprang into the water and swam ashore  of course i couldnt sink bein full of electricity  captain bird heaved a long sigh and rose to his feet whereupon the other mariners rose to their feet madam said captain bird whats to pay for the supper andthe rest of the entertainment  the supper is twentyfive cents apiece said the widow ducket and everything else is free gratis  whereupon each mariner put his hand into his trousers pocket pulled out a silver quarter and handed it to the widow  then with four solemn good evenins they went out to the front gate  cast off captain jenkinson said captain bird and you captain burress clew him up forard  you can stay in the bow captain sanderson and take the sheetlines  ill go aft  all being ready each of the elderly mariners clambered over a wheel and having seated themselves they prepared to lay their course for cuppertown  but just as they were about to start captain jenkinson asked that they lay to a bit and clambering down over his wheel he reentered the front gate and went up to the door of the house where the widow and dorcas were still standing  madam said he i just came back to ask what became of your brotherinlaw through his wifes not bein able to put no light in the window  the storm drove him ashore on our side of the bay said she and the next mornin he came up to our house and i told him all that had happened to me  and when he took our boat and went home and told that story to his wife she just packed up and went out west and got divorced from him  and it served him right too  thank you maam said captain jenkinson and going out of the gate he clambered up over the wheel and the wagon cleared for cuppertown  when the elderly mariners were gone the widow ducket still standing in the door turned to dorcas  think of it she said  to tell all that to me in my own house and after i had opened my one jar of brandied peaches that id been keepin for special company  in your own house ejaculated dorcas  and not one of them brandied peaches left  the widow jingled the four quarters in her hand before she slipped them into her pocket  anyway dorcas she remarked i think we can now say we are square with all the world and so lets go in and wash the dishes  yes said dorcas were square     captain elis best ear  the little seaside village of sponkannis lies so quietly upon a protected spot on our atlantic coast that it makes no more stir in the world than would a pebble which held between ones finger and thumb should be dipped below the surface of a millpond and then dropped about the postoffice and the storeboth under the same roofthe greater number of the houses cluster as if they had come for their weeks groceries or were waiting for the mail while toward the west the dwellings become fewer and fewer until at last the village blends into a long stretch of sandy coast and scrubby pinewoods  eastward the village ends abruptly at the foot of a windswept bluff on which no one cares to build  among the last houses in the western end of the village stood two neat substantial dwellings one belonging to captain eli bunker and the other to captain cephas dyer  these householders were two very respectable retired mariners the first a widower about fifty and the other a bachelor of perhaps the same age a few years more or less making but little difference in this region of weatherbeaten youth and seasoned age  each of these good captains lived alone and each took entire charge of his own domestic affairs not because he was poor but because it pleased him to do so  when captain eli retired from the sea he was the owner of a good vessel which he sold at a fair profit and captain cephas had made money in many a voyage before he built his house in sponkannis and settled there  when captain elis wife was living she was his household manager  but captain cephas had never had a woman in his house except during the first few months of his occupancy when certain female neighbors came in occasionally to attend to little matters of cleaning which according to popular notions properly belong to the sphere of woman  but captain cephas soon put an end to this sort of thing  he did not like a womans ways especially her ways of attending to domestic affairs  he liked to live in sailor fashion and to keep house in sailor fashion  in his establishment everything was shipshape and everything which could be stowed away was stowed away and if possible in a bunker  the floors were holystoned nearly every day and the whole house was repainted about twice a year a little at a time when the weather was suitable for this marine recreation  things not in frequent use were lashed securely to the walls or perhaps put out of the way by being hauled up to the ceiling by means of blocks and tackle  his cooking was done sailor fashion like everything else and he never failed to have plumduff on sunday  his well was near his house and every morning he dropped into it a lead and line and noted down the depth of water  three times a day he entered in a little notebook the state of the weather the height of the mercury in barometer and thermometer the direction of the wind and special weather points when necessary  captain eli managed his domestic affairs in an entirely different way he kept house woman fashionnot however in the manner of an ordinary woman but after the manner of his late wife miranda bunker now dead some seven years  like his friend captain cephas he had had the assistance of his female neighbors during the earlier days of his widowerhood  but he soon found that these women did not do things as miranda used to do them and although he frequently suggested that they should endeavor to imitate the methods of his late consort they did not even try to do things as she used to do them preferring their own ways  therefore it was that captain eli determined to keep house by himself and to do it as nearly as his nature would allow as miranda used to do it  he swept his doors and he shook his doormats he washed his paint with soap and hot water he dusted his furniture with a soft cloth which he afterwards stuck behind a chest of drawers he made his bed very neatly turning down the sheet at the top and setting the pillow upon edge smoothing it carefully after he had done so  his cooking was based on the methods of the late miranda  he had never been able to make bread rise properly but he had always liked shipbiscuit and he now greatly preferred them to the risen bread made by his neighbors  and as to coffee and the plainer articles of food with which he furnished his table even miranda herself would not have objected to them had she been alive and very hungry  the houses of the two captains were not very far apart and they were good neighbors often smoking their pipes together and talking of the sea  but this was always on the little porch in front of captain cephass house or by his kitchen fire in the winter  captain eli did not like the smell of tobacco smoke in his house or even in front of it in summertime when the doors were open  he had no objection himself to the odor of tobacco but it was contrary to the principles of woman housekeeping that rooms should smell of it and he was always true to those principles  it was late in a certain december and through the village there was a pleasant little flutter of christmas preparations  captain eli had been up to the store and he had stayed there a good while warming himself by the stove and watching the women coming in to buy things for christmas  it was strange how many things they bought for presents or for holiday usefancy soap and candy handkerchiefs and little woollen shawls for old people and a lot of pretty little things which he knew the use of but which captain cephas would never have understood at all had he been there  as captain eli came out of the store he saw a cart in which were two goodsized christmas trees which had been cut in the woods and were going one to captain holmess house and the other to mother nelsons captain holmes had grandchildren and mother nelson with never a child of her own good old soul had three little orphan nieces who never wanted for anything needful at christmastime or any other time  captain eli walked home very slowly taking observations in his mind it was more than seven years since he had had anything to do with christmas except that on that day he had always made himself a mincepie the construction and the consumption of which were equally difficult  it is true that neighbors had invited him and they had invited captain cephas to their christmas dinners but neither of these worthy seamen had ever accepted any of these invitations  even holiday food when not cooked in sailor fashion did not agree with captain cephas and it would have pained the good heart of captain eli if he had been forced to make believe to enjoy a christmas dinner so very inferior to those which miranda used to set before him  but now the heart of captain eli was gently moved by a christmas flutter  it had been foolish perhaps for him to go up to the store at such a time as this but the mischief had been done  old feelings had come back to him and he would be glad to celebrate christmas this year if he could think of any good way to do it  and the result of his mental observations was that he went over to captain cephass house to talk to him about it  captain cephas was in his kitchen smoking his third morning pipe captain eli filled his pipe lighted it and sat down by the fire  capn said he what do you say to our keepin christmas this year a christmas dinner is no good if its got to be eat alone and you and me might eat ourn together  it might be in my house or it might be in your houseit wont make no great difference to me which  of course i like woman housekeepin as is laid down in the rules of service fer my house  but next best to that i like sailor housekeepin so i dont mind which house the dinner is in capn cephas so it suits you  captain cephas took his pipe from his mouth  youre pretty late thinkin about it said he fer day after tomorrows christmas  that dont make no difference said captain eli  what things we want that are not in my house or your house we can easily get either up at the store or else in the woods  in the woods exclaimed captain cephas  what in the name of thunder do you expect to get in the woods for christmas  a christmas tree said captain eli  i thought it might be a nice thing to have a christmas tree fer christmas  capn holmes has got one and mother nelsons got another  i guess nearly everybodys got one  it wont cost anythingi can go and cut it  captain cephas grinned a grin as if a great leak had been sprung in the side of a vessel stretching nearly from stem to stern  a christmas tree he exclaimed  well i am blessed  but look here capn eli  you dont know what a christmas trees fer  its fer children and not fer grownups  nobody ever does have a christmas tree in any house where there aint no children  captain eli rose and stood with his back to the fire  i didnt think of that he said but i guess its so  and when i come to think of it a christmas isnt much of a christmas anyway without children  you never had none said captain cephas and youve kept christmas  yes replied captain eli reflectively we did do it but there was always a lackmentmiranda has said so and i have said so  you didnt have no christmas tree said captain cephas  no we didnt  but i dont think that folks was as much set on christmas trees then as they pear to be now  i wonder he continued thoughtfully gazing at the ceiling if we was to fix up a christmas treeand you and mes got a lot of pretty things that weve picked up all over the world that would go miles ahead of anything that could be bought at the store fer christmas treesif we was to fix up a tree real nice if we couldnt get some child or other that wasnt likely to have a tree to come in and look at it and stay awhile and make christmas more like christmas  and then when it went away it could take along the things that was hangin on the tree and keep em fer its own  that wouldnt work said captain cephas  if you get a child into this business you must let it hang up its stockin before it goes to bed and find it full in the mornin and then tell it an allfired lie about santa claus if it asks any questions  most children think more of stockins than they do of treesso ive heard at least  ive got no objections to stockins said captain eli  if it wanted to hang one up it could hang one up either here or in my house wherever we kept christmas  you couldnt keep a child all night sardonically remarked captain cephas and no more could i  fer if it was to get up a croup in the night it would be as if we was on a lee shore with anchors draggin and a gale ablowin  thats so said captain eli  youve put it fair  i suppose if we did keep a child all night wed have to have some sort of a woman within hail in case of a sudden blow  captain cephas sniffed  whats the good of talkin said he  there aint no child and there aint no woman that you could hire to sit all night on my front step or on your front step awaitin to be piped on deck in case of croup  no said captain eli  i dont suppose theres any child in this village that aint goin to be provided with a christmas tree or a christmas stockin or perhaps bothexcept now i come to think of it that little gal that was brought down here with her mother last summer and has been kept by mrs crumley sence her mother died  and wont be kept much longer said captain cephas fer ive hearn mrs crumley say she couldnt afford it  thats so said captain eli  if she cant afford to keep the little gal she cant afford to give no christmas trees nor stockins and so it seems to me capn that that little gal would be a pretty good child to help us keep christmas  youre all the time forgettin said the other that nuther of us can keep a child all night  captain eli seated himself and looked ponderingly into the fire youre right capn said he  wed have to ship some woman to take care of her  of course it wouldnt be no use to ask mrs crumley  captain cephas laughed  i should say not  and there doesnt seem to be anybody else said his companion  can you think of anybody capn  there aint anybody to think of replied captain cephas unless it might be eliza trimmer  shes generally ready enough to do anything that turns up  but she wouldnt be no goodher house is too far away for either you or me to hail her in case a croup came up suddint  thats so said captain eli  she does live a long way off  so that settles the whole business said captain cephas  shes too far away to come if wanted and nuther of us couldnt keep no child without somebody to come if they was wanted and its no use to have a christmas tree without a child  a christmas without a christmas tree dont seem agreeable to you capn so i guess wed better get along just the same as weve been in the habit of doin and eat our christmas dinner as we do our other meals in our own houses  captain eli looked into the fire  i dont like to give up things if i can help it  that was always my way  if wind and tides agin me i can wait till one or the other or both of them serve   yes said captain cephas you was always that kind of a man  thats so  but it does pear to me as if id have to give up this time though its a pity to do it on account of the little gal fer she aint likely to have any christmas this year  shes a nice little gal and takes as natural to navigation as if shed been born at sea ive given her two or three things because shes so pretty but theres nothing she likes so much as a little ship i gave her  perhaps she was born at sea remarked captain cephas  perhaps she was said the other and that makes it the bigger pity  for a few moments nothing was said  then captain eli suddenly exclaimed ill tell you what we might do capn  we might ask mrs trimmer to lend a hand in givin the little gal a christmas  she aint got nobody in her house but herself and i guess shed be glad enough to help give that little gal a regular christmas  she could go and get the child and bring her to your house or to my house or wherever were goin to keep christmas and  well said captain cephas with an air of scrutinizing inquiry what  well replied the other a little hesitatingly so far as im concernedthat is i dont mind one way or the othershe might take her christmas dinner along with us and the little gal and then she could fix her stockin to be hung up and help with the christmas tree and  well demanded captain cephas what  well said captain eli she couldthat is it doesnt make any difference to me one way or the othershe might stay all night at whatever house we kept christmas in and then you and me might spend the night in the other house and then she could be ready there to help the child in the mornin when she came to look at her stockin  captain cephas fixed upon his friend an earnest glare  thats pretty considerable of an idea to come upon you so suddint said he  but i can tell you one thing there aint agoin to be any such doins in my house  if you choose to come over here to sleep and give up your house to any woman you can find to take care of the little gal all right  but the thing cant be done here  there was a certain severity in these remarks but they appeared to affect captain eli very pleasantly  well said he if youre satisfied i am  ill agree to any plan you choose to make  it doesnt matter to me which house its in and if you say my house i say my house  all i want is to make the business agreeable to all concerned  now its time fer me to go to my dinner and this afternoon wed better go and try to get things straightened out because the little gal and whatever woman comes with her ought to be at my house tomorrow before dark  sposin we divide up this business ill go and see mrs crumley about the little gal and you can go and see mrs trimmer  no sir promptly replied captain cephas i dont go to see no mrs trimmer  you can see both of them just the same as you can see onetheyre all along the same way  ill go cut the christmas tree  all right said captain eli  it dont make no difference to me which does which  but if i was you capn id cut a good big tree because we might as well have a good one while were about it  when he had eaten his dinner and washed up his dishes and had put everything away in neat housewifely order captain eli went to mrs crumleys house and very soon finished his business there  mrs crumley kept the only house which might be considered a boardinghouse in the village of sponkannis and when she had consented to take charge of the little girl who had been left on her hands she had hoped it would not be very long before she would hear from some of her relatives in regard to her maintenance  but she had heard nothing and had now ceased to expect to hear anything and in consequence had frequently remarked that she must dispose of the child some way or other for she couldnt afford to keep her any longer  even an absence of a day or two at the house of the good captain would be some relief and mrs crumley readily consented to the christmas scheme  as to the little girl she was delighted  she already looked upon captain eli as her best friend in the world  it was not so easy to go to mrs trimmers house and put the business before her  it ought to be plain sailin enough captain eli said to himself over and over again but fer all that it dont seem to be plain sailin  but he was not a man to be deterred by difficult navigation and he walked straight to eliza trimmers house  mrs trimmer was a comely woman about thirtyfive who had come to the village a year before and had maintained herself or at least had tried to by dressmaking and plain sewing  she had lived at stetford a seaport about twenty miles away and from there three years before her husband captain trimmer had sailed away in a goodsized schooner and had never returned  she had come to sponkannis because she thought that there she could live cheaper and get more work than in her former home  she had found the first quite possible but her success in regard to the work had not been very great  when captain eli entered mrs trimmers little room he found her busy mending a sail  here fortune favored him  you turn your hand to most anything mrs trimmer said he after he had greeted her  oh yes she answered with a smile i am obliged to do that mending sails is pretty heavy work but its better than nothing  i had a notion said he that you was ready to turn your hand to any good kind of business so i thought i would step in and ask you if youd turn your hand to a little bit of business ive got on the stocks  she stopped sewing on the sail and listened while captain eli laid his plan before her  its very kind in you and captain cephas to think of all that said she  i have often noticed that poor little girl and pitied her  certainly ill come and you neednt say anything about paying me for it  i wouldnt think of asking to be paid for doing a thing like that  and besidesshe smiled again as she spokeif you are going to give me a christmas dinner as you say that will make things more than square  captain eli did not exactly agree with her but he was in very good humor and she was in good humor and the matter was soon settled and mrs trimmer promised to come to the captains house in the morning and help about the christmas tree and in the afternoon to go to get the little girl from mrs crumleys and bring her to the house  captain eli was delighted with the arrangements  things now seem to be goin along before a spankin breeze said he  but i dont know about the dinner  i guess you will have to leave that to me  i dont believe captain cephas could eat a womancooked dinner  hes accustomed to livin sailor fashion you know and he has declared over and over again to me that womancookin doesnt agree with him  but i can cook sailor fashion said mrs trimmerjust as much sailor fashion as you or captain cephas and if he dont believe it ill prove it to him so you neednt worry about that  when the captain had gone mrs trimmer gayly put away the sail  there was no need to finish it in a hurry and no knowing when she would get her money for it when it was done  no one had asked her to a christmas dinner that year and she had expected to have a lonely time of it but it would be very pleasant to spend christmas with the little girl and the two good captains  instead of sewing any more on the sail she got out some of her own clothes to see if they needed anything done to them  the next morning mrs trimmer went to captain elis house and finding captain cephas there they all set to work at the christmas tree which was a very fine one and had been planted in a box  captain cephas had brought over a bundle of things from his house and captain eli kept running here and there bringing each time that he returned some new object wonderful or pretty which he had brought from china or japan or corea or some spicy island of the eastern seas and nearly every time he came with these treasures mrs trimmer declared that such things were too good to put upon a christmas tree even for such a nice little girl as the one for which that tree was intended  the presents which captain cephas brought were much more suitable for the purpose they were odd and funny and some of them pretty but not expensive as were the fans and bits of shellwork and carved ivories which captain eli wished to tie upon the twigs of the tree  there was a good deal of talk about all this but captain eli had his own way  i dont suppose after all said he that the little gal ought to have all the things  this is such a big tree that its more like a family tree  capn cephas can take some of my things and i can take some of his things and mrs trimmer if theres anything you like you can call it your present and take it for your own so that will be fair and comfortable all round  what i want is to make everybody satisfied  im sure i think they ought to be said mrs trimmer looking very kindly at captain eli  mrs trimmer went home to her own house to dinner and in the afternoon she brought the little girl  she had said there ought to be an early supper so that the child would have time to enjoy the christmas tree before she became sleepy  this meal was prepared entirely by captain eli and in sailor fashion not woman fashion so that captain cephas could make no excuse for eating his supper at home  of course they all ought to be together the whole of that christmas eve  as for the big dinner on the morrow that was another affair for mrs trimmer undertook to make captain cephas understand that she had always cooked for captain trimmer in sailor fashion and if he objected to her plumduff or if anybody else objected to her mincepie she was going to be very much surprised  captain cephas ate his supper with a good relish and was still eating when the rest had finished  as to the christmas tree it was the most valuable if not the most beautiful that had ever been set up in that region  it had no candles upon it but was lighted by three lamps and a ships lantern placed in the four corners of the room and the little girl was as happy as if the tree were decorated with little dolls and glass balls  mrs trimmer was intensely pleased and interested to see the child so happy and captain eli was much pleased and interested to see the child and mrs trimmer so happy and captain cephas was interested and perhaps a little amused in a superior fashion to see captain eli and mrs trimmer and the little child so happy  then the distribution of the presents began  captain eli asked captain cephas if he might have the wooden pipe that the latter had brought for his present  captain cephas said he might take it for all he cared and be welcome to it  then captain eli gave captain cephas a red bandanna handkerchief of a very curious pattern and captain cephas thanked him kindly  after which captain eli bestowed upon mrs trimmer a most beautiful tortoiseshell comb carved and cut and polished in a wonderful way and with it he gave a tortoiseshell fan carved in the same fashion because he said the two things seemed to belong to each other and ought to go together and he would not listen to one word of what mrs trimmer said about the gifts being too good for her and that she was not likely ever to use them  it seems to me said captain cephas that you might be giving something to the little gal  then captain eli remembered that the child ought not to be forgotten and her soul was lifted into ecstasy by many gifts some of which mrs trimmer declared were too good for any child in this wide wide world but captain eli answered that they could be taken care of by somebody until the little girl was old enough to know their value  then it was discovered that unbeknown to anybody else mrs trimmer had put some presents on the tree which were things which had been brought by captain trimmer from somewhere in the far east or the distant west  these she bestowed upon captain cephas and captain eli and the end of all this was that in the whole of sponkannis from the foot of the bluff to the east to the very last house on the shore to the west there was not one christmas eve party so happy as this one  captain cephas was not quite so happy as the three others were but he was very much interested  about nine oclock the party broke up and the two captains put on their caps and buttoned up their peajackets and started for captain cephass house but not before captain eli had carefully fastened every window and every door except the front door and had told mrs trimmer how to fasten that when they had gone and had given her a boatswains whistle which she might blow out of the window if there should be a sudden croup and it should be necessary for any one to go anywhere  he was sure he could hear it for the wind was exactly right for him to hear a whistle from his house  when they had gone mrs trimmer put the little girl to bed and was delighted to find in what a wonderfully neat and womanlike fashion that house was kept  it was nearly twelve oclock that night when captain eli sleeping in his bunk opposite that of captain cephas was aroused by hearing a sound  he had been lying with his best ear uppermost so that he should hear anything if there happened to be anything to hear  he did hear something but it was not a boatswains whistle it was a prolonged cry and it seemed to come from the sea  in a moment captain eli was sitting on the side of his bunk listening intently  again came the cry  the window toward the sea was slightly open and he heard it plainly  capn said he and at the word captain cephas was sitting on the side of his bunk listening  he knew from his companions attitude plainly visible in the light of a lantern which hung on a hook at the other end of the room that he had been awakened to listen  again came the cry  thats distress at sea said captain cephas  harken  they listened again for nearly a minute when the cry was repeated  bounce on deck boys said captain cephas getting out on the floor theres some one in distress off shore  captain eli jumped to the floor and began to dress quickly  it couldnt be a call from land he asked hurriedly  it dont sound a bit to you like a boatswains whistle does it  no said captain cephas disdainfully  its a call from sea then seizing a lantern he rushed down the companionway  as soon as he was convinced that it was a call from sea captain eli was one in feeling and action with captain cephas  the latter hastily opened the draughts of the kitchen stove and put on some wood and by the time this was done captain eli had the kettle filled and on the stove  then they clapped on their caps and their peajackets each took an oar from a corner in the back hall and together they ran down to the beach  the night was dark but not very cold and captain cephas had been to the store that morning in his boat  whenever he went to the store and the weather permitted he rowed there in his boat rather than walk  at the bow of the boat which was now drawn up on the sand the two men stood and listened  again came the cry from the sea  its something ashore on the turtleback shoal said captain cephas  yes said captain eli and its some small craft fer that cry is down pretty nigh to the water  yes said captain cephas  and theres only one man aboard or else theyd take turns ahollerin  hes a stranger said captain eli or he wouldnt have tried even with a catboat to get in over that shoal on ebbtide  as they spoke they ran the boat out into the water and jumped in each with an oar  then they pulled for the turtleback shoal  although these two captains were men of fifty or thereabout they were as strong and tough as any young fellows in the village and they pulled with steady strokes and sent the heavy boat skimming over the water not in a straight line toward the turtleback shoal but now a few points in the darkness this way and now a few points in the darkness that way then with a great curve to the south through the dark night keeping always near the middle of the only good channel out of the bay when the tide was ebbing  now the cries from seaward had ceased but the two captains were not discouraged  hes heard the thumpin of our oars said captain cephas  hes listenin and hell sing out again if he thinks were goin wrong said captain eli  of course he doesnt know anything about that  and so when they made the sweep to the south the cry came again and captain eli grinned  we neednt to spend no breath hollerin said he  hell hear us makin fer him in a minute  when they came to head for the shoal they lay on their oars for a moment while captain cephas turned the lantern in the bow so that its light shone out ahead  he had not wanted the shipwrecked person to see the light when it would seem as if the boat were rowing away from him he had heard of castaway people who became so wild when they imagined that a ship or boat was going away from them that they jumped overboard  when the two captains reached the shoal they found there a catboat aground with one man aboard  his tale was quickly told  he had expected to run into the little bay that afternoon but the wind had fallen and in trying to get in after dark and being a stranger he had run aground  if he had not been so cold he said he would have been willing to stay there till the tide rose but he was getting chilled and seeing a light not far away he concluded to call for help as long as his voice held out  the two captains did not ask many questions  they helped anchor the catboat and then they took the man on their boat and rowed him to shore  he was getting chilled sitting out there doing nothing and so when they reached the house they made him some hot grog and promised in the morning when the tide rose they would go out and help him bring his boat in  then captain cephas showed the stranger to a bunk and they all went to bed  such experiences had not enough of novelty to the good captains to keep them awake five minutes  in the morning they were all up very early and the stranger who proved to be a seafaring man with bright blue eyes said that as his catboat seemed to be riding all right at its anchorage he did not care to go out after her just yet  any time during floodtide would do for him and he had some business that he wanted to attend to as soon as possible  this suited the two captains very well for they wished to be on hand when the little girl discovered her stocking  can you tell me said the stranger as he put on his cap where i can find a mrs trimmer who lives in this village  at these words all the sturdy stiffness which from his youth up had characterized the legs of captain eli entirely went out of them and he sat suddenly upon a bench  for a few moments there was silence  then captain cephas who thought some answer should be made to the question nodded his head  i want to see her as soon as i can said the stranger  i have come to see her on particular business that will be a surprise to her  i wanted to be here before christmas began and thats the reason i took that catboat from stetford because i thought id come quicker that way than by land  but the wind fell as i told you  if either one of you would be good enough to pilot me to where mrs trimmer lives or to any point where i can get a sight of the place id be obliged  captain eli rose and with hurried but unsteady steps went into the house for they had been upon the little piazza and beckoned to his friend to follow  the two men stood in the kitchen and looked at each other  the face of captain eli was of the hue of a clamshell  go with him capn he said in a hoarse whisper  i cant do it  to your house inquired the other  of course  take him to my house  there aint no other place where she is  take him along  captain cephass countenance wore an air of the deepest concern but he thought that the best thing to do was to get the stranger away   as they walked rapidly toward captain elis house there was very little said by either captain cephas or the stranger  the latter seemed anxious to give mrs trimmer a surprise and not to say anything which might enable another person to interfere with his project  the two men had scarcely stepped upon the piazza when mrs trimmer who had been expecting early visitors opened the door  she was about to call out merry christmas but her eyes falling upon a stranger the words stopped at her lips  first she turned red then she turned pale and captain cephas thought she was about to fall  but before she could do this the stranger had her in his arms  she opened her eyes which for a moment she had closed and gazing into his face she put her arms around his neck  then captain cephas came away without thinking of the little girl and the pleasure she would have in discovering her christmas stocking  when he had been left alone captain eli sat down near the kitchen stove close to the very kettle which he had filled with water to heat for the benefit of the man he had helped bring in from the sea and with his elbows on his knees and his fingers in his hair he darkly pondered  if id only slept with my hardohearin ear up he said to himself id never have heard it  in a few moments his better nature condemned this thought  thats next to murder he muttered fer he couldnt have kept himself from fallin asleep out there in the cold and when the tide riz held have been blowed out to sea with this wind  if i hadnt heard him captain cephas never would fer he wasnt primed up to wake as i was  but notwithstanding his better nature captain eli was again saying to himself when his friend returned if id only slept with my other ear up  like the honest straightforward mariner he was captain cephas made an exact report of the facts  they was huggin when i left them he said and i expect they went indoors pretty soon fer it was too cold outside  its an allfired shame she happened to be in your house capn thats all ive got to say about it its a thunderin shame  captain eli made no answer  he still sat with his elbows on his knees and his hands in his hair  a better course than you laid down fer these christmas times was never dotted on a chart continued captain cephas  from port of sailin to port of entry you laid it down clear and fine  but it seems there was rocks that wasnt marked on the chart  yes groaned captain eli there was rocks  captain cephas made no attempt to comfort his friend but went to work to get breakfast  when that meala rather silent onewas over captain eli felt better there was rocks he said and not a breaker to show where they lay and i struck em bow on  so thats the end of that voyage  but ive tuk to my boats capn ive tuk to my boats  im glad to hear youve tuk to your boats said captain cephas with an approving glance upon his friend  about ten minutes afterwards captain eli said im goin up to my house  by yourself said the other  yes by myself  id rather go alone  i dont intend to mind anything and im goin to tell her that she can stay there and spend christmasthe place she lives in aint no place to spend christmasand she can make the little gal have a good time and go long just as we intended to go longplumduff and mincepie all the same  i can stay here and you and me can have our christmas dinner together if we choose to give it that name  and if she aint ready to go tomorrow she can stay a day or two longer  its all the same to me if its the same to you capn  captain cephas having said that it was the same to him captain eli put on his cap and buttoned up his peajacket declaring that the sooner he got to his house the better as she might be thinking that she would have to move out of it now that things were different  before captain eli reached his house he saw something which pleased him  he saw the seagoing stranger with his back toward him walking rapidly in the direction of the village store  captain eli quickly entered his house and in the doorway of the room where the tree was he met mrs trimmer beaming brighter than any morning sun that ever rose  merry christmas she exclaimed holding out both her hands  ive been wondering and wondering when youd come to bid me merry christmasthe merriest christmas ive ever had  captain eli took her hands and bid her merry christmas very gravely  she looked a little surprised  whats the matter captain eli she exclaimed  you dont seem to say that as if you meant it  oh yes i do he answered  this must be an allfiredi mean a thunderin happy christmas fer you mrs trimmer  yes said she her face beaming again  and to think that it should happen on christmas daythat this blessed morning before anything else happened my bob my only brother should  your what roared captain eli as if he had been shouting orders in a raging storm  mrs trimmer stepped back almost frightened  my brother said she didnt he tell you he was my brothermy brother bob who sailed away a year before i was married and who has been in africa and china and i dont know where  its so long since i heard that hed gone into trading at singapore that id given him up as married and settled in foreign parts  and here he has come to me as if hed tumbled from the sky on this blessed christmas morning  captain eli made a step forward his face very much flushed  your brother mrs trimmerdid you really say it was your brother  of course it is said she  who else could it be  then she paused for a moment and looked steadfastly at the captain  you dont mean to say captain eli she asked that you thought it was  yes i did said captain eli promptly  mrs trimmer looked straight in the captains eyes then she looked on the ground  then she changed color and changed back again  i dont understand she said hesitatingly whyi mean what difference it made  difference exclaimed captain eli  it was all the difference between a man on deck and a man overboardthats the difference it was to me  i didnt expect to be talkin to you so early this christmas mornin but things has been sprung on me and i cant help it i just want to ask you one thing  did you think i was gettin up this christmas tree and the christmas dinner and the whole business fer the good of the little gal and fer the good of you and fer the good of captain cephas  mrs trimmer had now recovered a very fair possession of herself  of course i did she answered looking up at him as she spoke  who else could it have been for  well said he you were mistaken  it wasnt fer any one of you  it was all fer mefer my own self  you yourself said she  i dont see how  but i see how he answered  its been a long time since i wanted to speak my mind to you mrs trimmer but i didnt ever have no chance and all these christmas doins was got up to give me the chance not only of speakin to you but of showin my colors better than i could show them in any other way  everything went on askimmin till this mornin when that stranger that we brought in from the shoal piped up and asked fer you  then i went overboardat least i thought i didand sunk down down clean out of soundins  that was too bad captain said she speaking very gently after all your trouble and kindness  but i dont know now he continued whether i went overboard or whether i am on deck  can you tell me mrs trimmer  she looked up at him  her eyes were very soft and her lips trembled just a little  it seems to me captain she said that you are on deckif you want to be  the captain stepped closer to her  mrs trimmer said he is that brother of yours comin back  yes she answered surprised at the sudden question  hes just gone up to the store to buy a shirt and some things  he got himself splashed trying to push his boat off last night  well then said captain eli would you mind tellin him when he comes back that you and mes engaged to be married  i dont know whether ive made a mistake in the lights or not but would you mind tellin him that  mrs trimmer looked at him  her eyes were not so soft as they had been but they were brighter  id rather youd tell him that yourself said she  the little girl sat on the floor near the christmas tree just finishing a large piece of redandwhite candy which she had taken out of her stocking  people do hug a lot at christmastime said she to herself  then she drew out a piece of blueandwhite candy and began on that  captain cephas waited a long time for his friend to return and at last he thought it would be well to go and look for him  when he entered the house he found mrs trimmer sitting on the sofa in the parlor with captain eli on one side of her and her brother on the other and each of them holding one of her hands  it looks as if i was in port dont it said captain eli to his astonished friend  well here i am and heres my fust mate inclining his head toward mrs trimmer  and shes in port too safe and sound  and that strange captain on the other side of her hes her brother bob whos been away for years and years and is just home from madagascar  singapore amended brother bob  captain cephas looked from one to the other of the three occupants of the sofa but made no immediate remark  presently a smile of genial maliciousness stole over his face and he asked how about the poor little gal  have you sent her back to mrs crumleys  the little girl came out from behind the christmas tree her stocking now but half filled in her hand  here i am she said  dont you want to give me a christmas hug captain cephas  you and mes the only ones that hasnt had any  the christmas dinner was as truly and perfectly a sailorcooked meal as ever was served on board a ship or off it  captain cephas had said that and when he had so spoken there was no need of further words  it was nearly dark that afternoon and they were all sitting around the kitchen fire the three seafaring men smoking and mrs trimmer greatly enjoying it  there could be no objection to the smell of tobacco in this house so long as its future mistress enjoyed it  the little girl sat on the floor nursing a chinese idol which had been one of her presents  after all said captain eli meditatively this whole business come out of my sleepin with my best ear up  fer if id slept with my hardohearin ear up  mrs trimmer put one finger on his lips all right said captain eli i wont say no more  but it would have been different  even now several years after that christmas when there is no mrs trimmer and the little girl who has been regularly adopted by captain eli and his wife is studying geography and knows more about latitude and longitude than her teacher at school captain eli has still a slight superstitious dread of sleeping with his best ear uppermost  of course its the most allfired nonsense he says to himself over and over again  nevertheless he feels safer when it is his hardohearin ear that is not upon the pillow     love before breakfast  i was still a young man when i came into the possession of an excellent estate  this consisted of a large country house surrounded by lawns groves and gardens and situated not far from the flourishing little town of boynton  being an orphan with no brothers or sisters i set up here a bachelors hall in which for two years i lived with great satisfaction and comfort improving my grounds and furnishing my house when i had made all the improvements which were really needed and feeling that i now had a most delightful home to come back to i thought it would be an excellent thing to take a trip to europe give my mind a run in fresh fields and pick up a lot of bricabrac and ideas for the adornment and advantage of my house and mind  it was the custom of the residents in my neighborhood who owned houses and travelled in the summer to let their houses during their absence and my business agent and myself agreed that this would be an excellent thing for me to do  if the house were let to a suitable family it would yield me a considerable income and the place would not present on my return that air of retrogression and desolation which i might expect if it were left unoccupied and in charge of a caretaker  my agent assured me that i would have no trouble whatever in letting my place for it offered many advantages and i expected but a reasonable rent  i desired to leave everything just as it stood house furniture books horses cows and poultry taking with me only my clothes and personal requisites and i desired tenants who would come in bringing only their clothes and personal requisites which they could quietly take away with them when their lease should expire and i should return home  in spite however of the assurances of the agent it was not easy to let my place  the house was too large for some people too small for others and while some applicants had more horses than i had stalls in my stable others did not want even the horses i would leave  i had engaged my steamer passage and the day for my departure drew near and yet no suitable tenants had presented themselves  i had almost come to the conclusion that the whole matter would have to be left in the hands of my agent for i had no intention whatever of giving up my projected travels when early one afternoon some people came to look at the house  fortunately i was at home and i gave myself the pleasure of personally conducting them about the premises  it was a pleasure because as soon as i comprehended the fact that these applicants desired to rent my house i wished them to have it  the family consisted of an elderly gentleman and his wife with a daughter of twenty or thereabout  this was a family that suited me exactly  three in number no children people of intelligence and position fond of the country and anxious for just such a place as i offered themwhat could be better  the more i walked about and talked with these good people and showed them my possessions the more i desired that the young lady should take my house  of course her parents were included in this wish but it was for her ears that all my remarks were intended although sometimes addressed to the others and she was the tenant i labored to obtain  i say labored advisedly because i racked my brain to think of inducements which might bring them to a speedy and favorable decision  apart from the obvious advantages of the arrangement it would be a positive delight to me during my summer wanderings in europe to think that that beautiful girl would be strolling through my grounds enjoying my flowers and sitting with her book in the shady nooks i had made so pleasant lying in my hammocks spending her evening hours in my study reading my books writing at my desk and perhaps musing in my easychair  before these applicants appeared it had sometimes pained me to imagine strangers in my home but no such thought crossed my mind in regard to this young lady who if charming in the house and on the lawn grew positively entrancing when she saw my jersey cows and my two horses regarding them with an admiration which even surpassed my own  long before we had completed the tour of inspection i had made up my mind that this young lady should come to live in my house  if obstacles should show themselves they should be removed  i would tear down i would build i would paper and paint i would put in all sorts of electric bells i would reduce the rent until it suited their notions exactly i would have my horses tails banged if she liked that kind of tails better than long onesi would do anything to make them definitely decide to take the place before they left me  i trembled to think of her going elsewhere and giving other householders a chance to tempt her  she had looked at a good many country houses but it was quite plain that none of them had pleased her so well as mine  i left them in my library to talk the matter over by themselves and in less than ten minutes the young lady herself came out on the lawn to tell me that her father and mother had decided to take the place and would like to speak with me  i am so glad she said as we went in  i am sure i shall enjoy every hour of our stay here  it is so different from anything we have yet seen  when everything had been settled i wanted to take them again over the place and point out a lot of things i had omitted  i particularly wanted to show them some lovely walks in the woods  but there was no time for they had to catch a train  her name was vincentcora vincent as i discovered from her mothers remarks  as soon as they departed i had my mare saddled and rode into town to see my agent  i went into his office exultant  ive let my house i said and i want you to make out the lease and have everything fixed and settled as soon as possible  this is the address of my tenants  the agent asked me a good many questions being particularly anxious to know what rent had been agreed upon  heavens he exclaimed when i mentioned the sum that is ever so much less than i told you you could get  i am in communication now with a party whom i know would pay you considerably more than these people  have you definitely settled with them  perhaps it is not too late to withdraw  withdraw i cried  never  they are the only tenants i want  i was determined to get them and i think i must have lowered the rent four or five times in the course of the afternoon  i took a big slice out of it before i mentioned the sum at all  you see said i very impressively these vincents exactly suit me  and then i went on to state fully the advantages of the arrangement omitting however any references to my visions of miss vincent swinging in my hammocks or musing in my studychair  it was now may 15 and my steamer would sail on the twentyfirst  the intervening days i employed not in preparing for my travels but in making every possible arrangement for the comfort and convenience of my incoming tenants  the vincents did not wish to take possession until june 1 and i was sorry they had not applied before i had engaged my passage for in that case i would have selected a later date  a very good steamer sailed on june 3 and it would have suited me just as well  happening to be in new york one day i went to the vincents city residence to consult with them in regard to some awnings which i proposed putting up at the back of the house  i found no one at home but the old gentleman and it made no difference to him whether the awnings were black and brown or red and yellow  i cordially invited him to come out before i left and bring his family that they might look about the place to see if there was anything they would like to have done which had not already been attended to  it was so much better i told him to talk over these matters personally with the owner than with an agent in his absence  agents were often very unwilling to make changes  mr vincent was a very quiet and exceedingly pleasant elderly gentleman and thanked me very much for my invitation but said he did not see how he could find the time to get out to my house before i sailed  i did not like to say that it was not at all necessary for him to neglect his affairs in order to accompany his family to my place but i assured him that if any of them wished to go out at any time before they took possession they must feel at perfect liberty to do so  i mentioned this matter to my agent suggesting that if he happened to be in new york he might call on the vincents and repeat my invitation it was not likely that the old gentleman would remember to mention it to his wife and daughter and it was really important that everything should be made satisfactory before i left  it seems to me he said smiling a little grimly that the vincents had better be kept away from your house until you have gone  if you do anything more to it you may find out that it would have been more profitable to have shut it up while you are away  he did call however partly because i wished him to and partly because he was curious to see the people  i was so anxious to install in my home and to whom he was to be my legal representative  he reported the next day that he had found no one at home but miss vincent and that she had said that she and her mother would be very glad to come out the next week and go over the place before they took possession  next week i exclaimed  i shall be gone then  but i shall be here said mr barker and ill show them about and take their suggestions  this did not suit me at all  it annoyed me very much to think of barker showing miss vincent about my place  he was a goodlooking young man and not at all backward in his manners  after all said i i suppose that everything that ought to be done has been done  i hope you told her that  of course not said he  that would have been running dead against your orders  besides its my business to show people about places  i dont mind it  this gave me an unpleasant and uneasy feeling  i wondered if mr barker were the agent i ought to have and if a middleaged man with a family and more experience might not be better able to manage my affairs  barker said i a little later there will be no use of your going every month to the vincents to collect their rent  i shall write to mr vincent to pay as he pleases  he can send a check monthly or at the end of the season as it may be convenient  he is perfectly responsible and i would much prefer to have the money in a lump when i come back  barker grinned  all right said he but thats not the way to do business you know  i may have been mistaken but i fancied that i saw in my agents face an expression which indicated that he intended to call on the first day of each month on the pretext of telling vincent that it was not necessary to pay the rent at any particular time and that he also proposed to make many other intervening visits to inquire if repairs were needed  this might have been a good deal to get out of his expression but i think i could have got more if i had thought longer  on the day before that on which i was to sail my mind was in such a disturbed condition that i could not attend to my packing or anything else  it almost enraged me to think that i was deliberately leaving the country ten days before my tenants would come to my house  there was no reason why i should do this  there were many reasons why i should not  there was barker  i was now of the opinion that he would personally superintend the removal of the vincents and their establishment to my home  i remembered that the only suggestion he had made about the improvement of the place had been the construction of a tenniscourt  i knew that he was a champion player  confound it what a dreadful mistake i had made in selecting such a man for my houseagent  with my minds eye i could already see miss vincent and barker selecting a spot for tennis and planning the arrangements of the court  i took the first train to new york and went directly to the steamboat office  it is astonishing how many obstacles can be removed from a mans path if he will make up his mind to give them a good kick  i found that my steamer was crowded  the applications for passage exceeded the accommodations and the agent was delighted to transfer me to the steamer that sailed on june 3  i went home exultant  barker drove over in the evening to take his last instructions and a blank look came over his face when i told him that business had delayed my departure and that i should not sail the next day  if i had told him that part of that business was the laying out of a tenniscourt he might have looked blanker  of course the date of my departure did not concern the vincents provided the house was vacated by june 1 and i did not inform them of the change in my plans but when the mother and daughter came out the next week they were much surprised to find me waiting to receive them instead of barker  i hope that they were also pleased and i am sure that they had every reason to be so  mrs vincent having discovered that i was a most complacent landlord accommodated herself easily to my disposition and made a number of minor requirements all of which i granted without the slightest hesitation  i was delighted at last to put her into the charge of my housekeeper and when the two had betaken themselves to the bedrooms i invited miss vincent to come out with me to select a spot for a tenniscourt  the invitation was accepted with alacrity for tennis she declared was a passion with her  the selection of that tenniscourt took nearly an hour for there were several good places for one and it was hard to make a selection besides i could not lose the opportunity of taking miss vincent into the woods and showing her the walks i had made and the rustic seats i had placed in pleasant nooks  of course she would have discovered these but it was a great deal better for her to know all about them before she came  at last mrs vincent sent a maid to tell her daughter that it was time to go for the train and the court had not been definitely planned  the next day i went to miss vincents house with a plan of the grounds and she and i talked it over until the matter was settled  it was necessary to be prompt about this i explained as there would be a great deal of levelling and rolling to be done  i also had a talk with the old gentleman about books  there were several large boxes of my books in new york which i had never sent out to my country house  many of these i thought might be interesting to him and i offered to have them taken out and left at his disposal when he heard the titles of some of the books in the collection he was much interested but insisted that before he made use of them they should be catalogued as were the rest of my effects  i hesitated a moment wondering if i could induce barker to come to new york and catalogue four big boxes of books when to my surprise miss vincent incidentally remarked that if they were in any place where she could get at them she would be pleased to help catalogue them that sort of thing was a great pleasure to her  instantly i proposed that i should send the books to the vincent house that they should there be taken out so that mr vincent could select those he might care to read during the summer that i would make a list of these and if vincent would assist me i would be grateful for the kindness and those that were not desired could be returned to the storehouse  what a grand idea was this  i had been internally groaning because i could think of no possible pretence for further interviews with miss vincent and here was something better than i could have imagined  her father declared that he could not put me to so much trouble but i would listen to none of his words and the next morning my books were spread over his library floor  the selection and cataloguing of the volumes desired occupied the mornings of three days  the old gentlemans part was soon done but there were many things in the books which were far more interesting to me than their titles and to which i desired to draw miss vincents attention  all this greatly protracted our labors  she was not only a beautiful girl but her intelligence and intellectual grasp were wonderful  i could not help telling her what a great pleasure it would be to me to think while wandering in foreign lands that such an appreciative family would be enjoying my books and my place  you are so fond of your house and everything you have said she that we shall almost feel as if we were depriving you of your rights but i suppose that italian lakes and the alps will make you forget for a time even your beautiful home  not if you are in it i longed to say but i restrained myself  i did not believe that it was possible for me to be more in love with this girl than i was at that moment but of course it would be the rankest stupidity to tell her so  to her i was simply her fathers landlord  i went to that house the next day to see that the boxes were properly repacked and i actually went the next day to see if the right boxes had gone into the country and the others back to the storehouse the first day i saw only the father  the second day it was the mother who assured me that everything had been properly attended to  i began to feel that if i did not wish a decided rebuff i would better not make any more pretences of business at the vincent house  there were affairs of my own which should have been attended to and i ought to have gone home and attended to them but i could not bear to do so  there was no reason to suppose she would go out there before the first of june  thinking over the matter many times i came to the conclusion that if i could see her once more i would be satisfied  then i would go away and carry her image with me into every artgallery over every glacier and under every lovely sky that i should enjoy abroad hoping all the time that taking my place as it were in my home and making my possessions in a measure her own she would indirectly become so well acquainted with me that when i returned i might speak to her without shocking her  to obtain this final interview there was but one way  i had left my house on saturday the vincents would come on the following monday and i would sail on wednesday  i would go on tuesday to inquire if they found everything to their satisfaction  this would be a very proper attention from a landlord about to leave the country  when i reached boynton i determined to walk to my house for i did not wish to encumber myself with a hired vehicle  i might be asked to stay to luncheon  a very strange feeling came over me as i entered my grounds  they were not mine  for the time being they belonged to somebody else  i was merely a visitor or a trespasser if the vincents thought proper so to consider me  if they did not like people to walk on the grass i had no right to do it  none of my servants had been left on the place and the maid who came to the door informed me that mr vincent had gone to new york that morning and that mrs vincent and her daughter were out driving  i ventured to ask if she thought they would soon return and she answered that she did not think they would as they had gone to rock lake which from the way they talked about it must be a long way off  rock lake  when i had driven over there with my friends we had taken luncheon at the inn and returned in the afternoon  and what did they know of rock lake  who had told them of it  that officious barker of course  will you leave a message sir said the maid who of course did not know me  no said i and as i still stood gazing at the piazza floor she remarked that if i wished to call again she would go out and speak to the coachman and ask him if anything had been said to him about the time of the partys return  worse and worse  their coachman had not driven them  some one who knew the country had been their companion  they were not acquainted in the neighborhood and there could not be a shadow of a doubt that it was that obtrusive barker who had indecently thrust himself upon them on the very next day after their arrival and had thus snatched from me this last interview upon which i had counted so earnestly  i had no right to ask any more questions  i left no message nor any name and i had no excuse for saying i would call again  i got back to my hotel without having met any one whom i knew and that night i received a note from barker stating that he had fully intended coming to the steamer to see me off but that an engagement would prevent him  he sent however his best good wishes for my safe passage and assured me that he would keep me fully informed of the state of my affairs on this side  engagement i exclaimed  is he going to drive with her again tomorrow  my steamer sailed at two oclock the next day and after an early breakfast i went to the companys office to see if i could dispose of my ticket  it had become impossible i told the agent for me to leave america at present  he said it was a very late hour to sell my ticket but that he would do what he could and if an applicant turned up he would give him my room and refund the money  he wanted me to change to another date but i declined to do this  i was not able to say when i should sail  i now had no plan of action  all i knew was that i could not leave america without finding out something definite about this barker business  that is to say if it should be made known to me that instead of attending to my business sending a carpenter to make repairs if such were necessary or going personally to the plumber to make sure that that erratic personage would give his attention to any pipes in regard to which mr vincent might have written barker should mingle in sociable relations with my tenants and drive or play tennis with the young lady of the house then would i immediately have done with him  i would withdraw my business from his hands and place it in those of old mr poindexter  more than that it might be my duty to warn miss vincents parents against barker  i did not doubt that he was a very good house and landagent but in selecting him as such i had no idea of introducing him to the vincents in a social way  in fact the more i thought about it the more i became convinced that if ever i mentioned barker to my tenants it would be to warn them against him  from certain points of view he was actually a dangerous man  this however i would not do until i found my agent was really culpable  to discover what barker had done what he was doing and what he intended to do was now my only business in life  until i had satisfied myself on these points i could not think of starting out upon my travels  now that i had determined i would not start for europe until i had satisfied myself that mr barker was contenting himself with attending to my business and not endeavoring to force himself into social relations with my tenants i was anxious that the postponement of my journey should be unknown to my friends and acquaintances and i was therefore very glad to see in a newspaper published on the afternoon of the day of my intended departure my name among the list of passengers who had sailed upon the mnemonic  for the first time i commended the superenterprise of a reporter who gave more attention to the timeliness of his news than to its accuracy  i was stopping at a new york hotel but i did not wish to stay there until i felt myself ready to start on my travels the neighborhood of boynton would suit me better than anywhere else  i did not wish to go to the town itself for barker lived there and i knew many of the townspeople but there were farmhouses not far away where i might spend a week  after considering the matter i thought of something that might suit me  about three miles from my house on an unfrequented road was a mill which stood at the end of an extensive sheet of water in reality a millpond but commonly called a lake  the miller an old man had recently died and his house near by was occupied by a newcomer whom i had never seen  if i could get accommodations there it would suit me exactly  i left the train two stations below boynton and walked over to the mill  the countryfolk in my neighborhood are always pleased to take summer boarders if they can get them and the miller and his wife were glad to give me a room not imagining that i was the owner of a good house not far away  the place suited my requirements very well  it was near her and i might live here for a time unnoticed but what i was going to do with my opportunity i did not know  several times the conviction forced itself upon me that i should get up at once and go to europe by the first steamer and so show myself that i was a man of sense  this conviction was banished on the second afternoon of my stay at the mill  i was sitting under a tree in the orchard near the house thinking and smoking my pipe when along the road which ran by the side of the lake came mr vincent on my black horse general and his daughter on my mare sappho  instinctively i pulled my straw hat over my eyes but this precaution was not necessary  they were looking at the beautiful lake with its hills and overhanging trees and saw me not  when the very tip of sapphos tail had melted into the foliage of the road i arose to my feet and took a deep breath of the happy air  i had seen her and it was with her father she was riding  i do not believe i slept a minute that night through thinking of her and feeling glad that i was near her and that she had been riding with her father  when the early dawn began to break an idea brighter than the dawn broke upon me i would get up and go nearer to her  it is amazing how much we lose by not getting up early on the long summer days  how beautiful the morning might be on this earth i never knew until i found myself wandering by the edge of my woods and over my lawn with the tender grayblue sky above me and all the freshness of the grass and flowers and trees about me the birds singing among the branches and she sleeping sweetly somewhere within that house with its softly defined lights and shadows  how i wished i knew what room she occupied  the beauties and joys of that hour were lost to every person on the place who were all no doubt in their soundest sleep  i did not even see a dog  quietly and stealthily stepping from bush to hedge i went around the house and as i drew near the barn i fancied i could hear from a little room adjoining it the snores of the coachman  the lazy rascal would probably not awaken for two or three hours yet but i would ran no risks and in half an hour i had sped away  now i knew exactly why i was staying at the house of the miller  i was doing so in order that i might go early in the mornings to my own home in which the girl i loved lay dreaming and that for the rest of the day and much of the night i might think of her  what place in europe i said to myself could be so beautiful so charming and so helpful to reflection as this sequestered lake these noble trees these stretches of undulating meadow  even if i should care to go abroad a month or two later would answer all my purposes  why had i ever thought of spending five months away  there was a pretty stream which ran from the lake and wended its way through a green and shaded valley and here with a rod i wandered and fished and thought  the miller had boats and in one of these i rowed far up the lake where it narrowed into a creek and between the high hills which shut me out from the world i would float and think  every morning soon after break of day i went to my home and wandered about my grounds  if it rained i did not mind that  i like a summer rain  day by day i grew bolder  nobody in that household thought of getting up until seven oclock  for two hours at least i could ramble undisturbed through my grounds and much as i had once enjoyed these grounds they never afforded me the pleasure they gave me now  in these happy mornings i felt all the life and spirits of a boy  i went into my little field and stroked the sleek sides of my cows as they nibbled the dewy grass  i even peeped through the barred window of sapphos box and fed her as i had been used to doing with bunches of clover  i saw that the young chickens were flourishing  i went into the garden and noted the growth of the vegetables feeling glad that she would have so many fine strawberries and tender peas  i had not the slightest doubt that she was fond of flowers and for her sake now as i used to do for my own sake i visited the flower beds and borders  not far from the house there was a cluster of oldfashioned pinks which i was sure were not doing very well  they had been there too long perhaps and they looked stunted and weak  in the millers garden i had noticed great beds of these pinks and i asked his wife if i might have some and she considering them as mere wild flowers said i might have as many as i liked  she might have thought i wanted simply the blossoms but the next morning i went over to my house with a basket filled with great matted masses of the plants taken up with the roots and plenty of earth around them and after twenty minutes work in my own bed of pinks i had taken out all the old plants and filled their places with fresh luxuriant masses of buds and leaves and blossoms  how glad she would be when she saw the fresh life that had come to that flowerbed  with light footsteps i went away not feeling the weight of the basket filled with the old plants and roots  the summer grew and strengthened and the sun rose earlier but as that had no effect upon the rising of the present inhabitants of my place it gave me more time for my morning pursuits  gradually i constituted myself the regular flowergardener of the premises  how delightful the work was and how foolish i thought i had been never to think of doing this thing for myself but no doubt it was because i was doing it for her that i found it so pleasant  once again i had seen miss vincent  it was in the afternoon and i had rowed myself to the upper part of the lake where with the high hills and the trees on each side of me i felt as if i were alone in the world  floating idly along with my thoughts about three miles away i heard the sound of oars and looking out on the open part of the lake i saw a boat approaching  the miller was rowing and in the stern sat an elderly gentleman and a young lady  i knew them in an instant they were mr and miss vincent  with a few vigorous strokes i shot myself into the shadows and rowed up the stream into the narrow stretches among the lilypads under a bridge and around a little wooded point where i ran the boat ashore and sprang upon the grassy bank  although i did not believe the miller would bring them as far as this i went up to a higher spot and watched for half an hour but i did not see them again  how relieved i was it would have been terribly embarrassing had they discovered me  and how disappointed i was that the miller turned back so soon  i now extended the supervision of my grounds  i walked through the woods and saw how beautiful they were in the early dawn  i threw aside the fallen twigs and cut away encroaching saplings which were beginning to encumber the paths i had made and if i found a bough which hung too low i cut it off  there was a great beechtree between which and a dogwood i had the year before suspended a hammock  in passing this one morning i was amazed to see a hammock swinging from the hooks i had put in the two trees  this was a retreat which i had supposed no one else would fancy or even think of  in the hammock was a fana common japanese fan  for fifteen minutes i stood looking at that hammock every nerve atingle  then i glanced around  the spot had been almost unfrequented since last summer  little bushes weeds and vines had sprung up here and there between the two trees  there were dead twigs and limbs lying about and the short path to the main walk was much overgrown  i looked at my watch  it was a quarter to six  i had yet a good hour for work and with nothing but my pocketknife and my hands i began to clear away the space about that hammock  when i left it it looked as it used to look when it was my pleasure to lie there and swing and read and reflect  to approach this spot it was not necessary to go through my grounds for my bit of woods adjoined a considerable stretch of forestland and in my morning walks from the mill i often used a path through these woods  the next morning when i took this path i was late because i had unfortunately overslept myself  when i reached the hammock it wanted fifteen minutes to seven oclock  it was too late for me to do anything but i was glad to be able to stay there even for a few minutes to breathe that air to stand on that ground to touch that hammock  i did more than that  why shouldnt i  i got into it  it was a better one than that i had hung there  it was delightfully comfortable  at this moment gently swinging in that woodland solitude with the sweet odors of the morning all about me i felt myself nearer to her than i had ever been before  but i knew i must not revel in this place too long  i was on the point of rising to leave when i heard approaching footsteps  my breath stopped  was i at last to be discovered  this was what came of my reckless security  but perhaps the person some workman most likely would pass without noticing me  to remain quiet seemed the best course and i lay motionless  but the person approaching turned into the little pathway  the footsteps came nearer  i sprang from the hammock  before me was miss vincent  what was my aspect i know not but i have no doubt i turned fiery red she stopped suddenly but she did not turn red  oh mr ripley she exclaimed good morning  you must excuse me  i did not know  that she should have had sufficient selfpossession to say good morning amazed me  her whole appearance in fact amazed me  there seemed to be something wanting in her manner  i endeavored to get myself into condition  you must be surprised i said to see me here  you supposed i was in europe but  as i spoke i made a couple of steps toward her but suddenly stopped one of my coat buttons had caught in the meshes of the hammock  it was confoundedly awkward  i tried to loosen the button but it was badly entangled  then i desperately pulled at it to tear it off  oh dont do that she said  let me unfasten it for you and taking the threads of the hammock in one of her little hands and the button in the other she quickly separated them  i should think buttons would be very inconvenient thingsat least in hammocks she said smiling  you see girls dont have any such trouble  i could not understand her manner  she seemed to take my being there as a matter of course  i must beg a thousand pardons for thisthis trespass i said  trespass said she with a smile  people dont trespass on their own land  but it is not my land said i  it is your fathers for the time being  i have no right here whatever  i do not know how to explain but you must think it very strange to find me here when you supposed i had started for europe  oh  i knew you had not started for europe said she because i have seen you working in the grounds  seen me i interrupted  is it possible  oh yes said she  i dont know how long you had been coming when i first saw you but when i found that fresh bed of pinks all transplanted from somewhere and just as lovely as they could be instead of the old ones i spoke to the man but he did not know anything about it and said he had not had time to do anything to the flowers whereas i had been giving him credit for ever so much weeding and cleaning up  then i supposed that mr barker who is just as kind and attentive as he can be had done it but i could hardly believe he was the sort of man to come early in the morning and work out of doorsoh how i wish he had come i thought  if i had caught him here working among the flowersand when he came that afternoon to play tennis i found that he had been away for two days and could not have planted the pinks  so i simply got up early one morning and looked out and there i saw you with your coat off working just as hard as ever you could  i stepped back my mind for a moment a perfect blank  what could you have thought of me i exclaimed presently  really at first i did not know what to think said she  of course i did not know what had detained you in this country but i remembered that i had heard that you were a very particular person about your flowers and shrubs and grounds and that most likely you thought they would be better taken care of if you kept an eye on them and that when you found there was so much to do you just went to work and did it  i did not speak of this to anybody because if you did not wish it to be known that you were taking care of the grounds it was not my business to tell people about it  but yesterday when i found this place where i had hung my hammock so beautifully cleared up and made so nice and clean and pleasant in every way i thought i must come down to tell you how much obliged i am and also that you ought not to take so much trouble for us  if you think the grounds need more attention i will persuade my father to hire another man now and then to work about the place  really mr ripley you ought not to have to  i was humbled abashed  she had seen me at my morning devotions and this was the way she interpreted them  she considered me an overnice fellow who was so desperately afraid his place would be injured that he came sneaking around every morning to see if any damage had been done and to put things to rights  she stood for a moment as if expecting me to speak brushed a buzzing fly from her sleeve and then looking at me with a gentle smile she turned a little as if she were about to leave  i could not let her go without telling her something  her present opinion of me must not rest in her mind another minute  and yet what story could i devise  how indeed could i devise anything with which to deceive a girl who spoke and looked at me as this girl did  i could not do it  i must rush away speechless and never see her again or i must tell her all  i came a little nearer to her  miss vincent said i you do not understand at all why i am herewhy i have been here so muchwhy i did not go to europe  the truth is i could not leave  i do not wish to be away i want to come here and live here always  oh dear she interrupted of course it is natural that you should not want to tear yourself away from your lovely home  it would be very hard for us to go away now especially for father and me for we have grown to love this place so much  but if you want us to leave i dare say  i want you to leave i exclaimed  never  when i say that i want to live here myself that my heart will not let me go anywhere else i mean that i want you to live here tooyou your mother and fatherthat i want   oh that would be perfectly splendid she said  i have ever so often thought that it was a shame that you should be deprived of the pleasures you so much enjoy which i see you can find here and nowhere else  now i have a plan which i think will work splendidly we are a very small family  why shouldnt you come here and live with us  there is plenty of room and i know father and mother would be very glad and you can pay your board if that would please you better you can have the room at the top of the tower for your study and your smoking den and the room under it can be your bedroom so you can be just as independent as you please of the rest of us and you can be living on your own place without interfering with us in the least  in fact it would be ever so nice especially as i am in the habit of going away to the seashore with my aunt every summer for six weeks and i was thinking how lonely it would be this year for father and mother to stay here all by themselves  the tower and the room under it  for me  what a contemptibly littleminded and insignificant person she must think me  the words with which i strove to tell her that i wished to live here as lord with her as my queen would not come  she looked at me for a moment as i stood on the brink of saying something but not saying it and then she turned suddenly toward the hammock  did you see anything of a fan i left here she said  i know i left it here but when i came yesterday it was gone  perhaps you may have noticed it somewhere  now the morning before i had taken that fan home with me  it was an awkward thing to carry but i had concealed it under my coat  it was a contemptible trick but the fan had her initials on it and as it was the only thing belonging to her of which i could possess myself the temptation had been too great to resist  as she stood waiting for my answer there was a light in her eye which illuminated my perceptions  did you see me take that fan i asked  i did said she  then you know i exclaimed stepping nearer to her why it is i did not leave this country as i intended why it was impossible for me to tear myself away from this house why it is that i have been here every morning hovering around and doing the things i have been doing  she looked up at me and with her eyes she said how could i help knowing  she might have intended to say something with her lips but i took my answer from her eyes and with the quick impulse of a lover i stopped her speech  you have strange ways she said presently blushing and gently pressing back my arm  i havent told you a thing  let us tell each other everything now i cried and we seated ourselves in the hammock  it was a quarter of an hour later and we were still sitting together in the hammock  you may think said she that knowing what i did it was very queer for me to come out to you this morning but i could not help it  you were getting dreadfully careless and were staying so late and doing things which people would have been bound to notice especially as father is always talking about our enjoying the fresh hours of the morning that i felt i could not let you go on any longer  and when it came to that fan business i saw plainly that you must either immediately start for europe or  or what i interrupted  or go to my father and regularly engage yourself as a  i do not know whether she was going to say gardener or not but it did not matter  i stopped her  it was perhaps twenty minutes later and we were standing together at the edge of the woods  she wanted me to come to the house to take breakfast with them  oh i could not do that i said  they would be so surprised  i should have so much to explain before i could even begin to state my case  well then explain said she  you will find father on the front piazza  he is always there before breakfast and there is plenty of time  after all that has been said here i cannot go to breakfast and look commonplace while you run away  but suppose your father objects said i  well then you will have to go back and take breakfast with your miller said she  i never saw a family so little affected by surprises as those vincents when i appeared on the front piazza the old gentleman did not jump  he shook hands with me and asked me to sit down and when i told him everything he did not even ejaculate but simply folded his hands together and looked out over the railing  it seemed strange to mrs vincent and myself he said when we first noticed your extraordinary attachment for our daughter but after all it was natural enough  noticed it i exclaimed  when did you do that  very soon he said  when you and cora were cataloguing the books at my house in town i noticed it and spoke to mrs vincent but she said it was nothing new to her for it was plain enough on the day when we first met you here that you were letting the house to cora and that she had not spoken of it to me because she was afraid i might think it wrong to accept the favorable and unusual arrangements you were making with us if i suspected the reason for them  we talked over the matter but of course we could do nothing because there was nothing to do and mrs vincent was quite sure you would write to us from europe  but when my man ambrose told me he had seen some one working about the place in the very early morning and that as it was a gentleman he supposed it must be the landlord for nobody else would be doing such things mrs vincent and i looked out of the window the next day and when we found it was indeed you who were coming here every day we felt that the matter was serious and were a good deal troubled  we found however that you were conducting affairs in a very honorable waythat you were not endeavoring to see cora and that you did not try to have any secret correspondence with herand as we had no right to prevent you from coming on your grounds we concluded to remain quiet until you should take some step which we would be authorized to notice  later when mr barker came and told me that you had not gone to europe and were living with a miller not far from here  barker i cried  the scoundrel  you are mistaken sir said mr vincent  he spoke with the greatest kindness of you and said that as it was evident you had your own reasons for wishing to stay in the neighborhood and did not wish the fact to be known he had spoken of it to no one but me and he would not have done this had he not thought it would prevent embarrassment in case we should meet  would that everlasting barker ever cease meddling in my affairs  do you suppose i asked that he imagined the reason for my staying here  i do not know said the old gentleman but after the questions i put to him i have no doubt he suspected it  i made many inquiries of him regarding you your family habits and disposition for this was a very vital matter to me sir and i am happy to inform you that he said nothing of you that was not good so i urged him to keep the matter to himself  i determined however that if you continued your morning visits i should take an early opportunity of accosting you and asking an explanation  and you never mentioned anything of this to your daughter said i  oh no he answered  we carefully kept everything from her  but my dear sir said i rising you have given me no answer  you have not told me whether or not you will accept me as a soninlaw  he smiled  truly he said i have not answered you but the fact is mrs vincent and i have considered the matter so long and having come to the conclusion that if you made an honorable and straightforward proposition and if cora were willing to accept you we could see no reason to object to  at this moment the front door opened and cora appeared  are you going to stay to breakfast she asked  because if you are it is ready  i stayed to breakfast  i am now living in my own house not in the two tower rooms but in the whole mansion of which my former tenant cora is now mistress supreme  mr and mrs vincent expect to spend the next summer here and take care of the house while we are travelling  mr barker an excellent fellow and a most thorough business man still manages my affairs and there is nothing on the place that flourishes so vigorously as the bed of pinks which i got from the millers wife  by the way when i went back to my lodging on that eventful day the millers wife met me at the door  i kept your breakfast waitin for you for a good while said she but as you didnt come i supposed you were takin breakfast in your own house and i cleared it away  do you know who i am i exclaimed  oh yes sir she said  we did not at first but when everybody began to talk about it we couldnt help knowin it  everybody i gasped  and may i ask what you and everybody said about me  i think it was the general opinion sir said she that you were suspicious of them tenants of yours and nobody wondered at it for when city people gets into the country and on other peoples property theres no trustin them out of your sight for a minute  i could not let the good woman hold this opinion of my tenants and i briefly told her the truth  she looked at me with moist admiration in her eyes  i am glad to hear that sir said she  i like it very much  but if i was you i wouldnt be in a hurry to tell my husband and the people in the neighborhood about it  they might be a little disappointed at first for they had a mighty high opinion of you when they thought that you was layin low here to keep an eye on them tenants of yours     the staying power of sir rohan  during the winter in which i reached my twenty fifth year i lived with my mothers brother dr alfred morris in warburton a small country town and i was there beginning the practice of medicine  i had been graduated in the spring and my uncle earnestly advised me to come to him and act as his assistant which advice considering the fact that he was an elderly man and that i might hope to succeed him in his excellent practice was considered good advice by myself and my family  at this time i practised very little but learned a great deal for as i often accompanied my uncle on his professional visits i could not have taken a better postgraduate course  i had an invitation to spend the christmas of that year with the collingwoods who had opened their country house about twelve miles from warburton for the entertainment of a holiday house party  i had gladly accepted the invitation and on the day before christmas i went to the livery stable in the village to hire a horse and sleigh for the trip  at the stable i met uncle beamish who had also come to hire a conveyance  uncle beamish as he was generally called in the village although i am sure he had no nephews or nieces in the place was an elderly man who had retired from some business i know not what and was apparently quite able to live upon whatever income he had  he was a good man rather illiterate but very shrewd  generous in good works i do not think he was fond of giving away money but his services were at the call of all who needed them  i liked uncle beamish very much for he was not only a good storyteller but he was willing to listen to my stories and when i found he wanted to hire a horse and sleigh to go to the house of his married sister with whom he intended to spend christmas and that his sister lived on upper hill turnpike on which road the collingwood house was situated i proposed that we should hire a sleigh together  that will suit me said uncle beamish  there couldnt have been a better fit if i had been measured for it  less than half a mile after you turn into the turnpike you pass my sisters house  then you can drop me and go on to the collingwoods which i should say isnt more than three miles further  the arrangement was made a horse and sleigh ordered and early in the afternoon we started from warburton  the sleighing was good but the same could not be said of the horse he was a big roan powerful and steady but entirely too deliberate in action  uncle beamish however was quite satisfied with him  what you want when you are goin to take a journey with a horse said he is stayin power  your fast trotter is all very well for a mile or two but if i have got to go into the country in winter give me a horse like this  i did not agree with him but we jogged along quite pleasantly until the afternoon grew prematurely dark and it began to snow  now said i giving the roan a useless cut what we ought to have is a fast horse so that we may get there before there is a storm  no doctor youre wrong said uncle beamish  what we want is a strong horse that will take us there whether it storms or not and we have got him  and who cares for a little snow that wont hurt nobody  i did not care for snow and we turned up our collars and went as merrily as people can go to the music of slowly jingling sleighbells  the snow began to fall rapidly and what was worse the wind blew directly in our faces so that sometimes my eyes were so plastered up with snowflakes that i could scarcely see how to drive  i never knew snow to fall with such violence  the roadway in front of us as far as i could see it was soon one unbroken stretch of white from fence to fence  this is the big storm of the season said uncle beamish and it is a good thing we started in time for if the wind keeps blowin this road will be pretty hard to travel in a couple of hours  in about half an hour the wind lulled a little and i could get a better view of our surroundings although i could not see very far through the swiftly descending snow  i was thinkin said uncle beamish that it might be a good idee when we get to crockers place to stop a little and let you warm your fingers and nose  crockers is ruther more than halfway to the pike  oh i do not want to stop anywhere i replied quickly  i am all right  nothing was said for some time and then uncle beamish remarked  i dont want to stop any more than you do but it does seem strange that we aint passed crockers yit  we could hardly miss his house it is so close to the road  this horse is slow but i tell you one thing doctor hes improvin  he is goin better than he did  thats the way with this kind  it takes them a good while to get warmed up but they keep on gettin fresher instead of tireder  the big roan was going better but still we did not reach crockers which disappointed uncle beamish who wanted to be assured that the greater part of his journey was over  we must have passed it he said when the snow was so blindin  i did not wish to discourage him by saying that i did not think we had yet reached crockers but i believed i had a much better appreciation of our horses slowness than he had  again the wind began to blow in our faces and the snow fell faster but the violence of the storm seemed to encourage our horse for his pace was now greatly increased  thats the sort of beast to have exclaimed uncle beamish spluttering as the snow blew in his mouth  he is gettin his spirits up just when they are most wanted  we must have passed crockers a good while ago and it cant be long before we get to the pike  and its time we was there for its darkenin  on and on we went but still we did not reach the pike  we had lost a great deal of time during the first part of the journey and although the horse was travelling so much better now his pace was below the average of good roadsters  when we get to the pike said uncle beamish you cant miss it for this road doesnt cross it  all youve got to do is to turn to the left and in ten minutes you will see the lights in my sisters house and ill tell you doctor if you would like to stop there for the night shed be mighty glad to have you  much obliged replied i but i shall go on  its not late yet and i can reach the collingwoods in good time  we now drove on in silence our horse actually arching his neck as he thumped through the snow  drifts had begun to form across the road but through these he bravely plunged  stayin power is what we want doctor exclaimed uncle beamish where would your fast trotter be in drifts like these id like to know  we got the right horse when we got this one but i wish we had been goin this fast all the time  it grew darker and darker but at last we saw not far in front of us a light  that beats me said uncle beamish  i dont remember no other house so near the road  it cant be we aint passed crockers yit  if we aint got no further than that im in favor of stoppin  im not afraid of a snowstorm but i aint a fool nuther and if we havent got further than crockers it will be foolhardy to try to push on through the dark and these big drifts which will be gettin bigger  i did not give it up so easily  i greatly wished to reach my destination that night  but there were three wills in the party and one of them belonged to the horse  before i had any idea of such a thing the animal made a sudden turntoo sudden for safetypassed through a wide gateway and after a few rapid bounds which to my surprise i could not restrain he stopped suddenly  hello exclaimed uncle beamish peering forward heres a barn door  and he immediately began to throw off the far robe that covered our knees  what are you going to do i asked  im goin to open the barn door and let the horse go in said he he seems to want to  i dont know whether this is crockers barn or not  it dont look like it but i may be mistaken  anyway we will let the horse in and then go to the house  this aint no night to be travellin any further doctor and that is the long and the short of it  if the people here aint crockers i guess they are christians  i had not much time to consider the situation for while he had been speaking uncle beamish had waded through the snow and finding the barn door unfastened had slid it to one side  instantly the horse entered the dark barn fortunately finding nothing in his way  now said uncle beamish if we can get somethin to tie him with so that he dont do no mischief we can leave him here and go up to the house  i carried a pocket lantern and quickly lighted it  by george said uncle beamish as i held up the lantern this aint much of a barnits no more than a wagonhouse  it aint crockersbut no matter well go up to the house  here is a hitchinrope  we fastened the horse threw a robe over him shut the barn door behind us and slowly made our way to the back of the house in which there was a lighted window  mounting a little portico we reached a door and were about to knock when it was opened for us  a woman plainly a servant stood in a kitchen light and warm  come right in she said  i heard your bells  did you put your horse in the barn  yes said uncle beamish and now we would like to see  all right interrupted the woman moving toward an inner door  just wait here for a minute  im going up to tell her  i dont know this place said uncle beamish as we stood by the kitchen stove but i expect it belongs to a widow woman  what makes you think that i asked  cause she said she was goin to tell her  if there had been a man in the house she would have gone to tell him  in a few moments the woman returned  she says you are to take off your wet things and then go into the sittingroom  shell be down in a minute  i looked at uncle beamish thinking it was his right to make explanations but giving me a little wink he began to take off his overcoat  it was plain to perceive that uncle beamish desired to assume that a place of refuge would be offered us  its an awful bad night he said to the woman as he sat down to take off his arctic overshoes  its all that said she  you may hang your coats over them chairs it wont matter if they do drip on this bare floor  now then come right into the sittingroom  in spite of my disappointment i was glad to be in a warm house and hoped we might be able to stay there  i could hear the storm beating furiously against the windowpanes behind the drawn shades  there was a stove in the sittingroom and a large lamp  sit down said the woman  she will be here in a minute  it strikes me said uncle beamish when we were left alone that somebody is expected in this house most likely to spend christmas and that we are mistook for them whoever they are  i have the same idea i replied and we must explain as soon as possible  of course we will do that said he but i can tell you one thing whoever is expected aint comin for he cant get here  but weve got to stay here tonight no matter who comes or doesnt come and weve got to be keerful in speakin to the woman of the house  if she is one kind of a person we can offer to pay for lodgins and horsefeed but if she is another kind we must steer clear of mentionin pay for it will make her angry  you had better leave the explainin business to me  i was about to reply that i was more than willing to do so when the door opened and a person enteredevidently the mistress of the house she was tall and thin past middle age and plainly dressed  her pale countenance wore a defiant look and behind her spectacles blazed a pair of dark eyes which after an instants survey of her visitors were fixed steadily upon me  she made but a step into the room and stood holding the door  we both rose from our chairs  you can sit down again she said sharply to me  i dont want you now sir she continued turning to uncle beamish please come with me  uncle beamish gave a glance of surprise at me but he immediately followed the old lady out of the room and the door was closed behind them  for ten minutes at least i sat quietly waiting to see what would happen nextvery much surprised at the remark that had been made to me and wondering at uncle beamishs protracted absence  suddenly he entered the room and closed the door  heres a go said he slapping his leg but very gently  were mistook the worst kind  were mistook for doctors that is only half a mistake said i  what is the matter and what can i do  nothin said he quicklythat is nothin your own self  just the minute she got me outside that door she began pitchin into you i suppose thats young dr glover said she  i told her it was and then she went on to say givin me no chance to explain nothin that she didnt want to have anything to do with you that she thought it was a shame to turn peoples houses into paupers hospitals for the purpose of teachin medical students that she had heard of you and what she had heard she hadnt liked  all this time she kept goin upstairs and i follerin her and the fust thing i knowed she opened a door and went into a room and i went in after her and there in a bed was a patient of some kind  i was took back dreadful for the state of the case came to me like a flash  your uncle had been sent for and i was mistook for him  now what to say was a puzzle to me and i began to think pretty fast  it was an awkward business to have to explain things to that sharpset old woman  the fact is i didnt know how to begin and was a good deal afraid besides but she didnt give me no time for considerin  i think its her brain said she but perhaps youll know better  catherine uncover your head  and with that the patient turned over a little and uncovered her head which she had had the sheet over  it was a young woman and she gave me a good look but she didnt say nothin  now i was in a state of mind  of course you must have been i answered  why didnt you tell her that you were not a doctor but that i was  it would have been easy enough to explain matters  she might have thought my uncle could not come and he had sent me and that you had come along for company  the patient ought to be attended to without delay  shes got to beattended to said uncle beamish or else there will be a row and well have to travelstorm or no storm  but if you had heard what that old woman said about young doctors and you in particular you would know that you wasnt goin to have anything to do with this caseat least you wouldnt show in it  but ive got no more time for talkin  i came down here on business  when the old lady said catherine hold out your hand and she held it out i had nothin to do but step up and feel her pulse  i know how to do that for i have done a lot of nussin in my life  and then it seemed natral to ask her to put out her tongue and when she did it i gave a look at it and nodded my head  do you think it is her brain said the old woman half whisperin  cant say anything about that yit said i  i must go downstairs and get the medicinecase  the fust thing to do is to give her a draught and i will bring it up to her as soon as it is mixed  you have got a pocket medicinecase with you havent you  oh yes said i  it is in my overcoat  i knowed it said uncle beamish  an old doctor might go visitin without his medicinecase but a young one would be sure to take it along no matter where he was goin  now you get it please quick  my notion is said he when i returned from the kitchen with the case that you mix somethin that might soothe her a little if she has got anything the matter with her brain and which wont hurt her if she hasnt  and then when i take it up to her you tell me what symptoms to look for  i can do iti have spent nights lookin for symptoms  then when i come down and report you might send her up somethin that would keep her from gettin any wuss till the doctor can come in the mornin for he aint comin here tonight  a very good plan said i  now what can i give her  what is the patients age  oh her age dont matter much said uncle beamish impatiently  she may be twenty more or less and any mild stuff will do to begin with  i will give her some sweet spirits of nitre said i taking out a little vial  will you ask the servant for a glass of water and a teaspoon  now said i when i had quickly prepared the mixture she can have a teaspoonful of this and another in ten minutes and then we will see whether we will go on with it or not  and what am i to look for said he  in the first place said i producing a clinical thermometer you must take her temperature  you know how to do that  oh yes said he  i have done it hundreds of times  she must hold it in her mouth five minutes  yes and while you are waiting i continued you must try to find out in the first place if there are or have been any signs of delirium  you might ask the old lady and besides you may be able to judge for yourself  i can do that said he  i have seen lots of it  then again said i you must observe whether or not her pupils are dilated  you might also inquire whether there had been any partial paralysis or numbness in any part of the body  these things must be looked for in brain trouble  then you can come down ostensibly to prepare another prescription and when you have reported i have no doubt i can give you something which will modify or i should say  hold her where she is till mornin said uncle beamish thats what you mean  be quick  give me that thermometer and the tumbler and when i come down again i reckon you can fit her out with a prescription just as good as anybody  he hurried away and i sat down to consider  i was full of ambition full of enthusiasm for the practice of my profession  i would have been willing to pay largely for the privilege of undertaking an important case by myself in which it would depend upon me whether or not i should call in a consulting brother  so far in the cases i had undertaken a consulting brother had always called himself inthat is i had practised in hospitals or with my uncle  perhaps it might be found necessary notwithstanding all that had been said against me that i should go up to take charge of this case  i wished i had not forgotten to ask the old man how he had found the tongue and pulse  in less than a quarter of an hour uncle beamish returned  well said i quickly what are the symptoms  ill give them to you said he taking his seat  im not in such a hurry now because i told the old woman i would like to wait a little and see how that fust medicine acted  the patient spoke to me this time  when i took the thermometer out of her mouth she says you are comin up agin doctor speakin low and quickish as if she wanted nobody but me to hear  but how about the symptoms said i impatiently  well he answered in the fust place her temperature is ninetyeight and a half and thats about natral i take it  yes i said but you didnt tell me about her tongue and pulse  there wasnt nothin remarkable about them said he  all of which means i remarked that there is no fever  but that is not at all a necessary accompaniment of brain derangements  how about the dilatation of her pupils  there isnt none said uncle beamish they are ruther squinched up if anything  and as to delirium i couldnt see no signs of it and when i asked the old lady about the numbness she said she didnt believe there had been any  no tendency to shiver no disposition to stretch  no said the old man no chance for quinine  the trouble is said i standing before the stove and fixing my mind upon the case with earnest intensity that there are so few symptoms in brain derangement  if i could only get hold of something tangible  if i was you interrupted uncle beamish i wouldnt try to get hold of nothin  i would just give her somethin to keep her where she is till mornin  if you can do that ill guarantee that any good doctor can take her up and go on with her tomorrow  without noticing the implication contained in these remarks i continued my consideration of the case  if i could get a drop of her blood said i  no no exclaimed uncle beamish im not goin to do anything of that sort  what in the name of common sense would you do with her blood  i would examine it microscopically i said  i might find out all i want to know  uncle beamish did not sympathize with this method of diagnosis  if you did find out there was the wrong kind of germs you couldnt do anything with them tonight and it would just worry you said the old man  i believe that nature will get along fustrate without any help at least till mornin  but youve got to give her some medicinenot so much for her good as for our good  if shes not treated were bounced  cant you give her somethin that would do anybody good no matter whats the matter with em  if it was the spring of the year i would say sarsaparilla  if you could mix her up somethin and put into it some of them benevolent microbes the doctors talk about it would be a good deed to do to anybody  the benign bacilli said i  unfortunately i havent any of them with me  and if you had he remarked id be in favor of givin em to the old woman  i take it they would do her more good than anybody else come along now doctor it is about time for me to go upstairs and see how the other stuff actednot on the patient i dont mean but on the old woman  the fact is you know its her were dosin  not at all said i speaking a little severely  i am trying to do my very best for the patient but i fear i cannot do it without seeing her  dont you think that if you told the old lady how absolutely necessary  dont say anything more about that exclaimed uncle beamish  i hoped i wouldnt have to mention it but she told me agin that she would never have one of those unfledged medical students just out of the eggshell experimentin on any of her family and from what she said about you in particular i should say she considered you as a medical chick without even down on you  what can she know of me  i asked indignantly  give it up said he  cant guess it  but that aint the pint the pint is what are you goin to give her  when i was young the doctors used to say when you are in doubt give calomelas if you were playin trumps  nonsense nonsense said i my eyes earnestly fixed upon my open medical case  i suppose a mustardplaster on the back of her neck  wouldnt do at all i interrupted  wait a minute nowyesi know what i will do i will give her sodium bromideten grains  which will hit if its a deer and miss if its a calf as the hunter said inquired uncle beamish  it will certainly not injure her said i and i am quite sure it will be a positive advantage  if there has been cerebral disturbance which has subsided temporarily it will assist her to tide over the interim before its recurrence  all right said uncle beamish give it to me and ill be off  its time i showed up agin  he did not stay upstairs very long this time  no symptoms yit but the patient looked at me as if she wanted to say somethin but she didnt git no chance for the old lady set herself down as if she was planted in a gardenbed and intended to stay there but the patient took the medicine as mild as a lamb  that is very good said i  it may be that she appreciates the seriousness of her ewe better than we do  i should say she wants to git well he replied  she looks like that sort of a person to me  the old woman said she thought we would have to stay awhile till the storm slackened and i said yes indeed and there wasnt any chance of its slackenin tonight besides i wanted to see the patient before bedtime  at this moment the door opened and the servantwoman came in  she says you are to have supper and it will be ready in about half an hour  one of you had better go out and attend to your horse for the man is not coming back tonight  i will go to the barn said i rising  uncle beamish also rose and said he would go with me  i guess you can find some hay and oats said the woman as we were putting on our coats and overshoes in the kitchen and heres a lantern  we dont keep no horse now but theres feed left  as we pushed through the deep snow into the barn uncle beamish said  ive been tryin my best to think where we are without askin any questions and im dead beat  i dont remember no such house as this on the road  perhaps we got off the road said i  that may be said he as we entered the barn  its a straight road from warburton to the pike near my sisters house but theres two other roads that branch off to the right and strike the pike further off to the east  perhaps we got on one of them in all that darkness and perplexin whiteness when it wasnt easy to see whether we were keepin a straight road or not  the horse neighed as we approached with a light  i would not be at all surprised said i if this horse had once belonged here and that was the reason why as soon as he got a chance he turned and made straight for his old home  that isnt unlikely said uncle beamish and thats the reason we did not pass crockers  but here we are wherever it is and here weve got to stay till mornin  we found hay and oats and a pump in the corner of the wagonhouse and having put the horse in the stall and made him as comfortable as possible with some old blankets we returned to the house bringing our valises with us  our supper was served in the sittingroom because there was a good fire there and the servant told us we would have to eat by ourselves as she was not coming down  well excuse her said uncle beamish with an alacrity of expression that might have caused suspicion  we had a good supper and were then shown a room on the first floor on the other side of the hall where the servant said we were to sleep  we sat by the stove awhile waiting for developments but as uncle beamishs bedtime was rapidly approaching he sent word to the sickchamber that he was coming up for his final visit  this time he stayed upstairs but a few minutes  shes fast asleep said he and the old woman says shell call me if im needed in the night and youll have to jump up sharp and overhaul that medicinecase if that happens  the next morning and very early in the morning i was awaked by uncle beamish who stood at my side  look here said he ive been outside  its stopped snowin and its clearin off  ive been to the barn and ive fed the horse and i tell you what im in favor of doin  theres nobody up yit and i dont want to stay here and make no explanations to that old woman  i dont fancy gittin into rows on christmas mornin  weve done all the good we can here and the best thing we can do now is to git away before anybody is up and leave a note sayin that weve got to go on without losin time and that we will send another doctor as soon as possible  my sisters doctor dont live fur away from her and i know she will be willin to send for him  then our duty will be done and what the old woman thinks of us wont make no difference to nobody  that plan suits me said i rising  i dont want to stay here and as i am not to be allowed to see the patient there is no reason why i should stay  what we have done will more than pay for our supper and lodgings so that our consciences are clear  but you must write a note said uncle beamish  got any paper  i tore a leaf from my notebook and went to the window where it was barely light enough for me to see how to write  make it short said the old man  im awful fidgety to git off  i made it very short and then valises in hand we quietly took our way to the kitchen  how this floor does creak said uncle beamish  git on your overcoat and shoes as quick as you can and well leave the note on this table  i had just shaken myself into my overcoat when uncle beamish gave a subdued exclamation and quickly turning i saw entering the kitchen a female figure in winter wraps and carrying a handbag  by george whispered the old man its the patient  the figure advanced directly toward me  oh dr glover she whispered i am so glad to get down before you went away  i stared in amazement at the speaker but even in the dim light i recognized her  this was the human being whose expected presence at the collingwood mansion was taking me there to spend christmas  kitty i exclaimedmiss burroughs i meanwhat is the meaning of this  dont ask me for any meanings now she said  i want you and your uncle to take me to the collingwoods  i suppose you are on your way there for they wrote you were coming  and oh  let us be quick for im afraid jane will come down and she will be sure to wake up aunty i saw one of you go out to the barn and knew you intended to leave so i got ready just as fast as i could  but i must leave some word for aunty  i have written a note  said i but are you well enough to travel  just let me add a line to it said she  i am as well as i ever was  i gave her a pencil and she hurriedly wrote something on the paper which i had left on the kitchen table  then quickly glancing around she picked up a large carvingfork and sticking it through the paper into the soft wood of the table she left it standing there  now it wont blow away when we open the door she whispered  come on  you cannot go out to the barn i said we will bring up the sleigh  oh no no no she answered i must not wait here  if i once get out of the house i shall feel safe  of course i shall go anyway but i dont want any quarrelling on this christmas morning  im with you there said uncle beamish approvingly  doctor we can take her to the barn without her touching the snow  let her sit in this armchair and we can carry her between us  shes no weight  in half a minute the kitchen door was softly closed behind us and we were carrying miss burroughs to the barn  my soul was in a wild tumult  dozens of questions were on my tongue but i had no chance to ask any of them  uncle beamish and i returned to the porch for the valises and then closing the back door we rapidly began to make preparations for leaving  i suppose said uncle beamish as we went into the stable leaving miss burroughs in the wagonhouse that this business is all right you seem to know the young woman and she is of age to act for herself   whatever she wants to do i answered is perfectly right you may trust to that  i do not understand the matter any more than you do but i know she is expected at the collingwoods and wants to go there  very good said uncle beamish  well git away fust and ask explanations afterwards  dr glover said miss burroughs as we led the horse into the wagonhouse dont put the bells on him  stuff them gently under the seatas softly as you can  but how are we all to go away  i have been looking at that sleigh and it is intended only for two  its rather late to think of that miss said uncle beamish but theres one thing thats certain  were both very polite to ladies but neither of us is willin to be left behind on this trip  but its a goodsized sleigh and well all pack in well enough  you and me can sit on the seat and the doctor can stand up in front of us and drive  in old times it was considered the right thing for the driver of the sleigh to stand up and do his drivin  the baggage was carefully stowed away and after a look around the dimly lighted wagonhouse miss burroughs and uncle beamish got into the sleigh and i tucked the big fur robe around them  i hate to make a journey before breakfast said uncle beamish as i was doing this especially on christmas mornin but somehow or other there seems to be somethin jolly about this business and we wont have to wait so long for breakfast nuther  it cant be far from my sisters and well all stop there and have breakfast  then you two can leave me and go on  shell be as glad to see any friends of mine as if they were her own  and shell be pretty sure on a mornin like this to have buckwheat cakes and sausages  miss burroughs looked at the old man with a puzzled air but she asked him no questions  how are you going to keep yourself warm dr glover she said  oh this long ulster will be enough for me i replied and as i shall stand up i could not use a robe if we had another  in fact the thought of being with miss burroughs and the anticipation of a sleighride alone with her after we had left uncle beamish with his sister had put me into such a glow that i scarcely knew it was cold weather  youd better be keerful doctor said uncle beamish  you dont want to git rheumatism in your jints on this christmas mornin  heres this horseblanket that we are settin on  we dont need it and youd better wrap it round you after you git in to keep your legs warm  oh do said miss burroughs  it may look funny but we will not meet anybody so early as this  all right said i and now we are ready to start  i slid back the barn door and then led the horse outside  closing the door and making as little noise as possible in doing it i got into the sleigh finding plenty of room to stand up in front of my companions  now i wrapped the horseblanket about the lower part of my body and as i had no belt with which to secure it miss burroughs kindly offered to fasten it round my waist by means of a long pin which she took from her hat  it is impossible to describe the exhilaration that pervaded me as she performed this kindly office  after thanking her warmly i took the reins and we started  it is so lucky whispered miss burroughs that i happened to think about the bells  we dont make any noise at all  this was true  the slowly uplifted hoofs of the horse descended quietly into the soft snow and the sleighrunners slipped along without a sound  drive straight for the gate doctor whispered uncle beamish  it dont matter nothin about goin over flowerbeds and grassplats in such weather  i followed his advice for no roadway could be seen  but we had gone but a short distance when the horse suddenly stopped  whats the matter asked miss burroughs in a low voice  is it too deep for him  were in a drift said uncle beamish  but its not too deep  make him go ahead doctor  i clicked gently and tapped the horse with the whip but he did not move  what a dreadful thing whispered miss burroughs leaning forward for him to stop so near the house  dr glover what does this mean and as she spoke she half rose behind me  where did sir rohan come from  whos he asked uncle beamish quickly  that horse she answered  thats my aunts horse  she sold him a few days ago  by george ejaculated uncle beamish unconsciously raising his voice a little  wilson bought him and his bringin us here is as plain as a b c  and now he dont want to leave home  but he has got to do it said i jerking the horses head to one side and giving him a cut with the whip  dont whip him whispered miss burroughs it always makes him more stubborn  how glad i am i thought of the bells  the only way to get him to go is to mollify him  but how is that to be done i asked anxiously  you must give him sugar and pat his neck  if i had some sugar and could get out  but you havent it and you cant git out said uncle beamish  try him again doctor  i jerked the reins impatiently  go along said i  but he did not go along  havent you got somethin in your medicinecase you could mollify him with said uncle beamish  somethin sweet that he might like  for an instant i caught at this absurd suggestion and my mind ran over the contents of my little bottles  if i had known his character some sodium bromide in his morning feed might by this time have mollified his obstinacy  if i could be free of this blanket said i fumbling at the pin behind me i would get out and lead him into the road  you could not do it said miss burroughs  you might pull his head off but he wouldnt move  i have seen him tried  at this moment a windowsash in the second story of the house was raised and there not thirty feet from us stood an elderly female wrapped in a gray shawl with piercing eyes shining through great spectacles  you seem to be stuck said she sarcastically  you are worse stuck than the fork was in my kitchen table  we made no answer  i do not know how miss burroughs looked or felt or what was the appearance of uncle beamish but i know i must have been very red in the face  i gave the horse a powerful crack and shouted to him to go on  there was no need for low speaking now  you neednt be cruel to dumb animals said the old lady and you cant budge him  he never did like snow especially in going away from home  you cut a powerful queer figure young man with that horseblanket around you  you dont look much like a practising physician  miss burroughs i exclaimed please take that pin out of this blanket  if i can get at his head i know i can pull him around and make him go  but she did not seem to hear me  aunty she cried its a shame to stand there and make fun of us  we have got a perfect right to go away if we want to and we ought not to be laughed at  the old lady paid no attention to this remark  and theres that false doctor she said  i wonder how he feels just now  false doctor exclaimed miss burroughs  i dont understand  young lady said uncle beamish im no false doctor  i intended to tell you all about it as soon as i got a chance but i havent had one and old lady id like you to know that i dont say im a doctor but i do say im a nuss and a good nuss and you cant deny it  to this challenge the figure at the window made no answer  catherine said she i cant stand here and take cold but i just want to know one thing  have you positively made up your mind to marry that young doctor in the horseblanket  this question fell like a bombshell into the middle of the stationary sleigh  i had never asked kitty to marry me  i loved her with all my heart and soul and i hoped almost believed that she loved me  it had been my intention when we should be left together in the sleigh this morning after dropping uncle beamish at his sisters house to ask her to marry me  the old womans question pierced me as if it had been a flash of lightning coming through the frosty air of a winter morning  i dropped the useless reins and turned  kittys face was ablaze  she made a movement as if she was about to jump out of the sleigh and flee  oh kitty said i bending down toward her tell her yes  i beg i entreat i implore you to tell her yes  oh kitty if you dont say yes i shall never know another happy day  for one moment kitty looked up into my face and then said she  it is my positive intention to marry him  with the agility of a youth uncle beamish threw the robe from him and sprang out into the deep snow  then turning toward us he took off his hat  by george said he youre a pair of trumps  i never did see any human beins step up to the mark more prompt  madam he cried addressing the old lady you ought to be the proudest woman in this county at seein such a thing as this happen under your window of a christmas mornin  and now the best thing that you can do is to invite us all in to have breakfast  youll have to come in said she or else stay out there and freeze to death for that horse isnt going to take you away  and if my niece really intends to marry the young man and has gone so far as to start to run away with himand with a false doctorof course ive got no more to say about it and you can come in and have breakfast  and with that she shut down the window  thats talkin said uncle beamish  sit still doctor and ill lead him around to the back door  i guess hell move quick enough when you want him to turn back  without the slightest objection sir rohan permitted himself to be turned back and led up to the kitchen porch  now you two sparklin angels get out said uncle beamish and go in ill attend to the horse  jane with a broad grin on her face opened the kitchen door  merry christmas to you both said she  merry christmas we cried and each of us shook her by the hand  go in the sittingroom and get warm said jane  shell be down pretty soon  i do not know how long we were together in that sittingroom  we had thousands of things to say and we said most of them  among other things we managed to get in some explanations of the occurrences of the previous night  kitty told her tale briefly  she and her aunt to whom she was making a visit and who wanted her to make her house her home had had a quarrel two days before  kitty was wild to go to the collingwoods and the old lady who for some reason hated the family was determined she should not go  but kitty was immovable and never gave up until she found that her aunt had gone so far as to dispose of her horse thus making it impossible to travel in such weather there being no public conveyances passing the house  kitty was an orphan and had a guardian who would have come to her aid but she could not write to him in time and in utter despair she went to bed  she would not eat or drink she would not speak and she covered up her head  after a day and a night said kitty aunty got dreadfully frightened and thought something was the matter with my brain  her family are awfully anxious about their brains  i knew she had sent for the doctor and i was glad of it for i thought he would help me  i must say i was surprised when i first saw that mr beamish for i thought he was dr morris  now tell me about your coming here  and so she said when i had finished you had no idea that you were prescribing for me  please do tell me what were those medicines you sent up to me and which i took like a truly good girl  i didnt know it at the time said i but i sent you sixty drops of the deepest strongest love in a glass of water and ten grains of perfect adoration  nonsense said kitty with a blush and at that moment uncle beamish knocked at the door  i thought id just step in and tell you said he that breakfast will be comin along in a minute  i found they were goin to have buckwheat cakes anyway and i prevailed on jane to put sausages in the bill of fare  merry christmas to you both  i would like to say more but here comes the old lady and jane  the breakfast was a strange meal but a very happy one  the old lady was very dignified  she made no allusion to christmas or to what had happened but talked to uncle beamish about people in warburton  i have a practical mind and in spite of the present joy i could not help feeling a little anxiety about what was to be done when breakfast was over  but just as we were about to rise from the table we were all startled by a great jingle of sleighbells outside  the old lady arose and stopped to the window  there said she turning toward us  heres a pretty kettle of fish theres a twohorse sleigh outside with a man driving and a gentleman in the back seat who i am sure is dr morris and he has come all the way on this bitter cold morning to see the patient i sent for him to come to  now who is going to tell him he has come on a fools errand  fools errand i cried  every one of you wait in here and ill go out and tell him  when i dashed out of doors and stood by the side of my uncles sleigh he was truly an amazed man  i will get in uncle said i and if you will let john drive the horses slowly around the yard i will tell you how i happen to be here  the story was a much longer one than i expected it to be and john must have driven those horses backward and forward for half an hour  well said my uncle at last i never saw your kitty but i knew her father and her mother and i will go in and take a look at her  if i like her i will take you all on to the collingwoods and drop uncle beamish at his sisters house  ill tell you what it is young doctor said uncle beamish at parting you ought to buy that big roan horse  he has been a regular guardian angel to us this christmas  oh that would never do at all cried kitty  his patients would all die before he got there  that is if they had anything the matter with them added my uncle     a piece of red calico  before beginning the relation of the following incidents i wish to state that i am a young married man doing business in a large city in the suburbs of which i live  i was going into town the other morning when my wife handed me a little piece of red calico and asked me if i would have time during the day to buy her two yards and a half of calico like it  i assured her that it would be no trouble at all and putting the piece of calico in my pocket i took the train for the city  at lunchtime i stopped in at a large drygoods store to attend to my wifes commission  i saw a welldressed man walking the floor between the counters where long lines of girls were waiting on much longer lines of customers and asked him where i could see some red calico  this way sir and he led me up the store  miss stone said he to a young lady show this gentleman some red calico  what shade do you want asked miss stone  i showed her the little piece of calico that my wife had given me  she looked at it and handed it back to me  then she took down a great roll of red calico and spread it out on the counter  why that isnt the shade said i  no not exactly said she  but it is prettier than your sample  that may be said i  but you see i want to match this piece there is something already in my house made of this kind of calico which needs to be made larger or mended or something  i want some calico of the same shade  the girl made no answer but took down another roll  thats the shade said she  yes i replied but its striped  stripes are more worn than anything else in calicoes said she   yes  but this isnt to be worn  its for furniture i think  at any rate i want perfectly plain stuff to match something already in use  well i dont think you can find it perfectly plain unless you get turkey red  what is turkey red i asked  turkey red is perfectly plain in calicoes she answered  well let me see some  we havent any turkey red calico left she said but we have some very nice plain calicoes in other colors  i dont want any other color  i want stuff to match this  its hard to match cheap calico like that she said and so i left her  i next went into a store a few doors farther up broadway  when i entered i approached the floorwalker and handing him my sample said  have you any calico like this  yes sir said he  third counter to the right  i went to the third counter to the right and showed my sample to the salesman in attendance there  he looked at it on both sides  then he said  we havent any of this  the floorwalker said you had said i  we had it but were out of it now  youll get that goods at an upholsterers  i went across the street to an upholsterers  have you any stuff like this i asked  no said the salesman we havent  is it for furniture  yes i replied  then turkey red is what you want  is turkey red just like this i asked  no said he but its much better  that makes no difference to me i replied  i want something just like this  but they dont use that for furniture he said  i should think people could use anything they wanted for furniture i remarked somewhat sharply  they can but they dont he said quite calmly  they dont use red like that  they use turkey red  i said no more but left  the next place i visited was a very large drygoods store  of the first salesman i saw i inquired if they kept red calico like my sample  youll find that on the second story said he  i went upstairs  there i asked a man  where shall i find red calico  in the far room to the left and he pointed to a distant corner  i walked through the crowds of purchasers and salespeople around the counters and tables filled with goods to the far room to the left when i got there i asked for red calico  the second counter down this side said the man  i went there and produced my sample  calicoes downstairs said the man  they told me they were up here i said  not these plain goods  youll find them downstairs at the back of the store over on that side  i went downstairs to the back of the store  where can i find red calico like this i asked  next counter but one said the man addressed walking with me in the direction pointed out  dunn show red calicoes  mr dunn took my sample and looked at it  we havent this shade in that quality of goods he said  well have you it in any quality of goods i asked  yes  weve got it finer  he took down a piece of calico and unrolled a yard or two of it  thats not this shade i said  no said he  the goods is finer and the colors better  i want it to match this i said  i thought you werent particular about the match said the salesman you said you didnt care for the quality of the goods and you know you cant match without you take into consideration quality and color both  if you want that quality of goods in red you ought to get turkey red  i did not think it necessary to answer this remark but said  then youve got nothing to match this  no sir  but perhaps they may have it in the upholstery department in the sixth story  i got into the elevator and went up to the top of the house  have you any red stuff like this i said to a young man  red stuff  upholstery departmentother end of this floor  i went to the other end of the floor  i want some red calico i said to a man  furniture goods he asked  yes said i  fourth counter to the left  i went to the fourth counter to the left and showed my sample to a salesman  he looked at it and said  youll get this down on the first floorcalico department  i turned on my heel descended in the elevator and went out on broadway  i was thoroughly sick of red calico  but i determined to make one more trial  my wife had bought her red calico not long before and there must be some to be had somewhere  i ought to have asked her where she bought it but i thought a simple little thing like that could be procured anywhere  i went into another large drygoods store  as i entered the door a sudden tremor seized me  i could not bear to take out that piece of red calico  if i had had any other kind of a rag about mea penwiper or anything of the sorti think i would have asked them if they could match that  but i stepped up to a young woman and presented my sample with the usual question  back room counter on the left she said  i went there  have you any red calico like this i asked of the lady behind the counter  no sir she said but we have it in turkey red  turkey red again  i surrendered  all right i said  give me turkey red  how much sir she asked  i dont knowsay five yards  the lady looked at me rather strangely but measured off five yards of turkey red calico  then she rapped on the counter and called out cash  a little girl with yellow hair in two long plaits came slowly up  the lady wrote the number of yards the name of the goods her own number the price the amount of the banknote i handed her and some other mattersprobably the color of my eyes and the direction and velocity of the windon a slip of paper  she then copied all this in a little book which she kept by her  then she handed the slip of paper the money and the turkey red to the yellowhaired girl  this young girl copied the slip in a little book she carried and then she went away with the calico the paper slip and the money  after a very long timeduring which the little girl probably took the goods the money and the slip to some central desk where the note was received its amount and number entered in a book change given to the girl a copy of the slip made and entered girls entry examined and approved goods wrapped up girl registered plaits counted and entered on a slip of paper and copied by the girl in her book girl taken to a hydrant and washed number of towel entered on a paper slip and copied by the girl in her book value of my note and amount of change branded somewhere on the child and said process noted on a slip of paper and copied in her bookthe girl came to me bringing my change and the package of turkey red calico  i had time for but very little work at the office that afternoon and when i reached home i handed the package of calico to my wife  she unrolled it and exclaimed  why this doesnt match the piece i gave you  match it i cried  oh no it doesnt match it  you didnt want that matched  you were mistaken  what you wanted was turkey redthird counter to the left  i mean turkey red is what they use  my wife looked at me in amazement and then i detailed to her my troubles  well said she this turkey red is a great deal prettier than what i had and youve bought so much of it that i neednt use the other at all  i wish i had thought of turkey red before  i wish from my heart you had said i     the christmas wreck  well sir said old silas as he gave a preliminary puff to the pipe he had just lighted and so satisfied himself that the draught was all right the winds acomin an sos christmas  but its no use bein in a hurry fur either of em fur sometimes they come afore you want em anyway  silas was sitting in the stern of a small sailingboat which he owned and in which he sometimes took the sandport visitors out for a sail and at other times applied to its more legitimate but less profitable use that of fishing  that afternoon he had taken young mr nugent for a brief excursion on that portion of the atlantic ocean which sends its breakers up on the beach of sandport  but he had found it difficult nay impossible just now to bring him back for the wind had gradually died away until there was not a breath of it left  mr nugent to whom nautical experiences were as new as the very nautical suit of blue flannel which he wore rather liked the calm  it was such a relief to the monotony of rolling waves  he took out a cigar and lighted it and then he remarked  i can easily imagine how a wind might come before you sailors might want it but i dont see how christmas could come too soon  it come wunst on me when things couldnt a looked more onready fur it said silas  how was that asked mr nugent settling himself a little more comfortably on the hard thwart  if its a story lets have it  this is a good time to spin a yarn  very well said old silas  ill spin her  the barelegged boy whose duty it was to stay forward and mind the jib came aft as soon as he smelt a story and took a nautical position which was duly studied by mr nugent on a bag of ballast in the bottom of the boat  its nigh on to fifteen year ago said silas that i was on the bark mary auguster bound for sydney new south wales with a cargo of canned goods  we was somewhere about longitood a hundred an seventy latitood nothin an it was the twentysecond o december when we was ketched by a reglar typhoon which blew straight along end on fur a day an a half  it blew away the stormsails  it blew away every yard spar shroud an every strand o riggin an snapped the masts off close to the deck  it blew away all the boats  it blew away the cooks caboose an everythin else on deck  it blew off the hatches an sent em spinnin in the air about a mile to leeward  an afore it got through it washed away the capn an all the crew cept me an two others  these was tom simmons the second mate an andy boyle a chap from the adirondack mountins whod never been to sea afore  as he was a landsman he ought by rights to a been swep off by the wind an water considrin that the capn an sixteen good seamen had gone aready  but he had hands eleven inches long an that give him a grip which no typhoon could git the better of  andy had let out that his father was a miller up there in york state an a story had got round among the crew that his granfather an greatgranfather was millers too an the way the famly got such big hands come from their habit of scoopin up a extry quart or two of meal or flour fur themselves when they was levellin off their customers measures  he was a goodnatered feller though an never got riled when id tell him to clap his flourscoops onter a halyard  we was all soaked an washed an beat an battered  we held on some way or other till the wind blowed itself out an then we got on our legs an began to look about us to see how things stood  the sea had washed into the open hatches till the vessel was moren half full of water an that had sunk her so deep that she must a looked like a canalboat loaded with gravel  we hadnt had a thing to eat or drink durin that whole blow an we was pretty ravenous  we found a keg of water which was all right and a box of biscuit which was what you might call softtack fur they was soaked through an through with seawater  we eat a lot of them so fur we couldnt wait an the rest we spread on the deck to dry fur the sun was now shinin hot enough to bake bread  we couldnt go below much fur there was a pretty good swell on the sea an things was floatin about sos to make it dangerous  but we fished out a piece of canvas which we rigged up agin the stump of the mainmast so that we could have somethin that we could sit down an grumble under  what struck us all the hardest was that the bark was loaded with a whole cargo of jolly things to eat which was just as good as ever they was fur the water couldnt git through the tin cans in which they was all put up an here we was with nothin to live on but them salted biscuit  there wasnt no way of gittin at any of the ships stores or any of the fancy prog fur everythin was stowed away tight under six or seven feet of water an pretty nigh all the room that was left between decks was filled up with extry spars lumber boxes an other floatin stuff  all was shiftin an bumpin an bangin every time the vessel rolled  as i said afore tom was second mate an i was bosn  says i to tom the thing weve got to do is to put up some kind of a spar with a rag on it fur a distress flag so that well lose no time bein took off  theres no use aslavin at anythin like that says tom fur weve been blowed off the track of traders an the more we work the hungrier well git an the sooner will them biscuit be gone  now when i heared tom say this i sot still an began to consider bein second mate tom was by rights in command of this craft  but it was easy enough to see that if he commanded thered never be nothin fur andy an me to do  all the grit he had in him hed used up in holdin on durin that typhoon  what he wanted to do now was to make himself comfortable till the time come for him to go to davy joness lockeran thinkin  most likely that davy couldnt make it any hotter fur him than it was on that deck still in latitood nothin at all fur wed been blowed along the line pretty nigh due west  so i calls to andy who was busy turnin over the biscuits on the deck andy says i when he had got under the canvas wes goin to have a lection fur skipper  tom here is about played out  hes one candydate an im another  now who do you vote fur  an mind yer eye youngster that you dont make no mistake  i vote fur you says andy  carried unanermous says i  an i want you to take notice that im capn of whats left of the mary auguster an you two has got to keep your minds on that an obey orders  if davy jones was to do all that tom simmons said when he heared this the old chap would be kept busier than he ever was yit  but i let him growl his growl out knowin hed come round all right fur there wasnt no help fur it considrin andy an me was two to his one  pretty soon we all went to work an got up a spar from below which we rigged to the stump of the foremast with andys shirt atop of it  them seasoaked sundried biscuit was pretty mean prog as you might think but we eat so many of em that afternoon an cordingly drank so much water that i was obliged to put us all on short rations the next day  this is the day afore christmas says andy boyle an tonight will be christmas eve an its pretty tough fur us to be sittin here with not even so much hardtack as we want an all the time thinkin that the hold of this ship is packed full of the gayest kind of good things to eat  shut up about christmas says tom simmons  them two youngsters of mine up in bangor is havin their toes and noses pretty nigh froze i spect but theyll hang up their stockins all the same tonight never thinkin that their dads bein cooked alive on a empty stomach  of course they wouldnt hang em up says i if they knowed what a fix you was in but they dont know it an whats the use of grumblin at em fur bein a little jolly well says andy they couldnt be more jollier than id be if i could git at some of them fancy fixins down in the hold  i worked well on to a week at frisco puttin in them boxes an the names of the things was on the outside of most of em an i tell you what it is mates it made my mouth water even then to read em an i wasnt hungry nuther havin plenty to eat three times a day  there was roast beef an roast mutton an duck an chicken an soup an peas an beans an termaters an plumpuddin an mincepie  shut up with your mincepie sung out tom simmons  isnt it enough to have to gnaw on these salt chips without hearin about mincepie  an moren that says andy there was canned peaches an pears an plums an cherries  now these things did sound so cool an good to me on that brilin deck that i couldnt stand it an i leans over to andy an i says now looka here if you dont shut up talkin about them things whats stowed below an what we cant git at nohow overboard you go  that would make you shorthanded says andy with a grin  which is moren you could say says i if youd chuck tom an me overalludin to his eleveninch grip  andy didnt say no more then but after a while he comes to me as i was lookin round to see if anything was in sight an says he i spose you aint got nothin to say agin my divin into the hold just aft of the foremast where there seems to be a bit of pretty clear water an see if i cant git up somethin you kin do it if you like says i but its at your own risk  you cant take out no insurance at this office  all right then says andy an if i git stove in by floatin boxes you an tomll have to eat the rest of them salt crackers  now boy says ian he wasnt much more bein only nineteen year oldyoud better keep out o that hold  youll just git yourself smashed  an as to movin any of them there heavy boxes which must be swelled up as tight as if they was part of the ship you might as well try to pull out one of the mary augusters ribs  ill try it says andy fur tomorrer is christmas an if i kin help it i aint goin to be floatin atop of a christmas dinner without eatin any on it  i let him go fur he was a good swimmer an diver an i did hope he might root out somethin or other fur christmas is about the worst day in the year fur men to be starvin on an thats what we was acomin to  well fur about two hours andy swum an dove an come up blubberin an dodged all sorts of floatin an pitchin stuff fur the swell was still on  but he couldnt even be so much as sartin that hed found the canned vittles  to dive down through hatchways an among broken bulkheads to hunt fur any partiklar kind o boxes under seven foot of seawater aint no easy job  an though andy said he got hold of the end of a box that felt to him like the big uns hed noticed as havin the meatpies in he couldnt move it no moren if it had been the stump of the foremast  if we could have pumped the water out of the hold we could have got at any part of the cargo we wanted but as it was we couldnt even reach the ships stores which of course must have been mostly spiled anyway whereas the canned vittles was just as good as new  the pumps was all smashed or stopped up for we tried em but if they hadnt a been we three couldnt never have pumped out that ship on three biscuit a day an only about two days rations at that  so andy he come up so fagged out that it was as much as he could do to get his clothes on though they wasnt much an then he stretched himself out under the canvas an went to sleep an it wasnt long afore he was talkin about roast turkey an cranberry sass an punkinpie an sech stuff most of which we knowed was under our feet that present minnit  tom simmons he just biled over an sung out roll him out in the sun an let him cook  i cant stand no more of this  but i wasnt goin to have andy treated no sech way as that fur if it hadnt been fur tom simmons wife an young uns andyd been worth two of him to anybody who was considrin savin life  but i give the boy a good punch in the ribs to stop his dreamin fur i was as hungry as tom was an couldnt stand no nonsense about christmas dinners  it was a little arter noon when andy woke up an he went outside to stretch himself  in about a minute he give a yell that made tom an me jump  a sail he hollered a sail  an you may bet your life young man that twasnt moren half a second afore us two had scuffled out from under that canvas an was standin by andy  there she is he shouted not a mile to winard  i give one look an then i sings out  taint a sail  its a flag of distress  cant you see you landlubber that thats the stars and stripes upside down  why so it is says andy with a couple of reefs in the joyfulness of his voice an tom he began to growl as if somebody had cheated him out of half a years wages  the flag that we saw was on the hull of a steamer that had been driftin down on us while we was sittin under our canvas  it was plain to see shed been caught in the typhoon too fur there wasnt a mast or a smokestack on her  but her hull was high enough out of the water to catch what wind there was while we was so low sunk that we didnt make no way at all  there was people aboard and they saw us an waved their hats an arms an andy an me waved ours but all we could do was to wait till they drifted nearer fur we hadnt no boats to go to em if wed wanted to  id like to know what good that old hulk is to us says tom simmons she cant take us off  it did look to me somethin like the blind leadin the blind  but andy he sings out  wed be better off aboard of her fur she aint waterlogged an moren that i dont spose her stores are all soaked up in salt water  there was some sense in that an when the steamer had got to within half a mile of us we was glad to see a boat put out from her with three men in it  it was a queer boat very low an flat an not like any ships boat i ever see but the two fellers at the oars pulled stiddy an pretty soon the boat was longside of us an the three men on our deck  one of em was the first mate of the other wreck an when he found out what was the matter with us he spun his yarn which was a longer one than ours his vessel was the water crescent nine hundred tons from frisco to melbourne an they had sailed about six weeks afore we did  they was about two weeks out when some of their machinery broke down an when they got it patched up it broke agin worse than afore so that they couldnt do nothin with it  they kep along under sail for about a month makin mighty poor headway till the typhoon struck em an that cleaned their decks off about as slick as it did ours but their hatches wasnt blowed off an they didnt ship no water wuth mentionin an the crew havin kep below none of em was lost  but now they was clean out of provisions an water havin been short when the breakdown happened fur they had sold all the stores they could spare to a french brig in distress that they overhauled when about a week out  when they sighted us they felt pretty sure theyd git some provisions out of us  but when i told the mate what a fix we was in his jaw dropped till his face was as long as one of andys hands howsomdever he said hed send the boat back fur as many men as it could bring over an see if they couldnt git up some of our stores even if they was soaked with salt water theyd be better than nothin part of the cargo of the water crescent was tools an things fur some railway contractors out in australier an the mate told the men to bring over some of them irons that might be used to fish out the stores  all their ships boats had been blowed away an the one they had was a kind of shore boat for fresh water that had been shipped as part of the cargo an stowed below  it couldnt stand no kind of a sea but there wasnt nothin but a swell on an when it come back it had the capn in it an five men besides a lot of chains an tools  them fellers an us worked pretty nigh the rest of the day an we got out a couple of barls of water which was all right havin been tight bunged an a lot of seabiscuit all soaked an sloppy but we only got a halfbarl of meat though three or four of the men stripped an dove fur moren an hour  we cut up some of the meat an eat it raw an the capn sent some over to the other wreck which had drifted past us to leeward an would have gone clean away from us if the capn hadnt had a line got out an made us fast to it while we was aworkin at the stores  that night the capn took us three as well as the provisions wed got out on board his hull where the commodations was considable better than they was on the halfsunk mary auguster  an afore we turned in he took me aft an had a talk with me as commandin offcer of my vessel  that wreck o yourn says he has got a vallyble cargo in it which isnt spiled by bein under water  now if you could get that cargo into port it would put a lot of money in your pocket fur the owners couldnt git out of payin you fur takin charge of it an havin it brung in  now ill tell you what ill do  ill lie by you an ive got carpenters aboard thatll put your pumps in order an ill set my men to work to pump out your vessel  an then when shes afloat all right ill go to work agin at my vesselwhich i didnt spose there was any use o doin but whilst i was huntin round amongst our cargo today i found that some of the machinery we carried might be worked up sos to take the place of what is broke in our engine  weve got a forge aboard an i believe we can make these pieces of machinery fit an git goin agin  then ill tow you into sydney an well divide the salvage money  i wont git nothin fur savin my vessel coz thats my business but you wasnt capn o yourn an took charge of her apurpose to save her which is another thing  i wasnt at all sure that i didnt take charge of the mary auguster to save myself an not the vessel but i didnt mention that an asked the capn how he expected to live all this time  oh we kin git at your stores easy enough says he when the waters pumped out  theyll be mostly spiled says i  that dont matter says he  menll eat anything when they cant git nothin else  an with that he left me to think it over  i must say young man an you kin blieve me if you know anything about sech things that the idee of a pile of money was mighty temptin to a feller like me who had a girl at home ready to marry him and who would like nothin bettern to have a little house of his own an a little vessel of his own an give up the other side of the world altogether  but while i was goin over all this in my mind an wonderin if the capn ever could git us into port along comes andy boyle an sits down beside me  it drives me pretty nigh crazy says he to think that tomorrers christmas an weve got to feed on that sloppy stuff we fished out of our stores an not much of it nuther while theres all that roast turkey an plumpuddin an mincepie afloatin out there just afore our eyes an we cant have none of it  you hadnt oughter think so much about eatin andy says ibut if i was talkin about them things i wouldnt leave out canned peaches  by george  on a hot christmas like this is goin to be id be the jolliest jack on the ocean if i could git at that canned fruit well theres a way says andy that we might git some of em  a part of the cargo of this ship is stuff far blastin rockscatridges lectric batries an that sort of thing an theres a man aboard whos goin out to take charge of em  ive been talkin to this batry man an ive made up my mind itll be easy enough to lower a little catridge down among our cargo an blow out a part of it what ud be the good of it says i blowed into chips  it might smash some says he but others would be only loosened an theyd float up to the top where we could git em specially them as was packed with pies which must be pretty light  git out andy says i with all that stuff  an he got out  but the idees hed put into my head didnt git out an as i laid on my back on the deck lookin up at the stars they sometimes seemed to put themselves into the shape of a little house with a little woman cookin at the kitchin fire an a little schooner layin at anchor just off shore  an then agin theyd hump themselves up till they looked like a lot of new tin cans with their tops off an all kinds of good things to eat inside specially canned peachesthe big white kind soft an cool each one split in half with a holler in the middle filled with juice  by george sir the very thought of a tin can like that made me beat my heels agin the deck  id been mighty hungry an had eat a lot of salt pork wet an raw an now the very idee of it even cooked turned my stomach  i looked up to the stars agin an the little house an the little schooner was clean gone an the whole sky was filled with nothin but bright new tin cans  in the mornin andy he come to me agin  have you made up your mind says he about gittin some of them good things fur christmas dinner  confound you says i you talk as if all we had to do was to go an git em  an thats what i blieve we kin do says he with the help of that batry man yes says i an blow a lot of the cargo into flinders an damage the mary auguster sos she couldnt never be took into port  an then i told him what the capn had said to me an what i was goin to do with the money  a little catridge says andy would do all we want an wouldnt hurt the vessel nuther  besides that i dont blieve what this capn says about tinkerin up his engine  taint likely hell ever git her runnin agin nor pump out the mary auguster nuther  if i was you id a durned sight ruther have a christmas dinner in hand than a house an wife in the bush  i aint thinkin o marryin a girl in australier says i  an andy he grinned an said i wouldnt marry nobody if i had to live on spiled vittles till i got her  a little arter that i went to the capn an i told him about andys idee but he was down on it  its your vessel an not mine says he an if you want to try to git a dinner out of her ill not stand in your way  but its my pinion youll just damage the ship an do nothin  howsomdever i talked to the batry man about it an he thought it could be done an not hurt the ship nuther  the men was all in favor of it fur none of em had forgot it was christmas day but tom simmons he was agin it strong fur he was thinkin hed git some of the money if we got the mary auguster into port  he was a selfishminded man was tom but it was his nater an i spose he couldnt help it  well it wasnt long afore i began to feel pretty empty an mean an if id wanted any of the prog we got out the day afore i couldnt have found much fur the men had eat it up nearly all in the night  an so i just made up my mind without any more foolin an me an andy boyle an the batry man with some catridges an a coil of wire got into the little shore boat an pulled over to the mary auguster  there we lowered a small catridge down the main hatchway an let it rest down among the cargo  then we rowed back to the steamer uncoilin the wire as we went  the batry man clumb up on deck an fixed his wire to a lectric machine which hed got all ready afore we started  andy an me didnt git out of the boat  we had too much sense fur that with all them hungry fellers waitin to jump in her  but we just pushed a little off an sot waitin with our mouths awaterin fur him to touch her off  he seemed to be a long time about it but at last he did it an that instant there was a bang on board the mary auguster that made my heart jump  andy an me pulled fur her like mad the others ahollerin arter us an we was on deck in no time  the deck was all covered with the water that had been throwed up  but i tell you sir that we poked an fished about an andy stripped an went down an swum all round an we couldnt find one floatin box of canned goods  there was a lot of splinters but where they come from we didnt know  by this time my dander was up an i just pitched around savage  that little catridge wasnt no good an i didnt intend to stand any more foolin  we just rowed back to the other wreck an i called to the batry man to come down an bring some bigger catridges with him fur if we was goin to do anything we might as well do it right  so he got down with a package of bigger ones an jumped into the boat  the capn he called out to us to be keerful an tom simmons leaned over the rail an swored but i didnt pay no tention to nuther of em an we pulled away  when i got aboard the mary auguster i says to the batry man  we dont want no nonsense this time an i want you to put in enough catridges to heave up somethin thatll do fur a christmas dinner  i dont know how the cargo is stored but you kin put one big catridge midship another forard an another aft an one or nuther of em oughter fetch up somethin  well we got the three catridges into place  they was a good deal bigger than the one we fust used an we jined em all to one wire an then we rowed back carryin the long wire with us  when we reached the steamer me an andy was agoin to stay in the boat as we did afore but the capn sung out that he wouldnt allow the batry to be touched off till we come aboard thers got to be fair play says he  its your vittles but its my side thats doin the work  after weve blasted her this time you two can go in the boat an see what there is to git hold of but two of my men must go along  so me an andy had to go on deck an two big fellers was detailed to go with us in the little boat when the time come an then the batry man he teched her off  well sir the pop that followed that tech was somethin to remember it shuck the water it shuck the air an it shuck the hull we was on a reglar cloud of smoke an flyin bits of things rose up out of the mary auguster an when that smoke cleared away an the water was all bilin with the splash of varioussized hunks that come rainin down from the sky what was left of the mary auguster was sprinkled over the sea like a wooden carpet fur waterbirds to walk on  some of the men sung out one thing an some another an i could hear tom simmons swear but andy an me said never a word but scuttled down into the boat follered close by the two men who was to go with us then we rowed like devils fur the lot of stuff that was bobbin about on the water out where the mary auguster had been  in we went among the floatin spars and ships timbers i keepin the things off with an oar the two men rowin an andy in the bow  suddenly andy give a yell an then he reached himself forard with sech a bounce that i thought hed go overboard  but up he come in a minnit his two leveninch hands gripped round a box  he sot down in the bottom of the boat with the box on his lap an his eyes screwed on some letters that was stamped on one end  pidjinpies he sings out taint turkeys nor taint cranberries but by the lord harry its christmas pies all the same  after that andy didnt do no more work but sot holdin that box as if it had been his fust baby  but we kep pushin on to see what else there was  its my pinion that the biggest part of that barks cargo was blowed into mincemeat an the most of the rest of it was so heavy that it sunk  but it wasnt all busted up an it didnt all sink  there was a big piece of wreck with a lot of boxes stove into the timbers and some of these had in em beef ready biled an packed into cans an there was other kinds of meat an difrent sorts of vegetables an one box of turtle soup  i looked at every one of em as we took em in an when we got the little boat pretty well loaded i wanted to still keep on searchin but the men they said that shore boat ud sink if we took in any more cargo an so we put back i feelin glummern i oughter felt fur i had begun to be afeared that canned fruit sech as peaches was heavy an lible to sink  as soon as we had got our boxes aboard four fresh men put out in the boat an after a while they come back with another load  an i was mighty keerful to read the names on all the boxes  some was meatpies an some was salmon an some was potted herrins an some was lobsters  but nary a thing could i see that ever had growed on a tree  well sir there was three loads brought in altogether an the christmas dinner we had on the forard deck of that steamers hull was about the jolliest one that was ever seen of a hot day aboard of a wreck in the pacific ocean  the capn kept good order an when all was ready the tops was jerked off the boxes and each man grabbed a can an opened it with his knife  when he had cleaned it out he tuk another without doin much questionin as to the bill of fare  whether anybody got pidjinpie cept andy i cant say but the way we piled in delmoniker prog would a made people open their eyes as was eatin their christmas dinners on shore that day  some of the things would a been better cooked a little more or het up but we was too fearful hungry to wait fur that an they was tiptop as they was  the capn went out afterwards an towed in a couple of barls of flour that was only part soaked through an he got some other plain prog that would do fur future use  but none of us give our minds to stuff like this arter the glorious christmas dinner that wed quarried out of the mary auguster  every man that wasnt on duty went below and turned in fur a snoozeall cept me an i didnt feel just altogether satisfied  to be sure id had an a1 dinner an though a little mixed id never eat a jollier one on any christmas that i kin look back at  but fur all that there was a hanker inside o me  i hadnt got all id laid out to git when we teched off the mary auguster  the day was blazin hot an a lot of the things id eat was pretty peppery  now thinks i if there had been just one can o peaches sech as i seen shinin in the stars last night  an just then as i was walkin aft all by myself i seed lodged on the stump of the mizzenmast a box with one corner druv down among the splinters  it was half split open an i could see the tin cans shinin through the crack  i give one jump at it an wrenched the side off  on the top of the first can i seed was a picture of a big white peach with green leaves  that box had been blowed up so high that if it had come down anywhere cept among them splinters it would a smashed itself to flinders or killed somebody  so fur as i know it was the only thing that fell nigh us an by george sir i got it  when i had finished a can of em i hunted up andy an then we went aft an eat some more well says andy as we was aeatin how dye feel now about blowin up your wife an your house an that little schooner you was goin to own  andy says i this is the joyfulest christmas ive had yit an if i was to live till twenty hundred i dont blieve id have no joyfuler with things comin in so pat so dont you throw no shadders  shadders says andy  that aint me  i leave that sort of thing fur tom simmons  shadders is cool says i an i kin go to sleep under all he throws  well sir continued old silas putting his hand on the tiller and turning his face seaward if tom simmons had kept command of that wreck we all would a laid there an waited an waited till some of us was starved an the others got nothin fur it fur the capn never mended his engine an it wasnt moren a week afore we was took off an then it was by a sailin vessel which left the hull of the water crescent behind her just as she would a had to leave the mary auguster if that jolly old christmas wreck had been there  an now sir said silas dye see that stretch o little ripples over yander lookin as if it was a lot o herrin turnin over to dry their sides  do you know what that is  thats the supper wind  that means coffee an hot cakes an a bit of briled fish an pertaters an praps if the old woman feels in a partiklar good humor some canned peachesbig white uns cut in half with a holler place in the middle filled with cool sweet juice     my well and what came out of it  early in my married life i bought a small country estate which my wife and i looked upon as a paradise  after enjoying its delight for a little more than a year our souls were saddened by the discovery that our eden contained a serpent  this was an insufficient watersupply  it had been a rainy season when we first went there and for a long time our cisterns gave us full aqueous satisfaction but early this year a drought had set in and we were obliged to be exceedingly careful of our water  it was quite natural that the scarcity of water for domestic purposes should affect my wife much more than it did me and perceiving the discontent which was growing in her mind i determined to dig a well the very next day i began to look for a welldigger  such an individual was not easy to find for in the region in which i lived wells had become unfashionable but i determined to persevere in my search and in about a week i found a welldigger  he was a man of somewhat rough exterior but of an ingratiating turn of mind  it was easy to see that it was his earnest desire to serve me  and now then said he when we had had a little conversation about terms the first thing to do is to find out where there is water have you a peachtree on the place  we walked to such a tree and he cut therefrom a forked twig  i thought said i that diviningrods were always of hazel wood  a peach twig will do quite as well said he and i have since found that he was right  diviningrods of peach will turn and find water quite as well as those of hazel or any other kind of wood  he took an end of the twig in each hand and with the point projecting in front of him he slowly walked along over the grass in my little orchard  presently the point of the twig seemed to bend itself downward toward the ground  there said he stopping you will find water here  i do not want a well here said i  this is at the bottom of a hill and my barnyard is at the top  besides it is too far from the house  very good said he  we will try somewhere else  his rod turned at several other places but i had objections to all of them  a sanitary engineer had once visited me and he had given me a great deal of advice about drainage and i knew what to avoid  we crossed the ridge of the hill into the low ground on the other side here were no buildings nothing which would interfere with the purity of a well  my welldigger walked slowly over the ground with his diviningrod  very soon he exclaimed  here is water  and picking up a stick he sharpened one end of it and drove it into the ground then he took a string from his pocket and making a loop in one end he put it over the stick  what are you going to do i asked  i am going to make a circle four feet in diameter he said  we have to dig the well as wide as that you know  but i do not want a well here said i  its too close to the wall i could not build a house over it  it would not do at all  he stood up and looked at me  well sir said he will you tell me where you would like to have a well  yes said i i would like to have it over there in the corner of the hedge  it would be near enough to the house it would have a warm exposure which will be desirable in winter and the little house which i intend to build over it would look better there than anywhere else  he took his diviningrod and went to the spot i had indicated  is this the place he asked wishing to be sure he had understood me  yes i replied  he put his twig in position and in a few seconds it turned in the direction of the ground  then he drove down a stick marked out a circle and the next day he came with two men and a derrick and began to dig my well  when they had gone down twentyfive feet they found water and when they had progressed a few feet deeper they began to be afraid of drowning  i thought they ought to go deeper but the welldigger said that they could not dig without first taking out the water and that the water came in as fast as they bailed it out and he asked me to put it to myself and tell him how they could dig it deeper  i put the question to myself but could find no answer  i also laid the matter before some specialists and it was generally agreed that if water came in as fast as it was taken out nothing more could be desired  the well was therefore pronounced deep enough  it was lined with great tiles nearly a yard in diameter and my welldigger after congratulating me on finding water so easily bade me goodby and departed with his men and his derrick  on the other side of the wall which bounded my grounds and near which my well had been dug there ran a country lane leading nowhere in particular which seemed to be there for the purpose of allowing people to pass my house who might otherwise be obliged to stop  along this lane my neighbors would pass and often strangers drove by and as my well could easily be seen over the low stone wall its construction had excited a great deal of interest  some of the people who drove by were summer folks from the city and i am sure from remarks i overheard that it was thought a very queer thing to dig for water  of course they must have known that people used to do this in the olden times even as far back as the time of jacob and rebecca but the expressions of some of their faces indicated that they remembered that this was the nineteenth century  my neighbors however were all rural people and much more intelligent in regard to watersupplies  one of them phineas colwell by name took a more lively interest in my operations than did any one else  he was a man of about fifty years of age who had been a soldier  this fact was kept alive in the minds of his associates by his dress a part of which was always military  if he did not wear an old fatiguejacket with brass buttons he wore his blue trousers or perhaps a waistcoat that belonged to his uniform and if he wore none of these his military hat would appear upon his head  i think he must also have been a sailor judging from the little gold rings in his ears  but when i first knew him he was a carpenter who did masonwork whenever any of the neighbors had any jobs of the sort  he also worked in gardens by the day and had told me that he understood the care of horses and was a very good driver  he sometimes worked on farms especially at harvesttime and i know he could paint for he once showed me a fence which he said he had painted  i frequently saw him because he always seemed to be either going to his work or coming from it  in fact he appeared to consider actual labor in the light of a bad habit which he wished to conceal and which he was continually endeavoring to reform  phineas walked along our lane at least once a day and whenever he saw me he told me something about the well  he did not approve of the place i had selected for it  if he had been digging a well he would have put it in a very different place  when i had talked with him for some time and explained why i had chosen this spot he would say that perhaps i was right and begin to talk of something else  but the next time i saw him he would again assert that if he had been digging that well he would not have put it there  about a quarter of a mile from my house at a turn of the lane lived mrs betty perch  she was a widow with about twelve children  a few of these were her own and the others she had inherited from two sisters who had married and died and whose husbands having proved their disloyalty by marrying again were not allowed by the indignant mrs perch to resume possession of their offspring  the casual observer might have supposed the number of these children to be very greatfifteen or perhaps even twentyfor if he happened to see a group of them on the doorstep he would see a lot more if he looked into the little garden and under some cedartrees at the back of the house there were always some of them on fine days  but perhaps they sought to increase their apparent number and ran from one place to another to be ready to meet observation like the famous clown grimaldi who used to go through his performances at one london theatre and then dash off in his paint and motley to another so that perambulating theatregoing men might imagine that there were two greatest clowns in the world  when mrs perch had time she sewed for the neighbors and whether she had time or not she was always ready to supply them with news  from the moment she heard i was going to dig a well she took a vital interest in it  her own watersupply was unsatisfactory as she depended upon a little spring which sometimes dried up in summer and should my well turn out to be a good one she knew i would not object to her sending the children for pails of water on occasions  it will be fun for them she said and if your water really is good it will often come in very well for me  mr colwell tells me she continued that you put your well in the wrong place  he is a practical man and knows all about wells and i do hope that for your sake he may be wrong  my neighbors were generally pessimists  country people are proverbially prudent and pessimism is prudence  we feel safe when we doubt the success of another because if he should succeed we can say we were glad we were mistaken and so step from a position of good judgment to one of generous disposition without feeling that we have changed our plane of merit  but the optimist often gets himself into terrible scrapes for if he is wrong he cannot say he is glad of it  but whatever else he may be a pessimist is depressing and it was therefore a great pleasure to me to have a friend who was an outandout optimist  in fact he might be called a working optimist he lived about six miles from my house and had a hobby which was natural phenomena  he was always on the lookout for that sort of thing and when he found it he would study its nature and effect  he was a man in the maturity of youth and if the estate on which he lived had not belonged to his mother he would have spent much time and money in investigating its natural phenomena  he often drove over to see me and always told me how glad he would be if he had an opportunity of digging a well  i have the wildest desire he said to know what is in the earth under our place and if it should so happen in the course of time that the limits of earthly existence should be reached byi mean if the estate should come into my handsi would go down down down until i had found out all that could be discovered  to own a plug of earth four thousand miles long and only to know what is on the surface of the upper end of it is unmanly  we might as well be grazing beasts  he was sorry that i was digging only for water because water is a very commonplace thing but he was quite sure i would get it and when my well was finished he was one of the first to congratulate me  but if i had been in your place said he with full right to do as i pleased i would not have let those men go away  i would have set them to work in some place where there would be no danger of getting waterat least for a long timeand then you would have found out what are the deeper treasures of your land  having finished my well i now set about getting the water into my residence near by  i built a house over the well and put in it a little engine and by means of a system of pipes like the arteries and veins of the human body i proposed to distribute the water to the various desirable points in my house  the engine was the heart which should start the circulation which should keep it going and which should send throbbing through every pipe the water which if it were not our life was very necessary to it  when all was ready we started the engine and in a very short time we discovered that something was wrong  for fifteen or twenty minutes water flowed into the tank at the top of the house with a sound that was grander in the ears of my wife and myself than the roar of niagara and then it stopped  investigation proved that the flow had stopped because there was no more water in the well  it is needless to detail the examinations investigations and the multitude of counsels and opinions with which our minds were filled for the next few days  it was plain to see that although this well was fully able to meet the demands of a handpump or of bailing buckets the water did not flow into it as fast as it could be pumped out by an engine  therefore for the purposes of supplying the circulation of my domestic water system the well was declared a failure  my nonsuccess was much talked about in the neighborhood and we received a great deal of sympathy and condolence  phineas colwell was not surprised at the outcome of the affair  he had said that the well had been put in the wrong place  mrs betty was not only surprised but disgusted  it is all very well for you she said who could afford to buy water if it was necessary but it is very different with the widow and the orphan  if i had not supposed you were going to have a real well i would have had my spring cleaned out and deepened  i could have had it done in the early summer but it is of no use now  the spring has dried up  she told a neighbor that she believed the digging of my well had dried up her spring and that that was the way of this world where the widow and the orphan were sure to come out at the little end  of course i did not submit to defeatat least not without a struggle i had a well and if anything could be done to make that well supply me with water i was going to do it  i consulted specialists and after careful consideration of the matter they agreed that it would be unadvisable for me to attempt to deepen my present well as there was reason to suppose there was very little water in the place where i had dug it and that the very best thing i could do would be to try a driven well  as i had already excavated about thirty feet that was so much gain to me and if i should have a sixinch pipe put into my present well and then driven down and down until it came to a place where there was plenty of water i would have all i wanted  how far down the pipe would have to be driven of course they did not know but they all agreed that if i drove deep enough i would get all the water i wanted  this was the only kind of a well they said which one could sink as deep as he pleased without being interfered with by the water at the bottom  my wife and i then considered the matter and ultimately decided that it would be a waste of the money which we had already spent upon the engine the pipes and the little house and as there was nothing else to be done but to drive a well we would have a well driven  of course we were both very sorry that the work must be begun again but i was especially dissatisfied for the weather was getting cold there was already snow upon the ground and i was told that work could not be carried on in winter weather  i lost no time however in making a contract with a welldriver who assured me that as soon as the working season should open which probably would be very early in the spring he would come to my place and begin to drive my well  the season did open and so did the peablossoms and the pods actually began to fill before i saw that welldriver again  i had had a good deal of correspondence with him in the meantime urging him to prompt action but he always had some good reason for delay  i found out afterwards that he was busy fulfilling a contract made before mine in which he promised to drive a well as soon as the season should open  at lastit was early in the summerhe came with his derricks a steamengine a triphammer and a lot of men  they took off the roof of my house removed the engine and set to work  for many a long day and i am sorry to say for many a longer night that triphammer hammered and banged  on the next day after the nightwork began one of my neighbors came to me to know what they did that for  i told him they were anxious to get through  get through what said he  the earth  if they do that and your sixinch pipe comes out in a chinamans back yard he will sue you for damages  when the pipe had been driven through the soft stratum under the old well and began to reach firmer ground the pounding and shaking of the earth became worse and worse  my wife was obliged to leave home with our child  if he is to do without both water and sleep said she he cannot long survive  and i agreed with her  she departed for a pleasant summer resort where her married sister with her child was staying and from week to week i received very pleasant letters from her telling me of the charms of the place and dwelling particularly upon the abundance of cool spring water with which the house was supplied  while this terrible pounding was going on i heard various reports of its effect upon my neighbors  one of them an agriculturist with whom i had always been on the best of terms came with a clouded brow  when i first felt those shakes he said i thought they were the effects of seismic disturbances and i did not mind but when i found it was your well i thought i ought to come over to speak about it  i do not object to the shaking of my barn because my man tells me the continual jolting is thrashing out the oats and wheat but i do not like to have all my apples and pears shaken off my trees  and then said he i have a late brood of chickens and they cannot walk because every time they try to make a step they are jolted into the air about a foot  and again we have had to give up having soup  we like soup but we do not care to have it spout up like a fountain whenever that hammer comes down  i was grieved to trouble this friend and i asked him what i should do do you want me to stop the work on the well said i  oh no said he heartily  go on with the work  you must have water and we will try to stand the bumping  i dare say it is good for dyspepsia and the cows are getting used to having the grass jammed up against their noses  go ahead we can stand it in the daytime but if you could stop the nightwork we would be very glad  some people may think it a wellspring of pleasure to be bounced out of bed but i dont  mrs perch came to me with a face like a squeezed lemon and asked me if i could lend her five nails  what sort said i  the kind you nail clapboards on with said she  there is one of them been shook entirely off my house by your well  i am in hopes that before the rest are all shook off i shall get in some money that is owing me and can afford to buy nails for myself  i stopped the nightwork but this was all i could do for these neighbors  my optimist friend was delighted when he heard of my driven well  he lived so far away that he and his mother were not disturbed by the jarring of the ground  now he was sure that some of the internal secrets of the earth would be laid bare and he rode or drove over every day to see what we were getting out of the well  i know that he was afraid we would soon get water but was too kindhearted to say so  one day the pipe refused to go deeper  no matter how hard it was struck it bounced up again  when some of the substance it had struck was brought up it looked like french chalk and my optimist eagerly examined it  a frenchchalk mine said he would not be a bad thing but i hoped that you had struck a bed of mineral guttapercha  that would be a grand find  but the chalkbed was at last passed and we began again to bring up nothing but common earth  i suppose said my optimist to me one morning that you must soon come to water and if you do i hope it will be hot water  hot water i exclaimed  i do not want that  oh yes you would if you had thought about it as much as i have he replied  i lay awake for hours last night thinking what would happen if you struck hot water  in the first place it would be absolutely pure because even if it were possible for germs and bacilli to get down so deep they would be boiled before you got them and then you could cool that water for drinking  when fresh it would be already heated for cooking and hot baths  and thenjust think of ityou could introduce the hotwater system of heating into your house and there would be the hot water always ready  but the great thing would be your garden  think of the refuse hot water circulating in pipes up and down and under all your beds  that garden would bloom in the winter as others do in the summer at least you could begin to have limabeans and tomatoes as soon as the frost was out of the air  i laughed  it would take a lot of pumping i said to do all that with the hot water  oh i forgot to say he cried with sparkling eyes that i do not believe you would ever have any more pumping to do  you have now gone down so far that i am sure whatever you find will force itself up  it will spout high into the air or through all your pipes and run always  phineas colwell was by when this was said and he must have gone down to mrs betty perchs house to talk it over with her for in the afternoon she came to see me  i understand said she that you are trying to get hot water out of your well and that there is likely to be a lot more than you need so that it will run down by the side of the road  i just want to say that if a stream of hot water comes down past my house some of the children will be bound to get into it and be scalded to death and i came to say that if that well is going to squirt biling water id like to have notice so that i can move though where a widow with so many orphans is going to move to nobody knows  mr colwell says that if you had got him to tell you where to put that well there would have been no danger of this sort of thing  the next day the optimist came to me his face fairly blazing with a new idea  i rode over on purpose to urge you he cried if you should strike hot water not to stop there  go on and by george you may strike fire  heavens i cried  oh quite the opposite said he  but do not let us joke  i think that would be the grandest thing of this age  think of a fire well with the flames shooting up perhaps a hundred feet into the air  i wish phineas colwell had not been there  as it was he turned pale and sat down on the wall  you look astonished exclaimed the optimist but listen to me  you have not thought of this thing as i have  if you should strike fire your fortune would be made  by a system of reflectors you could light up the whole country  by means of tiles and pipes this region could be made tropical  you could warm all the houses in the neighborhood with hot air  and then the power you could generatejust think of it heat is power the cost of power is the fuel  you could furnish power to all who wanted it  you could fill this region with industries  my dear sir you must excuse my agitation but if you should strike fire there is no limit to the possibilities of achievement  but i want water said i  fire would not take the place of that  oh water is a trifle said he  you could have pipes laid from town it is only about two miles  but fire  nobody has yet gone down deep enough for that  you have your future in your hands  as i did not care to connect my future with fire this idea did not strike me very forcibly but it struck phineas colwell  he did not say anything to me but after i had gone he went to the welldrivers  if you feel them pipes getting hot he said to them i warn you to stop  i have been in countries where there are volcanoes and i know what they are  theres enough of them in this world and theres no need of making new ones  in the afternoon a wagoner who happened to be passing brought me a note from mrs perch very badly spelled asking if i would let one of my men bring her a pail of water for she could not think of coming herself or letting any of the children come near my place if spouting fires were expected  the welldriving had gone on and on with intermissions on account of sickness in the families of the various workmen until it had reached the limit which i had fixed and we had not found water in sufficient quantity hot or cold nor had we struck fire or anything else worth having  the welldrivers and some specialists were of the opinion that if i were to go ten twenty or perhaps a hundred feet deeper i would be very likely to get all the water i wanted  but of course they could not tell how deep they must go for some wells were over a thousand feet deep  i shook my head at this  there seemed to be only one thing certain about this drilling business and that was the expense  i declined to go any deeper  i think a facetious neighbor said to me it would be cheaper for you to buy a lot of apollinaris waterat wholesale rates of courseand let your men open so many bottles a day and empty them into your tank  you would find that would pay better in the long run  phineas colwell told me that when he had informed mrs perch that i was going to stop operations she was in a dreadful state of mind  after all she had undergone she said it was simply cruel to think of my stopping before i got water and that after having dried up her spring  this is what phineas said she said but when next i met her she told me that he had declared that if i had put the well where he thought it ought to be i should have been having all the water i wanted before now  my optimist was dreadfully cast down when he heard that i would drive no deeper  i have been afraid of this he said  i have been afraid of it and if circumstances had so arranged themselves that i should have command of money i should have been glad to assume the expense of deeper explorations  i have been thinking a great deal about the matter and i feel quite sure that even if you did not get water or anything else that might prove of value to you it would be a great advantage to have a pipe sunk into the earth to the depth of say one thousand feet  what possible advantage could that be i asked  i will tell you he said  you would then have one of the grandest opportunities ever offered to man of constructing a gravityengine this would be an engine which would be of no expense at all to run  it would need no fuel  gravity would be the power  it would work a pump splendidly  you could start it when you liked and stop it when you liked  pump said i  what is the good of a pump without water  oh of course you would have to have water he answered  but no matter how you get it you will have to pump it up to your tank so as to make it circulate over your house  now my gravitypump would do this beautifully  you see the pump would be arranged with cogwheels and all that sort of thing and the power would be supplied by a weight which would be a cylinder of lead or iron fastened to a rope and run down inside your pipe  just think of it  it would run down a thousand feet and where is there anything worked by weight that has such a fall as that  i laughed  that is all very well said i  but how about the power required to wind that weight up again when it got to the bottom  i should have to have an engine to do that  oh no said he  i have planned the thing better than that  you see the greater the weight the greater the power and the velocity now if you take a solid cylinder of lead about four inches in diameter so that it would slip easily down your pipeyou might grease it for that matterand twenty feet in length it would be an enormous weight and in slowly descending for about an hour a dayfor that would be long enough for your pumpingand going down a thousand feet it would run your engine for a year  now then at the end of the year you could not expect to haul that weight up again  you would have a trigger arrangement which would detach it from the rope when it got to the bottom  then you would wind up your ropea man could do that in a short timeand you would attach another cylinder of lead and that would run your engine for another year minus a few days because it would only go down nine hundred and eighty feet  the next year you would put on another cylinder and so on  i have not worked out the figures exactly but i think that in this way your engine would run for thirty years before the pipe became entirely filled with cylinders  that would be probably as long as you would care to have water forced into the house  yes said i i think that is likely  he saw that his scheme did not strike me favorably  suddenly a light flashed across his face  i tell you what you can do with your pipe he said just as it is you can set up a clock over it which would run for forty years without winding  i smiled and he turned sadly away to his horse but he had not ridden ten yards before he came back and called to me over the wall  if the earth at the bottom of your pipe should ever yield to pressure and give way and if water or gas oranything should be squirted out of it i beg you will let me know as soon as possible  i promised to do so  when the pounding was at an end my wife and child came home  but the season continued dry and even their presence could not counteract the feeling of aridity which seemed to permeate everything which belonged to us material or immaterial  we had a great deal of commiseration from our neighbors  i think even mrs betty perch began to pity us a little for her spring had begun to trickle again in a small way and she sent word to me that if we were really in need of water she would be willing to divide with us  phineas colwell was sorry for us of course but he could not help feeling and saying that if i had consulted him the misfortune would have been prevented  it was late in the summer when my wife returned and when she made her first visit of inspection to the grounds and gardens her eyes of course fell upon the unfinished well  she was shocked  i never saw such a scene of wreckage she said  it looks like a western town after a cyclone  i think the best thing you can do is to have this dreadful litter cleared up the ground smoothed and raked the wall mended and the roof put back on that little house and then if we can make anybody believe it is an icehouse so much the better  this was good advice and i sent for a man to put the vicinity of the well in order and give it the air of neatness which characterizes the rest of our home  the man who came was named mr barnet  he was a contemplative fellow with a pipe in his mouth  after having worked at the place for half a day he sent for me and said  ill tell you what i would do if i was in your place  id put that pumphouse in order and id set up the engine and put the pump down into that thirtyfoot well you first dug and id pump water into my house  i looked at him in amazement  theres lots of water in that well he continued and if theres that much now in this drought you will surely have ever so much more when the weather isnt so dry  i have measured the water and i know  i could not understand him  it seemed to me that he was talking wildly  he filled his pipe and lighted it and sat upon the wall  now said he after he had taken a few puffs ill tell you where the troubles been with your well  people are always in too big a hurry in this world about all sorts of things as well as wells  i am a welldigger and i know all about them  we know if there is any water in the ground it will always find its way to the deepest hole there is and we dig a well so as to give it a deep hole to go to in the place where we want it  but you cant expect the water to come to that hole just the very day its finished  of course you will get some because its right there in the neighborhood but there is always a lot more that will come if you give it time  its got to make little channels and passages for itself and of course it takes time to do that  its like settling up a new country  only a few pioneers come at first and you have to wait for the population to flow in  this being a dry season and the water in the ground a little sluggish on that account it was a good while finding out where your well was  if i had happened along when you was talking about a well i think i should have said to you that i knew a proverb which would about fit your case and that is let well enough alone  i felt like taking this good man by the hand but i did not  i only told him to go ahead and do everything that was proper  the next morning as i was going to the well i saw phineas colwell coming down the lane and mrs betty perch coming up it  i did not wish them to question me so i stepped behind some bushes  when they met they stopped  upon my word exclaimed mrs betty if he isnt going to work again on that everlasting well  if hes got so much money he dont know what to do with it i could tell him that theres people in this world and not far away either who would be the better for some of it  its a sin and a shame and an abomination  do you believe mr colwell that there is the least chance in the world of his ever getting water enough out of that well to shave himself with  mrs perch said phineas it aint no use talking about that well it aint no use and it never can be no use because its in the wrong place  if he ever pumps water out of that well into his house ill do  what will you do asked mr barnet who just then appeared from the recesses of the enginehouse  ill do anything on this earth that you choose to name said phineas i am safe whatever it is  well then said mr barnet knocking the ashes from his pipe preparatory to filling it again will you marry mrs perch  phineas laughed  yes he said  i promised i would do anything and ill promise that  a slim chance for me said mrs betty even if id have you  and she marched on with her nose in the air  when mr barnet got fairly to work with his derrick his men and his buckets he found that there was a good deal more to do than he had expected  the welldrivers had injured the original well by breaking some of the tiles which lined it and these had to be taken out and others put in and in the course of this work other improvements suggested themselves and were made  several times operations were delayed by sickness in the family of mr barnet and also in the families of his workmen but still the work went on in a very fair manner although much more slowly than had been supposed by any one but in the course of timei will not say how much timethe work was finished the engine was in its place and it pumped water into my house and every day since then it has pumped all the water we need pure cold and delicious  knowing the promise phineas colwell had made and feeling desirous of having everything which concerned my well settled and finished i went to look for him to remind him of his duty toward mrs perch but i could not find that naval and military mechanical agriculturist  he had gone away to take a job or a contracti could not discover whichand he has not since appeared in our neighborhood  mrs perch is very severe on me about this  theres plenty of bad things come out of that well she said but i never thought anything bad enough would come out of it to make mr colwell go away and leave me to keep on being a widow with all them orphans     mr tolman  mr tolman was a gentleman whose apparent age was of a varying character  at times when deep in thought on business matters or other affairs one might have thought him fiftyfive or fiftyseven or even sixty  ordinarily however when things were running along in a satisfactory and commonplace way he appeared to be about fifty years old while upon some extraordinary occasions when the world assumed an unusually attractive aspect his age seemed to run down to fortyfive or less  he was the head of a business firm  in fact he was the only member of it  the firm was known as pusey and co  but pusey had long been dead and the co of which mr tolman had been a member was dissolved our elderly hero having bought out the business firmname and all for many years had carried it on with success and profit  his countinghouse was a small and quiet place but a great deal of money had been made in it  mr tolman was richvery rich indeed  and yet as he sat in his countingroom one winter evening he looked his oldest  he had on his hat and his overcoat his gloves and his fur collar  every one else in the establishment had gone home and he with the keys in his hand was ready to lock up and leave also  he often stayed later than any one else and left the keys with mr canterfield the head clerk as he passed his house on his way home  mr tolman seemed in no hurry to go  he simply sat and thought and increased his apparent age  the truth was he did not want to go home he was tired of going home  this was not because his home was not a pleasant one  no single gentleman in the city had a handsomer or more comfortable suite of rooms  it was not because he felt lonely or regretted that a wife and children did not brighten and enliven his home  he was perfectly satisfied to be a bachelor  the conditions suited him exactly  but in spite of all this he was tired of going home  i wish said mr tolman to himself that i could feel some interest in going home  then he rose and took a turn or two up and down the room  but as that did not seem to give him any more interest in the matter he sat down again  i wish it were necessary for me to go home said he but it isnt  so then he fell again to thinking what i need he said after a while is to depend more upon myselfto feel that i am necessary to myself  just now im not  ill stop going homeat least in this way  wheres the sense in envying other men when i can have all that they have just as well as not  and ill have it too said mr tolman as he went out and locked the doors  once in the streets and walking rapidly his ideas shaped themselves easily and readily into a plan which by the time he reached the house of his head clerk was quite matured  mr canterfield was just going down to dinner as his employer rang the bell so he opened the door himself  i will detain you but a minute or two said mr tolman handing the keys to mr canterfield  shall we step into the parlor  when his employer had gone and mr canterfield had joined his family at the dinnertable his wife immediately asked him what mr tolman wanted  only to say that he is going away tomorrow and that i am to attend to the business and send his personal letters to  naming a city not a hundred miles away  how long is he going to stay  he didnt say answered mr canterfield  ill tell you what he ought to do said the lady  he ought to make you a partner in the firm and then he could go away and stay as long as he pleased  he can do that now returned her husband  he has made a good many trips since i have been with him and things have gone on very much in the same way as when he is here  he knows that  but still youd like to be a partner  oh yes said mr canterfield  and common gratitude ought to prompt him to make you one said his wife  mr tolman went home and wrote a will  he left all his property with the exception of a few legacies to the richest and most powerful charitable organization in the country  people will think i am crazy said he to himself and if i should die while i am carrying out my plan i will leave the task of defending my sanity to people who are able to make a good fight for me  and before he went to bed his will was signed and witnessed  the next day he packed a trunk and left for the neighboring city  his apartments were to be kept in readiness for his return at any time  if you had seen him walking over to the railroad depot you would have taken him for a man of fortyfive  when he arrived at his destination mr tolman established himself temporarily at a hotel and spent the next three or four days in walking about the city looking for what he wanted  what he wanted was rather difficult to define but the way in which he put the matter to himself was something like this  i would like to find a snug little place where i can live and carry on some business which i can attend to myself and which will bring me into contact with people of all sortspeople who will interest me  it must be a small business because i dont want to have to work very hard and it must be snug and comfortable because i want to enjoy it i would like a shop of some sort because that brings a man face to face with his fellowcreatures  the city in which he was walking about was one of the best places in the country in which to find the place of business he desired  it was full of independent little shops  but mr tolman could not readily find one which resembled his ideal  a small drygoods establishment seemed to presuppose a female proprietor  a grocery store would give him many interesting customers but he did not know much about groceries and the business did not appear to him to possess any aesthetic features  he was much pleased by a small shop belonging to a taxidermist  it was exceedingly cosey and the business was probably not so great as to overwork any one  he might send the birds and beasts which were brought to be stuffed to some practical operator and have him put them in proper condition for the customers  he might  but no  it would be very unsatisfactory to engage in a business of which he knew absolutely nothing  a taxidermist ought not to blush with ignorance when asked some simple question about a little dead bird or a defunct fish  and so he tore himself from the window of this fascinating place where he fancied had his education been differently managed he could in time have shown the world the spectacle of a cheerful and unblighted mr venus  the shop which at last appeared to suit him best was one which he had passed and looked at several times before it struck him favorably  it was in a small brick house in a side street but not far from one of the main business avenues of the city  the shop seemed devoted to articles of stationery and small notions of various kinds not easy to be classified  he had stopped to look at three penknives fastened to a card which was propped up in the little showwindow supported on one side by a chessboard with history of asia in gilt letters on the back and on the other by a small violin labelled 1 dollar  and as he gazed past these articles into the interior of the shop which was now lighted up it gradually dawned upon him that it was something like his ideal of an attractive and interesting business place  at any rate he would go in and look at it  he did not care for a violin even at the low price marked on the one in the window but a new pocketknife might be useful  so he walked in and asked to look at pocketknives  the shop was in charge of a very pleasant old lady of about sixty who sat sewing behind the little counter  while she went to the window and very carefully reached over the articles displayed therein to get the card of penknives mr tolman looked about him  the shop was quite small but there seemed to be a good deal in it  there were shelves behind the counter and there were shelves on the opposite wall and they all seemed well filled with something or other  in the corner near the old ladys chair was a little coal stove with a bright fire in it and at the back of the shop at the top of two steps was a glass door partly open through which he saw a small room with a red carpet on the floor and a little table apparently set for a meal  mr tolman looked at the knives when the old lady showed them to him and after a good deal of consideration he selected one which he thought would be a good knife to give to a boy  then he looked over some things in the way of papercutters whistmarkers and such small matters which were in a glass case on the counter  and while he looked at them he talked to the old lady  she was a friendly sociable body very glad to have any one to talk to and so it was not at all difficult for mr tolman by some general remarks to draw from her a great many points about herself and her shop  she was a widow with a son who from her remarks must have been forty years old  he was connected with a mercantile establishment and they had lived here for a long time  while her son was a salesman and came home every evening this was very pleasant but after he became a commercial traveller and was away from the city for months at a time she did not like it at all  it was very lonely for her  mr tolmans heart rose within him but he did not interrupt her  if i could do it said she i would give up this place and go and live with my sister in the country  it would be better for both of us and henry could come there just as well as here when he gets back from his trips  why dont you sell out asked mr tolman a little fearfully for he began to think that all this was too easy sailing to be entirely safe  that would not be easy said she with a smile  it might be a long time before we could find any one who would want to take the place  we have a fair trade in the store but it isnt what it used to be when times were better  and the library is falling off too  most of the books are getting pretty old and it dont pay to spend much money for new ones now  the library said mr tolman  have you a library  oh yes replied the old lady  ive had a circulating library here for nearly fifteen years  there it is on those two upper shelves behind you  mr tolman turned and beheld two long rows of books in brownpaper covers with a short stepladder standing near the door of the inner room by which these shelves might be reached  this pleased him greatly  he had had no idea that there was a library here  i declare said he  it must be very pleasant to manage a circulating librarya small one like this i mean  i shouldnt mind going into a business of the kind myself  the old lady looked up surprised  did he wish to go into business she had not supposed that just from looking at him  mr tolman explained his views to her  he did not tell what he had been doing in the way of business or what mr canterfield was doing for him now  he merely stated his present wishes and acknowledged to her that it was the attractiveness of her establishment that had led him to come in  then you do not want the penknife she said quickly  oh yes i do said he  and i really believe if we can come to terms that i would like the two other knives together with the rest of your stock in trade  the old lady laughed a little nervously  she hoped very much indeed that they could come to terms  she brought a chair from the back room and mr tolman sat down with her by the stove to talk it over  few customers came in to interrupt them and they talked the matter over very thoroughly  they both came to the conclusion that there would be no difficulty about terms nor about mr tolmans ability to carry on the business after a very little instruction from the present proprietress  when mr tolman left it was with the understanding that he was to call again in a couple of days when the son henry would be at home and matters could be definitely arranged  when the three met the bargain was soon struck  as each party was so desirous of making it few difficulties were interposed  the old lady indeed was in favor of some delay in the transfer of the establishment as she would like to clean and dust every shelf and corner and every article in the place  but mr tolman was in a hurry to take possession and as the son henry would have to start off on another trip in a short time he wanted to see his mother moved and settled before he left  there was not much to move but trunks and bandboxes and some antiquated pieces of furniture of special value to the old lady for mr tolman insisted on buying everything in the house just as it stood  the whole thing did not cost him he said to himself as much as some of his acquaintances would pay for a horse the methodical son henry took an account of stock and mr tolman took several lessons from the old lady in which she explained to him how to find out the selling prices of the various articles from the marks on the little tags attached to them  and she particularly instructed him in the management of the circulating library  she informed him of the character of the books and as far as possible of the character of the regular patrons  she told him whom he might trust to take out a book without paying for the one brought in if they didnt happen to have the change with them and she indicated with little crosses opposite their names those persons who should be required to pay cash down for what they had had before receiving further benefits  it was astonishing to see what interest mr tolman took in all this he was really anxious to meet some of the people about whom the old lady discoursed  he tried too to remember a few of the many things she told him of her methods of buying and selling and the general management of her shop and he probably did not forget more than three fourths of what she told him  finally everything was settled to the satisfaction of the two male parties to the bargainalthough the old lady thought of a hundred things she would yet like to doand one fine frosty afternoon a cartload of furniture and baggage left the door the old lady and her son took leave of the old place and mr tolman was left sitting behind the little counter the sole manager and proprietor of a circulating library and a stationery and notion shop  he laughed when he thought of it but he rubbed his hands and felt very well satisfied  there is nothing really crazy about it he said to himself  if there is a thing that i think i would like and i can afford to have it and theres no harm in it why not have it  there was nobody there to say anything against this so mr tolman rubbed his hands again before the fire and rose to walk up and down his shop and wonder who would be his first customer  in the course of twenty minutes a little boy opened the door and came in  mr tolman hastened behind the counter to receive his commands the little boy wanted two sheets of notepaper and an envelope  any particular kind asked mr tolman  the boy didnt know of any particular variety being desired  he thought the same kind she always got would do  and he looked very hard at mr tolman evidently wondering at the change in the shopkeeper but asking no questions  you are a regular customer i suppose said mr tolman opening several boxes of paper which he had taken down from the shelves  i have just begun business here and dont know what kind of paper you have been in the habit of buying  but i suppose this will do  and he took out a couple of sheets of the best with an envelope to match these he carefully tied up in a piece of thin brown paper and gave to the boy who handed him three cents  mr tolman took them smiled and then having made a rapid calculation he called to the boy who was just opening the door and gave him back one cent  you have paid me too much he said  the boy took the cent looked at mr tolman and then got out of the store as quickly as he could  such profits as that are enormous said mr tolman but i suppose the small sales balance them  this mr tolman subsequently found to be the case  one or two other customers came in in the course of the afternoon and about dark the people who took out books began to arrive  these kept mr tolman very busy  he not only had to do a good deal of entering and cancelling but he had to answer a great many questions about the change in proprietorship and the probability of his getting in some new books with suggestions as to the quantity and character of these mingled with a few dissatisfied remarks in regard to the volumes already on hand  every one seemed sorry that the old lady had gone away  but mr tolman was so pleasant and anxious to please and took such an interest in their selection of books that only one of the subscribers appeared to take the change very much to heart  this was a young man who was fortythree cents in arrears  he was a long time selecting a book and when at last he brought it to mr tolman to be entered he told him in a low voice that he hoped there would be no objection to letting his account run on for a little while longer  on the first of the month he would settle it and then he hoped to be able to pay cash whenever he brought in a book  mr tolman looked for his name on the old ladys list and finding no cross against it told him that it was all right and that the first of the month would do very well  the young man went away perfectly satisfied with the new librarian  thus did mr tolman begin to build up his popularity  as the evening grew on he found himself becoming very hungry  but he did not like to shut up the shop for every now and then some one dropped in sometimes to ask what time it was and sometimes to make a little purchase while there were still some library patrons coming in at intervals  however taking courage during a short rest from customers he put up the shutters locked the door and hurried off to a hotel where he partook of a meal such as few keepers of little shops ever think of indulging in  the next morning mr tolman got his own breakfast  this was delightful  he had seen how cosily the old lady had spread her table in the little back room where there was a stove suitable for any cooking he might wish to indulge in and he longed for such a cosey meal  there were plenty of stock provisions in the house which he had purchased with the rest of the goods and he went out and bought himself a fresh loaf of bread  then he broiled a piece of ham made some good strong tea boiled some eggs and had a breakfast on the little round table which though plain enough he enjoyed more than any breakfast at his club which he could remember  he had opened the shop and sat facing the glass door hoping almost that there would be some interruption to his meal  it would seem so much more proper in that sort of business if he had to get up and go attend to a customer  before the evening of that day mr tolman became convinced that he would soon be obliged to employ a boy or some one to attend to the establishment during his absence  after breakfast a woman recommended by the old lady came to make his bed and clean up generally but when she had gone he was left alone with his shop  he determined not to allow this responsibility to injure his health and so at one oclock boldly locked the shop door and went out to his lunch  he hoped that no one would call during his absence but when he returned he found a little girl with a pitcher standing at the door  she came to borrow half a pint of milk  milk exclaimed mr tolman in surprise  why my child i have no milk  i dont even use it in my tea  the little girl looked very much disappointed  is mrs walker gone away for good said she  yes replied mr tolman  but i would be just as willing to lend you the milk as she would be if i had any  is there any place near here where you can buy milk  oh yes said the girl  you can get it round in the markethouse  how much would half a pint cost he asked  three cents replied the girl  well then said mr tolman here are three cents  you can go and buy the milk for me and then you can borrow it  will that suit  the girl thought it would suit very well and away she went  even this little incident pleased mr tolman  it was so very novel when he came back from his dinner in the evening he found two circulating library subscribers stamping their feet on the doorstep and he afterwards heard that several others had called and gone away it would certainly injure the library if he suspended business at mealtimes  he could easily have his choice of a hundred boys if he chose to advertise for one but he shrank from having a youngster in the place  it would interfere greatly with his cosiness and his experiences  he might possibly find a boy who went to school and who would be willing to come at noon and in the evening if he were paid enough  but it would have to be a very steady and responsible boy  he would think it over before taking any steps  he thought it over for a day or two but he did not spend his whole time in doing so  when he had no customers he sauntered about in the little parlor over the shop with its odd old furniture its quaint prints on the walls and its absurd ornaments on the mantelpiece  the other little rooms seemed almost as funny to him and he was sorry when the bell on the shop door called him down from their contemplation  it was pleasant to him to think that he owned all these odd things  the ownership of the varied goods in the shop also gave him an agreeable feeling which none of his other possessions had ever afforded him  it was all so odd and novel  he liked much to look over the books in the library  many of them were old novels the names of which were familiar enough to him but which he had never read  he determined to read some of them as soon as he felt fixed and settled  in looking over the book in which the names and accounts of the subscribers were entered he amused himself by wondering what sort of persons they were who had out certain books  who for instance wanted to read the book of cats and who could possibly care for the mysteries of udolpho  but the unknown person in regard to whom mr tolman felt the greatest curiosity was the subscriber who now had in his possession a volume entitled dormstocks logarithms of the diapason  how on earth exclaimed mr tolman did such a book get into this library  and where on earth did the person spring from who would want to take it out  and not only want to take it he continued as he examined the entry regarding the volume but come and have it renewed one two three fournine times  he has had that book for eighteen weeks  without exactly making up his mind to do so mr tolman deferred taking steps toward getting an assistant until p  glascow the person in question should make an appearance and it was nearly time for the book to be brought in again  if i get a boy now thought mr tolman glascow will be sure to come and bring the book while i am out  in almost exactly two weeks from the date of the last renewal of the book p glascow came in  it was the middle of the afternoon and mr tolman was alone  this investigator of musical philosophy was a quiet young man of about thirty wearing a lightbrown cloak and carrying under one arm a large book  p glascow was surprised when he heard of the change in the proprietorship of the library  still he hoped that there would be no objection to his renewing the book which he had with him and which he had taken out some time ago  oh no said mr tolman none in the world  in fact i dont suppose there are any other subscribers who would want it  i have had the curiosity to look to see if it had ever been taken out before and i find it has not  the young man smiled quietly  no said he i suppose not  it is not every one who would care to study the higher mathematics of music especially when treated as dormstock treats the subject  he seems to go into it pretty deeply remarked mr tolman who had taken up the book  at least i should think so judging from all these calculations and problems and squares and cubes  indeed he does said glascow  and although i have had the book some months and have more reading time at my disposal than most persons i have only reached the fiftysixth page and doubt if i shall not have to review some of that before i can feel that i thoroughly understand it  and there are three hundred and forty pages in all said mr tolman compassionately  yes replied the other  but i am quite sure that the matter will grow easier as i proceed  i have found that out from what i have already done  you say you have a good deal of leisure remarked mr tolman  is the musical business dull at present  oh im not in the musical business said glascow  i have a great love for music and wish to thoroughly understand it  but my business is quite different  i am a night druggist and that is the reason i have so much leisure for reading  a night druggist repeated mr tolman inquiringly  yes sir said the other  i am in a large downtown drug store which is kept open all night and i go on duty after the day clerks leave  and does that give you more leisure asked mr tolman  it seems to answered glascow  i sleep until about noon and then i have the rest of the day until seven oclock to myself  i think that people who work at night can make a more satisfactory use of their own time than those who work in the daytime  in the summer i can take a trip on the river or go somewhere out of town every day if i like  daylight is more available for many things that is true said mr tolman  but is it not dreadfully lonely sitting in a drug store all night  there cant be many people to come to buy medicine at night  i thought there was generally a nightbell to drug stores by which a clerk could be awakened if anybody wanted anything  its not very lonely in our store at night said glascow  in fact its often more lively then than in the daytime  you see we are right down among the newspaper offices and theres always somebody coming in for sodawater or cigars or something or other  the store is a bright warm place for the night editors and reporters to meet together and talk and drink hot soda and theres always a knot of em around the stove about the time the papers begin to go to press  and theyre a lively set i can tell you sir  ive heard some of the best stories i ever heard in my life told in our place after three oclock in the morning  a strange life said mr tolman  do you know i never thought that people amused themselves in that wayand night after night i suppose  yes sir night after night sundays and all  the night druggist now took up his book  going home to read asked mr tolman  well no said the other  its rather cold this afternoon to read i think ill take a brisk walk  cant you leave your book until you return asked mr tolman  that is if you will come back this way  its an awkward book to carry about  thank you i will said glascow  i shall come back this way  when he had gone mr tolman took up the book and began to look over it more carefully than he had done before  but his examination did not last long  how anybody of common sense can take any interest in this stuff is beyond my comprehension said mr tolman as he closed the book and put it on a little shelf behind the counter  when glascow came back mr tolman asked him to stay and warm himself and then after they had talked for a short time mr tolman began to feel hungry  he had his winter appetite and had lunched early  so said he to the night druggist who had opened his dormstock  how would you like to sit here and read awhile while i go and get my dinner  i will light the gas and you can be very comfortable here if you are not in a hurry  p glascow was in no hurry at all and was very glad to have some quiet reading by a warm fire and so mr tolman left him feeling perfectly confident that a man who had been allowed by the old lady to renew a book nine times must be perfectly trustworthy  when mr tolman returned the two had some further conversation in the corner by the little stove  it must be rather annoying said the night druggist not to be able to go out to your meals without shutting up your shop  if you like said he rather hesitatingly i will stop in about this time in the afternoon and stay here while you go to dinner  ill be glad to do this until you get an assistant  i can easily attend to most people who come in and others can wait  mr tolman jumped at this proposition  it was exactly what he wanted  so p glascow came every afternoon and read dormstock while mr tolman went to dinner and before long he came at lunchtime also  it was just as convenient as not he said  he had finished his breakfast and would like to read awhile  mr tolman fancied that the night druggists lodgings were perhaps not very well warmed which idea explained the desire to walk rather than read on a cold afternoon glascows name was entered on the free list and he always took away the dormstock at night because he might have a chance of looking into it at the store when custom began to grow slack in the latter part of the early morning  one afternoon there came into the shop a young lady who brought back two books which she had had for more than a month  she made no excuses for keeping the books longer than the prescribed time but simply handed them in and paid her fine  mr tolman did not like to take this money for it was the first of the kind he had received but the young lady looked as if she were well able to afford the luxury of keeping books over their time and business was business  so he gravely gave her her change  then she said she would like to take out dormstocks logarithms of the diapason  mr tolman stared at her  she was a bright handsome young lady and looked as if she had very good sense  he could not understand it  but he told her the book was out  out she said  why its always out  it seems strange to me that there should be such a demand for that book  i have been trying to get it for ever so long  it is strange said mr tolman but it is certainly in demand  did mrs walker ever make you any promises about it  no said she but i thought my turn would come around some time and i particularly want the book just now  mr tolman felt somewhat troubled  he knew that the night druggist ought not to monopolize the volume and yet he did not wish to disoblige one who was so useful to him and who took such an earnest interest in the book  and he could not temporize with the young lady and say that he thought the book would soon be in  he knew it would not  there were three hundred and forty pages of it  so he merely remarked that he was sorry  so am i said the young lady very sorry  it so happens that just now i have a peculiar opportunity for studying that book which may not occur again  there was something in mr tolmans sympathetic face which seemed to invite her confidence and she continued  i am a teacher she said and on account of certain circumstances i have a holiday for a month which i intended to give up almost entirely to the study of music and i particularly wanted dormstock  do you think there is any chance of its early return and will you reserve it for me  reserve it said mr tolman  most certainly i will  and then he reflected a second or two  if you will come here the day after tomorrow i will be able to tell you something definite  she said she would come  mr tolman was out a long time at lunchtime the next day  he went to all the leading bookstores to see if he could buy a copy of dormstocks great work  but he was unsuccessful  the booksellers told him that there was no probability that he could get a copy in the country unless indeed he found it in the stock of some secondhand dealer and that even if he sent to england for it where it was published it was not likely he could get it for it had been long out of print  there was no demand at all for it  the next day he went to several secondhand stores but no dormstock could he find  when he came back he spoke to glascow on the subject  he was sorry to do so but thought that simple justice compelled him to mention the matter  the night druggist was thrown into a perturbed state of mind by the information that some one wanted his beloved book  a woman he exclaimed  why she would not understand two pages out of the whole of it  it is too bad  i didnt suppose any one would want this book  do not disturb yourself too much said mr tolman  i am not sure that you ought to give it up  i am very glad to hear you say so said glascow  i have no doubt it is only a passing fancy with her  i dare say she would really rather have a good new novel  and then having heard that the lady was expected that afternoon he went out to walk with the dormstock under his arm  when the young lady arrived an hour or so later she was not at all satisfied to take out a new novel and was very sorry indeed not to find the logarithms of the diapason waiting for her  mr tolman told her that he had tried to buy another copy of the work and for this she expressed herself gratefully  he also found himself compelled to say that the book was in the possession of a gentleman who had had it for some timeall the time it had been out in factand had not yet finished it  at this the young lady seemed somewhat nettled  is it not against the rules for any person to keep one book out so long she asked  no said mr tolman  i have looked into that  our rules are very simple and merely say that a book may be renewed by the payment of a certain sum  then i am never to have it remarked the young lady  oh i wouldnt despair about it said mr tolman  he has not had time to reflect upon the matter  he is a reasonable young man and i believe that he will be willing to give up his study of the book for a time and let you take it  no said she i dont wish that  if he is studying as you say he is day and night i do not wish to interrupt him  i should want the book at least a month and that i suppose would upset his course of study entirely  but i do not think any one should begin in a circulating library to study a book that will take him a year to finish for from what you say it will take this gentleman at least that time to finish dormstocks book so she went her way  when p glascow heard all this in the evening he was very grave  he had evidently been reflecting  it is not fair said he  i ought not to keep the book so long  i now give it up for a while  you may let her have it when she comes and he put the dormstock on the counter and went and sat down by the stove  mr tolman was grieved  he knew the night druggist had done right but still he was sorry for him  what will you do he asked  will you stop your studies  oh no said glascow gazing solemnly into the stove  i will take up some other books on the diapason which i have and so will keep my ideas fresh on the subject until this lady is done with the book  i do not really believe she will study it very long  then he added  if it is all the same to you i will come around here and read as i have been doing until you shall get a regular assistant  mr tolman would be delighted to have him come he said  he had entirely given up the idea of getting an assistant but this he did not say  it was some time before the lady came back and mr tolman was afraid she was not coming at all  but she did come and asked for mrs burneys evelina  she smiled when she named the book and said that she believed she would have to take a novel after all and she had always wanted to read that one  i wouldnt take a novel if i were you said mr tolman and he triumphantly took down the dormstock and laid it before her  she was evidently much pleased but when he told her of mr glascows gentlemanly conduct in the matter her countenance instantly changed  not at all said she laying down the book  i will not break up his study  i will take the evelina if you please  and as no persuasion from mr tolman had any effect upon her she went away with mrs burneys novel in her muff  now then said mr tolman to glascow in the evening you may as well take the book along with you  she wont have it  but glascow would do nothing of the kind  no he remarked as he sat looking into the stove  when i said i would let her have it i meant it  shell take it when she sees that it continues to remain in the library  glascow was mistaken she did not take it having the idea that he would soon conclude that it would be wiser for him to read it than to let it stand idly on the shelf  it would serve them both right said mr tolman to himself if somebody else should come and take it  but there was no one else among his subscribers who would even think of such a thing  one day however the young lady came in and asked to look at the book dont think that i am going to take it out she said noticing mr tolmans look of pleasure as he handed her the volume  i only wish to see what he says on a certain subject which i am studying now  and so she sat down by the stove on the chair which mr tolman placed for her and opened dormstock  she sat earnestly poring over the book for half an hour or more and then she looked up and said  i really cannot make out what this part means  excuse my troubling you but i would be very glad if you would explain the latter part of this passage  me exclaimed mr tolman  why my good madammiss i meani couldnt explain it to you if it were to save my life  but what page is it said he looking at his watch  page twentyfour answered the young lady  oh well then said he if you can wait ten or fifteen minutes the gentleman who has had the book will be here and i think he can explain anything in the first part of the work  the young lady seemed to hesitate whether to wait or not but as she had a certain curiosity to see what sort of a person he was who had been so absorbed in the book she concluded to sit a little longer and look into some other parts of the volume  the night druggist soon came in and when mr tolman introduced him to the lady he readily agreed to explain the passage to her if he could so mr tolman got him a chair from the inner room and he also sat down by the stove  the explanation was difficult but it was achieved at last and then the young lady broached the subject of leaving the book unused  this was discussed for some time but came to nothing although mr tolman put down his afternoon paper and joined in the argument urging among other points that as the matter now stood he was deprived by the deadlock of all income from the book  but even this strong argument proved of no avail  then i will tell you what i wish you would do said mr tolman as the young lady rose to go come here and look at the book whenever you wish to do so  i would like to make this more of a readingroom anyway  it would give me more company  after this the young lady looked into dormstock when she came in and as her holidays had been extended by the continued absence of the family in which she taught she had plenty of time for study and came quite frequently  she often met glascow in the shop and on such occasions they generally consulted dormstock and sometimes had quite lengthy talks on musical matters  one afternoon they came in together having met on their way to the library and entered into a conversation on diapasonic logarithms which continued during the ladys stay in the shop  the proper thing thought mr tolman would be for these two people to get married  then they could take the book and study it to their hearts content  and they would certainly suit each other for they are both greatly attached to musical mathematics and philosophy and neither of them either plays or sings as they have told me  it would be an admirable match  mr tolman thought over this matter a good deal and at last determined to mention it to glascow  when he did so the young man colored and expressed the opinion that it would be of no use to think of such a thing  but it was evident from his manner and subsequent discourse that he had thought of it  mr tolman gradually became quite anxious on the subject especially as the night druggist did not seem inclined to take any steps in the matter  the weather was now beginning to be warmer and mr tolman reflected that the little house and the little shop were probably much more cosey and comfortable in winter than in summer  there were higher buildings all about the house and even now he began to feel that the circulation of air would be quite as agreeable as the circulation of books  he thought a good deal about his airy rooms in the neighboring city  mr glascow said he one afternoon i have made up my mind to sell out this business shortly  what exclaimed the other  do you mean you will give it up and go awayleave the place altogether  yes replied mr tolman i shall give up the place entirely and leave the city  the night druggist was shocked  he had spent many happy hours in that shop and his hours there were now becoming pleasanter than ever  if mr tolman went away all this must end  nothing of the kind could be expected of any new proprietor  and considering this continued mr tolman i think it would be well for you to bring your love matters to a conclusion while i am here to help you  my love matters exclaimed mr glascow with a flush  yes certainly said mr tolman  i have eyes and i know all about it  now let me tell you what i think  when a thing is to be done it ought to be done the first time there is a good chance  thats the way i do business  now you might as well come around here tomorrow afternoon prepared to propose to miss edwards  she is due tomorrow for she has been two days away  if she doesnt come we will postpone the matter until the next day  but you should be ready tomorrow  i dont believe you can see her much when you dont meet her here for that family is expected back very soon and from what i infer from her account of her employers you wont care to visit her at their house  the night druggist wanted to think about it  there is nothing to think said mr tolman  we know all about the lady  he spoke truly for he had informed himself about both parties to the affair  take my advice and be here tomorrow afternoonand come rather early  the next morning mr tolman went up to his parlor on the second floor and brought down two blue stuffed chairs the best he had and put them in the little room back of the shop  he also brought down one or two knickknacks and put them on the mantelpiece and he dusted and brightened up the room as well as he could  he even covered the table with a red cloth from the parlor  when the young lady arrived he invited her to walk into the back room to look over some new books he had just got in  if she had known he proposed to give up the business she would have thought it rather strange that he should be buying new books  but she knew nothing of his intentions  when she was seated at the table whereon the new books were spread mr tolman stepped outside of the shop door to watch for glascows approach  he soon appeared  walk right in said mr tolman  shes in the back room looking over books  ill wait here and keep out customers as far as possible its pleasant and i want a little fresh air  ill give you twenty minutes  glascow was pale but he went in without a word and mr tolman with his hands under his coattail and his feet rather far apart established a blockade on the doorstep  he stood there for some time looking at the people outside and wondering what the people inside were doing  the little girl who had borrowed the milk of him and who had never returned it was about to pass the door but seeing him standing there she crossed over to the other side of the street  but he did not notice her  he was wondering if it was time to go in  a boy came up to the door and wanted to know if he kept easter eggs mr tolman was happy to say he did not  when he had allowed the night druggist a very liberal twenty minutes he went in  as he entered the shop door giving the bell a very decided ring as he did so p glascow came down the two steps that led from the inner room  his face showed that it was all right with him  a few days after this mr tolman sold out his stock good will and fixtures together with the furniture and lease of the house  and who should he sell out to but to mr glascow  this piece of business was one of the happiest points in the whole affair  there was no reason why the happy couple should not be married very soon and the young lady was charmed to give up her position as teacher and governess in a family and come and take charge of that delightful little store and that cunning little house with almost everything in it that they wanted  one thing in the establishment mr tolman refused to sell  that was dormstocks great work  he made the couple a present of the volume and between two of the earlier pages he placed a banknote which in value was very much more than that of the ordinary wedding gift  what are you going to do they asked of him when all these things were settled  and then he told them how he was going back to his business in the neighboring city and he told them what it was and how he had come to manage a circulating library  they did not think him crazy  people who studied the logarithms of the diapason would not be apt to think a man crazy for such a little thing as that  when mr tolman returned to the establishment of pusey  co he found everything going on very satisfactorily  you look ten years younger sir said mr canterfield  you must have had a very pleasant time  i did not think there was enough to interest you in  for so long a time  interest me exclaimed mr tolman  why objects of interest crowded on me  i never had a more enjoyable holiday in my life  when he went home that evening and he found himself quite willing to go he tore up the will he had made  he now felt that there was no necessity for proving his sanity     my unwilling neighbor  i was about twentyfive years old when i began life as the owner of a vineyard in western virginia  i bought a large tract of land the greater part of which lay upon the sloping side of one of the foothills of the blue ridge the exposure being that most favorable to the growth of the vine  i am an enthusiastic lover of the country and of country life and believed that i should derive more pleasure as well as profit from the culture of my farstretching vineyard than i would from ordinary farm operations  i built myself a good house of moderate size upon a little plateau on the higher part of my estate  sitting in my porch smoking my pipe after the labors of the day i could look down over my vineyard into a beautiful valley with here and there a little curling smoke arising from some of the few dwellings which were scattered about among the groves and spreading fields and above this beauty i could imagine all my hillside clothed in green and purple  my family consisted of myself alone  it is true that i expected some day that there would be others in my house besides myself but i was not ready for this yet  during the summer i found it very pleasant to live by myself  it was a novelty and i could arrange and manage everything in my own fashion which was a pleasure i had not enjoyed when i lived in my fathers house  but when winter came i found it very lonely  even my servants lived in a cabin at some little distance and there were many dark and stormy evenings when the company even of a bore would have been welcome to me  sometimes i walked over to the town and visited my friends there but this was not feasible on stormy nights and the winter seemed to me a very long one  but spring came outdoor operations began and for a few weeks i felt again that i was allsufficient for my own pleasure and comfort  then came a change  one of those seasons of bad and stormy weather which so frequently follow an early spring settled down upon my spirits and my hillside  it rained it was cold fierce winds blew and i became more anxious for somebody to talk to than i had been at any time during the winter  one night when a very bad storm was raging i went to bed early and as i lay awake i revolved in my mind a scheme of which i had frequently thought before  i would build a neat little house on my grounds not very far away from my house but not too near and i would ask jack brandiger to come there and live  jack was a friend of mine who was reading law in the town and it seemed to me that it would be much more pleasant and even more profitable to read law on a pretty hillside overlooking a charming valley with woods and mountains behind and above him where he could ramble to his hearts content  i had thought of asking jack to come and live with me but this idea i soon dismissed  i am a very particular person and jack was not  he left his pipes about in all sorts of placessometimes when they were still lighted  when he came to see me he was quite as likely to put his hat over the inkstand as to put it anywhere else  but if jack lived at a little distance and we could go backward and forward to see each other whenever we pleased that would be quite another thing  he could do as he pleased in his own house and i could do as i pleased in mine and we might have many pleasant evenings together  this was a cheering idea and i was planning how we might arrange with the negro woman who managed my household affairs to attend also to those of jack when i fell asleep  i did not sleep long before i was awakened by the increased violence of the storm  my house shook with the fury of the wind  the rain seemed to be pouring on its roof and northern side as if there were a waterfall above us and every now and then i could hear a shower of hailstones rattling against the shutters  my bedroom was one of the rooms on the lower floor and even there i could hear the pounding of the deluge and the hailstones upon the roof  all this was very doleful and had a tendency to depress the spirits of a man awake and alone in a goodsized house  but i shook off this depression  it was not agreeable to be up here by myself in such a terrible storm but there was nothing to be afraid of as my house was new and very strongly built being constructed of logs weatherboarded outside and ceiled within  it would require a hurricane to blow off the roof and i believed my shutters to be hailproof  so as there was no reason to stay awake i turned over and went to sleep  i do not know how long it was before i was awakened again this time not by the noise of the storm but by a curious movement of my bedstead  i had once felt the slight shock of an earthquake and it seemed to me that this must be something of the kind  certainly my bed moved under me  i sat up  the room was pitchy dark  in a moment i felt another movement but this time it did not seem to me to resemble an earthquake shock  such motion i think is generally in horizontal directions while that which i felt was more like the movement of a ship upon the water  the storm was at its height the wind raged and roared and the rain seemed to be pouring down as heavily as ever  i was about to get up and light the lamp for even the faintest candleflame would be some sort of company at such a grewsome moment when my bedstead gave another movement more shiplike than before  it actually lurched forward as if it were descending into the trough of the sea but unlike a ship it did not rise again but remained in such a slanting position that i began to slide down toward the foot  i believe that if it had not been a bedstead provided with a footboard i should have slipped out upon the floor  i did not jump out of bed  i did not do anything  i was trying to think to understand the situation to find out whether i was asleep or awake when i became aware of noises in the room and all over the house which even through the din of the storm made themselves noticed by their peculiarity  tables everything in the room seemed to be grating and grinding on the floor and in a moment there was a crash i knew what that meant my lamp had slipped off the table  any doubt on that point would have been dispelled by the smell of kerosene which soon filled the air of the room  the motion of the bed which i now believe must have been the motion of the whole house still continued but the grating noises in the room gradually ceased from which i inferred that the furniture had brought up against the front wall of the room  it now was impossible for me to get up and strike a light for to do so with kerosene oil all over the floor and its vapor diffused through the room would probably result in setting the house on fire  so i must stay in darkness and wait  i do not think i was very much frightenedi was so astonished that there was no room in my mind for fear  in fact all my mental energies were occupied in trying to find out what had happened  it required however only a few more minutes of reflection and a few more minutes of the grating bumping trembling of my house to enable me to make up my mind what was happening  my house was sliding downhill  the wind must have blown the building from its foundations and upon the slippery surface of the hillside probably lashed into liquid mud by the pouring rain it was making its way down toward the valley  in a flash my minds eye ran over the whole surface of the country beneath me as far as i knew it  i was almost positive that there was no precipice no terrible chasm into which my house might fall  there was nothing but sloping hillside and beneath that a wide stretch of fields  now there was a new and sudden noise of heavy objects falling upon the roof and i knew what that meant my chimney had been wrenched from its foundations and the upper part of it had now toppled over  i could hear through the storm the bricks banging and sliding upon the slanting roof  continuous sounds of cracking and snapping came to me through the closed front windows and these were caused i supposed by the destruction of the stakes of my vines as the heavy house moved over them  of course when i thoroughly understood the state of the case my first impulse was to spring out of bed and as quickly as possible to get out of that thumping and sliding house  but i restrained myself  the floor might be covered with broken glass i might not be able to find my clothes in the darkness and in the jumble of furniture at the end of the room and even if i could dress myself it would be folly to jump out in the midst of that raging storm into a probable mass of wreckage which i could not see  it would be far better to remain dry and warm under my roof  there was no reason whatever to suppose that the house would go to pieces or that it would turn over  it must stop some time or other and until it did so i would be safer in my bed than anywhere else  therefore in my bed i stayed  sitting upright with my feet pressed against the footboard i listened and felt  the noises of the storm and the cracking and the snapping and grinding before me and under me still continued although i sometimes thought that the wind was moderating a little and that the strange motion was becoming more regular  i believed the house was moving faster than when it first began its strange career but that it was sliding over a smooth surface  now i noticed a succession of loud cracks and snaps at the front of the house and from the character of the sounds i concluded that my little front porch which had been acting as a cutwater at the bow of my shiplike house had yielded at last to the rough contact with the ground and would probably soon be torn away  this did not disturb me for the house must still be firm  it was not long before i perceived that the slanting of my bed was becoming less and less and also i was quite sure that the house was moving more slowly  then the crackings and snappings before my front wall ceased altogether  the bed resumed its ordinary horizontal position and although i did not know at what moment the house had ceased sliding and had come to a standstill i was sure that it had done so  it was now resting upon a level surface  the room was still perfectly dark and the storm continued  it was useless for me to get up until daylight camei could not see what had happenedso i lay back upon my pillow and tried to imagine upon what level portion of my farm i had stranded  while doing this i fell asleep  when i woke a little light was stealing into the room through the blinds of my shutters  i quickly slipped out of bed opened a window and looked out  day was just breaking the rain and wind had ceased and i could discern objects  but it seemed as if i needed some light in my brain to enable me to comprehend what i saw  my eyes fell upon nothing familiar  i did not stop to investigate however from my window  i found my clothes huddled together with the furniture at the front end of the room and as soon as i was dressed i went into the hall and then to my front door  i quickly jerked this open and was about to step outside when suddenly i stopped  i was positive that my front porch had been destroyed  but there i saw a porch a little lower than mine and a great deal wider and on the other side of it not more than eight feet from me was a windowthe window of a house and on the other side of the window was a facethe face of a young girl  as i stood staring in blank amazement at the house which presented itself at my front door the face at the window disappeared and i was left to contemplate the scene by myself  i ran to my back door and threw it open  there i saw stretching up the fields and far up the hillside the wide path which my house had made as it came down from its elevated position to the valley beneath where it had ended its onward career by stopping up against another house  as i looked from the back porch i saw that the ground still continued to slope so that if my house had not found in its path another building it would probably have proceeded somewhat farther on its course  it was lighter and i saw bushes and fences and outbuildingsi was in a back yard  almost breathless with amazement and consternation i ran again to the front door  when i reached it i found a young woman standing on the porch of the house before me  i was about to say somethingi know not whatwhen she put her finger on her lips and stepped forward  please dont speak loudly she said  i am afraid it will frighten mother  she is asleep yet  i suppose you and your house have been sliding downhill  that is what has happened said i  but i cannot understand it  it seems to me the most amazing thing that ever took place on the face of the earth  it is very queer said she but hurricanes do blow away houses and that must have been a hurricane we had last night for the wind was strong enough to loosen any house  i have often wondered if that house would ever slide downhill  my house  yes she said  soon after it was built i began to think what a nice clean sweep it could make from the place where it seemed to be stuck to the side of the mountain right down here into the valley  i could not talk with a girl like this at least i could not meet her on her own conversational grounds  i was so agitated myself that it seemed unnatural that any one to whom i should speak should not also be agitated  who are you i asked rather brusquely  at least to whom does this house belong  this is my mothers house said she  my mother is mrs carson  we happen just now to be living here by ourselves so i cannot call on any man to help you do anything  my brother has always lived with us but last week he went away  you dont seem to be a bit astonished at what has happened said i  she was rather a pretty girl of a cheerful disposition i should say for several times she had smiled as she spoke  oh i am astonished she answered or at least i was  but i have had time enough to get over some of it  it was at least an hour ago when i was awakened by hearing something crack in the yard  i went to a window and looked out and could just barely see that something like a big building had grown up during the night  then i watched it and watched it until i made out it was a whole house and after that it was not long before i guessed what had happened  it seemed a simpler thing to me you know than it did to you because i had often thought about it and probably you never had  you are right there said i earnestly  it would have been impossible for me to imagine such a thing  at first i thought there was nobody in the house said she but when i heard some one moving about i came down to tell whoever had arrived not to make a noise  i see she added with another of her smiles that you think i am a very strange person not to be more flurried by what has happened  but really i cannot think of anything else just now except what mother will say and do when she comes down and finds you and your house here at the back door  i am very sure she will not like it  like it i exclaimed  who on earth could like it  please speak more gently she said  mother is always a little irritable when her nights rest has been broken and i would not like to have her wakened up suddenly now  but really mr warren i havent the least idea in the world how she will take this thing  i must go in and be with her when she wakes so that i can explain just what has happened  one moment i said  you know my name  of course i know your name she answered  could that house be up there on the hillside for more than a year without my knowing who lived in it  with this she went indoors  i could not help smiling when i thought of the young lady regretting that there was no man in the house who might help me do something what could anybody do in a case like this  i turned and went into my house  i entered the various rooms on the lower floor and saw no signs of any particular damage except that everything movable in each room was jumbled together against the front wall  but when i looked out of the back door i found that the porch there was a good deal wrecked which i had not noticed before  i went upstairs and found everything very much as it was below nothing seemed to have been injured except the chimney and the porches i thanked my stars that i had used hard wood instead of mortar for the ceilings of my rooms  i was about to go into my bedroom when i heard a woman scream and of course i hurried to the front  there on the back porch of her house stood mrs carson  she was a woman of middle age and as i glanced at her i saw where her daughter got her good looks  but the placidity and cheerfulness of the younger face were entirely wanting in the mother  her eyes sparkled her cheeks were red her mouth was partly opened and it seemed to me that i could almost see that her breath was hot  is this your house she cried the moment her eyes fell upon me and what is it doing here  i did not immediately answer i looked at the angry woman and behind her i saw through the open door the daughter crossing the hallway  it was plain that she had decided to let me have it out with her mother without interference  as briefly and as clearly as i could i explained what had happened  what is all that to me she screamed  it doesnt matter to me how your house got here  there have been storms ever since the beginning of the world and i never heard of any of them taking a house into a persons back yard  you ought not to have built your house where any such thing could happen  but all this is nothing to me  i dont understand now how your house did get here and i dont want to understand it  all i want is for you to take it away  i will do that madam just as soon as i can  you may be very sure i will do that  but  can you do it now she asked  can you do it today  i dont want a minute lost  i have not been outside to see what damage has been done but the first thing to do is to take your house away  i am going to the town now madam to summon assistance  mrs carson made no answer but she turned and walked to the end of her porch  there she suddenly gave a scream which quickly brought her daughter from the house  kitty  kitty cried her mother  do you know what he has done  he has gone right over my round flowergarden his house is sitting on it this minute  but he could not help it mother said kitty  help it exclaimed mrs carson  i didnt expect him to help it what i want  suddenly she stopped  her eyes flashed brighter her mouth opened wider and she became more and more excited as she noticed the absence of the sheds fences or vegetablebeds which had found themselves in the course of my alldestroying dwelling  it was now well on in the morning and some of the neighbors had become aware of the strange disaster which had happened to me although if they had heard the news from mrs carson they might have supposed that it was a disaster which had happened only to her  as they gazed at the two houses so closely jammed together all of them wondered some of them even laughed but not one offered a suggestion which afforded satisfaction to mrs carson or myself  the general opinion was that now my house was there it would have to stay there for there were not enough horses in the state to pull it back up that mountainside  to be sure it might possibly be drawn off sidewise  but whether it was moved one way or the other a lot of mrs carsons trees would have to be cut down to let it pass  which shall never happen cried that good lady  if nothing else can be done it must be taken apart and hauled off in carts  but no matter how it is managed it must be moved and that immediately  miss carson now prevailed upon her mother to go into the house and i stayed and talked to the men and a few women who had gathered outside  when they had said all they had to say and seen all there was to see these people went home to their breakfasts  i entered my house but not by the front door for to do that i would have been obliged to trespass upon mrs carsons back porch  i got my hat and was about to start for the town when i heard my name called  turning into the hall i saw miss carson who was standing at my front door  mr warren said she you havent any way of getting breakfast have you  oh no said i  my servants are up there in their cabin and i suppose they are too much scared to come down  but i am going to town to see what can be done about my house and will get my breakfast there  its a long way to go without anything to eat she said and we can give you some breakfast  but i want to ask you something  i am in a good deal of perplexity  our two servants are out at the front of the house but they positively refuse to come in they are afraid that your house may begin sliding again and crush them all so i shall have to get breakfast  but what bothers me is trying to find our well  i have been outside and can see no signs of it  where was your well i gasped  it ought to be somewhere near the back of your house she said  may i go through your hall and look out  of course you may i cried and i preceded her to my back door  now it seems to me she said after surveying the scene of desolation immediately before and looking from side to side toward objects which had remained untouched that your house has passed directly over our well and must have carried away the little shed and the pump and everything above ground  i should not wonder a bit she continued slowly if it is under your porch  i jumped to the ground for the steps were shattered and began to search for the well and it was not long before i discovered its round dark opening which was as miss carson had imagined under one end of my porch  what can we do she asked  we cant have breakfast or get along at all without water  it was a terribly depressing thing to me to think that i or rather my house had given these people so much trouble but i speedily assured miss carson that if she could find a bucket and a rope which i could lower into the well i would provide her with water  she went into her house to see what she could find and i tore away the broken planks of the porch so that i could get to the well  and then when she came with a tin pail and a clothesline i went to work to haul up water and carry it to her back door  i dont want mother to find out what has happened to the well she said for she has enough on her mind already  mrs carson was a woman with some good points in her character  after a time she called to me herself and told me to come in to breakfast but during the meal she talked very earnestly to me about the amazing trespass i had committed and about the means which should be taken to repair the damages my house had done to her property  i was as optimistic as i could be and the young lady spoke very cheerfully and hopefully about the affair so that we were beginning to get along somewhat pleasantly when suddenly mrs carson sprang to her feet heavens and earth she cried this house is moving  she was not mistaken  i had felt beneath my feet a sudden sharp shocknot severe but unmistakable  i remembered that both houses stood upon slightly sloping ground  my blood turned cold my heart stood still even miss carson was pale  when we had rushed out of doors to see what had happened or what was going to happen i soon found that we had been needlessly frightened some of the broken timbers on which my house had been partially resting had given way and the front part of the building had slightly descended jarring as it did so the other house against which it rested  i endeavored to prove to mrs carson that the result was encouraging rather than otherwise for my house was now more firmly settled than it had been  but she did not value the opinion of a man who did not know enough to put his house in a place where it would be likely to stay and she could eat no more breakfast and was even afraid to stay under her own roof until experienced mechanics had been summoned to look into the state of affairs  i hurried away to the town and it was not long before several carpenters and masons were on the spot  after a thorough examination they assured mrs carson that there was no danger that my house would do no farther damage to her premises but to make things certain they would bring some heavy beams and brace the front of my house against her cellar wall  when that should be done it would be impossible for it to move any farther  but i dont want it braced cried mrs carson  i want it taken away  i want it out of my back yard  the master carpenter was a man of imagination and expedients  that is quite another thing maam said he  well fix this gentlemans house so that you neednt be afraid of it and then when the time comes to move it theres several ways of doing that  we might rig up a powerful windlass at the top of the hill and perhaps get a steamengine to turn it and we could fasten cables to the house and haul her back to where she belongs  and can you take your oaths cried mrs carson that those ropes wont break and when that house gets halfway up the hill it wont come sliding down ten times faster than it did and crash into me and mine and everything i own on earth  no sir  ill have no house hauled up a hill back of me  of course said the carpenter it would be a great deal easier to move it on this ground which is almost level  and cut down my trees to do it  no sir  well then said he there is no way to do but to take it apart and haul it off  which would make an awful time at the back of my house while you were doing it exclaimed mrs carson  i now put in a word  theres only one thing to do that i can see i exclaimed  i will sell it to a match factory  it is almost all wood and it can be cut up in sections about two inches thick and then split into matches  kitty smiled  i should like to see them she said taking away the little sticks in wheelbarrows  there is no need of trifling on the subject said mrs carson  i have had a great deal to bear and i must bear it no longer than is necessary  i have just found out that in order to get water out of my own well i must go to the back porch of a stranger  such things cannot be endured  if my son george were here he would tell me what i ought to do  i shall write to him and see what he advises  i do not mind waiting a little bit now that i know that you can fix mr warrens house so that it wont move any farther  thus the matter was left  my house was braced that afternoon and toward evening i started to go to a hotel in the town to spend the night  no sir said mrs carson  do you suppose that i am going to stay here all night with a great empty house jammed up against me and everybody knowing that it is empty  it will be the same as having thieves in my own house to have them in yours  you have come down here in your property and you can stay in it and take care of it  i dont object to that in the least i said  my two women are here and i can tell them to attend to my meals  i havent any chimney but i suppose they can make a fire some way or other  no sir said mrs carson  i am not going to have any strange servants on my place  i have just been able to prevail upon my own women to go into the house and i dont want any more trouble  i have had enough already  but my dear madam said i you dont want me to go to the town and you wont allow me to have any cooking done here  what am i to do  well she said you can eat with us  it may be two or three days before i can hear from my son george and in the meantime you can lodge in your own house and i will take you to board  that is the best way i can see of managing the thing  but i am very sure i am not going to be left here alone in the dreadful predicament in which you have put me  we had scarcely finished supper when jack brandiger came to see me  he laughed a good deal a about my sudden change of base but thought on the whole my house had made a very successful move  it must be more pleasant in the valley than up on that windy hill  jack was very much interested in everything and when mrs carson and her daughter appeared as we were walking about viewing the scene i felt myself obliged to introduce him  i like those ladies said he to me afterwards  i think you have chosen very agreeable neighbors  how do you know you like them said i  you had scarcely anything to say to mrs carson  no to be sure said he  but i expect i should like her  by the way do you know how you used to talk to me about coming and living somewhere near you  how would you like me to take one of your rooms now  i might cheer you up  no said i firmly  that cannot be done  as things are now i have as much as i can do to get along here by myself  mrs carson did not hear from her son for nearly a week and then he wrote that he found it almost impossible to give her any advice  he thought it was a very queer state of affairs  he had never heard of anything like it  but he would try and arrange his business so that he could come home in a week or two and look into matters  as i was thus compelled to force myself upon the close neighborhood of mrs carson and her daughter  i endeavored to make things as pleasant as possible  i brought some of my men down out of the vineyard and set them to repairing fences putting the garden in order and doing all that i could to remedy the doleful condition of things which i had unwillingly brought into the back yard of this quiet family  i rigged up a pump on my back porch by which the water of the well could be conveniently obtained and in every way endeavored to repair damages  but mrs carson never ceased to talk about the unparalleled disaster which had come upon her and she must have had a great deal of correspondence with her son george because she gave me frequent messages from him  he could not come on to look into the state of affairs but he seemed to be giving it a great deal of thought and attention  spring weather had come again and it was very pleasant to help the carson ladies get their flowergarden in orderat least as much as was left of it for my house was resting upon some of the most important beds  as i was obliged to give up all present idea of doing anything in the way of getting my residence out of a place where it had no business to be because mrs carson would not consent to any plan which had been suggested i felt that i was offering some little compensation in beautifying what seemed to be at that time my own grounds  my labors in regard to vines bushes and all that sort of thing were generally carried on under direction of mrs carson or her daughter and as the elderly lady was a very busy housewife the horticultural work was generally left to miss kitty and me  i liked miss kitty  she was a cheerful wholesouled person and i sometimes thought that she was not so unwilling to have me for a neighbor as the rest of the family seemed to be for if i were to judge the disposition of her brother george from what her mother told me about his letters both he and mrs carson must be making a great many plans to get me off the premises  nearly a month had now passed since my house and i made that remarkable morning call upon mrs carson  i was becoming accustomed to my present mode of living and so far as i was concerned it satisfied me very well  i certainly lived a great deal better than when i was depending upon my old negro cook  miss kitty seemed to be satisfied with things as they were and so in some respects did her mother  but the latter never ceased to give me extracts from some of her son georges letters and this was always annoying and worrying to me  evidently he was not pleased with me as such a close neighbor to his mother and it was astonishing how many expedients he proposed in order to rid her of my undesirable proximity  my son george said mrs carson one morning has been writing to me about jackscrews  he says that the greatest improvements have been made in jackscrews  what do you do with them mother asked miss kitty  you lift houses with them said she  he says that in large cities they lift whole blocks of houses with them and build stories underneath  he thinks that we can get rid of our trouble here if we use jackscrews  but how does he propose to use them i asked  oh he has a good many plans answered mrs carson  he said that he should not wonder if jackscrews could be made large enough to lift your house entirely over mine and set it out in the road where it could be carried away without interfering with anything except of course vehicles which might be coming along  but he has another planthat is to lift my house up and carry it out into the field on the other side of the road and then your house might be carried along right over the cellar until it got to the road  in that way he says the bushes and trees would not have to be interfered with  i think brother george is cracked said kitty  all this sort of thing worried me very much  my mind was eminently disposed toward peace and tranquillity but who could be peaceful and tranquil with a prospective jackscrew under the very base of his comfort and happiness  in fact my house had never been such a happy home as it was at that time  the fact of its unwarranted position upon other peoples grounds had ceased to trouble me  but the coming son george with his jackscrews did trouble me very much and that afternoon i deliberately went into mrs carsons house to look for kitty  i knew her mother was not at home for i had seen her go out  when kitty appeared i asked her to come out on her back porch  have you thought of any new plan of moving it she said with a smile as we sat down  no said i earnestly  i have not and i dont want to think of any plan of moving it  i am tired of seeing it here i am tired of thinking about moving it away and i am tired of hearing people talk about moving it  i have not any right to be here and i am never allowed to forget it  what i want to do is to go entirely away and leave everything behind meexcept one thing  and what is that asked kitty  you i answered  she turned a little pale and did not reply  you understand me kitty i said  there is nothing in the world that i care for but you  what have you to say to me  then came back to her her little smile  i think it would be very foolish for us to go away she said  it was about a quarter of an hour after this when kitty proposed that we should go out to the front of the house it would look queer if any of the servants should come by and see us sitting together like that i had forgotten that there were other people in the world but i went with her  we were standing on the front porch close to each other and i think we were holding each others hands when mrs carson came back  as she approached she looked at us inquiringly plainly wishing to know why we were standing side by side before her door as if we had some special object in so doing  well said she as she came up the steps  of course it was right that i should speak and in as few words as possible i told her what kitty and i had been saying to each other  i never saw kittys mother look so cheerful and so handsome as when she came forward and kissed her daughter and shook hands with me  she seemed so perfectly satisfied that it amazed me  after a little kitty left us and then mrs carson asked me to sit by her on a rustic bench  now said she this will straighten out things in the very best way when you are married you and kitty can live in the back buildingfor of course your house will now be the same thing as a back buildingand you can have the second floor  we wont have any separate tables because it will be a great deal nicer for you and kitty to live with me and it will simply be your paying board for two persons instead of one  and you know you can manage your vineyard just as well from the bottom of the hill as from the top  the lower rooms of what used to be your house can be made very pleasant and comfortable for all of us  i have been thinking about the room on the right that you had planned for a parlor and it will make a lovely sittingroom for us which is a thing we have never had and the room on the other side is just what will suit beautifully for a guestchamber  the two houses together with the roof of my back porch properly joined to the front of your house will make a beautiful and spacious dwelling  it was fortunate too that you painted your house a light yellow  i have often looked at the two together and thought what a good thing it was that one was not one color and the other another  as to the pump it will be very easy now to put a pipe from what used to be your back porch to our kitchen so that we can get water without being obliged to carry it  between us we can make all sorts of improvements and some time i will tell you of a good many that i have thought of  what used to be your house she continued can be jackscrewed up a little bit and a good foundation put under it  i have inquired about that  of course it would not have been proper to let you know that i was satisfied with the state of things but i was satisfied and there is no use of denying it  as soon as i got over my first scare after that house came down the hill and had seen how everything might be arranged to suit all parties i said to myself what the lord has joined together let not man put asunder and so according to my belief the strongest kind of jackscrews could not put these two houses asunder any more than they could put you and kitty asunder now that you have agreed to take each other for each others own  jack brandiger came to call that evening and when he had heard what had happened he whistled a good deal  you are a funny kind of a fellow said he  you go courting like a snail with your house on your back  i think my friend was a little discomfited  dont be discouraged jack said i you will get a good wife some of these daysthat is if you dont try to slide uphill to find her     our archery club  when an archery club was formed in our village i was among the first to join it  but i should not on this account claim any extraordinary enthusiasm on the subject of archery for nearly all the ladies and gentlemen of the place were also among the first to join  few of us i think had a correct idea of the popularity of archery in our midst until the subject of a club was broached  then we all perceived what a strong interest we felt in the study and use of the bow and arrow  the club was formed immediately and our thirty members began to discuss the relative merits of lancewood yew and greenheart bows and to survey yards and lawns for suitable spots for setting up targets for home practice  our weekly meetings at which we came together to show in friendly contest how much our home practice had taught us were held upon the village green or rather upon what had been intended to be the village green  this pretty piece of ground partly in smooth lawn and partly shaded by fine trees was the property of a gentleman of the place who had presented it under certain conditions to the township  but as the township had never fulfilled any of the conditions and had done nothing toward the improvement of the spot further than to make it a grazingplace for local cows and goats the owner had withdrawn his gift shut out the cows and goats by a picket fence and having locked the gate had hung up the key in his barn  when our club was formed the green as it was still called was offered to us for our meetings and with proper gratitude we elected its owner to be our president  this gentleman was eminently qualified for the presidency of an archery club  in the first place he did not shoot this gave him time and opportunity to attend to the shooting of others  he was a tall and pleasant man a little elderly  this elderliness if i may so put it seemed in his case to resemble some mild disorder like a gentle rheumatism which while it prevented him from indulging in all the wild hilarities of youth gave him in compensation a position as one entitled to a certain consideration which was very agreeable to him his little disease was chronic it is true and it was growing upon him but it was so far a pleasant ailment  and so with as much interest in bows and arrows and targets and successful shots as any of us he never fitted an arrow to a string nor drew a bow  but he attended every meeting settling disputed points for he studied all the books on archery encouraging the disheartened holding back the eager ones who would run to the targets as soon as they had shot regardless of the fact that others were still shooting and that the human body is not arrowproof and shedding about him that general aid and comfort which emanates from a good fellow no matter what he may say or do  there were personsoutsiderswho said that archery clubs always selected ladies for their presiding officers but we did not care to be too much bound down and trammelled by customs and traditions  another club might not have among its members such a genial elderly gentleman who owned a village green  i soon found myself greatly interested in archery especially when i succeeded in planting an arrow somewhere within the periphery of the target but i never became such an enthusiast in bowshooting as my friend pepton  if pepton could have arranged matters to suit himself he would have been born an archer  but as this did not happen to have been the case he employed every means in his power to rectify what he considered this serious error in his construction  he gave his whole soul and the greater part of his spare time to archery and as he was a young man of energy this helped him along wonderfully  his equipments were perfect  no one could excel him in this respect his bow was snakewood backed with hickory  he carefully rubbed it down every evening with oil and beeswax and it took its repose in a green baize bag  his arrows were philip highfields best his strings the finest flanders hemp  he had shootinggloves and little leather tips that could be screwed fast on the ends of what he called his stringfingers  he had a quiver and a belt and when equipped for the weekly meetings he carried a fancycolored wipingtassel and a little ebony greasepot hanging from his belt  he wore when shooting a polished armguard or bracer and if he had heard of anything else that an archer should have he straightway would have procured it  pepton was a single man and he lived with two good old maiden ladies who took as much care of him as if they had been his mothers  and he was such a good kind fellow that he deserved all the attention they gave him  they felt a great interest in his archery pursuits and shared his anxious solicitude in the selection of a suitable place to hang his bow  you see said he a fine bow like this when not in use should always be in a perfectly dry place  and when in use too said miss martha for i am sure that you oughtnt to be standing and shooting in any damp spot  theres no surer way of gettin chilled  to which sentiment miss maria agreed and suggested wearing rubber shoes or having a board to stand on when the club met after a rain  pepton first hung his bow in the hall but after he had arranged it symmetrically upon two long nails bound with green worsted lest they should scratch the bow through its woollen cover he reflected that the front door would frequently be open and that damp drafts must often go through the hall  he was sorry to give up this place for his bow for it was convenient and appropriate and for an instant he thought that it might remain if the front door could be kept shut and visitors admitted through a little side door which the family generally used and which was almost as convenient as the otherexcept indeed on washdays when a wet sheet or some article of wearing apparel was apt to be hung in front of it  but although washday occurred but once a week and although it was comparatively easy after a little practice to bob under a highpropped sheet peptons heart was too kind to allow his mind to dwell upon this plan  so he drew the nails from the wall of the hall and put them up in various places about the house  his own room had to be aired a great deal in all weathers and so that would not do at all  the wall above the kitchen fireplace would be a good location for the chimney was nearly always warm  but pepton could not bring himself to keep his bow in the kitchen  there would be nothing esthetic about such a disposition of it and besides the girl might be tempted to string and bend it  the old ladies really did not want it in the parlor for its length and its green baize cover would make it an encroaching and unbecoming neighbor to the little engravings and the big samplers the pictureframes of acorns and pinecones the fancifully patterned ornaments of clean wheat straw and all the quaint adornments which had hung upon those walls for so many years  but they did not say so  if it had been necessary to make room for the bow they would have taken down the pencilled profiles of their grandfather their grandmother and their father when a little boy which hung in a row over the mantelpiece  however pepton did not ask this sacrifice  in the summer evenings the parlor windows must be open  the diningroom was really very little used in the evening except when miss maria had stockings to darn and then she always sat in that apartment and of course she had the windows open  but miss maria was very willing to bring her work into the parlorit was foolish anyway to have a feeling about darning stockings before chance companyand then the diningroom could be kept shut up after tea  so into the wall of that neat little room pepton drove his worstedcovered nails and on them carefully laid his bow  all the next day miss martha and miss maria went about the house covering the nailholes he had made with bits of wallpaper carefully snipped out to fit the patterns and pasted on so neatly that no one would have suspected they were there  one afternoon as i was passing the old ladies house saw or thought i saw two men carrying in a coffin  i was struck with alarm  what i thought  can either of those good women  or can pepton  without a moments hesitation i rushed in behind the men  there at the foot of the stairs directing them stood pepton  then it was not he  i seized him sympathetically by the hand  which i faltered  which  who is that coffin for  coffin cried pepton  why my dear fellow that is not a coffin that is my ascham  ascham i exclaimed  what is that  come and look at it he said when the men had set it on end against the wall  it is an upright closet or receptacle for an archers armament  here is a place to stand the bow here are supports for the arrows and quivers here are shelves and hooks on which to lay or hang everything the merry man can need  you see moreover that it is lined with green plush that the door fits tightly so that it can stand anywhere and there need be no fear of drafts or dampness affecting my bow  isnt it a perfect thing  you ought to get one  i admitted the perfection but agreed no further  i had not the income of my good pepton  pepton was indeed most wonderfully well equipped and yet little did those dear old ladies think when they carefully dusted and reverentially gazed at the bunches of arrows the armbracers the gloves the greasepots and all the rest of the paraphernalia of archery as it hung around peptons room or when they afterwards allowed a particular friend to peep at it all arranged so orderly within the ascham or when they looked with sympathetic loving admiration on the beautiful polished bow when it was taken out of its baglittle did they think i say that pepton was the very poorest shot in the club  in all the surface of the muchperforated targets of the club there was scarcely a hole that he could put his hand upon his heart and say he made  indeed i think it was the truth that pepton was born not to be an archer  there were young fellows in the club who shot with bows that cost no more than peptons tassels but who could stand up and whang arrows into the targets all the afternoon if they could get a chance and there were ladies who made hits five times out of six and there were also all the grades of archers common to any club  but there was no one but himself in peptons grade  he stood alone and it was never any trouble to add up his score  yet he was not discouraged  he practised every day except sundays and indeed he was the only person in the club who practised at night  when he told me about this i was a little surprised  why its easy enough said he  you see i hung a lantern with a reflector before the target just a little to one side  it lighted up the target beautifully and i believe there was a better chance of hitting it than by daylight for the only thing you could see was the target and so your attention was not distracted  to be sure he said in answer to a question it was a good deal of trouble to find the arrows but that i always have  when i get so expert that i can put all the arrows into the target there will be no trouble of the kind night or day  however he continued i dont practise any more by night  the other evening i sent an arrow slambang into the lantern and broke it all to flinders  borrowed lantern too besides i found it made miss martha very nervous to have me shooting about the house after dark  she had a friend who had a little boy who was hit in the leg by an arrow from a bow which she says accidentally went off in the night of its own accord  she is certainly a little mixed in her mind in regard to this matter but i wish to respect her feelings and so shall not use another lantern  as i have said there were many good archers among the ladies of our club  some of them after we had been organized for a month or two made scores that few of the gentlemen could excel  but the lady who attracted the greatest attention when she shot was miss rosa  when this very pretty young lady stood up before the ladies targether left side well advanced her bow firmly held out in her strong left arm which never quivered her head a little bent to the right her arrow drawn back by three wellgloved fingers to the tip of her little ear her dark eyes steadily fixed upon the gold and her dress well fitted over her fine and vigorous figure falling in graceful folds about her feet we all stopped shooting to look at her  there is something statuesque about her said pepton who ardently admired her and yet there isnt  a statue could never equal her unless we knew there was a probability of movement in it  and the only statues which have that are the jarley waxworks which she does not resemble in the least  there is only one thing that that girl needs to make her a perfect archer and that is to be able to aim better  this was true  miss rosa did need to aim better  her arrows had a curious habit of going on all sides of the target and it was very seldom that one chanced to stick into it  for if she did make a hit we all knew it was chance and that there was no probability of her doing it again  once she put an arrow right into the centre of the goldone of the finest shots ever made on the groundbut she didnt hit the target again for two weeks  she was almost as bad a shot as pepton and that is saying a good deal  one evening i was sitting with pepton on the little front porch of the old ladies house where we were taking our afterdinner smoke while miss martha and miss maria were washing with their own white hands the china and glass in which they took so much pride  i often used to go over and spend an hour with pepton  he liked to have some one to whom he could talk on the subjects which filled his soul and i liked to hear him talk  i tell you said he as he leaned back in his chair with his feet carefully disposed on the railing so that they would not injure miss marias madeiravine i tell you sir that there are two things i crave with all my power of cravingtwo goals i fain would reach two diadems i would wear upon my brow  one of these is to kill an eagleor some large birdwith a shaft from my good bow  i would then have it stuffed and mounted with the very arrow that killed it still sticking in its breast  this trophy of my skill i would have fastened against the wall of my room or my hall and i would feel proud to think that my grandchildren could point to that birdwhich i would carefully bequeath to my descendantsand say my grandther shot that bird and with that very arrow  would it not stir your pulses if you could do a thing like that  i should have to stir them up a good deal before i could do it i replied  it would be a hard thing to shoot an eagle with an arrow if you want a stuffed bird to bequeath youd better use a rifle  a rifle exclaimed pepton  there would be no glory in that  there are lots of birds shot with rifleseagles hawks wild geese tomtits  oh no i interrupted not tomtits  well perhaps they are too little for a rifle said he but what i mean to say is that i wouldnt care at all for an eagle i had shot with a rifle  you couldnt show the ball that killed him  if it were put in properly it would be inside where it couldnt be seen  no sir it is ever so much more honorable and far more difficult too to hit an eagle than to hit a target  that is very true i answered especially in these days when there are so few eagles and so many targets  but what is your other diadem  that said pepton is to see miss rosa wear the badge  indeed said i  and from that moment i began to understand peptons hopes in regard to the grandmother of those children who should point to the eagle  yes sir he continued i should be truly happy to see her win the badge  and she ought to win it  no one shoots more correctly and with a better understanding of all the rules than she does  there must truly be something the matter with her aiming  ive half a mind to coach her a little  i turned aside to see who was coming down the road  i would not have had him know i smiled  the most objectionable person in our club was o j  hollingsworth  he was a good enough fellow in himself but it was as an archer that we objected to him  there was so far as i know scarcely a rule of archery that he did not habitually violate  our president and nearly all of us remonstrated with him and pepton even went to see him on the subject but it was all to no purpose  with a quiet disregard of other peoples ideas about bowshooting and other peoples opinions about himself he persevered in a style of shooting which appeared absolutely absurd to any one who knew anything of the rules and methods of archery  i used to like to look at him when his turn came around to shoot  he was not such a pleasing object of vision as miss rosa but his style was so entirely novel to me that it was interesting  he held the bow horizontally instead of perpendicularly like other archers and he held it well downabout opposite his waistband  he did not draw his arrow back to his ear but he drew it back to the lower button of his vest  instead of standing upright with his left side to the target he faced it full and leaned forward over his arrow in an attitude which reminded me of a roman soldier about to fall upon his sword when he had seized the nock of his arrow between his finger and thumb he languidly glanced at the target raised his bow a little and let fly  the provoking thing about it was that he nearly always hit  if he had only known how to stand and hold his bow and draw back his arrow he would have been a very good archer  but as it was we could not help laughing at him although our president always discountenanced anything of the kind  our champion was a tall man very cool and steady who went to work at archery exactly as if he were paid a salary and intended to earn his money honestly  he did the best he could in every way  he generally shot with one of the bows owned by the club but if any one on the ground had a better one he would borrow it  he used to shoot sometimes with peptons bow which he declared to be a most capital one  but as pepton was always very nervous when he saw his bow in the hands of another than himself the champion soon ceased to borrow it  there were two badges one of green silk and gold for the ladies and one of green and red for the gentlemen and these were shot for at each weekly meeting  with the exception of a few times when the club was first formed the champion had always worn the gentlemens badge  many of us tried hard to win it from him but we never could succeed he shot too well  on the morning of one of our meeting days the champion told me as i was going to the city with him that he would not be able to return at his usual hour that afternoon  he would be very busy and would have to wait for the sixfifteen train which would bring him home too late for the archery meeting  so he gave me the badge asking me to hand it to the president that he might bestow it on the successful competitor that afternoon  we were all rather glad that the champion was obliged to be absent here was a chance for some one of us to win the badge  it was not indeed an opportunity for us to win a great deal of honor for if the champion were to be there we should have no chance at all  but we were satisfied with this much having no reasonin the present at leastto expect anything more  so we went to the targets with a new zeal and most of us shot better than we had ever shot before  in this number was o j hollingsworth he excelled himself and what was worse he excelled all the rest of us  he actually made a score of eightyfive in twentyfour shots which at that time was remarkably good shooting for our club  this was dreadful  to have a fellow who didnt know how to shoot beat us all was too bad  if any visitor who knew anything at all of archery should see that the member who wore the champions badge was a man who held his bow as if he had the stomachache it would ruin our character as a club  it was not to be borne  pepton in particular felt greatly outraged  we had met very promptly that afternoon and had finished our regular shooting much earlier than usual and now a knot of us were gathered together talking over this unfortunate occurrence  i dont intend to stand it pepton suddenly exclaimed  i feel it as a personal disgrace  im going to have the champion here before dark by the rules he has a right to shoot until the president declares it is too late  some of you fellows stay here and ill bring him  and away he ran first giving me charge of his precious bow  there was no need of his asking us to stay  we were bound to see the fun out and to fill up the time our president offered a special prize of a handsome bouquet from his gardens to be shot for by the ladies  pepton ran to the railroad station and telegraphed to the champion this was his message   you are absolutely needed here  if possible take the fivethirty train for ackford  i will drive over for you  answer   there was no train before the sixfifteen by which the champion could come directly to our village but ackford a small town about three miles distant was on another railroad on which there were frequent afternoon trains  the champion answered   all right  meet me   then pepton rushed to our livery stable hired a horse and buggy and drove to ackford  a little after halfpast six when several of us were beginning to think that pepton had failed in his plans he drove rapidly into the grounds making a very short turn at the gate and pulled up his panting horse just in time to avoid running over three ladies who were seated on the grass  the champion was by his side  the latter lost no time in talking or salutations  he knew what he had been brought there to do and he immediately set about trying to do it he took peptons bow which the latter urged upon him  he stood up straight and firm on the line at thirtyfive yards from the gentlemens target he carefully selected his arrows examining the feathers and wiping away any bit of soil that might be adhering to the points after some one had shot them into the turf with vigorous arm he drew each arrow to its head he fixed his eyes and his whole mind on the centre of the target he shot his twentyfour arrows handed to him one by one by pepton and he made a score of ninetyone  the whole club had been scoring the shots as they were made and when the last arrow plumped into the red ring a cheer arose from every member excepting three the champion the president and o j hollingsworth  but pepton cheered loudly enough to make up these deficiencies  what in the mischief did they cheer him for asked hollingsworth of me  they didnt cheer me when i beat everybody on the grounds an hour ago  and its no new thing for him to win the badge he does it every time  well said i frankly i think the club as a club objects to your wearing the badge because you dont know how to shoot  dont know how to shoot he cried  why i can hit the target better than any of you  isnt that what you try to do when you shoot  yes said i of course that is what we try to do  but we try to do it in the proper way  proper grandmother he exclaimed  it doesnt seem to help you much the best thing you fellows can do is to learn to shoot my way and then perhaps you may be able to hit oftener  when the champion had finished shooting he went home to his dinner but many of us stood about talking over our great escape  i feel as if i had done that myself said pepton  i am almost as proud as if i had shotwell not an eagle but a soaring lark  why that ought to make you prouder than the other said i for a lark especially when its soaring must be a good deal harder to hit than an eagle  thats so said pepton reflectively  but ill stick to the lark im proud  during the next month our style of archery improved very much so much indeed that we increased our distance for gentlemen to forty yards and that for ladies to thirty and also had serious thoughts of challenging the ackford club to a match  but as this was generally understood to be a crack club we finally determined to defer our challenge until the next season  when i say we improved i do not mean all of us  i do not mean miss rosa  although her attitudes were as fine as ever and every motion as true to rule as ever she seldom made a hit  pepton actually did try to teach her how to aim but the various methods of pointing the arrow which he suggested resulted in such wild shooting that the boys who picked up the arrows never dared to stick the points of their noses beyond their boarded barricade during miss rosas turns at the target but she was not discouraged and pepton often assured her that if she would keep up a good heart and practise regularly she would get the badge yet  as a rule pepton was so honest and truthful that a little statement of this kind especially under the circumstances might be forgiven him  one day pepton came to me and announced that he had made a discovery  its about archery he said and i dont mind telling you because i know you will not go about telling everybody else and also because i want to see you succeed as an archer   i am very much obliged i said and what is the discovery  its this he answered  when you draw your bow bring the nock of your arrowhe was always very particular about technical termswell up to your ear  having done that dont bother any more about your right hand  it has nothing to do with the correct pointing of your arrow for it must be kept close to your right ear just as if it were screwed there  then with your left hand bring around the bow so that your fistwith the arrowhead which is resting on top of itshall point as nearly as you can make it directly at the centre of the target  then let fly and ten to one youll make a hit  now what do you think of that for a discovery  ive thoroughly tested the plan and it works splendidly  i think said i that you have discovered the way in which good archers shoot  you have stated the correct method of managing a bow and arrow  then you dont think its an original method with me  certainly not i answered  but its the correct way  theres no doubt of that said i  well said pepton then i shall make it my way  he did so and the consequence was that one day when the champion happened to be away pepton won the badge  when the result was announced we were all surprised but none so much so as pepton himself  he had been steadily improving since he had adopted a good style of shooting but he had had no idea that he would that day be able to win the badge  when our president pinned the emblem of success upon the lapel of his coat pepton turned pale and then he flushed  he thanked the president and was about to thank the ladies and gentlemen but probably recollecting that we had had nothing to do with itunless indeed we had shot badly on his behalfhe refrained  he said little but i could see that he was very proud and very happy  there was but one drawback to his triumph  miss rosa was not there  she was a very regular attendant but for some reason she was absent on this momentous afternoon  i did not say anything to him on the subject but i knew he felt this absence deeply  but this cloud could not wholly overshadow his happiness  he walked home alone his face beaming his eyes sparkling and his good bow under his arm  that evening i called on him for i thought that when he had cooled down a little he would like to talk over the affair  but he was not in  miss maria said that he had gone out as soon as he had finished his dinner which he had hurried through in a way which would certainly injure his digestion if he kept up the practice and dinner was late too for they waited for him and the archery meeting lasted a long time today and it really was not right for him to stay out after the dew began to fall with only ordinary shoes on for whats the good of knowing how to shoot a bow and arrow if youre laid up in your bed with rheumatism or disease of the lungs  good old lady  she would have kept pepton in a green baize bag had such a thing been possible  the next morning full two hours before churchtime pepton called on me  his face was still beaming  i could not help smiling  your happiness lasts well i said  lasts he exclaimed  why shouldnt it last  theres no reason why it should notat least for a week i said and even longer if you repeat your success  i did not feel so much like congratulating pepton as i had on the previous evening  i thought he was making too much of his badgewinning  look here said pepton seating himself and drawing his chair close to me you are shooting wildvery wild indeed  you dont even see the target  let me tell you something  last evening i went to see miss rosa  she was delighted at my success  i had not expected this i thought she would be pleased but not to such a degree  her congratulations were so warm that they set me on fire  they must have been very warm indeed i remarked  miss rosa said i continued pepton without regarding my interruption it has been my fondest hope to see you wear the badge but i never could get it you know she said  you have got it i exclaimed  take this  i won it for you  make me happy by wearing it  i cant do that she said  that is a gentlemans badge take it i cried gentleman and all   i cant tell you all that happened after that continued pepton  you know it wouldnt do  it is enough to say that she wears the badge  and we are both her ownthe badge and i  now i congratulated him in good earnest  there was a reason for it  i dont owe a snap now for shooting an eagle said pepton springing to his feet and striding up and down the floor  let em all fly free for me  i have made the most glorious shot that man could make  i have hit the goldhit it fair in the very centre  and whats more ive knocked it clean out of the target  nobody else can ever make such a shot  the rest of you fellows will have to be content to hit the red the blue the black or the white  the gold is mine  i called on the old ladies some time after this and found them alone they were generally alone in the evenings now  we talked about peptons engagement and i found them resigned  they were sorry to lose him but they wanted him to be happy  we have always known said miss martha with a little sigh that we must die and that he must get married  but we dont intend to repine these things will come to people  and her little sigh was followed by a smile still smaller
